At time my possible was 13 m/s2 while the current was going up and down on its own to as 9 m/s2 (a huge power loss for something trying to hit mach 3!). The vessel\u0027s throttle was going up and down in mach 0.8 - 1.5 range at 5,000 to 15,000 m. The altitude was changing so the air pressure would to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is it making the throttle go down and cut power like that? Is that normal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
