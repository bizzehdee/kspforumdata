The only things that happen are the game slows down or crashes completely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, after a bit of messing about (installing MJ, adding launch clamps because it collapses on the pad under its own weight, reorganising the staging etc.) I\u0027ve managed to run a few tests on your craft and it certainly behaves a bit strangely though not in the way you describe the docked together version behaving. The small docking ports that attach the bottom tug to the bottom side fuel tanks aren\u0027t docked to the side tanks though this shouldn\u0027t be affecting anything. All of the puller engines seem to be correctly drawing fuel from their respective side tank stacks but only so far as the middle Jumbo-64. These drain first, followed by the top Jumbo-64s, then the FT-T100s and then the X200-8s. From looking at the vessel\u0027s tree structure dumped by KER it appears that the docking ports at the top of the bottom fuel tanks aren\u0027t connected properly to the fuel tanks (the fuel tanks are children of the docking ports but the attach nodes aren\u0027t set up correctly). Detaching and reattaching these fixes that issue, KER shows increased deltaV due to more fuel being available and the fuel is drawn from the bottom tanks on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the above doesn\u0027t do anything to explain your issue as all of the engines are burning correctly. Do you have a save game with the vessel in orbit with the engines misbehaving as you describe? I suspect the problem has been caused by the vessel tree rearrangement that happens when you dock vessels together but I would need to look at the in-flight save to see what the vessel tree looks like. If this is the case then it may be possible to work around it by setting the type of the top part of the vessel (with the cupola) to a station when it has nothing else docked to it (preferably at launch time) and make sure that none of the other vessels docked to it are set to station. This should ensure that the cupola remains as the root part of the overall ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-20T22:19:53Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2014 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T22:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also could not reproduce the described behavior and observed the same drain behavior as Padishar.
