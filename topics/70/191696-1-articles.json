While it doesn\u0027t happen in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, it does happen in flight, in the main menu and I get something that looks like burn-in in the loading screens. And the thing is, it just happened and I don\u0027t know why. I have a list of my mods right\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/W0HgkNR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, I\u0027m playing on v1.8.1.

If there are any further questions, just ask me because I don\u0027t really know what\u0027s needed other than the .log file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
