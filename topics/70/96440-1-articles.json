In my case, the bug triggered while using AGX, but many users report the same bug without mods. It has something to do with doing lots of reverting and saving, or possibly saving a craft in the VAB after using the widgets to place parts in a buggy position. In any case, the VAB craft file is corrupted. Delete the VAB craft file and everything returns to normal. In my case I opened windows explorer and went to the following file:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP\\saves\\SavedDameName\\Ships\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI then deleted the last 3 craft I had worked on when the bug occurred. I restarted KSP, and could then load craft into the VAB as normal. This means you lose any progress you made on a few craft, but at least means you don\u0027t have to delete the entire save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-25T01:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RedPine\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RedPine\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI then deleted the last 3 craft I had worked on when the bug occurred.

Simply alt-tab out of the game, add your craft file, go back and open load menu - your craft will be there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
