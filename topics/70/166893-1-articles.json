I have went through trying to install it and started a new sandbox to play and experement with it, more or less to see what I can do with it and it didn\u0027t show up in the new game. Did I mess up or is it somethign silly like I need to unlock these parts. If it is the first thing I am not that surprised, if it is the other, not only would I feel silly, but kind of stupid as well for not trying that... but then again in a sandbox game all parts should be auto unlocked corect?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, that is my problem, if anyone can help it would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-26T21:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck out these instructions to see what kind of information is needed to help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed6713663772\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:211px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
