Good examples are the runways that have bumps between sections (I use Kourou and that one has one huge bump between 3rd and 4th sections.) This problem exasperates by 3 factors:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Time since the vessel(s) have been loaded.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Size of the vessel. Specifically it seems the farther the part is from either root part or center of mass will have their bounding boxes dislocate faster as time passes. I am not sure about this one, but docking ports closer to center of the vessel did not give me any problems but ports at far points did.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Also not sure about this one, but it seems that the bigger the port the more likely the issue will occur, so Docking Port Sr. is more likely to glitch than regular port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-09T23:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m unclear on exactly what you\u0027re saying happens.
