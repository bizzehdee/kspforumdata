Instead of just letting me load in, There was red text, it said \u0022argument cannot be null\u0022 Online it seemed like others have had this problem, the solution apparently was to delete my \u0022perisistent.sfs\u0022 and \u0022persistent.loadmeta\u0022 files, and rename my most recent quicksave files, quicksave#7\u0027s files, A .sfs file and a .loadmeta file to the names of the two files i had deleted. When I finished my prayers and the game finally loaded, A new green text appeared under my save. \u0022save incompatible\u0022. When I try to load the save I\u0027m informed that the save is incompatible with this version of KSP. It asks if i want to continue, I\u0027m itching for a mun flyby, so i click yes and in the top right \u0022Unable to load the save\u0022 appears in orange.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few notes: I have only ever installed or played 1.12.5.3190 of the game on this computer. While it is downloaded from steam, I have no internet connection and haven\u0027t had once since before i even made the save. So it is certainly not a version issue. I have no idea what to do, and just want to spend more time in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomeone please!
