Matter of fact I\u0027m just about ready to throw in the towel myself, performance in general is appalling and this stutter makes the game almost too annoying to play.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...and possibly the devs.\n\nSo why then have we heard zero news on this from said devs? Not even an acknowledgement that there is a problem.\n\nNot impressed, not at all. Cantfix/Wontfix is not an appropriate response to such a serious performance issue.\n\nAnd if you think it\u0027s bad now, I\u0027m seeing a strong correlation with the number of active flights / debris... Which is why I can\u0027t ever seem to play right through a game - by the time I have the mods to patch the \u0022missing\u0022 features in and a few craft or offworld bases in play the stutter drives me away for a couple of months. I start playing again (hoping the latest patch improves it), stutter returns, cycle repeats.\n\nConclusion: Unity is garbage, KSP is crippled because of it, none of the devs appear to care. I\u0027d love for someone to prove me wrong.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T12:07:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 12:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"}]}
