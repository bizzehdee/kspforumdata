I focus on a celestial body. But then I can\u0027t move the focus back to my ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried backspace, tilde, double clicking, square brackets. The only two ways I have found to do are by using TAB, but that seems to cycle through all the celestial bodies first leaving the ship to last (shiftTAB cycles through all the celestial bodies in the opposite direction but still leaves the ship to last). The second way is by exiting to the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither of the two ways is exactly user friendly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know any shorter ways?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstalled mods are up to date versions of Mechjeb2 and XScience.
