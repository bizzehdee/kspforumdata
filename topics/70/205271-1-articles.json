I installed this mod way back (can\u0027t remember the version KSP was on back then) and since then it was working fine, for a couple of years. I forgot I had the game in my library and decided to repopen it a couple days ago, the mod was still working fine even with the updates (game version 3167, breaking grounds 1.12 and making history 1.7). Yesterday I decided to use a mod that was called HullCam VDS and it kinda deleted all my docking ports\u00A0 (I don\u0027t know the reason behind this issue). I deleted HullCam mod, all docking ports reappeared for some reason but I noticed, as I was making an approach on a new station I build that I do not have the Docking port aligment indicator button in the toolbar. The file for the mod was still in the GameData folder but no button in game, so I decided to download it again and reinstall it, but still the same issue, I tried Blizzy\u0027s toolbar and it was not showing up there too. The file with it\u0027s module manager are in the GameData folder. Am I missing something?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-10-16T16:21:17Z\u0022 title=\u002210/16/2021 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 16, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by tritter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
