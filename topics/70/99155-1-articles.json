Place in low Munar orbit (10km circular to 20km circular; unknown if effect extends noticeably to higher orbits.) Verify vehicle has no engines activated (i.e., \u0022Deactivate Engine\u0022 selected for all attached engines, RCS off). Focus as active vehicle, turn off warp. \u0022Phantom\u0022 acceleration will act on vehicle. Record Ap/Pe once every couple minutes. Note how Ap/Pe changes. Sometimes accel, sometimes decel; similar to the tiny phantom acceleration in low Munar orbit in stock, but effect is greatly magnified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen 12km circular (Ap - Pe = 100 meters or less) orbit degrade to Pe \u0026lt; 0 and subsequent lithobraking in less than one orbital period. Likewise, I have seen 18km circular orbit raise Ap to \u0026gt; 30 km in a fraction of an orbit (I shut down at that point; Ap was still increasing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl case: same vehicle, same Munar orbit, but with KJR removed. Note minor \u0022drift\u0022 of Ap/Pe, which \u0027jitters\u0027 within a few meters around a more-or-less stable median, but the \u0027jitter\u0027 is more or less random and the momentary effects cancel over the longer term such that orbit stays \u0027essentially\u0027 unchanged over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput log and quicksave of example (smaller vehicle docking with larger station, which drives the point home as the smaller vehicle has to thrust along a single vector repeatedly in order to \u0022chase\u0022 the larger station just for stationkeeping) follow in next post.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-10T04:22:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2015 04:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Srpadget\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERetitle to reflect actual issue after troubleshooting\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T06:27:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExample of issue: Rendezvous/dock of smaller Mun lander with larger orbital station. Forced the rendezvous/dock with a combination of staying in warp to a couple hundred meters followed by excessive RCS usage/constant corrections during proximity operations.
