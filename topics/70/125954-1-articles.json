I found some mods that add sounds to various things, rover wheels, ion engines, rcs thrusters, and non of them seem to be working. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI looked into the ion engine one as that was my main goal and I checked the versions to see that it didn\u0026#39;t quite support 1.05, but with the sound files and a little cfg editing it shouldn\u0026#39;t be that big of a deal. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI looked at the old ion code with the sounds and grabbed these lines:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nsound_loop = running\u003Cbr\u003E\nsound_stop = disengage\u003Cbr\u003E\nsound_stop = engage\u003Cbr\u003E\nsound_stop = flameout\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nand pasted them into the new 1.05 code. I also put the sound files themselves in supposedly the correct place, not sure if the folder has changed since .24.2\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan anyone help me with this? I desperately want to get these sounds working and I would update the mods if I could, or at least release an updated package or something. I do have tons of mod experience, but it\u0026#39;s the specifics that maybe some of you veterans can help me with. Thanks.\n"}]}
