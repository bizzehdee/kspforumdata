I tried to fix it in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E to no avail, instead, it wouldn\u0027t even let me re-place the parts. I\u0027ve tried re-installing the game and I\u0027m having the same issues. This didn\u0027t happen with the H.U.L.K.K. I, only the H.U.L.K.K. II\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
