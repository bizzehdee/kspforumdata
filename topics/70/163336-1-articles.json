Looks like an issue of bays added in mods (as far as drag actually being applied to stowed parts).\u00A0 I don\u0027t know how to delete a post, but someone who can may want to knock this one out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve searched and cannot find why my cargo bays won\u0027t shield anything from drag.\u00A0 I\u0027ve knocked out all the usual suspects I can find, and here\u0027s what I\u0027ve done:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0 I\u0027ve used different types of cargo bays, both stock and OPT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. NO clipping anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Internal parts attached to nodes inside cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Tried different parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. No external parts attached to cargo bays except inline by external nodes. For testing used fuel tanks of same type as cargo bay attached to either end with one random tester part inside bay attached to internal node, nothing else but landing legs attached to fuel tanks and maybe a drone core attached to a fuel tank to allow actuation of bay doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI load it up on the runway, look inside bay and parts (using debug menu) are showing NO for \u0022shielded.\u0022 Open and close bay doors, no difference.\u00A0 Used several types of different sized bays, mk3, mk2, OPT J, no difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*(edit) I finally removed all mods and made a simple tester as described above and had the same results, but I will list my mods here anyways, since I put it in the modded category.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nxScience (doubtful)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCommunityResourcePack (didn\u0027t install this? came with another mod?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirespitter (didn\u0027t really want this one either...came with Infernal Robotics I think)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterstellarFuelSwitch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInfernal Robotics\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb2 Embedded by Dennis6492\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOPT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanetshine (doubtful)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTextureReplacerReplaced\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTweakScale\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModule Manager 2.8.0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running 1.3 with all mods updated and (I thought) working.
