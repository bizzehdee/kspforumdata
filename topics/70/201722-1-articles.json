Basically after undocking the camera remains at the spot both ships were, not following either. I have control over one, and the other I no\u00A0longer have control over OR can see on the map view. Ships are weirdly accelerating, and I cannot exit to Tracking Station. One is manned, other has probe core. I have tried restarting and the issue persists.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVideo -\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://filebin.net/ixizcrprnljm71oz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://filebin.net/ixizcrprnljm71oz\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore info - One ship is a Duna lander,\u00A0 other is a orbital refueling station. Refueled multiple times with other ships with no issues. Docking ports are both shielded. I have electric charge, fuel, and a probe core on the docking station. Duna Lander has both probe and manned capsules (for skycrane on landing).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is appreciated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I did not notice before but I also lose all staging, but can still fire my boosters as seen in the video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-04-15T02:05:21Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2021 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by jonahk3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMore Info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Max von Kerman","CreatedById":211147,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-15T04:11:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYea for me it\u0027s my minmus base and lab just kept tipping and exploding ON IT\u0027S OWN i think having the physics engine clogged could lead to this sort of problems.
