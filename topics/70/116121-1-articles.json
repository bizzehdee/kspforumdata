I just now updated to 1.0.4 will all up-to date mods but I\u0027m suffering a CTD during loading when MM is installed, I tested it without MM and it loads fine though.\n\nI\u0027m running 64-bit on linux with 8gb of ram and KSP stays well below the limit so it\u0027s not a memory-related crash.\n\nI thought at first that it was a ModualManager related problem because the game loads when MM is not installed but someone on that thead said that\u0027s not the case.\n\n[Log provided.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0BZCbirvqyweGFRcmFTUUZjYm8/view?usp=sharing)"},{"CreatedByName":"TranceaddicT","CreatedById":73653,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T16:54:16Z","Content":"Does this happen with every launch? Or, just occasionally? Personally speaking, it looks like a random CTD; these happen.\n\nIf it is MM related, make sure you are running v2.6.6. I\u0027m running Linux x64, 32GB; run a heavily modded install and it loads fine. I approach the KSP hard 16GB upper limit.\n\nAlso, check ~/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/Player.log to see what that tells you.\n\nNext, try unzipping and overwrite all the original KSP except the GameData folder. I\u0027ve had installs that ended-up borked and that helped.\n\nI\u0027ve 87 add-ons and it takes about 4m to load. Get yourself a SSD. 25m load time is horrendous.

I don\u0027t see an immediate answer in that log, so your best bet might be to remove mods one or two at a time until it loads. Tiresome I know, but that\u0027s just what we have to do sometimes with heavily modded installs.\n\nBetter yet, if this is a fresh install: Always add mods a couple at a time, that way you can spot issues before they get buried."}]}
