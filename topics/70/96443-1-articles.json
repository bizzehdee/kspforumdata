No amount of thrust in this direction will change it to being completed. Following it blindly for a \u0027circularisation\u0027 will instead crash you into the far side of the planet as you chase the bugged node until your PE is below zero.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the node is for a rendezvous, it behaves very oddly. This kind of marker will also try to run away at the end, but if you bail out when you have an intercept of, say, 2km separation, then timewarp forward; you won\u0027t have an intercept by the time the ships get there. Putting the navball in target mode when \u0027anywhere close\u0027 can sometimes show a relative velocity towards the target, or of zero, even while the distance shown is rapidly increasing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis most commonly happens to me during Kerbal Construction Time simulations, but I have had it in a totally different playthrough, using totally different ships that I\u0027d HyperEdited out to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can guarantee that the problem is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Asymmetrical or clipped ships causing phantom forces. I have tried multiple ships, some of them super-simple and HyperEdited out to Duna orbit, all of them have the problem. Sometimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rookie stupidity. Honestly, I can manoeuvre and rendezvous just fine around Kerbin/Mun/Minmus. Duna on the other hand is in some kind of time-distortion and things aren\u0027t where they should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m completely at a loss as to how to solve this one.
