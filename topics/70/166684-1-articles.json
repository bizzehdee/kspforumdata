I\u0027ve been enjoying myself a lot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProblem is, I have a couple of peeves with it. First, things are too hazy. I understand this is what Scatterer does, but to my taste they\u0027ve overdone it. Second, the sun looks weird, like a\u00A0 fried egg. Too jagged on the edges. I don\u0027t like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure both these problems can be easily solved with some config wizardry, but alas I am not tech savvy. I have no idea what any of the things do in the in-game GUI of Scatterer.\u00A0Thus I turn to you for help.
