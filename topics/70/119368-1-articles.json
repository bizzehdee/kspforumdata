Right now, we have a lot of speculation about how stable KSP will be under Unity 5, but as it is there isn\u0027t a separate OS X 64-bit client.

Which means a 64bit OS X unity 5 1.1 version. OS X is fine but for me has a lower memory cap with mods in the current version. I think because of its OpenGL implementation if I recall. So you will hit memory crashes earlier and with less mods installed than the current 32bit windows version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"danfarnsy","CreatedById":67183,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T06:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JPLRepo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JPLRepo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActually harvester tweeted on the unity 5 1.1 release...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch optimism!
