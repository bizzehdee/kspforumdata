These were working assemblies until today.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis seems to affect all the FISSION style reactors, Garnet, F.L.A.T., Excaliber, Prometheus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI put a molten salt reactor on it and the generator works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI noticed that there was some sort of file that Steam updated today, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E shows no mod updates.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll I can see is that Steam downloaded something for KSP, I can\u0027t tell what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid something get patched today that disabled the ability of fission reactors to generate power with the thermal generator?\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think I see the fission reactor generating electric charge, but no megajoules due to the generator disabling itself.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
