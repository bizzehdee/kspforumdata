You described it exactly. I was recording for YouTube during this issue and I\u0027ve just gotten around to editing the footage and can now confirm. My scenario is exactly the same. Exiting on-rails warp as I approached my Munar periapsis, after orbit, caused the decoupler to overheat and explode without cause. I reverted and carried on without issue until I tried to return to Kerbin which, due to fuel shortage, I was doing with some trepidatious aero-braking, starting at 52km or so. When I tried to physics warp through atmo, 1 in 5 times the decoupler would overheat and blow again, meaning I had to sit there in real time and wait for the ship to exit atmo before I could safe-ish-ly warp again."},{"CreatedByName":"SLinkY","CreatedById":48016,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T23:26:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Wow!

The problem isn\u0027t even exclusively caused by warping either, it manifests during staging as well, as I mentioned. I\u0027ve never had it during physics warp though, but interestingly it always originates from the same part. For you it\u0027s the stack decoupler, for me it\u0027s the cubic strut thingy.\n\nWhat I did to work around it is to ignore max temps, do your mission, what ever it is, with a ship that\u0027s infinitely hot (like in the gif above. Another thing I\u0027ve noticed is that infinitely hot solar panels don\u0027t generate any power). In my case this was a Mun base, four modules all landing separately (two of the modules are in the gif), joining together, then I went and edited the save file to bring the temps back to within a reasonable range. For me this meant changing \u0022temp\u0022 and \u0022tempExt\u0022 of the overheated parts from \u0022Infinity\u0022 to \u0022103\u0022 , which seems to be the ambient temp on the surface of the Mun. I can now warp on the surface and exit warp without any issues.\n\nUnless someone has a better way, this is what I\u0027ll be doing until it gets patched.\n\n\\*Edit: I should mention that I did a clean install and only reinstalled utility mods, i.e. Kerbal Engineer, docking port alignment, etc\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T23:54:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SLinkY**"},{"CreatedByName":"Roninpawn","CreatedById":114184,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T03:00:28Z","Content":"And if SLinkY\u0027s gif wasn\u0027t proof enough of the bug...\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/9FOcete0qBg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOrqwithVagrant","CreatedById":39208,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T19:28:20Z","Content":"I\u0027m being hit by this too and with really bad timing.

I wish I had when I last saw the issue, because once you\u0027re getting the problem at a certain point its really consistent across quickloads.
