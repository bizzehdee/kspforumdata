That being said, I cannot isolate the problem to one specific mod or even one group of mods. As far as I can tell, they all work fine with one another. When it\u0027s not crashing, everything works smoothly. Good framerate, no signs of odd effects or glitchiness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crashes only seem to occur when I\u0027m using more than 7.5-ish GB of RAM. By that, I mean that I can go into my folder and randomly prune mods until it respects that limit and then all of a sudden the crashes stop happening. I\u0027d prefer not to use this solution if possible because I enjoy having lots of mods and consider most of the ones I have necessary. I was also given to understand that KSP on Linux 64bit has no \u0022hard\u0022 RAM limit so what gives? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the things I\u0027ve tried:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEnsured all mods are up-to-date\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEnsured all mods are correctly installed\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EVerified integrity of game cache on Steam\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDeleted everything, reinstalled KSP, and reinstalled all my mods (this was a few weeks ago and I\u0027d hate to try it again since it didn\u0027t work the first time)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETried with and without the segfault fix by Addle over in The Linux Thread\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003Etried with and without the quad-core startup script provided in The Other Linux Thread\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReduced swappiness\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDisabled swappiness\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would appreciate any insight.

Ubuntu, with 16 Gb Ram, and my current install uses about 7.1 Gb of RAM sitting at the main menu.

Not always, though, and it may be coincidental. There\u0027s also sometimes (but not always) error messages after it crashes at the start of the log related to the LD_PRELOAD part of my launch script.
