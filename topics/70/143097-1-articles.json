Especially the latter. Whenever I try to encounter anything lately, the purple and orange encounter markers flash around and disappear when I need them most, giving me a real hard time to encounter just about anything. Is it broken for anyone else too?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bomoo","CreatedById":78616,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-05T12:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"s4stamler","CreatedById":166325,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T03:17:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyup, same here. Right now I\u0027m also having a charming little issue where markers will be lined up but read some distance like 173km apart. Then the game auto-warped me right past a maneuver node. Not sure if this is a MechJeb problem (I just installed it) or an issue with the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Screen_Shot_2016_07_06_at_7_55_01_PM.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022https://s32.postimg.org/lznba5mlh/Screen_Shot_2016_07_06_at_7_55_01_PM.png\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCute, huh?

The encounter just flashes between a non-encountering trajectory and the proper encounter. Tip: Ignore the non-encounter trajectory, the one with the encounter is always the true one.
