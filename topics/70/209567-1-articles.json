Open the save in a text editor (notepad will do, but something like VSCode or Notepad\u002B\u002B will make it a bit easier) and search for runway, you should centrally find a list of facilities and their upgrade levels; reduce the number for their level by one and load the save to see if that\u2019s downgraded them. Alternatively, try KML - an editor program that\u2019s made specifically to edit KSP save files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
