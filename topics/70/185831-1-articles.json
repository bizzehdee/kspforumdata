I don\u0027t have any extra controllers attached that would send inputs into the game, and I have tried the old trix of Alt\u002BX to correct any trimming but it seems to be fighting me. When I rotate into certain positions as well, it will always want to be on a slight angle. I recorded this wild situation. Any help would be lovely!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you notice in the bottom left where Pitch, Roll, and Yaw are, they are not on their zeroed position, they are slightly off while \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E on like they are being forced.
