When I reached the Mun, transferred my 2nd pilot to the lander, and undocked it from my main ship, I found I could not switch to the ship from orbital view, when I went back to the tracking station, the lander did not appear. Tried re-docking, and undocking again, still nothing. Of course, now the lander is spinning, and I can\u0027t stop it. \n\nWorked perfectly fine yesterday. Anyone else run into this problem.\n\nMods I\u0027m running: \n\nKerbal Engineering Redux. (Up to date)\n\nWindows 7, 64bit\n\nKerbal Version 1.0.3"}]}
