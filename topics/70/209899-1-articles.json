There\u2019s a button beside the signal indicators that can toggle what lines are displayed- off, first hop (the thing you\u2019re directly connected to), path (all connections back to a ground station), vessel links (everything the vessel can connect to directly) and network (everything) and the same button can also be found in the tracking station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have CommNet switched on in the difficulty settings? If it\u2019s turned off then you\u2019ll always have a connection but won\u2019t see any signal lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
