That is until I decided it was time to start launching SSTO spaceplanes. I can\u0027t even make it to orbit with one with out running out of memory. I watched it happen several times. Memory stays pretty level until I start generating lots of heat. At this point it begins to climb rapidly, causing a ctd from out of memory shortly after I ignite my LFOs. Some times I do end up making it to space, but am not there for long. Any way I can determine what mod is causing this besides elimination?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T02:23:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by icedown**"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T00:51:51Z","Content":"It\u0027s not a mod doing it -- there\u0027s a huge memory leak related to PPFX that heats up when your craft heats up.
