If there is a simple fix in a post (that I couldn\u0027t find), please do not hesitate to notify me of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built a craft with KW Rocketry and Nova Punch mods, then after a re-start, I am now getting an error loading the craft. the error says \u0022Craft Loading Error: Craft was not loaded because it is missing the following parts: 1200 fuel tank 1.25 cl.large.shortMonoTank. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem, is that I had not altered or changed any of the mods before this error. And If I am not mistaken, the 1200 fuel tank is a stock tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a wipe of KSP and resinstalled and put back in exact same mods that I had in before, newly downloaded to ensure they are the most current version, but I\u0027m still getting that error when I attempt to load that specific craft. If any crafts have that specific tank in it, then I can\u0027t load it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I correct in believing that the 1200 Fuel Tank 1.25 is a stock tank? If not, doesn\u0027t\u0027 it come in either KW Rocketry or NovaPunch? those are the only two parts mods I use. I also use Kerbal Alarm clock and the Enhanced Visual pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T15:50:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you had a monopropellant tank that was only available for a part test contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft file should be in KSP/saves/[your save name]/Ships/VAB or SPH.
