The version of FireSpitter you are using is not built for KSP 0.25 so you will need to update that. Also, Kethane has been built against the Unity version used by the Linux and Windows versions of KSP so may have issues when used on the Mac version (the Mac version of KSP 0.25 uses a slightly newer version of Unity than the others and isn\u0027t supported on Mac).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour log shows you are running out of memory, both RAM and GPU texture memory. You are using an integrated GPU that shares the main RAM. How much RAM do you have? You will either need to change the config of Active Texture Management to be more aggressive (see the ATM thread for details on what settings to change) or reduce the various graphics settings in KSP (set the texture resolution to minimum, disable SM3, use fallback shaders, minimum terrain detail etc) or quite possibly both. If it still doesn\u0027t work then you will have to live with less mods, both KSO and KWRocketry use a lot of memory because they have a lot of parts using high resolution textures and your machine simply can\u0027t cope...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: ok, ninja\u0027d twice, so it isn\u0027t the previous post anymore...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rowns","CreatedById":66524,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T08:20:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you all very much and I am sorry for bumping my thread, im not really patient \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I will try to do what I can do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
