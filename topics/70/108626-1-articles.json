But it seems I can\u0027t add custom actions with them, everytime once I saved my custom action with airbreaks, they restore to their default action of break (the one actived by B button). Is it by design? Hope you can fix it. Thanks.\n\n**Mods installed:**\n\nAlternate Resource Panel 2.7.1.0\n\nDistant Object Enhancement 1.5.5\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator 6.2\n\nEditor Extension 2.7\n\nFilter Extensions 2.1.1\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock 3.3.1.1\n\nKerbal Joint Reforcement 3.1.3\n\nKSP AVC 1.1.5.0\n\nLanding Height Display 1.4\n\nMechJeb 2.5.0\n\nModule Manager 2.6.3\n\nPlanet Shine 0.2.3.1\n\nS.A.V.E 1.0.1-672\n\nStock Bug Fix Modules 1.0.2c.2\n\nWide Contracts App 1.1.2\n\n**Reproduction Steps:** \n\n1. Build a plane in SPH.\n\n2. Attach one more mirrored A.I.R.B.R.E.A.K.E.S parts to it.\n\n3. Go action groups, and build a custom group of airbreaks.\n\n4. Save the plane design.\n\n5. Reload the design, and the custom group were gone."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T18:24:09Z","Content":"You can set the deploy and retract actions to the action groups, but not toggle, it\u0027s a bug."},{"CreatedByName":"CobyLee","CreatedById":137141,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T15:08:51Z","Content":"Thanks, I\u0027ll try it."}]}
