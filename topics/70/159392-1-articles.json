But recently I decided to play with stock solar system and go visit some easter eggs. The problem is, that deleting RevSSS broke my quicksave. Something that should probably be mentioned is, that I deleted the bodies it added to the game (currently just a few small Joolian moons). The rest of the mod is\u00A0replacing the stock\u00A0models/textures of the planets and moons. Anyways, when I try to load the latest quicksave, the clock resets and a bunch of vessels dissappear. Does anyone have the same problem/clue about what\u0027s going on?\u00A0If needed, I can provide the save (if that would help)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Tvpy0Yg.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Tvpy0Yg.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
