So i have this issue where my lights dont work correctly. They\u0027re on in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and turn on in off while in there building a craft. When i launch, they\u0027re on by default and when i turn them off, that\u0027s it. They\u0027re off for good and i can\u0027t turn them back on again. If i go on EVA and attach lights on a space station or whatever via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, i cant turn them on at all and i wasted time putting it on during the EVA. I tried installing new Module Manager directly instead of through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and nothing i\u0027ve done so far seems to do the trick and i\u0027m confused to what is causing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d really appreciate the help and thank you to anyone who takes their time to look through my issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
