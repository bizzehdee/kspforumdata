I read that this can happen due to part clipping, but to my knowledge there is no accidental clipping in my ships. Craft will spin whether I have SAS on or off, if I\u0027m trying to do a burn, I have to manually hold the ship in place with RCS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have FAR \u0026amp; RemoteTech installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone else seen this issue? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T10:18:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo idea if it applies in this case, but when I had similar issues it turned out to be due to non-zero trim settings.

This is more noticable if you are using an engine that does not have thrust vectoring like the LVT-30 or the the Aerospike, because they do not have the ability to correct. Knowing how your ship is built could help diagnose the issue, so post some screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you diagnose in the VAB with that stage only, ensure the Center of Thrust ball is directly inline with the center of Mass ball.
