But only visual mods nothing on extra parts (i dont know if maybe Restock\u002B does anything which might differ other than visual overhaul) so my question would be, if i can still copy back the save game and ships folder (i progressed further in modded than in vanilla and created some good ships) back to standard Steam route and location and vanilla will still load the ships and saves?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chubwheel","CreatedById":222483,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-25T19:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to clarify, IF there is some kind of update still for KSP 1 before KSP 2 comes out, i still would want to transfer my saves and ships from the modded version back to vanilla, and then continue, wait a little bit if the mods will be adjusted to the new patch, and then copy back the progressed vanilla saves and ships back to the modded folders (I\u0027ve copied KSP from Steam to another place, meaning i have a modded version to play, and the vanilla one which starts via steam) Hence my original question if i could copy back a purely visual modded save and ships back to vanilla which would still work with the steam version\u003Cbr\u003E\n(Edit: I\u0027ve removed Restock\u002B as it said it has extra parts, only kept regular Restock which should be only visual overhaul for parts, and no effect on gameplay)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-11-25T19:05:29Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2022 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by chubwheel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HansAcker","CreatedById":195534,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-25T19:32:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPure visual mods like Scatterer, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and a visuals pack should be safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRestock changes the dimensions of a few parts.
