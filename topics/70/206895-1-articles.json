Last night and this morning I go into my latest career (the last one went way too slowly on the timeline), and the entirety of the sky and horizon was pure white while in flight. On the main menu the atmosphere is replaced by pure white. I don\u0027t have a photo, and i run all recommended mods for the express install on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E. Is there any help anyone can think of? It kinda hurts my eyes and overall its something I would love to fix. Thanks in advance for any help! P.S. I run KSP 1.10.1 for the pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-14T17:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry reinstalling Scatterer, and if that doesn\u0027t fix it go back to the previous version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
