I\u0027m obviously doing something wrong, but all the tutorials are so out of date. What makes it even more confusing is that when I deploy the Gigantor XL Solar Panels, the engine can suddenly produce up to 0.00800 kN out of nowhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, could someone please explain to me how to set up plasma, fusion, and thermal engines in this mod? I can\u0027t get anywhere with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-06T20:31:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey guy. I am unfamiliar with that mod, so I moved your question to a sub where someone else might be able to help.
