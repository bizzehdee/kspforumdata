However, some of them (Planetary Base Systems, Karbonite, and a few others) don\u0027t work. By \u0022don\u0027t work\u0022 I mean that they don\u0027t show up in the game. I\u0027m wondering if this is because of an incorrect install. I\u0027ve just been copying the mod\u0027s \u0022GameData\u0022 folder and pasting it in KSP\u0027s \u0022GameData\u0022 folder. This works for most of my mods, but not for all. Is there something else I should be doing? PS, The mods partially work. For example, Karbonite functions, but none of the engines of parts are there, and Planetary Base Systems has a tutorial in the manual, but the parts aren\u0027t there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E,\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Jagger\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-07-29T23:17:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2017 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by SpookyShark73\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJoe","CreatedById":179018,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-26T23:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpen the mod game data file and copy the files inside to the ksp game data file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorks for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-26T23:39:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should not have any Gamedata folders inside your gamedata folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-27T01:08:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends on the mod author and how they chose to package it.\u00A0 There are really 2 possibilitys\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
