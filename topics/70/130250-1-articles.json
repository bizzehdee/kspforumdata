I\u0027m trying to design a very large SSTO using various mods, mostly the Mk4 Spaceplane and B9 P-Wings. Aside from having a devil of a time getting the damn thing into orbit with any kind of payload, it\u0027s been working fine. Just now I ran into something weird though. I attached a pair of SRBs to the side of my lower engine nacelles to give the plane a kick off the runway and now it won\u0027t burn the liquid fuel. The engines are all running just fine, but they are not consuming any fuel. When I switch them to Closed-Cycle (rocket) mode (using the hybrids included with the Mk4 pack), they start burning oxidizer fine, but the liquid fuel doesn\u0027t change still.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running 64 bit in Linux, if that matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Finally found the log...\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-yGBr_w0lX8d042TGpaaUVHNGs/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPlayer.log\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: The problem is with all air breathing engines. Regular LFO rocket engines consume LF as normal. However, all of the air breather jets and hybrids (RAPIER and it\u0027s derivatives added by mods) do not consume LF. Now testing to see if this is related to this save only or if it\u0027s global to the entire installation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Tested a new sandbox save and everything worked fine. Back in the original save, it seems that the problem is only affecting the one aircraft. Tried an earlier revision of the same SSTO and in works correctly (at least, it burns fuel - doesn\u0027t exactly \u0022work\u0022 as I had hoped...). So I guess all I\u0027ve lost is that one plane, which was my best design so far. Grr. Oh well, back to formula I guess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-19T09:35:50Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2016 09:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kananesgi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore info - isolated problem to the craft file\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
