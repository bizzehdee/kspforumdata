I saved it as subassembly and then constructed my booster with enough delta v and then attached three satellites to the interstage nodes inside the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow whenever i try to test the decoupling mechanism the following happens: satellite separates from booster, physics freak out, satellite is stuck floating mid air. At this point my controlled vessel is still the booster (root part is probe core on booster). However, if I switch to the detached satellite the game doesn\u0027t respond to my inputs anymore and it crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recreated the issue and recorded it so you guys can see what i\u0027m on about here.

Of course for attitude control you\u0027ll need one of: reaction wheels, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, gimballing engine running; and it doesn\u0027t necessarily need an engine/fuel but if it does, it can go places or change its orbit etc (its possible to launch into an orbit, or leave on the surface, an \u0027unpowered\u0027 thing if you so chose).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I normally do it is ensure each has solar panels/batteries/small engine/fuel tank/aerial, ie its a fully functioning craft, then plan quite thoroughly the order in which they will leave the main ship in space.
