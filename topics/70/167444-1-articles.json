I\u0027m familiar with your idea of troubleshooting, did it yesterday and it happened to be Texture replacer replaced, that caused the crash. Yet after installing mods back (without TRR), I got stuck with the same problem. I hoped someone skilled with logfiles could save me from\u00A0going through\u00A0mods again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-12T17:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooked at your output and it tells me that the lock up is happening while \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E is loading custom configs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry removing that and if doesn\u0027t fix your problem then O will need to see your KSP.log (found in the main KSP directory above KSP_x64.exe)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
