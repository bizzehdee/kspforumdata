If you don\u0027t get one, then go into KSP/Internal, and you should see an output_log. This is always the most recent one, so the game knows what happened the last time you played (so no progress is lost once you start the game again). Go to that log, and upload it to a file-sharing site (dropbox works the best), give us the link, and we can analyse it and try to find the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried uninstalling/re-installing the game?

Many people have had issues with the 1.3 KSP, but 1.3.1 pre-release has just been released, so you could download that one (it\u0027s a bugfix one), and see if it fixes your issues. You should uninstall all mods before updating versions, and then try out a stock playthrough (to avoid mods being outdated, causing glitches and bugs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RobFalcon","CreatedById":159685,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T03:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJas0n: Not sure why that was the thing, but that was the thing.\u00A0 I deleted Play Your Way, launched the same mission (was already on the pad, so easy), and made it through with no issues whatsoever.\u00A0 I\u0027ll make my way to its thread to see if there\u0027s a fix.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks much!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUpdate:\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, it appears to have been a known issue for which there was an update.\u00A0 And it also appears that I had seen it, as I\u0027d already downloaded the latest version.\u00A0 I simply failed to INSTALL it.\u00A0 ::Facepalm.::\u00A0 Well, problem solved!\u00A0 New version of Play Your Way is in, and the problem did not resurface.\u00A0 Thanks again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-25T04:20:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2017 04:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by RobFalcon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate based on Investigation\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
