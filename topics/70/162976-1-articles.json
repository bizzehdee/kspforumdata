I do a lot of rendezvous and docking so it helps to have the target highlighted. However I have found that sometimes \u0022Show vessel labels\u0022 in the Settings has been spontaneously turned off and deselected, meaning vessels I am docking with are no longer highlighted in yellow or show \u0027distance to\u0027. Often I have no idea this has happened until I am actually trying to dock. I played for 2 hours straight and found this setting had somehow been turned off during gameplay; I had not turned it off manually. I had to save and quit and reselect it in the Settings menu.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis has happened four times so far and it gets a bit annoying, especially if I\u0027m docking at night. It seems to happen randomly, whether I am docking in space or setting a target on the ground. I have no idea why actual gameplay would randomly deselect this option in this way; no other settings - including \u0022Always show closest approach\u0022 - are affected and all other changes I make in the Settings menu are saved (yes I do hit Apply\u0026gt;Accept when exiting the Settings menu!).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyone else encountered this? Is it a bug, or maybe something I am doing? Here are all the mods I am running; is it possible one of these is doing this? I don\u0027t see why.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n000_Toolbar\u003Cbr\u003E\nBoulderCo\u003Cbr\u003E\nContractConfigurator\u003Cbr\u003E\nDecoupleFromHeatshield\u003Cbr\u003E\nDistantObject\u003Cbr\u003E\nEnvironmentalVisualEnhancements\u003Cbr\u003E\nHaystackContinued\u003Cbr\u003E\nHullCameraVDS\u003Cbr\u003E\nKopernicus\u003Cbr\u003E\nModularFlightIntegrator\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlanetShine\u003Cbr\u003E\nProceduralFairings\u003Cbr\u003E\nProceduralParts\u003Cbr\u003E\nReentryParticleEffect\u003Cbr\u003E\nSCANsat\u003Cbr\u003E\nscatterer\u003Cbr\u003E\nSquad\u003Cbr\u003E\nSVT\u003Cbr\u003E\nTextureReplacer\u003Cbr\u003E\nTrajectories\u003Cbr\u003E\nTweakScale\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
