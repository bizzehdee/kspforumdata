There is also a craft with mining capabilities that is also attached to one of the asteroids. When I try mining the amount of ore decreases in a different asteroid from the one the drills are mining, until the level of ore in that asteroid reaches 0. When it is 0 the drils tell me that resources are depleted, despite the fact that the asteroid that they are drilling is still full.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/ceEDr/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the images you can see the miner attached to the asteroid on the left but the resources of the asteroid on the right changing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
