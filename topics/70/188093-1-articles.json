This can be difficult to track down, as it may be that something went into the wrong folder or you may be missing the proper config, as appears to be the case with Kerbalism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. There is a conflict. One (or more) mods could be incompatible with your chosen install, or incompatible with the current version of KSP. As I noted above, you definitely had some mods that are out-of-date, and I don\u0027t know that all of them are compatible with KSP 1.7.3. Also, some of the mods don\u0027t work together, or have issues that require intervention: for instance, unless I am incorrect, SVE and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E don\u0027t go together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. There is a genuine bug in one of your mods that is causing your problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere may be others who can look through your log file and point to one specific culprit, but I am afraid that is not within my skillset. I can see that there are issues with your installed mods, and I can see that some of your installation choices don\u0027t necessarily play nice. Hence my advice remains: start over, move slowly. It may take some time and patience, but it will almost definitely identify your problem if not solve it outright.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last reminder: you can save your entire current KSP install by copying it to another folder and doing your clean sweep and installation tests on one KSP directory while leaving the other intact. That way, if you quickly identify the culprit, you might be able to simply remove it from your real directory and lose nothing but a bit of time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, thank you. I will work on slowly readding all the mods until I find the culprit tomorrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
