He recently figured out how to delete files. I was in gamedata trying to mod and I did not notice he deleted the gamedata. And I tried to launch KSP on steam and it did not work. I went in to delete some mods and I noticed it was missing. So I went to my recycling bin, and its empty. So how would I recover it?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-15T13:16:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither restore from a VSS Snapshot a.k.a. \u0022Previous Versions\u0022, or restore from a\u00A0backup (you do make backups regularly, do you?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-15T13:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have the game on Steam so you can verify the game files and it\u0027ll reinstall whatever was deleted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt won\u0027t install mods again so you\u0027ll have to do that manually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd tell your cousin\u0027s parents about it because there is no excuse for that behavior.
