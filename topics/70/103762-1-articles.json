I know it\u0027s not a huge deal as the parts still work, but it would be a bit better than the pathetic glow on the nozzle of cf34 turbofans that doesn\u0027t show there\u0027s actually any exhaust. I\u0027ve still got afterburning effects and the flames coming out sabres, and my stock and kw rocketry stuff works perfectly. Does anyone know what I can do to fix this?"}]}
