I also ran into it myself, but didn\u0027t investigate at the time (I can\u0027t remember if that was immediately before or immediately after installing Asteroid Day).\n\nI do see what appears to be the contracts getting wiped in the log:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.772] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.772] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.773] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.773] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.774] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.775] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.775] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.776] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.777] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.777] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.778] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.778] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.779] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.780] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.780] ContractList: Contract 0 is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.781] ContractList: Contract config is invalid  \n\u003E [ERR 14:37:07.781] ContractList: Contract 1 is invalid  \n\u003E \u003Csnip\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/snip\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E     [ERR 14:37:07.771] ContractList: Contract config is invalid\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nHowever I don\u0027t see anything that ties it to Asteroid Day or even implies what the issue is (there some other exceptions that seemed unrelated, but hard to say for sure).\n\nOne last note - when I observed it in my game, I only noticed because I was looking at the persistence file for other issues. The CONTRACTS node had no contracts underneath it, but my game appeared normal. When I did a quicksave of the game, the contracts were properly saved again - so I can assume that you have to get the contracts saved incorrectly, and then exit or reload at the inappropriate time to be affected by the issue."},{"CreatedByName":"frozenwatters","CreatedById":144823,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-06T20:27:31Z","Content":"Sorry just posting this from work and don\u0027t have any logs or anything.
