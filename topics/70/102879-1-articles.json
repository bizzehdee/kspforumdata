Can\u0027t offset or rotate parts. Same in VAB. 3 hours of hard work completely wasted.\n\nYo devs, how about some dev notes about those kinds of bugs... those that really break the game and set the fun level instantly to zero?\n\nSorry, I had to vent... this just so incredibly frustrating.\n\n![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T22:32:36Z","Content":"Weird stuff starts happening after about 300 parts in the VAB; I don\u0027t know about the SPH.

As far as I remember, my ship didn\u0027t have that many parts though -less than 150-.\n\nIf I remember anything else, I\u0027ll post here.\n\nEdit: It seems this is in modded installs, mine is stock and this still happened."},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T23:35:52Z","Content":"this is in modded installs because a mod decided my rant is a call for support. which it wasn\u0027t. it was just a rant.

It\u0027s usually better to just add stuff to one of the wings and then reattach the whole wing using 2x symmetry)\n\nI have always resolved the problem by hitting save craft, loading the craft, taking off the problematic part and redoing it in a manner that tends to not break KSP so much."},{"CreatedByName":"ShadowZone","CreatedById":112420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T05:29:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve had this happen, but usually only when I get really high in part count.
