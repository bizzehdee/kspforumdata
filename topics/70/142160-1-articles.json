I purchased KSP through Steam and had it installed on a laptop. During startup, it would have such \u0022loading hints\u0022 as \u0022Adding K to every word\u0022 \u0022Locating Jebediah Kerman\u0022 \u0022Adding more boosters\u0022 and \u0022Inventing witty loading hints.\u0022 I later built a proper desktop gaming rig, and instead of redownloading KSP, copied the\u00A0game files\u00A0over and verified the installation through Steam. The loading hints no longer appear, but the initial \u0022Loading...\u0022 text does. I assumed it would be fixed when I\u00A0updated the game to 1.1, but no such luck. I run a modded install, but the issue persists even with any plugin files removed, and Steam\u0027s option to \u0022Verify integrity of game cache\u0022 does not fix the issue, leaving me wondering if I\u0027ve run afoul of some sort of anti-piracy trigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate: Uninstalling and reinstalling KSP did not fix the issue, somehow. The impact is minor, but I am amazed that a reinstallation did not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutput log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4SyhB7yCOn4dUlCakJuUk1TTnc/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4SyhB7yCOn4dUlCakJuUk1TTnc/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-16T17:17:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2016 05:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SingABrightSong\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
