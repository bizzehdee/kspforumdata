I\u0027ve tried adding the stock RetroFuture.cfg file (from the patches folder) into the atm configs folder, I\u0027ve also tried several different configs to eliminate the problem.\n\n*ACTIVE\\_TEXTURE\\_MANAGER\\_CONFIG{*\n\n*folder = RetroFuture*\n\n*enabled = false*\n\nThis didn\u0027t work, so then I figured that it must be the normal maps, so I tried this:\n\n*ACTIVE\\_TEXTURE\\_MANAGER\\_CONFIG*\n\n*{*\n\n*folder = RetroFuture*\n\n*enabled = true*\n\n*NORMAL\\_LIST*\n\n*{*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\ED125\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\ED250\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\latMainLG\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\med2mFuselage\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\med2mPod\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\rectCkPit\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\rectFuselage\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\rFpWing\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\UHB\\_props\\_NRM*\n\n*}*\n\n*}*\n\nBut that also didn\u0027t do anything. I figured maybe it was an issue with the prodedural dynamics (since retro future is dependent on that mod) so I tried adding the proceduraldynamics.cfg and adding this to it:\n\n*ACTIVE\\_TEXTURE\\_MANAGER\\_CONFIG*\n\n*{*\n\n*folder = ProceduralDynamics*\n\n*enabled = false*\n\n*}*\n\nThat still didn\u0027t work, so i tried leaving the procedural dynamics off and changed retrofuture to this:\n\n*ACTIVE\\_TEXTURE\\_MANAGER\\_CONFIG*\n\n*{*\n\n*folder = RetroFuture*\n\n*enabled = false*\n\n*NORMAL\\_LIST*\n\n*{*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\ED125\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\ED250\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\latMainLG\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\med2mFuselage\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\med2mPod\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\rectCkPit\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\rectFuselage\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\rFpWing\\_NRM*\n\n*texture = RetroFuture\\Textures\\UHB\\_props\\_NRM*\n\n*}*\n\n*}*\n\nbut that had no effect either. So far I can\u0027t find any way around it. I don\u0027t even care if active texture managment doesn\u0027t do anything to the retro future mod but I can\u0027t seem to figure out any configuration that fixes the problem. I\u0027m not very good with this stuff so if anyone could write me some exceptions for those mods that would be great. at least let me know what I\u0027m doing wrong here. It doesn\u0027t cause any crashes, the parts just don\u0027t work like they used to, which is weird because every mod I installed was the exact same download from my last install of ksp. Anyway I appreciate any solutions here."},{"CreatedByName":"SalamanderAnder","CreatedById":145558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T12:30:19Z","Content":"Bumb.

I know one of those causes reflection."},{"CreatedByName":"SalamanderAnder","CreatedById":145558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T01:56:37Z","Content":"Okay sorry. Well I managed to fix the textures by switching back to an older version of ATM, so it\u0027s here if anyone happens to have a similar issue. The one that caused the problem was the \u0022has cash re-hash\u0022 update (the new versions don\u0027t work with .90, they make the textures white), so I simply rolled back to the .90 update and that solved the normals. \n\nHowever, now the only problem is that none of the right click options will work, which I\u0027ve narrowed down to the Firespitter modules. I don\u0027t have FASA but I do have Texture Replacer, so I\u0027ll look at that next. By now I\u0027ve tried almost every build of Firespitter I can think of, with several .dll versions, but to no avail. Nothing with Firespitter modules has any kind of right click option, so if anyone happens to know how to fix that particular issue then I\u0027ll finally have this thing straightened out. I\u0027ll look at the config cache.\n\nWell I guess you were right about KSPI, I deleted those files. First I tried installing the KSPI for 1.02 but naturally that didn\u0027t work with .90. I reinstalled the old version and also happened upon some advice for ATM to fix the white texture issue, so I installed the x86 version of that and applied the supplied patch. Finally I\u0027ve got the Firespitter module working and most of the textures all sewed up.\n\n![viper.jpg](http://s9.postimg.org/mbsenxlun/viper.jpg)\n\nFinally my project can proceed ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T21:42:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 09:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SalamanderAnder**"}]}
