I cannot see it in screenshot, but was there any part that had intersection with service bay model (some sort of clipping). You should build your rockets carefully to prevent any collider intersections (with the bay) and not try to fit too large parts, so this problem will not happen.. in most cases."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T15:31:38Z","Content":"I had this happen in some very rare cases.

For future crafts I would just build up from the floor of the service bays and not stick anything on the ceilings. Sometimes its a little harder to build inside the service bay that way, but if you build outside and then stick it to the floor it works pretty well."},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:06:13Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had this problem too. Took a while to diagnose as it was contained inside a fairing so I couldn\u0027t see the shaking and Kraken-ness. It\u0027s funny the first time when your station core snaps off the launch vehicle (still inside the fairing!) halfway off the launchpad. Not funny when it keeps happening no matter how many struts you put on."},{"CreatedByName":"Arsonik","CreatedById":79705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:19:20Z","Content":"While I initially was loving service bays while using them on a stock career game mostly for rockets.... Well, since I\u0027ve started Sandboxing out planes again I\u0027ve decided against using them for the very same reason others have stated. While most parts handle clipping fine, service bays do NOT. The tiniest little amount of part clipping and your boned. As soon as you open the bay, the shakes stop. When you closed the bay, they start again.\n\nNot a huge problem except for the lack of a service compartment for Mk1 size planes. I have nowhere \u0027good\u0027 to stick TAC-LS, batteries, etc. So I\u0027ve been reduced to Mk2 \u002B planes only for now."},{"CreatedByName":"damonrox76","CreatedById":143565,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:47:47Z","Content":"Does anyone have the problem with the 1x6 and 2x3 solar panels not giving you the option to retract them???? most of the time happens on the spot when i extend them or leave them open go to the space center and come back to the ship"},{"CreatedByName":"Pax Kerbana","CreatedById":129558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:48:36Z","Content":"Oh man I just imagined a literal kraken in there, like something out of Alien...

They wanted to make the two types of deployable panels different - so the lightweight ones can not only not survive re-entry, but can\u0027t be undeployed either. \n\nI learned this the hard way when using the small inline service bays to deploy from - \u0022undeploy\u0022 basically means closing and opening the bays until the panels break off."},{"CreatedByName":"sj176","CreatedById":138287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:07:46Z","Content":"Welcome, Kraken overlord"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:15:43Z","Content":"It\u0027s back?
