So I\u0027m deploying my mk16 at around 250 m/s and it is ripping off. Previously I could deploy the stock chute at this speed without that happening. Now I have to get well under 200 m/s to deploy safely, which often times gets me dangerously close to the ground. Is this just how it is? Can anyone help me figure out why this is happening?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went back to watch the manley tutorials to see if I had unlearned a hundred hours of KSP, but he seems to deploy fine that that speed in 23.5.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ratchet freak","CreatedById":119895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T10:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euse some drogues to slow you down first\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SlimeCrusher","CreatedById":105427,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T10:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, first of all, how do you make your re-entry normally? It may be you\u0027re comming too fast. Also, at wich altitude do you deploy your parachutes? I say 15.000m is ok.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaugeforever","CreatedById":110684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T10:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh I was told in another thread that deadly reentry had a bug in it which was fixed in a newer version.
