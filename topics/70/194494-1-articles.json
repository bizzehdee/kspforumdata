I think you are on your own.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbout the only thing you can do, is revert your game to 1.8.1 (using the *official* build of Kopernicus), or remove either Kopernicus and use OPT in 1.9.1, or remove OPT and continue to use your unofficial build of Kopernicus in 1.9.1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOR, better yet, go contact the person who supplied the unnofficial recompile of Kop for 1.9.1, and hit *them* up for fixes and support. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would suggest NOT posting about this on either the OPT, OR the Kopernicus thread, as you will be told exactly the same thing, and may even get some hostility and drama thrown your way. NOT your fault, but this is why *unofficial* builds of Kopernicus thrown around publicly are so frowned upon.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is one reason why official Kopernicus is KSP version locked.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIF, after reverting to 1.8.1, removing all traces of your unnoficial copy of Kopernicus, and re-installing a fresh copy of the official Kop for 1.8.1, you *still* have issues with OPT, it would be best to post on the OPT Legacy/Reconfig thread for support.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, I\u0027m pretty sure all of OPT works with no issues with official Kopernicus release in 1.8.1, and it is probably an issue specific to your install.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPrior to posting on the OPT thread, if you do this, tho, I highly suggest reading \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ETHIS\u003C/a\u003E thread, to learn how to supply your KSP logs in your post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-06T13:34:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2020 01:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Stone Blue\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
