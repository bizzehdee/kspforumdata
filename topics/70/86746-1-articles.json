I can go, pick up contracts, go to the VAB, construct my first rocket \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 everything goes just fine. Sounds are stable, music is stable, nothing glitches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe very moment I go to launch the rocket, things go strange. In previous versions, I was used to win the physical simulation started there would be a little hitch and then you would settle into the rocket. What happens to me right now is that the planet never renders, only the horizon and the interface renders, and the rocket appears to already be in a launched state zoomed very far out and off-center. No controls work \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the view can\u0027t be moved, zoom doesn\u0027t change with the mouse wheel, nothing. The background audio indicates that engines are on (or at least the sound is that of burning engines) and the buttons in the upper right are responsive \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 outstanding contracts, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point nothing I do makes a difference. Escape opens the center panel but revert to launch is not an option (it\u0027s grayed out). \u0022Return to Space Center\u0022 does nothing but close that panel, it does not take me back to the Space Center. In fact, the only way to get to any other activity is literally close the whole window.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tested this with both the 64-bit and 32-bit executables, both before and after deleting my CFG file, but frankly I\u0027m stumped. In the past I\u0027ve had absolutely no problem running KSP, but not long before 0.25 was released I also picked up a brand-new GTX 970.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I\u0027m not exactly sure how to even go about trying to debug this problem, but it definitely seems like something I should report.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SquidLord","CreatedById":58543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T04:35:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScratch that, I actually did find a log file after digging around a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not encouraging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://gist.github.com/anonymous/43fb016b69559962e13d\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://gist.github.com/anonymous/43fb016b69559962e13d\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T07:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed in your log that you are running a few mods, so I\u0027m going to slide this over to the modded support forum for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you can get it to happen in stock, let us know and we\u0027ll move it back.
