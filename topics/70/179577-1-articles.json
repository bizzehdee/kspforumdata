I have four mods: Mechjeb2, Kerbal Alarm, BonVoyage, and World Stailizer, all of which are up to date. I have tried three clean installs of 1.5.1 and the MH version that goes with it, and every time I enter the game and try to go into the tracking station the game freezes and I have to force quit and restore the old version o the game from my backup drive. The same problem might occur if I try to go into another building, but the tracking station is always my first stop on starting a gaming session.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-06T03:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a little experience running KSP on MacOS 10.10.
