It worked great and I have used it multiple times, then today I went to launch it (in the same configuration, no additional payload) and it couldn\u0027t even break the sound barrier. I tried a few other previously\u00A0successful SSTOs and the same thing: All except the smallest of spaceplanes get \u0027stuck\u0027 at about 300m/s. I relaunched KSP and they all worked again, but today I was playing and the same thing happened. Its annoying because I have to restart KSP multiple times to get rid of it. I am always following the same ascent profile and everything is the same. I have no idea what could be causing this, as I have definitely not updated KSP or any of my mods before this problem started. I know Interstellar adds certain mechanics to the stock jets but as I said these planes worked perfecty just yesterday. Any ideas or something similar happening to anyone?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-28T06:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny chance you forgot to install dependencies?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny antivirus stuff messing with ksp?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A35K","CreatedById":145429,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-28T12:56:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help, but it turns out it was my fault after all. I was editing some small things on the payload and in putting the cargo bay back, it attached to a node on the payload rather than the rest of the fuselage, but it looked normal unless you really zoomed in on the joint (which is why I only caught it by accident). Apparently that little uneven bump on the fuselage is enough to completely ruin my Mk2 SSTOs. The reason why it worked when I restarted was because it reverted back to the craft file with\u00A0the proper cargo bay attachment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-28T12:56:54Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2018 12:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by A35K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
