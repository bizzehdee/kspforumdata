This is the first time I have realy big problems with landing planes... and the root cause seems to be the wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey have become VERY sensitive to landing speed and have extreme amount of spring effect - resulting in my plane bouncing of the runway if I touch down, or immidatly crash if I go at it hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if this is caused by the FARc mod... but anyone else experience this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-14T21:54:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bad news is that the wheels have gotten worse since versions past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe good new is that you can now adjust spring/dampener settings in flight.\u00A0 (You may need advanced tweakables on for this)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would do quicksave shortly before landing, then try playing with those settings, starting with turning the spring value down a bit, and the dampener up.\u00A0 It\u0027s really black magic guesswork, so there\u0027s no right answer for every craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
