Then it\u0027s not possible, it will only connect to one but not both. For decoupling you can either use sepratons or Claw\u0027s decoupling fix mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve noticed that subassemblies will only connect through one of its nodes, the one you used to separate it from the ship when saving the subassembly(the one you are holding) or the root part if you made the subassembly by itself. It\u0027s annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen adding parts, the camera affects how you will attach the part. If you want to attach to a node, try pressing the mod key (alt key in windows) while attaching said part. This way it will only attach to nodes, which is useful when adding parts to a mk2 cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
