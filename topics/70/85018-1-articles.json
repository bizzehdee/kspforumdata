I\u0027m running KSP 0.24.2 x86 on Win 7. My system incudes 16gb of RAM. I\u0027m a mod-happy little nimrod, currently running approximately 100 mods, give or take. I run ATM at the default-aggressive level, though I know it\u0027s possible to make it even more aggressive if I don\u0027t mind making everything almost ugly-blurry by manually tweaking its config file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was told by none other than Majiir, the creator of kethane itself, a while ago said ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majiir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majiir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s important to note that while part memory consumption is fairly easy to predict, plugins are much harder to predict. In particular, plugins can have bursty memory consumption. So, even if everything seems fine when idle, a plugin might need to allocate a large portion of memory even for just a millisecond, and that can contribute to instability. Some plugins might maintain large data sets in memory at all times, too.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s what I\u0027m running into here. I know that the normal troubleshooting steps calls for me to strip down to a stock-only install and reintroduce the mods one or a few at a time, but in my case, that would actually make my problem MORE difficult to track if it is indeed a RAM overflow issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ex64 is no help either, since it\u0027s widely-enough considered to be broken that it\u0027s not even supported here on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to learn more about this than I do.

I do know that I throw a crapton of NRE\u0027s which become visible when I open up the debug menu in-game, but they\u0027re anonymous and I can\u0027t make sense of that info either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for steps to reproduce my problem, the fact that it\u0027s difficult to predict when it happens lends credibility to my sense that it\u0027s a plugin-driven RAM overflow. Like I said, I run about 100 mods, and while only B9 / KW / NovaPunch are part-only mods, I do have a fair number of mods designed for VAB / SPH use, to include KCT, Fusebox, Editor Extensions, Part Highlighter, MJ, KER, and some others.

For example, TweakScale is still known as Scale because it\u0027s based on Goodspeed Scale. That\u0027s a common conflict.

Stack traces like that are why so many modders refuse to support Windows 64-bit KSP. All it really shows is that a crash happened in an unnamed Mono function called by an unnamed Mono function called by what\u0027s probably a recursive KSP function. It\u0027s the particular sort of useless that I\u0027ve come to expect from out-of-memory errors with Win64 KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENormally I\u0027d stop there \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 it seems clear enough that that\u0027s the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Run a Find All search for \u0022exception\u0022 to get an overview of the pattern of errors. There are 222. There are normal exceptions like TweakScale_RealFuels (can\u0027t load because you don\u0027t have RealFuels installed). DangIt! for FAR complains, though I suspect that\u0027s a version incompatibility because I\u0027ve seen similar issues with the MechJeb FAR modules with the dev version of FAR. PunishTheLazy is having trouble finding out what time it is in the game. Is that Rover Wheel Sounds that always puts out four NullReferenceExceptions in a row? I know I\u0027ve seen that pattern before, but it\u0027s never been relevant. I see the ReflectionTypeLoadException a fair amount, but have never needed to track it down. EVE (Clouds) complains as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It can be helpful to look backwards from the crash or issue, but in this case, there\u0027s nothing obvious before the crash. Looks like you reverted to launch (\u0022Scene Change : From FLIGHT to FLIGHT\u0022), some plugins redisplayed themselves, and the game autosaved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. It helps to have a programmers text editor like Notepad\u002B\u002B for Windows or TextWrangler for Macs. If I suspect that someone has installed a mod incorrectly, I\u0027ll make a regex/grep search for \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027courier new\u0027;\u0022\u003E^AssemblyLoader[^\\r\\n]\u002B\\.dll$\u003C/span\u003E.

At a glance, everything looks like it\u0027s installed correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Look for evidence of problems that I\u0027ve seen before. There have been a few cases recently of an old ModuleManager config causing issues with TweakScale and the Infernal Robotics Rework. Once I started recognizing the symptoms, I found that I could locate it by looking for distinctive @PART lines. In one case, I identified similar issues by noticing that the player was making similar changes to IR with a different config.

The second is that function that called the first, and third function listed called the second. Basically, read down the list until you get to a function you can associate with a particular mod. Then remove all your other mods to see if it\u0027s really just that mod causing the problem.

There will be lots of references to ALLOC (Win) or malloc (Mac, Linux) at the end of the log. It\u0027s still possible that this is the memory issue you\u0027ve theorized. Confirming that as a player (rather than SQUAD) would probably take more work than it\u0027s worth. You\u0027d need to run many trials with the same mods and action sequence, monitoring memory load and adjusting ATM settings for at least high/low test cases.

The varying organization of mod download zipfiles can get maddening. To reduce it, I\u0027ve taken to prepping all downloaded mods with a blank .txt file, with a filename signifying the exact zipfile I downloaded it from. This allows me to do some of my own version tracking. Also, happy side effect, I found it\u0027s REALLY useful in uninstalling mods (for example, to reduce ram-load). A lot of GameData folders get joined or partially overwritten by multiple mods, such that deleting a GameData folder can break another mod if you don\u0027t replace that other mod\u0027s dependencies afterward. For example, my BoulderCo directory has ... six .txt files like that, so that if I wanna uninstall any of those, I have a list of other mods dependent on it, so I can reconstruct the dependencies after deleting the mod I wanna uninstall.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
