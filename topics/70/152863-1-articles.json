But when i quit to menu or exit the game and then click on \u0027\u0027Resume Saved\u0027\u0027 it doesn\u0027t appear there. It\u0027s all empty. I created a few more games and then checked the \u0027\u0027Resume saved\u0027\u0027 and there is still nothing, I also tried quicksaving the progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen i check the \u0027\u0027saves\u0027\u0027 folder in KSP directory, I can see al of my created Agencies/Games but they donot appear in-game.
