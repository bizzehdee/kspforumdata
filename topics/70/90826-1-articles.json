When I start a career game, everything is fine for a while, but as I get further through it and have a few landing sites \u0026amp; space stations something odd happens. The first sign is that the controls freeze when I switch to a new ship. I can\u0027t change the view, control the ship or move to the map mode but I can return to the space centre and when I do I get this view of it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/qycv3t.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qycv3t.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this happens I have to close the program through windows as it\u0027s now almost frozen.

This is on my dev environment and I\u0027ve deleted that part to make load times quicker so it probably is not related, but it is the only error in the log. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Because this was my dev environment, the only mods running were my own and Blizzy\u0027s toolbar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The error persisted across games.
