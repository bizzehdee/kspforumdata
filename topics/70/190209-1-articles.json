I first started playing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E on 1.6.0 and was able to use the Making History launch sites.

In Difficulty, I have Allow Other Launchsites checked. When I hover over the launch button, only the local runway/launch site option is available. In tracking station/map, the launch sites are not loaded up either. They just don\u0027t exist. In my copy of 1.6.0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, it works perfectly. I just tried redownloading a fresh copy of KSP 1.7.3 on my Steam, and copied Making History expansion into my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E KSP installation. I have all the Making History parts at least...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould love to make use of the other launch sites like I did in 1.6.0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E.
