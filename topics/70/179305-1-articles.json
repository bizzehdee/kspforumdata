The Kerbin texture is STUNNING. However, as I haven\u0027t explored all the Kerbol system\u0027s planets, I want to keep them as they are for now. So no full installation of SSRSS for me now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is : Is it possible to just take the Kerbin texture from the mod to install it, so I can have this beautiful Kerbin visual while keeping other planets stock?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to break any rule or license, so I don\u0027t want to play around with the files, unless there\u0027s a solution which is legal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-26T11:28:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understand this, did you want to use the model for SSRSS Earth for Kerbin in an otherwise Stock system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wastel","CreatedById":192540,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-26T11:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223475733\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179305\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221540553323\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157121\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gordon Fecyk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, Gordon Fecyk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I understand this, did you want to use the model for SSRSS Earth for Kerbin in an otherwise Stock system?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely.

You can test by just installing Kopernicus and its dependencies without adding any planet packs. Kopernicus is the plugin that lets people edit or create planetary systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that you\u0027re looking at editing Kerbin to use SSRSS Earth\u0027s properties. Make a new folder for yourself inside GameData and create an empty plain text file with the extension .cfg inside it. This will contain your modified Kerbin. Then see if you can take inspiration from SSRSS Earth\u0027s config.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI won\u0027t go into further details here, nor am I going to explain how to use Kopernicus in this thread.
