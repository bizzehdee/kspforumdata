I\u0027ve found a way to re-route to solve the problem, but thought I\u0027d report it anyway because sooner or later it\u0027ll be an issue for someone and it\u0027s usually a good thing to have someone able to report test results to aid in debugging. I do have one mod currently loaded after just recently performing a fresh install, I did not attempt to unload MJ to duplicate, so yes, there\u0027s a chance it\u0027s MJ causing the problem. I\u0027ve created a flow chart of the asparagus staging of my ship, showing where the fuel flow balance begins to fail and my resolution to the issue.
