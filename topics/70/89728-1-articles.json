The game runs smoothly and then randomly half of the vab/hanger will go dark and will lag more than usual and the screen where the kerbals are floating above kerban, they will either turn from pink to green to normal or have a grey/black splotch on them. Also the 2.5m sas from the Aires pack will hold its position on the nav ball but will not allow for maneuvering until the sas is disengaged. The game will crash randomly when it is in the loading screen. the kerbal engineer parts show up in the vab/hangar but do not have a display. I pretty sure I installed the mods correctly, but ill try with a fresh install tomorrow and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-08T04:10:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2014 04:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by TheRhinelander\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T07:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease follow the directions in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-(READ-FIRST)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow To Get Support (READ FIRST)\u003C/a\u003E sticky.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
