The craft already had the ability to store electrical charge in the lander can and probe core, I was just giving it some extra electric storage.\n\nIs there a way I can force the game to refresh the ship or the contracts so it completes the mission?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-11T23:49:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2015 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by yorshee**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:46:05Z","Content":"It\u0027s possible that the station isn\u0027t \u0022new\u0022, as repurposed stations don\u0027t count, but you can use the Alt\u002BF12 debug menu to complete the contract."},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T23:48:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s possible that the station isn\u0027t \u0022new\u0022, as repurposed stations don\u0027t count, but you can use the Alt\u002BF12 debug menu to complete the contract.\n\nAh, I see, I\u0027ll have to remember to always put batteries on my contract vessels from now on. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nThanks!
