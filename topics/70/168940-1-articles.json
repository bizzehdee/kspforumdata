After downloading and unzipping it, I found that there was no \u0022Parts \u0022 folder in V 1.1.0.0. I also checked the V 1.0.04 version and the parts folder is there... So already that \u0027s one that I\u0027m going to report to KGEX.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I tried this experiment, and in fact it\u00A0 comes down that when I mered (and yes, this is where I took V1.1.0.0 (which had No \u0022Folder\u0022 and merged it with the 1.0.0.4 the thing is that I got not a fatal error but rather a warning.. I\u0027m looking in the Log folder and the KSP Data folder , but there is no Logs being written into them..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow this brings up an interesting question.. Why have\u00A0 No Parts folder in 1.1.0.0 and a parts folder in 1.0.0.4? This is a rather curious question as to why I can\u0027t get the parts to Appear in 1.1.0.0 and I can when I add the 1.0.0.4 mod Parts folder into the mod.. And it\u0027s this one thing that causes the issues.. It is an issue that @zeroKerbal will ahve to address in furture updates to his mod.. So B9 Parts switch is in the cleear.. Will approach @zerokerbal on this one for an answer why there is so much inconsistency with his mod. Be cause it\u0027s only a matter of time for this to happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso a side note, and this has been brought up before but another issue could be with Tweakscale. I\u0027ve been reading in this thread that Tweakscale and B9 Parts switch are at odds with each other... But then Without the ability to get logs well, it\u0027s gonna be hard to prove anything here..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in my opinion I feel that mods should work smoothly.. sometimes it\u0027s a bit of Errant Coding that causes these things to happen Just my thoughts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace_Coyote (Aerodyne Space Industries...

Finding it is quite simple; you just have to scroll slightly past all of the files in the main folder, then get to the configs and stuff. It will most likely appear as being a text document just being named KSP to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
