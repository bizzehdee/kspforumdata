After creating a space plane(in my case its only happened on three craft and somehow Ive fixed the others) I will launch after loading in the back end floats while the front has physics over a few moments the craft slowly drops to the surface and I do mean slowly, at contact it will start to stress all my parts touching and break them one by one. on top of this the craft is locked in place and will not react to thrust but will roll and yaw... but the craft is locked in place on the back will not move forward or backwards....\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI run Ksp 1.2.2 ive got several mods but have not encountered this before... I have read that tweakscale has an issue with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E or RPO but I dont have them... I do have the Kargantua mod installed that uses Kapernicus and I do have tweakscale.... this space plane is well done and I would love to fix this problem since its not just annoying its game-breaking.... I mean\u00A0after spending several hours on a craft and having to scrap it.. ask any helpful questions and Ill give ya an answer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"l3obcat84","CreatedById":177296,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-30T00:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nremoved rapiers and it fixed it....now im curious whats happened to cause this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brent Kerman","CreatedById":167451,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-02T14:09:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the rapiers mass in your game?
