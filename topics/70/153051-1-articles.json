Basically, I have all of near future installed, OPM, MK2 expansion, OPT, MRS, and the MK4 parts pack, until recently i had \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E plus para sci high which reduces the effects of eve. Building craft with x number of parts makes me run in a slowed time rate so i uninstalled \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E and para sci high and my performance in buttery smooth again. However, I don\u0027t think ill be using near future parts except for construction so i was wondering if removing parts packs has that much influence on system performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-06T08:07:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPart packs increase RAM usage, and load times. As long as you have enough RAM they don\u0027t degrade performance over time as long as the modules are \u0027pluginless\u0027 (so no new game mechanics, like life support or manufacturing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft with a large number of parts (any!) degrade gameplay performance as number of physics calculations and complexity of rendered scene grows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means you may actually save up on your performance using larger mod parts instead of a large number of stock parts.
