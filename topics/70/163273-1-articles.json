Since I only ever load the 64bit version of KSP, can I delete the KSP_Data folder and leave only the KSP_x64_Data folder? Both those folders are 1.5G in size, and since I have limited space on the SSD, I\u0027d like to remove those folders if they aren\u0027t used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-15T09:09:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack-up the folder in question, then delete the original.
