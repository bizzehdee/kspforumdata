Here is the list of my mods, all up-to-date: ![vh515i.jpg](http://i59.tinypic.com/vh515i.jpg)\n\nFor a couple of days now I\u0027m not getting reeentry heat. I\u0027m also not getting any aero effects. \n\nFor some reason, even after replacing the Physics.cfg file with the original one (fro the Linux thread and also tried by redownloading it with Steam), my convection factor is being reset to 1.100, instead of 6.000; it only happens after entering my saved game. In the main menu, the convection factor is 6.000. That is what I noticed.\n\nI have set the Physics.cfg file to read-only after replacing it and the convection factor was still 1.100 instead of 6.000 after entering my save-game.\n\nHere are my files (Physics.cfg, Modulemanager.Physics, some screenshots, settings.cfg): [http://www.4shared.com/get/ORNmZ6Lxce/KSP_files.html](http://www.4shared.com/get/ORNmZ6Lxce/KSP_files.html)\n\nEverything was fine with aero and heat effects until a few days ago. I also encountered a heating bug, in which a component would suddenly overheat and explode. It was suggested to change conduction to 1 and back to normal and it fixed the bug. I think after that the aero and reentry heat broke. Here is the topic with the bug if it helps: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126664-MAJOR-Heating-Bug?p=2069825\u0026viewfull=1#post2069825](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/126664-MAJOR-Heating-Bug?p=2069825\u0026viewfull=1#post2069825)\n\nPS: It seems that in the alt\u002BF12 menu, the database used for physics was modulemanager.physics, instead of physics.cfg. Just loaded the physics.cfg file and everything seems to work, for now.\n\nProblem is that every time I load my save-game, modulemanager.physics is being used instead of physics.cfg and I have to manually load physics.cfg. How can I change modulemanager.physics to use the same parameters as physics.cfg?"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T10:29:55Z","Content":"Hmm, did you set aero effects to zero?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sheppard","CreatedById":93282,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T10:32:24Z","Content":"I did not mess with the any parameter regarding aero.
