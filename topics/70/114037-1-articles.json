The heat comes from direct contact with the heated air. The ablative substances are terrible conductors of heat and are designed to be eroded by the contact of the hot air so that any hot ablative coating is removed and so does not conduct heat to the craft.\n\nAs the only heat source is the heat of the friction with the atmosphere that heat should not be able to go deeper than the ablative coating.\n\nOnce the coating is used up and gone. then the friction heats up the base of the heatshield and conductivity can cause it to get to the rest of the craft.\n\nWhich brings me to my point. While there is still ablation on the shield, it should continue to function until there is not.\n\nIf the friction and so the heat becomes more intense, more ablation is removed from the shield again until such a time as there is no more ablation left.\n\nAre you seriously suggesting that there is a different heat source than the friction from the atmosphere?

The pressure gradient of Eve\u0027s atmosphere is going to be different from Kerbin\u0027s because of its high gravity. That means that you\u0027ll have significantly more time for aerobraking before you hit the denser parts of the atmosphere where heat can rise quickly enough to bypass ablation... so when you get there you\u0027ll be travelling significantly slower than you would be entering Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at that velocity."},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T20:38:25Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I am reminded of something I heard once. \u0022In theory, practice and theory are the same, but in practice, they differ.\u0022\n\u003E There is nothing you can make that can\u0027t be overcome by nature\u0027s forces. That includes heat shields. Heat shields merely make successful re-entry possible. They don\u0027t make it certain. Just ask Vladimir Komarov.\n\u003E \n\u003E Here\u0027s how I do re-entry. Returning to Kerbin I\u0027ll put my periapse at ~68km. When I get to periapse, I burn retrograde to bring apoapse down to ~40km. I now have a good long run of slow aerobreaking in the upper atmosphere to bring it in gently. One hundred percent survival rate, barring things like poorly designed aerodynamics of the re-entry vehicle.\n\nWow, what an amazing waste of fuel.\n\nI very rarely burn retrograde at all on re-entry only to set pe. My guys always aero-brake and always survive.\n\nI don\u0027t have any problems re-entering. I was commenting on tests I was doing with the heat shield.\n\nWe are not talking about natures forces, we are talking about a game. There is no theory it\u0027s all practical data. Garbage in...\n\nAbout what the devs said we can do as opposed to what we can actually do."},{"CreatedByName":"Zeo","CreatedById":147045,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:43:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E As I understood it, the ablation process works by the friction of the hot air hitting it and gradually stripping it away. The heat comes from direct contact with the heated air. The ablative substances are terrible conductors of heat and are designed to be eroded by the contact of the hot air so that any hot ablative coating is removed and so does not conduct heat to the craft.\n\u003E As the only heat source is the heat of the friction with the atmosphere that heat should not be able to go deeper than the ablative coating.\n\u003E \n\u003E Once the coating is used up and gone. then the friction heats up the base of the heatshield and conductivity can cause it to get to the rest of the craft.\n\u003E \n\u003E Which brings me to my point. While there is still ablation on the shield, it should continue to function until there is not.\n\u003E \n\u003E If the friction and so the heat becomes more intense, more ablation is removed from the shield again until such a time as there is no more ablation left.\n\u003E \n\u003E Are you seriously suggesting that there is a different heat source than the friction from the atmosphere? One which can be so intense as to bypass the heatshield altogether?\n\u003E \n\u003E Please, I\u0027m eager to learn. Do educate me.\n\nHello!\n\nRe-entry heating actually happens mostly because of pressure, not friction. Because of the very high velocity when entering atmosphere, the air in front of the ship gets compressed so much that it turns to super-heated plasma (high pressure -\u003E high heat). Blunt shaped ships (surprise high friction!) work so well because the air can\u0027t escape from the front fast enough and it pushes this hot stuff away from the ship. Similarly, ablative heatshields block the heat by expelling gases and pushing the hot stuff away, no friction. I\u0027m sure someone with proper education can explain this a whole lot better than me.\n\nSo yeah you can totally cook through the heatshield while it still has protective material left. Go too fast and the shield can\u0027t keep up. Or go too slow and you won\u0027t get enough heat for the reactions in the shield to happen and it becomes useless and your ship blows up (not in ksp thankfully).\n\nIn KSP universe things are of course scaled differently and work differently.\n\ntl;dr It is pressure, not drag!"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:32:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello!\n\u003E Re-entry heating actually happens mostly because of pressure, not friction.
