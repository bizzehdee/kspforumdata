The parts are all showing up now, however all of the modular tanks are invisible. I also have the issue where whenever I right click on any SSTU part it brings up the menu and I\u2019m unable to do anything else once the menu appears, I can click a few options on the menu, but I can\u2019t close it or even leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Currently not at my PC so I\u2019m unable to provide a mod list (I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s something\u00A0conflicting) but I have seen someone else post a similar problem to this and couldn\u2019t get that to work for me! Just to let you know I\u2019m using the 1.6.1 install of SSTU from Github.
