I got a new computer and installed ksp and this started happening. YES MY DRIVERS ARE UPTO DATE.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven with just vanilla it was randomly hitting a HARD 4GB limit and the game would freeze but I can still here the sounds it was making when it froze.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Game Idles on the main menu at 3.6GB usage too so I really don\u0027t know what to do.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have tried reducing texture quality in an effort to reduce texture memory eating up too much but it doesn\u0027t seem to have helped at all. I have found people talking about KSP as if this should only happen if launched 32bit but it won\u0027t even run in 32bit I always run it 64. I have seen online discussion about KSP using upto 16GB and others saying it\u0027s impossible for KSP to do more than 4GB ever even in 64bit mode.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat the hell is going on? It started just running out of memory like no tomorrow once I added Raster Prop Monitor or any other mod. I get to 10 mods and it hits the ram limit during loading up the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy last time I ran it on 4GB with about 50\u002B mods in 1.3.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
