I\u0027ve been playing for about 3 months and having a ball! I eagerly updated to .24 in order to play the 64 bit version. I\u0027m running Win 8.1 on a Samsung laptop. I have probably about 25 mods installed and try to keep them up to date. Like many of you I have been experiencing crashes on a daily basis and the output logs usually indicate a graphics problem (ATI card). I crashed especially when loading the VAB, like every 3 times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stumbled on a solution last night that might help some of you with a similar configuration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is happening on my machine is the power saving features were not powering the graphics card at sufficient voltage for it to keep up with KSP even though I told it to run at maximum performance. I was able to switch to a Full Power profile on my laptop that keeps everything fully powered and doesn\u0027t try to save battery. Low and behold, the crashes seem to have stopped. If you have a desktop machine you may be able to adjust the voltage settings on your card and it might help too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps some people. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MisterFister","CreatedById":85686,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T07:38:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I suppose that this might be helpful to some, it is very important to know that the x64 instability issues are not video card related, not mod related, and not KSP related.

I was having odd crashes in BF4 until I did the same thing on my desktop (max out/set to performance on all the power settings). The talk of voltages is due to the low power mode and high power modes that graphics cards use...frequency would have been better to use. None of this deals with overclocking or anything like that, just settings for power saving in the Control Panel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also had to tweak my CPU power profile in my system\u0027s bios to stay at max frequency for BF4 as well...I could see that helping with KSP too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
