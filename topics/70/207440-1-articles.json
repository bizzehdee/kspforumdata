sad but true.\u00A0 Reapplying new, higher quality, grease and \u0022pads\u0022 is not trivial on many machines, especially laptops, but for most models and makes there are how to videos.\u00A0 This is not for most people, but every town has people who make a living doing this kind of thing if it comes to it.\u00A0 Pick someone with a good reputation and these people are often the ones who also post how to videos.\u00A0 Some of the bad technique in some of those videos is why I suggest finding someone reputable.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E It is way too big of a subject to get into here\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E5) Finally, it is hard to say a mod couldn\u0027t cause such behavior under some condition, so running a test game without any mods can be a good reality check to rule this out. \u003C/strong\u003EMods that can cause something like this are usually ones that have to periodically monitor resources or the state of the craft in Flight or Map view.\u00A0 Editor oriented mods typically don\u0027t affect Flight or Map view.\u00A0 After removing mods you can reintroduce the mods one by one until the problem occurs again.\u00A0 Often mod issues are solved simply by reinstalling, and if not, often reinstalling KSP first can help, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut checking log error messages, free RAM, and temps before doing any of this can be a lot more efficient\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EI am by no means an expert!\u00A0 I know I probably missed something obvious here and probably made an incorrect statement somewhere and others will almost certainly let me know and I welcome it\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 Wait for more input to this thead before doing anything involving a lot of effort.\u00A0 Maybe look at the logs, temps, and RAM\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just thought of something else.\u00A0 If you are approaching another craft, when it comes into \u0022load\u0022 range, usually around 2.2km or so, the game will \u0022freeze\u0022, engines burning, etc, as the other craft loads.\u00A0 Don\u0027t be fooled by the engines burning during this freeze, it has no effect on the game as the entire physics engine is also frozen.\u00A0 The sounds and stuff are just running on a loop until the freeze finishes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-27T22:34:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2022 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by darthgently\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"djr5899","CreatedById":182804,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-11T03:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ended up returning the laptop.\u00A0 I was able to just replace the SSD in my old laptop and, even though the new laptop was supposed to be better specs, it ran incredibly hot and seemed to have small \u0022pauses\u0022 doing the simplest things, unrelated to the KSP issues I saw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-11T17:55:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224114899\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022207440\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221649648399\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182804\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022djr5899\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, djr5899 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ended up returning the laptop.\u00A0 I was able to just replace the SSD in my old laptop and, even though the new laptop was supposed to be better specs, it ran incredibly hot and seemed to have small \u0022pauses\u0022 doing the simplest things, unrelated to the KSP issues I saw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaptops are notorious for having heat issues, regardless of age.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are also notorious for being hard to keep clean (even without cats).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, they are designed to be able to run at full blast without overheating so the key is to figure out how to keep all air ducts open and free of dust (and cat hair)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
