But I might as well try to explain it. There seems to be a bug with the special effects that won\u0027t shut off while in the VAB. for instance, I install a new mod, a new RCS thruster from a mod pack, or a new heat shield decoupler from a parts pack. However, when these parts come to the vehicle assembly building, they seem to have what I think is a \u0022special effects\u0022 or \u0022animation\u0022 glitch. For instance, the new RCS thruster that I downloaded from a mod pack won\u0027t turn off, it is just in the vehicle assembly building turned on for all eternity. Even when I try to launch a creation with those parts, the RCS thruster\u0027s special effects still doesn\u0027t seem to go away. Another example is that of a heat shield decoupler. Whenever a new heat shield is placed in a creation in the VAB, there is a \u0022smoke animation\u0022 on the heat shield decoupler that won\u0027t disappear, and even when I try to launch something the smoke effect is still there. Has anyone ever received this glitch issue at all?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncase it helps, he following mods that I was using when I experienced this particular glitch was from \u003Cstrong\u003EFASA\u003C/strong\u003E and the \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbin Shuttle Orbital System\u003C/strong\u003E mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T16:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat means something broke when you installed it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Kromblers","CreatedById":123939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T01:46:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay.
