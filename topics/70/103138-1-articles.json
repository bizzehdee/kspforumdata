I have to reach Cabdan Kerman, put him into a capsule and bring him back home. The thing is that i\u0027, at 2 meters from Cabdan, and i\u0027m not capable to switch him.\n\nI tried to going tracking station or to the orbit map and I can\u0027t switch him, I tried bracket keys ( [ and ] ) and does\u0027t works... \n\nI don\u0027t know what to do, cause i\u0027m on space at his side, and I cannot switch Cabdan to propulse him onto the vessel. My vessel is a Stayputnik driving an MkI cockpit (empty, to put Cabdan inside) and all the other things (parachutes, tanks, propulsors...)...\n\nMods that I have: MechJeb 2; Station Science; Tarsier SpaceTech, that\u0027s all.\n\nI let you a capture...
