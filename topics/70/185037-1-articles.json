I mean obviously I can use the cheat menu to complete it manually, but that\u0027s kinda immersion-breaking. If there\u0027s a mod that\u0027s making the new features not work right, I\u0027d like to know what it is so I can disable it or repair it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
