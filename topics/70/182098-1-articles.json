For this, I need the internal name\u00A0of each part that I wish to relocate in the tech tree, which so far I have been retrieving from each individual part\u0027s config file. However, for some reason I am entirely unable to find the config files for the LV-T15 or LV-T303 engines. I know that these are added by Making History; I have checked in the Making History parts folder as well as in the stock parts folder (just in case), but the config files for these engines do not appear to be anywhere obvious. Where are the files for these engines located? Or, alternatively, what are the names used in the game code for the engines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-11T14:31:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1065693184\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/182040-145-151-161-partinfo/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-11T14:39:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160814-septemberwaves/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022160814\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/160814-septemberwaves/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@septemberWaves\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0The Valiant and Pug are not stock engines.
