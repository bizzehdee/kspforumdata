The usual cause of crashing rather than landing is due to turning on Autoland too late. Any ship coming in for a landing needs a specific amount of DeltaV to counteract the ship\u0027s speed. If you enable Autoland when you\u0027re too close to the surface and moving too fast, you will crash every time. The easiest way to land is to first get into a stable circular orbit, then in the Autoland window click the box that says something like, \u0022Select spot to land\u0022. Pick a place on the planet\u0027s surface then engage autopilot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
