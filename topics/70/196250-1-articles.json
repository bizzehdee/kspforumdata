Sometimes, after an unknown period of play, the game\u0027s lighting will start acting up. During the day it\u0027s not as noticeable, (though it definitely looks darker than normal), but during the night/behind celestial body it is just pitch black. Usually it will occur within an hour, and always requires some sort of load event - long-distance vessel switching, switching back to tracking station/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, sometimes even reverting a flight to launch causes it.
