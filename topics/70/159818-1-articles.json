However, \u00A0I\u0027m pretty sure that:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u0022release\u0022 releases the cable (whilst keeping the head attached) and allows the cable to flow freely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u0022extend/retract\u0022 toggle extension or retraction of the cable at a moderate speed (like 1m/s). Clicking the opposite button whilst one is active places the cable in an idle state iirc, but takes the action you\u0027d expect if it had previously been idle. There\u0027s already an issue for that on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E github I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u0022eject\u0022 fires out the cable with head from a locked position in the winch to the maximum length (actually, until the time it takes to reach the maximum length given the velocity one tick after it is ejected/fired.) This doesn\u0027t seem to apply a force in the case of being called by a kOS event or action, which is the problem I\u0027m having.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- \u0026lt;I forgot the name but something like release\u0026gt; - releases the head from the cable. Does nothing to the cable. I\u0027m avoiding this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the gui panel there\u0027s also a \u0022detach\u0022 available when the head is locked to the ground. This is available as an action of the harpoon module in kOS and works perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToggling the plug mode switches between docked and undocked. I *think* this just locks or unlocks the joint between head and cable. The winch should be \u0022undocked\u0022 when retracting and trying to lock, or else it frequently won\u0027t retract due to part misalignment.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
