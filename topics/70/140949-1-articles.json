And I didn\u0027t think that Collision FX could possibly be responsible considering it has little to do with engines specifically, but apparently it was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this whole thread was rendered pointless before it even got any replies. And now I\u0027m not sure what to do with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess it can serve as help for people encountering this issue- I just removed Collision FX. I didn\u0027t notice that the thread title said 1.0.x rather than 1.1.x.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was all on a new install, so I didn\u0027t think to check for updates- thought Collision FX was already up to date, or that it would work with 1.1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA mod should probably delete this thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Im8FGpp.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022302\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Im8FGpp.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022536\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RkBArAn.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022302\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RkBArAn.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022536\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T11:04:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 11:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brixmon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ewelp this entire thread is pretty much pointless now\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
