There are in particular two scenarios where this happens, first one is if I switch between the launchpad and the VAB/SPH while testing designs. After 2-3 switches my game will crash. Another scenario this happens is whenever I try to land a space plane or space shuttle anywhere on Kerbin. Mid atmo the game will crash leaving a crash report I have no idea how to interpret. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried all the go-to solutions, like checking how much ram is consumed, reinstalling the game\u00A0and updated all my mods. I\u0027m not a heavy mod user, but I don\u0027t know if there are any conflicts between mods.\u00A0I started using CKAN this weekend, hoping that getting all my mods refreshed would fix this but there\u00A0seems to be no difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had two crashes today and I am getting sick of troubleshooting this myself when I dont know how to read the crash reports. I was hoping someone could take a look at them for me and see if there are any obvious conflicts that are causing this. See the dropbox file, here I have attached the two latest crashes where one happened while landing the Space shuttle, and another from swapping between hangar and pad.
