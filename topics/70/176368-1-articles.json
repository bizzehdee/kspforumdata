The Problem is, in order to do the upgrade I have to switch back to original language and then I can start the patch program. Else I get an error that this is not a valid KSP folder. After the upgrade I would like to switch back to german but then it says the Version of KSP is not valid for the Language patch. So the only \u0022Fix\u0022, more likely a workaround, is to Backup all Saves and so on, uninstall the Game and reinstall with full setup.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any posibillity to make this easier?
