I assembled it in orbit using the Cormorant Aeronology\u00A0Space shuttle. I attatched the final part with the Canadarm 2 and undocked. The shuttle moved like 5 metres away from the station but it wouldn\u0027t move,, except roll. Same with the station. So even though it was seperated from the station, it was stuck in that place next to the station. I tried everything to move away from it but it won\u0027t move an inch. Then i loaded a quicksave from 10 mins before but then almost everything, including kerbin \u0022disappeared and you could see everything like a ghost, because they were transparent. I got really annoyed and went back to the space center. Then i found out the center was like a ghost as well, everything was transparent. I clicked on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and the game crashed. Any ideas of what is going on? I did a lot of stuff in that world and i don\u0027t really want to do a re-install or anything... thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-23T18:48:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re gonna need pics for this one, I think.\u00A0 Mod list, KSP version, logs, etc, too.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut first off confirm all your mods are the right version for the KSP version you are playing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes it still happen after rebooting KSP?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas the station rolling with the shuttle, as if they were still docked, or could you only roll each one individually?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"edwin.robert","CreatedById":189937,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-29T17:11:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223404166\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176127\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221529779703\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/23/2018 at 7:48 PM, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re gonna need pics for this one, I think.\u00A0 Mod list, KSP version, logs, etc, too.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut first off confirm all your mods are the right version for the KSP version you are playing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes it still happen after rebooting KSP?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWas the station rolling with the shuttle, as if they were still docked, or could you only roll each one individually?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, i just loaded a save from just before docking and carried of from there.
