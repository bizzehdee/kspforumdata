But there is a problem with the Radar Warning Receiver hud. I click it and it turns on but it\u0027s not showing up on my screen the only thing I am getting is a small grey square in the top left corner covering up a part of the time stamp. I tried dragging it down but it doesn\u0027t do anything. Is my mod glitched out or is the radar stuck off screen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
