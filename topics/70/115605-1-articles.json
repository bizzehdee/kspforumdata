Usually I can just go and restore the file, also excluding it from that happening again in the process. However I installed procedural parts, had the same issue and went to go restore it but now Norton refuses to open at all. No amount of mashing the mousepad or mouse buttons as fast as physically possible will get it to open. It does however continue to delete the .dlls when I copy them back. I\u0027m wondering if anyone can help me get those files restored and make an exclusion for my KSP directory so I don\u0027t have to deal with this again. \n\nNOTE: I apologize if this in in the wrong section as I wasn\u0027t sure where it would fit in, I\u0027m perfectly fine with this being moved to a section it would be better in, since I couldn\u0027t find one specifically about stuff like it it myself."},{"CreatedByName":"mike9606","CreatedById":90275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T01:37:37Z","Content":"Is it even possible to fix this issue or am I only gonna get people saying stuff like the two posts above.

The only way I know to fix it is to go to Norton\u0027s settings, click antivirus, go to the scans and risks tab, click the configure button next to \u0022Items to Exclude from Auto-Protect, SONAR, and Download Intelligence Detection\u0022, and add your GameData folder to the exclusions list.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...went to go restore it but now Norton refuses to open at all.

Same hoes for antivirus products: once they get a reputation, people will hate them because they were, once, flaky.\n\nNorton is now fine. You need to know how to use it, same as all other antivirus products.
