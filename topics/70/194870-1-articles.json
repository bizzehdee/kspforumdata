Also make sure you have all the dependencies installed- those are mods that are needed by other mods for those other mods to work properly- for SSPXr those are: ModuleManager, B9 Part Switch and Near Future Props, they come bundled with the download but make sure they\u0027re the right version for your version of KSP. If you\u0027re on KSP 1.9.1 then just use the newest versions of each and you should be fine, 1.8.1 should also be OK but anything 1.7.3 or older will need older versions which you need to track down individually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
