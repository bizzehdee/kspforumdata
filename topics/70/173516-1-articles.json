Found out there were new versions of the MSI mod and the IRSampler plugin. If this doesn\u0027t work my next attempt is removing Infernal Robotics completely until they come up with a new 1.3.1 release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Update 2*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReading more into the non-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E related exceptions it seems the reflection plugins/wrappers are a huge cause of this. I copied over parts from my other modded install but not all the parts that take advantage of the new .pdb texture shading. First I removed ReflectionPlugin.dll from the /Hubs subfolder and the startup got a little further and then crashed again when reaching AT_000Utilities (or some version of that) which was the .pdb active texture mod, including injections for shaders that this install doesn\u0027t seem to like (at least I think that\u0027s what it is doing). I\u0027m loading it again with every reflective/reflection based \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch and .dll removed, will report my results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Update 3*\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still haven\u0027t figured this one out. I\u0027ve taken out everything that causes any kind of exception on startup and it still crashes... however I think I may have had the wrong Module Manger .dll there (was a 3.x version). I have a feeling this is the issue.
