I\u2019ve used SR quite a lot and it\u2019s very configurable plus it has a helpful UI in the editor for judging how many parachutes you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s also KSTS which lets you record a flight taking a given mass of payload to a given altitude, then reuse it to take any payload you make in the editor into space up to that mass and altitude, for the same price and flight time as the recorded flight; it ties in with both FMRS and SR to offset the costs of recovered parts from the total. It also has a \u2018transport\u2019 mode which lets you carry resources or crew up to space or back down again, and with a suitably staffed space station can even do in-orbit construction over time by flying repeated launches to carry the equivalent mass then waiting a while for the engineers on the station to \u201Cbuild\u201D it- very handy for large or awkwardly shaped payloads that wouldn\u2019t work on a conventional launcher or for building monstrous ships in orbit that would never get into space otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
