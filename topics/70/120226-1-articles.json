At around 70 to 80 m/s (or 150 knots), I start getting the white trails of the aero FX across my parts like I\u0027m doing high-mach. By the time I\u0027m at a lazy cruising speed of 150 or so m/s, my aircraft looks like I should be gripping my stick, gritting my teeth, taking a photo and turning it into a \u0027KSP INTENSIFIES\u0027 [shake] GIF image with the amount of aero visual effects \u0027ripping\u0027 over my aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEssentially, visually, I\u0027m barely doing .3 mach with something that looks like a global hawk or U2, and the VFX are behaving like I turned the \u0027epic flying intensifies!\u0027 knob up to max.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I\u0027ve been going through what in my mind are the first candidates and removing them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- FAR: Not it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- EVE: Not it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Real Plumes: Not It\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this is something in the physics.cfg settings, or an obscure setting hidden away in the depths of a mod, but I cannae\u0027 find any leads on what might cause this.
