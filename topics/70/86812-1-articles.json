I had to get my rocket into orbit with the camera lagging about 500m behind it which was fun. I also noticed the controls went very sluggish in fact when I got the craft into orbit I tried spinning it around and it was sending the little ring around Kerbin all over the place. Going to the space center fixed the problem long enough for me to get Eldrin on board and start my return journey, unfortunately it happened again as I was landing giving me a beautiful aerial view of my parachutes. I have launched several craft before this one with no problem but this was the first one I had built on 0.25 with both a probe core and a command pod on it so I am wondering if that is the cause of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am using 32 bit with the following mods installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS, Kethane, Infernal Robotics, Tweakscales, Part Angle Display, Modular Fuel Tanks.
