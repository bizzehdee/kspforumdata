As the title says, I somehow changed the orbit of an asteroid (AST. HSJ-227) through the cheat menu... How it happened? I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I was attempting to set a station into orbit through the cheat menu and next thing I know I\u2019m looking at an asteroid orbiting Kerbin in a circular 125KM orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nKnowing that this was out of place, I thought I could revert back to launch and it would be fine. But, the option to revert wasn\u2019t available, due to the fact my station was still on the pad.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nSo I thought I could simply change the orbit of the asteroid again through the cheat menu. But it says there\u2019s no active craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\nThoughts anybody?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
