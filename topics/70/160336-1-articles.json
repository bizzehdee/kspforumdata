So the games says I\u0027m getting an encounter, and I reach the patched conic, and it just sat there saying \u0022Moho Encounter, T -\u0022 However, when I went from Kerbin to the Mun, everything worked just fine. This bug wasn\u0027t unique to Moho though. I did a test going to Duna, and the sane thing happened. However, I did enter its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, but as soon as I did, I was teleported to the other side of it and exited again. Even after uninstalling Hyperedit, uninstalling and reinstalling KSP, this still happens and is very frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
