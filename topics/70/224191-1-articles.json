After doing so, the bug evolved to what it is currently. Instead of a full deletion of my vessel and killing of my pilot, it now merely removes my ability to control the vessel\u0027s attitude after reaching space, and continues to bar my inputs until again passing 70,000 meters on the way back down\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther quirks of this issue I\u0027ve noticed is that the nav ball\u0027s indicators, if shown, ant-radial for instance will flicker like the nav ball is glitching out.

I\u0027m using Jeb, so the kerbal not being a pilot isn\u0027t the issue. I have electric charge.
