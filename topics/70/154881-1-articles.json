I usually only end up updating once I\u0027m ready to let my career save go and start over. But I\u0027m interested in updating from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 without losing my current career. Is this possible? How is it done?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a rather extensive modlist on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E which may affect the answer to this question, so I assume this is the correct location for this post. Moderators, please feel free to move me if there\u0027s a better forum for this question!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
