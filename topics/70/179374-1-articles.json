Sometimes I stay on the PC and play BeamNG Drive or just look for scenery I can download for FSX. A lot of the times I just walk off and do some chores to pass time but when I come back, KSP has crashed. This is really annoying as it takes an eternity to load and it crashes. It seems as if Squad is watching me and making it crash when I\u0027m not looking. When I sit at the computer, nothing goes wrong. The crash files are taking up half a gig on my storage, just to show you how many times it has crashed. It\u0027s not the mods either, otherwise it will crash on startup every time. I\u0027ve inserted\u00A0the crash file, output log and KSP.log. I\u0027ve Also added another crash file that I got today from just ENTERING the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E after a flight. This happens every day and I\u0027m almost at the point of deleting KSP and I wouldn\u0027t give a f about my money. Does anyone know what is causing these crashes? The other thing i that in EVERY SINGLE crash file, the cause it an \u0022access violation\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nerror.log from crash at opening up:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6u9ceap5msj1rk/error.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/w6u9ceap5msj1rk/error.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\noutput_log.txt:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/gzi9oa6ddulfedr/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/gzi9oa6ddulfedr/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP.log:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/um3aqt0ee4rowwe/KSP.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/um3aqt0ee4rowwe/KSP.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nerror.log from entering \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6u9ceap5msj1rk/error.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/w6u9ceap5msj1rk/error.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-29T14:46:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should definitly clean up your GameData directory.
