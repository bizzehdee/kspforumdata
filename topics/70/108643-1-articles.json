It turned out that I had two two configs fighting each other, and when I removed one MM config it was all A-OK. But.. It has now happened with the Mk3 cockpit, and I cant think of what has caused it. I assume there is a doublet lurching somewhere.. So does anyone know if there is an obvious way to find out which the two offending configs are?\n\nPs. thanks\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T19:28:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by plausse**\n  \nadded thanks"},{"CreatedByName":"plausse","CreatedById":64331,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T17:00:17Z","Content":"Although I still haven\u0027t found a quick way to check.. the offending mod was (unsurprisingly) a screwy copy of tweakscale, in case anyone actually wondered."}]}
