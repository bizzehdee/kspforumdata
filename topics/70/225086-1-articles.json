This is my first time on the forums so I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m supposed to post this issue here (please tell me if this is the incorrect channel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, as of recently, I have had issues with Luna Multiplayer (LMP), usually after a couple months of using the server (hosted locally on my computer and downloaded from here). This has happened twice now, with the 1st one resulting in a complete re-download of the LMP server and removal of all progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the transcript:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[21:05:44][Fatal]: Error in main server thread, Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: Sequence contains no elements\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 at System.Linq.ThrowHelper.ThrowNoElementsException()\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 at System.Linq.Enumerable.First[TSource](IEnumerable\u00601 source)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 at Server.System.Vessel.Classes.Vessel..ctor(ConfigNode cfgNode) in C:\\projects\\lunamultiplayer\\Server\\System\\Vessel\\Classes\\Vessel.cs:line 26\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 at Server.System.VesselStoreSystem.LoadExistingVessels() in C:\\projects\\lunamultiplayer\\Server\\System\\VesselStoreSystem.cs:line 62\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 at Server.MainServer.Main() in C:\\projects\\lunamultiplayer\\Server\\MainServer.cs:line 80\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/j970Kjs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/j970Kjs (image of the issue)\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not know the exact sequence of events, however I can give you general information:\u003Cbr\u003E\nA couple days before the issue, I installed and uninstalled TAC life support, which left my ship in shambles (manoeuvre nodes were incorrectly placed, resources that weren\u0027t put into the craft like oxygen, CO2, wastewater, water, etc.), but seemed to be fixed after I closed the server and the client and reopened both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple minutes before the issue, I was burning my engine and it kept shutting off for no reason, as if it was lagging, and it was jittering around suddenly. After at least 3-4 times of this, the server gave up and crashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"space-shoop","CreatedById":233935,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-14T01:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found the issue! It is because you either CHANGED a file, or a file is EMPTY. To find this, if you\u0027re on windows, and you have have this issue, go into the LMP server file and search\u00A0 \u0022.txt size:empty\u0022. Then delete that file, and it should do the trick!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-15T13:31:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2024 01:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 15\u0022\u003EJune 15\u003C/time\u003E by space-shoop\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
