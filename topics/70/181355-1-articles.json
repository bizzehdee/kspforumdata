I walk with the last Kerbalism 2.1.1.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven so the game starts without problems.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem starts when I start with the construction of something.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the moment I put the 1 Piece, it starts to give me some micro jumps, sometimes very fast every 2 seconds and sometimes a few seconds more. Unbearable Play like this.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTry a clean installation of the 1.6 with only those mods. The game goes well, until I put the 1 piece and back with the same.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt the moment I remove that mods Out problems.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn Ksp 1.5 the same.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is the mods that I like the most ...\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince I tried it ... I can not boot KSP without it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI see videos of people running it in the 1.6 without problems ..\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd tried to find information about it .... Nothing.
