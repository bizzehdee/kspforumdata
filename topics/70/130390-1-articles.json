It seems to run the GFX card as hard as it can, all the time which, as you say, causes them to degrade quicker but only in the limited areas that KSP uses. The card never registers it\u0060s maximum heat but the fans run at full speed and the frequency of the card never drops below max which suggests to me that a subsection of the routines on the card are being used without any restrictions. To my mind this would cause maximum stress but only on part of the card.
