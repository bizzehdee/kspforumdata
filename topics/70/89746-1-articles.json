Everything was fine until I entered the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery single part was doubled, and the funds indicator had a \u0022(\u002B 9,8 %)\u0022 next to the number. I couldn\u0027t understand anything. My old ships would load up just fine, but it was still annoying and confusing. Same story in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked out the R\u0026amp;D Facility: Same story. Every tab showed that I had unlocked double the amount of parts that I previously had. For example, when the next unlock involved two parts, it would show me four, the doubles of the previous. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running a few mods, but in this it must be something the upgrade has caused. I will however note that \u0027Firespitter\u0027 doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Max\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T10:08:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the first instance, I\u0027d try a clean install.

Before contracts, all you did was give yourself amounts of science and power through the tech tree until you got to where you where.
