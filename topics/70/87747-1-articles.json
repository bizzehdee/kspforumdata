First of all i\u0027m using a few well known mods : Kethane, KAS, KW Rocketry, B9 Aerospace, SelectRoot, SCANsat and Catterpillar Tracks. My problem is that I have just build a glider that holds a rover that is upside down under its belly. When I eject my rover, a parachute open on the nose of it to slow its fall, and I put landing pads on its back so when it touches the ground, it always falls on its catterpillar tracks and is ready to use. BUT, when i get into the rover, everything works except the catterpillar tracks...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I noticed that when I save the rover only and launches it without the glider, it works perfectly. I checked all the available options for the tracks, there\u0027s nothing useful. I tried to select different parts as the root part, but it doesn\u0027t change anything. And I use stock separators between the glider and the rover. In the past I\u0027ve already succeeded in building a droppable rover, and it worked very well. I don\u0027t understand where the issue is in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Can someone help me please ? I really need it to work !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Here are screenshots of my creation :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RfgtIhp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022RfgtIhp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MuSZoZz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MuSZoZz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QUZRO1Z.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QUZRO1Z.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-18T12:55:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/18/2014 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Knacky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Knacky","CreatedById":126354,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T12:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell... It seems the problem has been solved by itself...

In fact, it was because my gears were raised at the moment when I drop the rover, and the Caterpillar tracks need to have lowered gears to works, even if you don\u0027t have gears on the vehicle !\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
