I then decided to switch to making an AA vehicle, but not without saving the first plane. Once I had finished the building/testing process of the AA rover, the craft file for the spaceplane I had made magically disappeared. I looked around in my KSP\u0026gt;saves\u0026gt;(save name)\u0026gt;Ships\u0026gt;\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E directory but couldn\u0027t find anything. I searched around a bit on the web, and realized that I could reverse-engineer a craft file from a save. So that\u0027s what I did. I loaded my quicksave from before I kitted the plane out with mods and created a save.\u00A0I used the craft rescuer tool on Kerbaltek, which was able to bring the stats of the plane and the amount of parts, ect. However, when I clicked load, KSP just did nothing. I looked around in the craft file with notepad, didn\u0027t find anything majorly broken. Also, since its was able to recover some of the information about the plane, including the name and part count/price, it didn\u0027t seem likely that the craft file was broken too badly. I\u0027m not entirely sure of what to do. I could just recreate my craft (it wasn\u0027t all that complicated anyways) although that would be a bit of a bummer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m mostly looking for ways to either force load the file or open it in a separate editor, just to make sure there\u0027s nothing wrong with it, and if there is, how to fix it manually.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks for any help!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: I just recreated the plane from screenshot that I took during flight in the save, but any help would still be appreciated just so I can figure out what to do in the future if a craft is too complex to screenshot and rebuild.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-06T17:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2020 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by PhoenixFire\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
