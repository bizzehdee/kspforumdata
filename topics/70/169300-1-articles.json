I can\u0027t fly fer shiite. Started out too fast in this game by loading a lot of mods before I knew what to do with them. Apparently one or more of these mods has had adverse affects in the game. For example I had done some of the tutorials and after loading about 20 mods at once, now all of a sudden I can\u0027t play those training sessions anymore. The take me back to a\u00A0 point a couple of seconds before the ship was about to crash, it did crash and the session was over\u00A0 and if I tried to do it again, I would still go back to where the ship would crash again. Couldn\u0027t do any one of them all the way through anymore. I then got rid of all my mods and now I can play the training session from start to finish again.\u00A0 Don\u0027t know which of those mods affected this cause I had put in so many at once (using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E).
