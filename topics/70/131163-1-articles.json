Now when I access my flights in my career save, my framerate slows down into 10 fps territory, even on the map screen.

It\u0027s in no way a high performance pc, but did run the game ok until the last few days. I have a gaming pc on which the game runs great, but I like playing the game on the laptop. :/ Can the amount of ongoing flights result in these kinds of problems? I have a few empty crafts orbiting Kerbin and its moons that I could bring down, but haven\u0027t yet got to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-01T13:45:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2016 01:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Haukifile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdit: added ksp ver.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Haukifile","CreatedById":156506,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-01T16:55:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I have found the culprit. I had the Snacks life support mod installed before the performance issues, and the issues went away after reinstalling the mod. So it seems that my save, which was played with Snacks until then, did not play well at all after suddenly removing the mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
