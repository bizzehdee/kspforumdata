I use many different mods, but since I had a similar issue before I think it rather is an issue with the save.

Please note, that there are two docking ports at the M1 II, from which one has more parts on it which are not needed after the docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThx for the help.

But I would guess that you\u0027ve got a case of a docking port ending up in the wrong state. \u00A0Have you managed to get the docking craft\u0027s port right up to the stations port, perfectly level etc but it just doesn\u0027t do anything? If that\u0027s the case then it\u0027s probably one of the two docking ports is in the wrong state. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way around it is to open your save file with a text editor (vim, notepad\u002B\u002B) and search for your craft and then find the docking ports in that craft. \u00A0Then on each docking port you want to find the line that says \u0022state = ...\u0022 and make sure it says \u0022Ready\u0022. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlternatively if you\u0027re not into save file editing and you have KIS installed then run a mission with an engineer to bring up a new docking port and replace the faulty one. \u00A0(I\u0027ve not tried doing that but I\u0027m sure it would work, plus you get a realistic mission out of it!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
