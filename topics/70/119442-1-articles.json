Help Please.","CreatedByName":"AceSeptre","CreatedById":98991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T21:40:56Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"AceSeptre","CreatedById":98991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T21:40:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstalled the FASA Mod but am having an issue when I finish a craft and go to launch, the loading screen (black screen with loading in bottom corner) will pop up, and the music starts playing, but the craft will never load, and the game freezes on the loading screen with the music playing, forcing me to force quit the game. I thought that it may be only a specific few parts that are causing the issue, and a few of the parts such as the LEM, and CSM will load into the launch if they are not connected to anything else, other than that 98% of the parts I have tried to use in a craft cause the same problem. I downloaded FASA from Kerbal Stuff. The file contained two folders, one that contained all the parts, and maybe some other stuff. And another that contained the Ship saves, as well as Raster Prop Monitor. I placed the folder containing all the parts (which are also broken up into various folders) into the Game Data folder, and placed all the ship saves into the Ships Folder. I did not do anything with Raster Prop Monitor, and I\u0027m not sure if this is my problem or not. In the install instructions it game no specific instructions to do anything with the Raster file, so I left it alone. Do i need to place Raster into the game data folder, or is there something else I can do to fix this problem. Thanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm an on KSP 1.0.4, and I think it is FASA Version 5.37, but Im not 100% sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
