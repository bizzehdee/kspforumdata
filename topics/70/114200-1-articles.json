Seemingly at random (I can\u0027t predictably reproduce it an any time) the gimbals on my engines will operate backwards, in other words if I pitch up the gimbal pitches down. It will work just fine one second, flip the next, then be back to normal the next time I hit a key. The really strange thing is it\u0027s only the engine gimbals, the reaction wheels are RCS will operate properly and fight against the incorrect gimbal of the engine.\n\nThis happens with all of my spacecraft and I don\u0027t have any fancy builds, just fuel tanks with an engine at the bottom. For whatever reason it seems to never happen while in kerbin atmosphere. I haven\u0027t been able to reproduce it on my stock install so I\u0027m pretty sure one of my mods is causing it. I realize that all of my mods haven\u0027t been updated to 1.03/4 yet but I\u0027m hoping someone can help me figure out which one is causing it.\n\nMy mod list:\n\nKSP: 1.0.4 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\n\nUSI Tools - 0.4.1\n\nAmbient Light Adjustment - 1.4.3.1\n\nChatterer - 0.9.5.86\n\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.4.2\n\nContract Configurator - 1.5\n\nContract Pack: Anomaly Surveyor - 1.2.2\n\nContract Pack: Kerbal Space Station - 1.4.1\n\nContract Pack: Useful Space Stations - 1.0\n\nContracts Window Plus - 1.0.5.2\n\nDMagic Orbital Science - 1.0.4\n\nEngine Lighting - 1.3.5\n\nFerram Aerospace Research - 0.15.3.1\n\nFirespitter - 7.1.4\n\nRasterPropMonitor - 0.20\n\nKAS - 0.5.2\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.17\n\nKIS - 1.1.5\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\n\nInfernal Robots - 0.21.2\n\nModularFlightIntegrator - 1.0\n\nNavHud - 1.2.1\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator - 6.2\n\nS.A.V.E - 1.0.1.672\n\nQuickScroll - 1.3\n\nQuickSearch - 1.1.3\n\nRCS Build Aid - 0.7.2\n\nRCS Sounds - 4.3\n\nRealChute - 1.3.2.3\n\nSpaceY Lifters - 0.17.2\n\nStageRecovery - 1.5.6\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer - 2.5.1.7\n\nTextureReplacer - 2.4.6\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.3.2.1\n\nAlternate Resource Panel - 2.7.1\n\nTransfer Window Planner - 1.3.0.1\n\nTweakScale - 2.1\n\nUSI Exploration Pack - 0.4.1\n\nKarbonite - 0.6.2\n\nUSI-LS - 0.1.2\n\nWaypoint Manager - 2.3.4\n\n[x] Science! - 4.6\n\nI will link an output log and craft file(even though it isn\u0027t specific to any one craft)the next time it happens."}]}
