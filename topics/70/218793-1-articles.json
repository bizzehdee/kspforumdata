if it\u0027s a basic rocket it can\u0027t have many parts, it will take half a minute. your probe core should still work to provide guidance, because every probe core has built-in batteries. if electricity is still the problem, you could try to cheat infinite electricity just to solve this issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-06T23:43:52Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2023 11:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 6\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by king of nowhere\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrAir","CreatedById":225345,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-07T17:34:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe cores own batteries have the same issue, but I\u0027ll try infinite el\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/218794-whenever-i-try-to-launch-my-autonomous-probe-all-resources-including-power-are-set-to-no-transfers-preventing-launch/#elControls_4309722_menu\u0022 title=\u0022More options...\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/a\u003Eectricity\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: It works, but now non of the fuel sources work (even when i specifically reenable them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-07T17:42:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2023 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 7\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by OrAir\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate regarding the bug\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-07T21:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Tech Support modded\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrossposted threads have been merged.\u00A0\u00A0 Please don\u0027t crosspost the same question, it leads to fractured discussions and confusion.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-08T20:36:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224309722\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218793\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691429657\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225345\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OrAir\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/7/2023 at 7:34 PM, OrAir said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe probe cores own batteries have the same issue, but I\u0027ll try infinite electricity\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: It works, but now non of the fuel sources work (even when i specifically reenable them)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would try uninstalling some mods. it\u0027s definitely a bug, it\u0027s not in the stock game, so it\u0027s most likely caused by mod compatibility issues\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
