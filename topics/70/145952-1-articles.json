I installed it into the game data folder for ksp and the files even seem to show as some of the loading files on the first loading screen for the game. But when I am in the game none of the files show up in utility or any of the other files. Any solutions? I\u0027ve tried everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T07:18:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty sure this is an installation issue. Some mods are extremely sensitive to the exact file paths by which their assets can be reached. A common newcomer mistake that screws up these paths is having nested GameData folders. This happens because there is not really a common standard as to how mod downloads are packaged into zip files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor any given zip file you download and open, you can encounter one of three folder structure variants:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.) ActualModFolders \\ Stuff\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.) GameData \\ ActualModFolders \\ Stuff\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.) ModName \\ GameData \\ ActualModFolders \\ Stuff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn all three cases, what you actually need to do is to copy ActualModFolders (plural, as there may be dependencies) over to your GameData folder. In case 1, that\u0027s easy, because it\u0027s the first thing you see. But in case 2, you need to click into the GameData folder in the zip file first (or, merge that one with your GameData folder instead of copying the mods over). And in case 3, you need to click through two folders before you find what you need. Also, at first glance, case 3 often looks indistinguishable from case 1 until you start clicking into the folders to chack what it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you do it wrong in case 2, you end up with something like GameData \\ GameData \\ ModName on your disk.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you do it wrong in case 3, you end up with something like GameData \\ ModName \\ GameData \\ Modname on your disk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth of these cases break the pathing to the mod\u0027s resource and asset files, causing parts not to load when the game starts as they cannot find their models and textures. I\u0027m pretty much 100% sure that this is exactly what is happening to you \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-25T18:32:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2016 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T11:17:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved over to Modded Tech Support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SamBallington","CreatedById":167727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T13:19:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy folder is structured GameData, then BDArmory, then all of the parts and plugins etc. So if you are saying to copy the bdarmory folder into the GameData folder for Ksp, that did not work for me.
