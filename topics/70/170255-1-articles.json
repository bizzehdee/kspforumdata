Stages disappers, RemoteTech loses connection, keyboard stops working and picture degrades to 4-10 FPS. Though, the rocket continues to fly without any thrust but with persistent speed. Due to keyboard shutdow (in game) I am unable to revert the flight, so the only way to stop this mess is process killing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using a lot of mods, so I\u0027m ready to provide any additional information along with the screenshots if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
