I can click one of them and it will zoom to it, but the vessel\u0027s button on the side won\u0027t be inverted like I\u0027ve actually clicked it, and the fly/terminate/recover buttons are still greyed out. Once I\u0027ve \u0027selected\u0027 one ship, I can\u0027t click to change view to any others at all.\n\nI can switch to nearby ships that are in the Kerbin system by launching some random vessel and switching to something else via the map view, but that doesn\u0027t work when I try switching to my Eve ship. I\u0027m using Sandbox mode so this isn\u0027t because I haven\u0027t unlocked something.\n\nPlease help, my crew have been stuck in Eve orbit for over a year now.
