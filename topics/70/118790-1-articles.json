The mods I have installed are ModuleManager, Mechjeb, KER, KAC, USI LS, the outer planets mod and several parts packs (I just say I have parts packs since these don\u0027t really mod the core game in any way, but just add more part files). The OPM seems to be the one causing the problem because I have a separate install with the same mods minus OPM and it works. OPM supports FF and I even saw a folder while trying to get it to work with the additional ribbons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
