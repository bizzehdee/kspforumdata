I\u0027ve encountered strange bug in my career. I\u0027m playing heavy modded (15K\u002B patches in cashe) KSP, but it\u00A0istn\u0027t about mods, because unmodded version encouters the same bug. It\u0027s about current savegame and continous version migration: I\u0027ve started it on\u00A01.2, but the bug appears just on 1.7. New game started on 1.7 is free from this bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the bug itself: after switching a craft using any way, except Control Room, the game locks as if you click on some object and didn\u0027t choose an option. Saves don\u0027t save, menus don\u0027t function. You can do nothing, but control current craft or quickload (the only way to unlock the game back). Technically, the game is playable, but jumping to Control Room every time I want to switch a craft is a bit annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe someone can figure out, what\u0027s wrong in my saves...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://uploadfiles.io/g9ixrds6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://uploadfiles.io/g9ixrds6\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-05-11T23:53:21Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2019 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Gr@y\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
