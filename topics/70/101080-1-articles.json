The first one I made worked fine, then I made a slight change and then it started doing this. Since then, every craft i build does this.\n\nWhat usually happens is I\u0027ll start a flight, go VTOL, take off, and start ascending. It doesnt always happen immediately, but then it\u0027ll randomly freak out. My latest craft would wig out so bad a part would shoot off dozens of KM away causing the craft to spin wildly out of control.\n\nI think it might have to do with parts that I take off, and replace (perhaps to move or adjust them), but it\u0027s like theyre no longer attached to my ship. Sometimes it\u0027ll happen right off the bat, I\u0027ve seen modules fall 90 degree from their attachment and just flop around. Shoring up part\u0027s like these does nothing.\n\nWith the latest ship, I noticed that whatever flew off was still attached to the struts. This is becoming incredibly infuriating since I spent 3-4 hours crafting these ships, and when I went to test them something would just flop around like the part had zero rigidity at all. Almost like it\u0027s not even really attached. (I\u0027ve seen part\u0027s just literally fall off immediately, perhaps held on by a strut) \n\nThe best I can describe this phenomena is that it\u0027s like the part\u0027s are just storing up and gathering energy, then suddenly releasing it all at once causing it to discombobulate with out actually breaking (for some reason).\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nEDIT:\n\nThis is the best i could capture it. The craft isnt broken, but all the part\u0027s will fling out like this then go back together (with this one anyway)\n\n![0NwddmY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/0NwddmY.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-02T07:26:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2015 07:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The DigitalAlchemist**"},{"CreatedByName":"The DigitalAlchemist","CreatedById":133218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T23:27:42Z","Content":"\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jeyZR3Y2iTA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThis is becoming SUCH an issue, I went ahead and captured a video of it. Imagine this happening every 30 seconds, whenever your trying to maneuver, whenever your aligning to a node in space, whenever your trying to go for a sensitive landing.   \n  \nThis appears to happen when I turn. I think it\u0027s just suddenly \u0022jolting\u0022 the ship back to what ever it\u0027s original orientation is. Like the physics didnt turn with it and suddenly they catch up and go \u0022oh no, that was supposed to be here\u0022 and yanks it instantly back into position causing the vessel to get thrown back in that direction. The effect is MUCH more dramatic if i\u0027m only turning using torque since the ship cant \u0022correct\u0022 it\u0027s self nearly as quickly.  \n  \nThe mods on this install are relatively simple, Thrust Controlled Avionics, B9, Kerbal Joint Reinforcement, In Flight Waypoints, Active Texture Management, Crowd Sourced Science, Safe Chute, and TweekScale (which isnt being used on this ship)  \n  \nI really need help with this.

Its a great mod, and I wish I could have it back but there has been funkiness with it. I gave it a spin in .90 and I do periodically and it\u0027s... unpredictable. Even when you don\u0027t use it on a given ship.\n\nKJR just in the nature of how it works (again great mod, I was using it myself up until a little while ago) can cause some funkiness.

At that point it falls straight through the entire map. Attaching struts does nothing.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s not a weight issue. I discovered that I could just go into the files and edit them manually, and I did so reducing the weight of all the parts by 100x (including the thrust output of the engines so they didnt just blow everything apart). Didnt fix anything. First ship i took off with did okay until one of those parts the game just wasnt dealing with whipped off literally 500km... nearly crashed my comp. \n\nDoes any of this sound familiar and is there a way to fix it?"},{"CreatedByName":"The DigitalAlchemist","CreatedById":133218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T09:59:15Z","Content":"A solution has been found!\n\nBig thanks to The Space Man for pointing out one of the issues that\u0027s been really killin me for a while, and blowfish for a (so far!) working solution to the HX parts issue!\n\nIdentical problem was described here, and the solution is posted in the very next post!\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630-0-90-B9-Aerospace-Release-5-2-8-%28updated-30-12-14%29?p=1768531\u0026viewfull=1#post1768531](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630-0-90-B9-Aerospace-Release-5-2-8-%28updated-30-12-14%29?p=1768531\u0026viewfull=1#post1768531)"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tegu","CreatedById":76643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T16:44:09Z","Content":"um, could just be clipped parts clashing with each other.
