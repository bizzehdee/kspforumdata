But when i opened a sandbox where i wanted to experiment with my new rocket parts, and my Proton, Zenit and Dnepr rockets were 100% complete no trouble at all. But When looking at my R-7 parts, i saw that only parts for the soyuz showed up, not for Sputnik, Luna, Vostok and Voshkod. I thought i made a mistake and decided to remove and reinstall the mod, and again, the same thing. So i did it again and again and again... but nothing seemed to work. I saw the parts loading while starting KSP, but they dont show up in the parts list. Does anyone know how to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
