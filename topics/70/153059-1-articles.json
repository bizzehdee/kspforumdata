I truly do not want to cheat it. so i imagined that i can just do 1 piece that replaces all others, not to cheat just to replace and lower the amount of items (each ship has at least 200, and this are like 10 or more ships linked together).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am willing to even sacrifice them and make the place \u0022unmovable\u0022 after this change is done. so my plan was, to make a mod that with just a basic cube do all at the same time, the problem now is, that the pannels do not receive sun and the drillers do not drill . so or what i want cannot be done or i am to new to mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso i did not even started trying but if its so hard to just set the module of a solar pannel the rest that i want to do may be impossible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbut i say never the less may be it inspires someone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is after having all in just one piece, that this piece has basically 0.01, so if you use it like that its not usefull. even so anything that attaches to it, can be set inside (not sure if its posible to do this but, my idea was to scan the \u0022attached ship\u0022 ( or rover or whatever it was, and add the resource needed and generated to it, and make the original disapear, even so to add all the mass to it as well).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neven if this can be done just once and after that cannot change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow i am stuck and can\u0027t play the game, because all my idea was to gather fuel and if cannot go on with that cannot continue. the problem is not that is just slow but its so slow that when i press the escape button it crashes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow, can someone tell me what to do?, do i just edit it to give it \u0022extra powers\u0022 to this station and remove the rest? or should i wait for some mod to solve this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IncongruousGoat","CreatedById":157062,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-06T01:57:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow many mods do you have installed, and on what sort of machine? A good first step would be removing any graphical mods-these tend to have the highest overhead for the least solid effect upon gameplay.

You also might want to consider working on your part count, try to downscale your projects. KSP is very demanding on your PC and since it simulates physics individually for each part, there\u0027s a limit to how fast all these calculations can happen at once, and you get lag. Optimize your designs to be more minimalist, do more with less, etc. Use a big battery instead of two small ones, to give a very basic example.
