It continued gaining speed until impacting the water at about 1700m/s. This was a craft with no engines or tanks, as they\u0027d been staged off on the way up.\n\nAlso, performance was miserable, getting like 5 frames per second.\n\nMac OS X 10.10.3\n\n3.4ghz i7-3770, 8GB\n\nGTX 675MX 1GB\n\nRemoved FAR and DRE, performance back to normal."},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T02:20:33Z","Content":"Moved from the FAR thread.
