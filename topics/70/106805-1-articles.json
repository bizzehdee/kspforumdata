IIRC, there is an exclusion list .cfg for ATM that has Kerbinside listed... Check either the Kerbinside thread, or the ATM thread... (I\u0027m pretty sure its in the Kerbinside thread, tho)\n\nEDIT: Actually, it looks like the ATM exclusion .cfg you need is listed in the OP of the KerbalKonstructs thread.
