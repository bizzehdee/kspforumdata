The game is known for completely shutting down once it\u0027s memory requirements cant be met. I suggest you run a clean install of KSP without any mods and see if it still crashes randomly. If it doesn\u0027t, then one of your mods is either A)Broken and needs an update B)Incompatible with another mod or C)No longer supported and causing unforeseen issues.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf your KSP is still crashing without any mods installed, the next step is to check your drivers.

And it never hurts to check.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe very last thing you can check is your hardware.
