Or I think it is a bug.\n\nWhen accepting contracts it is a good thing that the parts list (this one is stock) highlights a part so I can pick it without have to extensive search for it.\n\nBut sometimes it is not make it highlighted even with stock parts like the hichhikers bay.\n\n I don\u0027t know if it is some programmable logic (like if you don\u0027t already researched the part) or is it related to a mod or maybe missconfig on my end. But it is just a minor thing.\n\nI think I\u0027we got all the mods so I don\u0027t bother to list them up. If you heard of a mod I surely have it. Excluding hangar extensions and editor extensions related ones. I use the stock on that part...\n\nAll info maybe a workaround is more than wellcome.\n\nThank you in advance"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T13:29:54Z","Content":"The blue highlighted parts are \u0022experimental\u0022 parts, that is, parts which you have not unlocked yet but have available for a part test contract.
