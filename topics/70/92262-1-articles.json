Total 73 tons. The goal of this thing is to land it on the mun, drop my science rover from the skycrane and right it using a winch (it lands flat on the rear end, by design). Then I decouple my \u0022mini\u0022 driller from the top of the skycrane and land it nearby to commence work. At least that\u0027s the plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like carrying lots of RCS fuel. 1,900 monoprop from all my tanks total. I have a 750 tank that\u0027s on the transfer stage that gives me RCS during upper atmosphere and maneuvers. I then enable a 750 tank on the driller, \u0026amp; 100 tank on each decent engine (4 total for 400 monoprop) and use that for righting my ship while doing my approach and landing. TWICE now once I get close, suddenly RCS refuses to work and I have a huge mad dash to make sure all my monoprop tanks are enabled (all are except the 2 on the rover), and my power is good (6- 1x6 solar panels deployed as well as 4 RTGs). Both attempts resulted in my lander crashing and burning. Panic on the tip caused me to full throttle with little fuel I had left, but no RCS so I crashed at 15m/sec and started tumbling. This last one made me rage-quit. I was SO close to my base, and the landing would have been impeccable if the ship didn\u0027t tip over due to a little horizontal velocity. RCS would have saved the landing (both landings actually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I had plenty of electrical charge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* I had plenty of monoprop (400\u002B).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Nothing blew up on touchdown (3 m/sec) landing speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* NONE of the RCS thrusters was working.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Turned off RCS then back on (R key).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrashes like this makes me want to get \u0026amp; use mechjeb, but I like trying to land my creations.
