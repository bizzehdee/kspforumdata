You can try converting some of your mod textures to .dds files if you haven\u0027t already (quick Google should provide info on how to do that/the benefits of doing so). Be sure to continue disabling temp gauges. \n\nOther than that... yeah, out of memory, no magic way around it. I recently returned to KSP after 1.0 and I feel like there\u0027s a lot less room for modding purposes now."},{"CreatedByName":"Dortmunder","CreatedById":66018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T05:53:03Z","Content":"Yeah, just installed a bunch of mods, and they all looked up to date.\n\nHad been playing stock a little here and there, figured it might be a memory thing since I have high res textures added now. I used to run 64 bit and never seemed to have that problem then. Hopefully they will get a perfected 64 bit version soon since this game seems to suffer from memory issues ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nThanks guys."},{"CreatedByName":"Sli 41","CreatedById":129508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T13:49:24Z","Content":"I have a just few mods installed, I had to be very selective with the graphical ones, even then and with active texture management I eventually end up crashing a lot. I\u0027ve been keeping an eye on the the RAM usage and it just keeps going up and up until a scene change crashes the game. Pre 1.0 was A LOT more stable for me. Sadly with the lack of 64 bit it feels like modding the game is becoming impossible."}]}
