Is there a mod or any patch or simple fix I can get to make me slow down quicker. By the way for orbital flight if you\u0027re wondering why I can\u0027t just do a shallow re-entry I\u0027m using retro rocket cuz it is Gemini and Mercury and similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReproduce: Build a suborbital rocket with something like a Mercury or Mk1 Capsule and re-enter from a suborbital trajectory on KSRSS 2.5X\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have any mods that should affect this as I\u0027ve used all my mods except Less Real Than Realism in the stock system and they haven\u0027t prevented me slowing down so I am confusion\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-01-09T10:36:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/09/2022 10:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 9, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by tinyspy44\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EForgot to include some stuff\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
