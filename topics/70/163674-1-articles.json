Also version of KSP and version of BDA you are trying to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 However try this first, load game go to bda category, switch to search by mass, and the weapon manger, if you have only BDA installed will be two or three items from the top.\u00A0 If it\u0027s not there exit game and supply the items requested.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo note that ALL weapons require that a weapon manager module be present on the craft . Only one weapon manger is required per craft, do not fit more than one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
