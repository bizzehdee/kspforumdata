I have the\u00A0interstellar fuel switch mod downloaded which i am thinking is the problem. this is because during startup of KSP, windows popped up saying that the mod needs to be updated. the annoying thing was i had already updated it from spaceport. So i decided to delete interstellar fuel switch by search it in the Squad game data folder. i deleted the file and then about three other items that were white. i don\u0027t know if it even relates or the \u00A0whole thing is just a minor bug. Any help is extremely appreciated as i love the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-29T11:50:08Z\u0022 title=\u002206/29/2016 11:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Rolster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
