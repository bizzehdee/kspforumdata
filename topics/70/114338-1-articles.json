I had someone look at it who works with computers for a living and he noticed that it\u0027s a pretty severe bug but I don\u0027t know what it is or how to fix it. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAlso if anyone can tell me where I might be able to find the crash logs that would also be greatly appreciated because as far as I know, Squad removed that folder, either that or I\u0027m looking in the wrong places."},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T08:59:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also if anyone can tell me where I might be able to find the crash logs that would also be greatly appreciated because as far as I know, Squad removed that folder, either that or I\u0027m looking in the wrong places.\n\nYou are looking KSP.log in the main folder."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T09:31:46Z","Content":"No, you\u0027re looking for \u0022~/.config/unity3d/Squad/Kerbal Space Program/Player.log\u0022\n\nKSP.log *might* be useful, but it\u0027s incomplete re Player.log.\n\nLook [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92230-!!!-PLEASE-READ-BEFORE-POSTING-!!!-Stock-Support-Bug-Reporting-Guide) for generic bug reporting instructions and file locations.\n\nIf it\u0027s native code crashing, you\u0027ll see it in STDOUT/STDERR when run from a terminal.\n\nIf this is the case, [get a backtrace](https://wiki.debian.org/HowToGetABacktrace), but note that there\u0027s a limit to what we humble users can do with it as Unity doesn\u0027t come with debug symbols (and recompiling mono for the same is a little painful).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T09:50:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 09:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"}]}
