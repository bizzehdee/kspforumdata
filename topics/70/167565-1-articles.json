However, it would always crash the game. So, i went in KSP/GameData and removed EVERYTHING that isn\u0027t \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and deleted modulemanager.cfg (four files) so it can rebuild it. And when i thought it worked (I thought it worked since it loaded everything), (surprise, surprise) my game got stuck on the \u0022loading\u0022 screen with the planets orbiting, so I know its not lagging or frozing. And i wouldn\u0027t ussualy make a discussion about it, but i released that there is no other solution. I know exactly what the problem is; my computer is too slow for KSP, so it can\u0027t be loaded. So I\u0027m not asking why or how this happened, I\u0027m asking for a solution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd BTW, my computer specs are tiny and are below minimum for KSP:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCPU: AMD Athlon 2 II 240\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRAM: 2 GB, DDR 2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGPU: ATI Radeon HD 3400 Series\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n32 bit OS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to know, but no rush :).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-15T15:34:30Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2017 03:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by UnfortuneLess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jas0n","CreatedById":57441,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-16T05:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, it sounds like you installed it wrong.
