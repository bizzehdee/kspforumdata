The physics isnt right, isnt it? What happened!!??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alpha188","CreatedById":145723,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T16:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK,\u00A0even if a vessel\u00A0has the PE inside of the atmosphere it won\u0027t aerobrake unless it\u0027s in the physics range of another vessel or it\u0027s the focused vessel. So, if you are further away than 22.5 km from the vessel, it won\u0027t aerobrake and his orbit will be on-rails.
