I\u0027m new to mods in KSP and especially HyperEdit. I just downloaded it, and I kinda broke my entire game and I don\u0027t know how to fix it. I made it so kerbin is pretty much inside of the sun, and now whenever I spawn anything it just enters space because it is where kerbin\u00A0should be, but its not there. I don\u0027t know how to fix it though, so if anyone could help, that would be great!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m dumb, just figured it out.
