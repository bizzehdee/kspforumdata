I don\u0027t know enough about how planets are composed and rendered at the moment to know what routes to investigate."},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T12:54:37Z","Content":"My thought is it has something to do with how shaders are applied, possibly by Unity itself.\n\nI have a feeling it\u0027s a common reason as to why shadows in the SPH are messed up and your ship turns purple when transsonic and heating effects are applied. It probably has something to do with a shader or texture that is applied to Minmus when you get close enough for it to go into a higher detail mode.\n\nThis is all speculation based on my observations mucking around with dx11 mode. I really don\u0027t know."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-22T13:03:03Z","Content":"Use -force-d3d11-no-singlethreaded instead.

I would imagine that\u0027s 800km from Minmus ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) and yeah I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s also the shader ( read: material ) but I don\u0027t know what options there are to change that, if any.
