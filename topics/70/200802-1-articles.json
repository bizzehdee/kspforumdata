Fuels like Hydrogen can\u0027t be stored on fueltanks for too much time, they just boil up and leak into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChoosing the right fuel for the mission (what limits the engines you can use on the mission) is the reason Real Fuels were made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRule of thumb: Cryogenics (chilled kerosene, LOX, etc) are excellent for first and second stages. Once you establish a parking orbit and start to plan the rest of the mission, it\u0027s best to rely on non-cryogenics fuels: kerolox, hypergolic, nuclear, ion, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you really don\u0027t want to cope with these details, you can try removing Real Fuels from the system. It will probably screw up any vessels already launched, however - make backups while experimenting things.

There are a few ways to prevent\u00A0this- insulate your tanks with MLI (I\u2019m not sure which mod adds that, might be RealFuels but might be something else in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E), add active radiators to cool the tanks, or use fuels that don\u2019t need to be kept cold such as hypergolics; the downside to hypergolics is that their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E is lower and they\u2019re generally heavier than Kerouac, never mind hydrolox.
