Before switching though I noticed a left click issue developing: When I\u0027m controlling one vessel, and try to click on another in the map view to either target it or switch to it, often times the menu giving those options doesn\u0027t appear. Switching to 32-bit solved the right click issue, but not this left click issue; I still can\u0027t target or switch from ship to ship. The kerbal gods picked an interesting time to prevent ship switching too; I have a 3 ship fleet enroute to duna, so there will need to be some targetting done for rendezvous once I get there, or I\u0027ll need to improve my piloting skills dramatically \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running windows vista and the only mod I have is the latest MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-03T06:26:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen that too.
