TS level 2 shows you patched conics and I think it also allows you to target planets and moons, so setting up a transfer should be easier. Sandbox games have everything at level 3 but career will start at level 1, which may explain why you\u0027re having some trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to do it the old fashioned way, in stock KSP one \u0027month\u0027 is 4 Kerbin days and a typical transfer out to the Mun takes 1 day. By the application of \u0022sums\u0022\u003Csup\u003ETM\u00A0\u003C/sup\u003Eyou\u0027ll need to time your transfer burn exactly 90 degrees in front of the Mun; or, to put it another way, if you\u0027re pointing prograde and the Mun is directly in front of you, BURN! Just try not to crash straight into it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb has a maneuver planner feature that can automatically set up Hohmann transfers, although it will set up the transfer to travel straight to the Mun and crash into it- you\u0027ll need to tweak the burn slightly to avoid that. It will also execute the burn for you if you want. Useful, yes; cheating? Possibly, but that\u0027s what computers are made for! Alternatively, the Astrogator mod can also set up transfers to moons in the same planet\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and other planets orbiting the Sun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
