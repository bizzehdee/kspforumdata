I can almost believe the opened cargo bay hatch could collide in some weird way with the location of a Kerbal coming out of the cockpit, but when it\u0027s closed it\u0027s exactly like any other Mk2 part...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try building a plane with a fuel tank behind the cockpit to see if that works, and report back...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor reference, my latest log is at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSsHA-YBVwSMZaMLhDekbi_odBWnFd_4/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSsHA-YBVwSMZaMLhDekbi_odBWnFd_4/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOH!
