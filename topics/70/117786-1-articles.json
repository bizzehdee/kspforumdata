I\u0027ve tried removing mods that it hangs on, but it just hangs on another random mod. I am using the 64 bit client on Linux Mint 17.1. I have the full list of mods installed linked in my signature (it\u0027s the blue flag).\n\nAll of my mods are up to date as far as possible (I\u0027ve let out some like AIES because i\u0027m not sure it will break crafts files.).\n\nI don\u0027t know if this is a stock bug or if it\u0027s cause by a mod. I don\u0027t even know if there\u0027s a way I can fix it! ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nAny and all help is appreciated.\n\nEDIT: [Here\u0027s my KSP.log](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4nQFK0Xs-OcWjlUVHFvTUwtTEk/view?usp=sharing).
