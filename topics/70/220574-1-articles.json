I launched other rockets without any problem, but this one just doesn\u0027t want to work.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s nothing fancy, very simple actually: Some procedural avionics, Modular tanks,\u00A0 etc etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen the app crashes i get a SIGABRT call on a different thread everytime it happens, and I don\u0027t really know how to troubleshoot that (I\u0027m not THAT good with this stuff).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also noticed that when simulating the same craft\u00A0 3 or 4 times in Test Flight Mode,\u00A0 I get a strange overheating bug: my craft overheats and explodes way outside of the atmosphere\u0027s thinnest layers (80-90km)\u00A0 or in atmosphere but at speeds much lower than needed to overheat something until the point of blowing it up (1700/2300 m/s), and then the craft becomes useless and if I try to roll it out the crash bug happens again. And if I try to use cheat menu to ignore max temp and try for example to start an experiment, the game detects the craft as moving on surface and everything gets max overheating, as If i was going 7000 m/s 30 feet from the ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny ideas about where to start to troubleshoot something like this?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you need logs can you please tell me where to find \u0027em?
