I landed ok, but when it came time to find the Kerbals a strange bug kept happening. The Kerbals would appear as target signatures, but once I got within 250 m of them they would fall \u0022through\u0022 the ground for about 300 m before stopping accompanied by a \u0022splashdown\u0022 sound effect. Tried going to tracking station then back to my jet, doing so would reset the ones that had fallen through but they would do it again the moment I got close to them, either taxiing or on EVA.\n\nThese are my installed mods: \n\nKSP: 1.0.4 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\n\nBetter Science Labs Continued - 0.1.2\n\nChuteSafetyIndicator - 1.0.1\n\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.4.4\n\nContract Configurator - 1.6.3\n\nContract Pack: Anomaly Surveyor - 1.3\n\nContract Pack: Base Construction - 0.2.1\n\nCC-CP-SCANSat - 0.5.2.1\n\nContract Pack: Field Research - 1.0.6\n\nContract Pack: Initial Contracts - 1.0.4\n\nContract Pack: Kerbal Space Station - 2.1.2\n\nContract Pack: RemoteTech - 2.0\n\nContract Pack: Grand Tours - 0.1.7\n\nContract Pack: Unmanned Contracts - 0.3.10\n\nContract Pack: Tourism Plus - 1.1.8\n\nDocking Sounds - 1.2\n\nDSD Mobile Labs - 1.0\n\nEditor Extensions - 2.12\n\nAGroupOnStage - 2.0.11\n\nRasterPropMonitor - 0.21.2\n\nKerbal Attachment System - 0.5.4\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.18\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.1.4\n\nKerboKatzUtilities - 1.2.9\n\nCraftHistory - 1.4.3\n\nKerbalScienceExchange - 1.1.1\n\nKerbal Inventory System - 1.2.1\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\n\nLaunchCountDown - 1.7.5.86\n\nKerbal Konstructs - 0.9.1\n\nModularFlightIntegrator - 1.1.1\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator - 6.2\n\nEVAHandrailsPackContinued - 0.2\n\nFinal Frontier - 0.8.6.1370\n\nPartCommander - 1.0.2.4\n\nPilot Assistant - 1.11.6\n\nRemoteTech - 1.6.7\n\nSCANsat - 1.1.4.1\n\nSpaceTux: Shared Assets - 0.3.6\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.4\n\nAlternate Resource Panel - 2.7.2\n\nTweakScale - 2.2.1\n\nWaypoint Manager - 2.4.2\n\nI\u0027m going to hazard a guess that part of this comes from the fact I have the 64-bit version (I think) but otherwise don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"Auriga_Nexus","CreatedById":149320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T21:33:08Z","Content":"Still does this even with 32-bit.
