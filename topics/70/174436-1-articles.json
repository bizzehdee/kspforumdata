Are there any specific categories or types of mods that are generally safe to add to a persistent save, or any types that are more often dangerous to add to a current save? I have a 1.4.1 modded career going and I want to browse the mod release pages and add anything that catches my eye as it gets updated to 1.4.x. On a similar note, is it mostly okay to have mods optimized for 1.4.2 or 1.4.3 with a 1.4.1 install, or even the other way around, with mods meant for 1.4.1 installed in a 1.4.3 save?
