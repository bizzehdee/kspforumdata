Your dishes are useful \u003Cem\u003Eas\u003C/em\u003E dishes because of their incredibly long range -- in your case, to Duna.

Make each network, individually, all-passive, with omnidirectional antennae, so that all you need to use that network is to be in range, with no dish targeting. Design a way to make those networks talk to each other with dishes. That would obviously entail placing dishes and omnis on the same satellites, of course, but don\u0027t target your dishes on anything within the same network (if you can maintain a reliable and stable connection passively, of course. if you must use a targeted dish, for example between dishes in your Edge-Kerbin-SOI network, then fine.) For example, your LKO satellites might have one dish targeted to the Mun, one to Minmus, one to your Edge-of-SOI, and one to \u0022active vessel\u0022 as a safety measure. And one unused. Make sure you populate the LKO orbit with enough that you have universal coverage with omnis. Mun network: each has a dish pointed toward LKO, and one to active vessel.

I know that seems overkillish, and you can shut down unused dishes to conserve power if need be, and if you\u0027re sending a probe to Duna, I always try to graveyard them into a sort of vanguard network at the destination once they\u0027re science-exhausted. A properly delivered and implemented Low-Duna network would be needed, as well as an Ike network, and an Edge-Duna network, and delivering those networks will be easier if you have even one still-transmitting probe already in orbit, or hell, even landed if it\u0027s intact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, I\u0027m still willing to look at your savefile and .craft file.

What exactly do you mean by that?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used SelectRoot to make sure the probe core was the root part for both crafts (by the way, how did I even get by without SelectRoot? It is THE essential mod, above all).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy savefile would be kinda useless at the moment, since you\u0027d need an insane list of mods to even load it (one of them isn\u0027t even released yet, since it\u0027s the next version of my stuff and it\u0027s not even up for download atm).
