This led to me eventually adjusting the minimum pressure to \u0022.01\u0022 as I had staged the chutes, the staging icon indicated it was safe, and the chutes did not deploy until immediately after I adjusted the pressure. After landing and reverting to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I tried to adjust the min press to .01 and it bottomed out at .02.\u00A0 I launched the lander and while on the pad, I was able to adjust the min press down to \u0022.01\u0022 again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t\u00A0 know if its a feature or a bug.
