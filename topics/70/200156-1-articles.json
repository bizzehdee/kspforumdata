When it got in orbit the HG-5 antenna on it was broke. So I sent up another ship to rendezvous with it. I got my engineer out with tools and repaired it. After I repaired it, the antenna looked glitchy with two antenna\u0027s to it. So I got out again on a EVA and decided to remove it and place it. I placed it once and it was OK. Then I took it off and replaced it somewhere else and this time it caused an explosion and half the ship blew apart from some sort of glitch. It looked like I was no where near another part sticking out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone heard of this problem? If so do I have to be really careful placing thing?
