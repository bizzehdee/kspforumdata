I\u0027m using Win10, Newest KSP version and i have around 10 mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt starts when i load the game, taking up around 4 gigabytes, then when i try to load a save or something, that number increases to around 6, then it slowly makes it way to 8 or 9 gigabytes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll of those go away when i close the game, but it stills makes my pc slow until it starts filling up to the last gigabyte. The most intense one i had made me have 30mb left on storage.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have tried uninstalling all mods, but it still happens.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf anything else is needed to help me out, just tell me and i\u0027ll try to get it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RealKerbal3x","CreatedById":183830,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-10-21T14:31:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206997-cardzlol/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206997\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/206997-cardzlol/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@CardZLol\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0How much memory (RAM) does your computer have, and how much storage space?
