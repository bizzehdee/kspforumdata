Has occurred twice. I\u0027ve been unable to get the bug to repeat itself intentionally.\n\nBoth times were similar circumstances (CAREER MODE):\n\n1) Basic Radial Engine Mount and attached engine both resized using tweaks, raidal symmetry 6 on first\n\n vessel and 3 on second vessel\n\n2) Staging disabled with tweaks (didn\u0027t need decoupler function)\n\n3) suborbital on Mun and Minmus, close to landing.\n\n4) Game freezes, once it didn\u0027t recover and I forced closed, other time it came back after a few seconds.\n\n5) reload (2nd instance was just a reload of quicksave using F9, 1st was reboot)\n\n6) Vessel immediately decouples the radial engine mounts, Killing Bob kerman, 1000\u002Bscience, and my\n\n dreams.\n\nAlthough I can\u0027t repeat the bug intentionally, I have backup of the 2nd instance\u0027s quicksave. It continues to do it under all circumstances. I\u0027ve even tried editing the save and part files, removing the decouple module all together, and changing staging to last stage in case it was issue with disabling staging.\n\nInstalled Mods: \n\nAtomic Age 2.0\n\nDMagic Orbital Science 1.0.3\n\nDocking Port Alignment 6.2\n\nEngine Lighting 1.2\n\nKAS 0.5.1\n\nKerbal Engineer 1.0.16.6\n\nKIS 1.1.4\n\nKW rocketry 2.7\n\nMagic Smoke Infernal Robotics 0.12.2\n\nModular Rocket System 1.6.5\n\n\\*\\* Radial Engine Mounts by PanaTee-Parts-International \\*\\* (parts in question)\n\nRealChute 1.3.2.3\n\nStage Recovery 1.5.6\n\nTweakable Everything 1.11.4\n\nTweak Scale 2.1\n\nDropBox links:\n\n[Output log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ocyg82zhqr5jqmq/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\n[quicksave](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bi53yzutqfdwe8q/quicksave%20-%20Copy.sfs?dl=0)\n\nAny help would be appreciated. I\u0027d really like to save this ship as this is career mode and I spent a lot of time collecting science from all biomes on Minmus. Even just a workaround so I can edit the quicksave and save my ship would be nice. I\u0027ll just use old school manual radial mounts next time. Thanks a bunch"}]}
