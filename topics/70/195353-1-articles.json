I then updated to 1.10 with the outdated mods. I had been playing career for a few days without any problem but then my game crashed and when I restarted Commnet didn\u0027t work anymore as all my probes didn\u0027t have a signal but they used to. And now i have just found out that some of my vessels, 2 medium sized space stations, won\u0027t even let me switch to them through the tracking station. Every time I try I get put in an endless loading screen and when I launched a manned vessel to rendezvous with the station I could kind of see it but my game went down to 1FPS. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the mods to see what would work as well as uninstalling the game. Nothing worked. Commnet is enabled, I do have electric charge and no the tracking station isn\u0027t damaged. Any solution or idea would be appreciated. If there isn\u0027t a solution to the commnet problem then I hope there\u0027s one to fix my stations not loading.
