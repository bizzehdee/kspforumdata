The game isn\u2019t stuck at BG, it\u2019s stuck after that point- verifying breaking ground is the last thing it did before something went wrong, usually during code compilation because an exception was thrown. The logs will show what\u2019s responsible, but to make things easier you should also include your version of KSP and a list of mods. Check that all your mods are compatible with that version of KSP, as old mods often cause issues in new versions of KSP and vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anth","CreatedById":161238,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-16T12:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210676-coolaidthx/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022210676\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/210676-coolaidthx/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@coolaidthx\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0This could be the following bug:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/24391\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBug #24391: DLC Fails to Load With Certain Character Combinations in File Path - Kerbal Space Program - Squad Bugtracker\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMy Recommendation:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the game is installed to something similar to D:\\KSP Installs\\1.8.1\u002BMH\u002BBG\\ remove any symbols from the path (e.g\u00A0D:\\KSP Installs\\1.8.1MHBG\\)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf its installed using Steam or similar,\u00A0copy the folder and back it up.
