For whatever reason, the science lab is somehow attached to the N and S parts of the station, which themselves are somehow not attached to the central hub. I\u0027ve tried changing the root to a dozen different configurations, but nothing has worked. I also tried changing the root and deleting the science lab, but then the central hub\u0027s attachment nodes disappear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe central hub was the first part that I placed, and I built outwards, so I\u0027m not sure how this could\u0027ve happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Wy1cR/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
