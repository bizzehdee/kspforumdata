I have a heavily modded KSP 1.7.0 OPM install, which I have using to complete a Jool-5 Mission. The problem is, after updating to 1.7, I am not able to swap/select/remove crew from vessels in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E. I was making a crew recovery vessel and two kerbonauts snuck onboard, so when I reverted to remove them, upon pressing the crew tab, the game kinda softlocks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the buttons grey out on the left side. I am unable to swap crew, change action groups or add any part. I am able to swap facilities, but the problem persists. The right side is mostly unaffected - I am able to create a new vessel (although I cannot add anything), open a saved vessel, launch or exit. But sometimes, this goes as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuicksaving and quickloading, or a hard reset don\u0027t help. I have confirmed this isn\u0027t stock beahviour.\u00A0I\u0027m currently stopped work on that install (I launched the vessel i needed to complete the mission by removing the crew on the launchpad and recovering them), but since I have such a large modlist (for me atleast), I don\u0027t know where to start with finding which mod works. Furthermore, the mod loading times are rather big, so repeatedly testing which mods or mods combinations cause this would a huge hassle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI post this in order to find whether other users are also experiencing this, or whether anyone can give any insight on which mods to test.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/5om5dat\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/5om5dat\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a picture\u00A0of my Game Data folder, incase you want to check for any mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.
