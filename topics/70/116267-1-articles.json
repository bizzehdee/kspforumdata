I was running some tests to see if an NRE problem was resolved from one of the mods I use, and I discovered what seems to be excessive \u0027errors\u0027(?) ... and I\u0027m wondering if they are indeed \u0022errors\u0022.\n\n**Mods installed:** \n\n Clamp-O-Tron\\_APAS-1.0, \n\n FreeEVA-0.5.2, \n\n Hullcam\\_VDS-0.40, \n\n SCANsat-v14.1, \n\n StockBugFixModules.v1.0.4a.1, \n\n x-science-v4.6\n\n**Reproduction steps:**\n\n A test I did was to start KSP, load my saved Science game - which then opens the KSC overview, switch to the Tracking Station, switch back to the KSC overview, switch to the VAB, switch back to the KSC overview, and then exit the game. No other actions were performed other than switching to the screens mentioned.\n\nLog file entries I\u0027m questioning:\n\nThere are dozens of entries of this form -\n\n    Serialization depth limit exceeded at \u0027ThermalLink\u0027.

Long read, and a bit out of my scope being I\u0027ve no experience with Unity ... however, it seems to me that it\u0027s \u0027not a problem but a warning\u0027 that actually is \u0027a problem\u0027. Some of what I read indicates it can lead to a crash, which I\u0027ve experienced but I\u0027m not sure if it was attributed to that specifically. No question the indication of what I read says it\u0027s a performance hit, especially when hundreds of such \u0027warnings\u0027 are issued and written to log. In either case, it doesn\u0027t bode well with most reporting in that thread. A solution is given, but it will be up to Squad to enact the fix.\n\nThere will be no immediate resolution to this one; Thread marked as solved."}]}
