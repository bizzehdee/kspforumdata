Before 1.9.x my KSP also would crash when it got to the Squad folder in GameData unless I was running 1.5.1 or lower. I don\u0027t know if this has anything to do with it though. Anyway when KSP is loading and it reaches the end is where it gets stuck at \u0022Loading Expansions.\u0022 I have no idea why this is even here in the first place as I have not bought any expansions. It never moves on from there so right now, the game is unplayable for me. Hope somebody has the solution to this as I have been trying to figure this out myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-09T17:34:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2020 05:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by wumbo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-10T07:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck the logs.
