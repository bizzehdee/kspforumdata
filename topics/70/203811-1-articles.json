Going into and out of time warp doesn\u0027t fix it, and both mechjeb and remotetech\u0027s controls are helpless against it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve searched for solutions and found nothing that works. Yes I\u0027ve checked for part collision.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the weird thing: it only happens on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change. A given craft will be fine, but every time I change \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E it is a crapshoot as to whether or not the craft will be controllable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometimes switching back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and back to the craft fixes it, sometimes not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running 1.8.1. It\u0027s the same install I had a few years ago, with no changes or updates (because some of the mods I like haven\u0027t been updated).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can post mod lists and other stuff if needed, but at least initially this is a general question:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anybody found a solution to the spinning problem? I can find few references to it being actually solved, and the solutions I\u0027ve found are either not apropos or don\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
