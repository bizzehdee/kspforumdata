I\u0027m having a problem which is ABSOLUTELY MY FAULT, but *maybe* there is some way to fix it. I looked for it in the forums and tried a couple of things, but I didn\u0027t find the same exact error. I don\u0027t think there are many players as dumb as me.\n\nWhen 1.0 was released, I wanted to start a new game and uninstalled unnecesary mods to play a fresh and vanilla version of the game. I accidentally uninstalled KW Rocketry and then tried to play my old Sandbox Save (which included a lot of KW-made ships). Don\u0027t ask about that. The game showed some kind of \u0022This vessel has some parts which are not installed\u0022 error warning. Since that, I can\u0027t fly any of my ships, even though I immediately re-installed KW Rocketry.\n\nI understand that the game probably overwrote my persistent.sfs file and disabled, at least, all the vessels with parts that no longer existed. I also know it was a EXTREMELY STUPID move, but I made a mistake and accidentally lost 300\u002B hours of fun and achievements.\n\nI\u0027m currently playing in my new save, no it\u0027s not a big deal, but I would love to recover my save. Is there any fix for this kind of situation?\n\nThank you very much in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"ShuFF","CreatedById":118083,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T15:06:37Z","Content":"Really?
