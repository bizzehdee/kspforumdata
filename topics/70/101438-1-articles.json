This problem occurs in the VAB, SPH, and with launched vehicles.\n\n**Mods installed:**\n\nScience Revisited Revisited 1.0.0\n\nModule Manager 2.5.10\n\n*either of the following and associated required mods*:\n\nHabitat Pack 0.4\n\nUSI Kolonization Systems (MKS/OKS) 0.22.8\n\n**Reproduction:**\n\nPlace the rotating habitation ring from either mod. Right-click on it. Placing any other part on the ring and right-clicking on it BEFORE right-clicking on the ring will highlight the problem.\n\nI suspect that the lab rebalance might be the main issue because when I removed Lab\\_Rebalance.cfg (which calls both parts effected and only those parts) the problem disappeared.\n\n**Log:**\n\nThis [output_log](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wjhsvzd3ue0njdu/rotatin_hab_ring_bug_output_log.txt?dl=0) is using Habitat Pack due to fewer dependencies, but I can provide a second log for Kolonization on request."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T13:52:46Z","Content":"There it is:\n\n    NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object  at ModuleScienceLab.updateModuleUI () [0x00000] in :0   at ModuleScienceLab.onPartActionUI (.Part p) [0x00000] in :0   at EventData\u00601[Part].Fire (.Part data) [0x00000] in :0   at UIPartActionWindow.CreatePartList () [0x00000] in :0   at UIPartActionWindow.Setup (.Part part, DisplayType type, UI_Scene scene) [0x00000] in :0   at UIPartActionController.CreatePartUI (.Part part, DisplayType type, UI_Scene scene) [0x00000] in :0   at UIPartActionController.SelectPart (.Part part, Boolean allowMultiple) [0x00000] in :0   at UIPartActionController.HandleMouseClick (UnityEngine.Camera cam, Boolean allowMultiple) [0x00000] in :0   at UIPartActionController\u002B.MoveNext () [0x00000] in :0 [FONT=Verdana]\n\nThat\u0027s the stock science lab, so my guess is that containerModuleIndex is set incorrectly?"},{"CreatedByName":"Padrone","CreatedById":132505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T03:56:02Z","Content":"I had a similar issue, in that my Habitat Rings would not present the right click menu in the hanger.\n\nCommenting out the second item of the \u0022Lab\\_Rebalance.cfg\u0022 (the @PART[OKS\\_HabRing] part) brought it back.
