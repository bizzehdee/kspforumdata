I have stock planets and no physics-changing mods like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E. I have the strangest bug that occurs both in flight and in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E: Sometimes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E tools assume that the mass of the entire stage is different from what it actually is (usually double). I figured out the root of the problem is to do with mass because \u0022starting mass\u0022 is the thing that is obviously incorrect and it leads to incorrect \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E calculations while Isp behaves as expected.\u00A0I think the mass value is the issue because when the bug occurs in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I can clearly see that the engineering report vessel mass and the first stage burn\u0027s starting mass are different (usually doubled). I am 99% sure it is only the displayed numbers that are wrong and the actual numbers are alright because I can take off with \u00220.6\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and reach \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E with \u00222000\u0022 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0In \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, removing and re-adding all the non-root parts fixes the issue by refreshing the calculation and in flight, reverting to launch sometimes corrects the issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI verify the game files frequently and there tends to be more than a few to reinstall each time, but even right after that the bug can occur. I think I\u0027ll install Kerbal Engineering Redux to compare values and maybe ignore stock calculations entirely but I wanted to post about this bug here too because I cannot believe no one has come across it before.
