Due to heat flux and the considerable higher thermal mass of the capsula the heat was slowly transferred to the probe core reaching its overheating temperature which in return lead to overheating in higher orbits.\n\nSo check your temperatures on your craft ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nBut the game is really missing some kind of extra information for this kind of explosions.
