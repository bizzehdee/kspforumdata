I\u0027m running over 100 mods on my current main install. Now, when switching between a flight scene and the editor, or from a flight scene or the tracking station to the main menu, there is a MIDI version of Elvis\u0027 \u0022Don\u0027t Be Cruel\u0022 playing in the background. It\u0027s driving me nuts, and I can\u0027t find the music file or figure out which mod may be causing it.
