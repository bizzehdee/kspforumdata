I know it\u0027s hot there... but even with parts that are labeled to\u00A0 be 2000Kelvin heat-resistant, this happens. I have put a thermometer to the vessel and this reads out around 750K on the sunny side of mercury and 25K on the dark side. So these are values I would have expected, but why do my parts with 1024K and 2000K heat-tolerance explode anyway? Radiators do not seem to help here. Also putting everything into a fairing (for sun protection) has no effect on the overheating. Am I missing something or is this simply a bug?
