It flew just fine, but after refueling at Minmus, when I activated MJ2 to execute a node, once it lined up on the target marker, it started to \u0027shudder\u0027 ... not enough to leave the target, but there\u0027s constant input to the roll/yaw axis\u0027 back and forth. Visually, it looks like a chihuahua that\u0027s not been let out in too long. There\u0027s just the one tank (the long adapter), so the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECoT\u003C/abbr\u003E shouldn\u0027t have changed. I have autostruts enabled (heaviest part) but like I said, that was how I built it and it launched and travelled out to Minmus, docked and rendezvoused with a couple of different ships, before re-fueling, and it flew perfectly normally. And when\u00A0\u00A0I line it up manually on the target and execute, there\u0027s no shuddering involved. So it definitely seems to have something to do with MJ2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone else see this, or have an idea of what might be the cause/fix?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-06T08:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMechJeb can be twitchy sometimes, it seems to depend on how fast the game is running as it can end up overcorrecting itself from one extreme to the other.

Changing the physics delta in the main menu will affect this as it affects how much time can be in each tick- a bigger number will tend to make the game run slightly better with large or high part count vessels, but will also increase the likelihood of getting this behaviour from MechJeb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally speaking the physics ticks will correspond to your game\u2019s frame rate so if the game seems to be stuttering it\u2019s probably because the physics engine is struggling to keep up. The time displayed in the top left will also change from green to yellow and then red if the frame rate (and by extension the physics processing speed) drops. Increasing physics warp makes this worse as you\u2019re trying to cram 2-4 times\u00A0as much game time into the same number of physics ticks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough I can\u2019t say any of that for certain, so take everything I just said with a pinch of salt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223936832\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200804\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221615045915\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022107529\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Curveball Anders\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Curveball Anders said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially on small crafts with \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
