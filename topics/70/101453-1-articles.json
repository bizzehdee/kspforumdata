There is no fix , but you can make your docking ports a decoupler (code below). Just make sure when you decouple (un-dock) that you do it from the ejecting vessel as the docking port will be disposed of. ALso get Kerbal Attachment System and make all docking ports grabbable. This way you can install docking ports in mid-flight.\n\n    MODULE{ name = ModuleDecouple ejectionForce = 5 explosiveNodeID = top}\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T22:31:56Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 10:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lextacy**"}]}
