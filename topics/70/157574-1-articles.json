Since I\u0027m running KSP 1.2.1, I downloaded the corresponding version of Interstellar, version 1.11.4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything works beautifully, except for one small thing; when I run either of the Alcubierre warp drives, the blue/violet warp effect texture regularly flashes bright white for a split second before resuming the usual colors and transparency fluctuation. The frequency of these \u0022white flashes\u0022 is proportional to the warp speed. These white flashes alternate; first, the inner violet flashes white, and then the outer blue flashes white. Then the process repeats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t affect function or anything, but it\u0027s kind of jarring. Plus, it\u0027s a mystery to resolve.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tried going into the warp effect\u0027s texture files; each warp color has 16 different images that cycle through, each varying in transparency. I copied one file of each type (warp and warpr) 16 times, renaming each the appropriate number. Then, when I re-run the game, sure enough, the colors do not fluctuate, but the white flashes still occur. So the texture files aren\u0027t the problem; at first I thought that one of the 16 images must have been \u0022whitened,\u0022 but that has proven to be false. It must have something to do with whichever other file deals with cycling through the texture images.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know that the Alcubierre Drive\u0027s page over on Github mentions a texture glitch; their glitch, however, refers to a solid black texture. This isn\u0027t my case (quite the opposite). Besides, my version of KSPI doesn\u0027t have Active Texture Management, which seems to have been the problem for their \u0022black glitch.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there we go, I think that\u0027s everything...anyone have any ideas? / have had this happen to them? I\u0027m posting here because I can\u0027t find a single reference to my specific flashy-glitch anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monstah","CreatedById":95210,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-10T20:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, there, and welcome!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved your thread to the support subforum, hope someone helps with your problem soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
