The mod pack is a TP mod where your kerbals earn certain ribbons and awards for accomplishing great feats such as being to the lethal to reach orbit. My problem I\u2019ve been having is even since my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E data erased I cannot reinstall any addon to the mod and can only install\u00A0the mod core. I cannot use old beta on steam because the mod adding are made to run 1.4.3 and for some reason your not able to use that beta on steam. I was wondering if anyone knows about a possible update for the mod or if anyone knows how to update it. Please get back to me thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-20T07:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModded support question moved to the modded support subforum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd good luck with your issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-20T08:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about asking in the actual \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/61065-142-final-frontier-kerbal-individual-merits-142-3375/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Emod thread\u003C/a\u003E for Final Frontier?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also not sure I can parse your question.\u00A0 Could you try to rephrase what you\u0027re trying to achieve and what your problem is?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-20T09:25:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you are looking for a version of FF that runs on an older version of KSP?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4425759060\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173371-how-to-get-old-versions-of-mods/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your issue is with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, then I\u0027d ask in that thread about getting it fixed, but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E should only install the mod version compatible with your version of KSP.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
