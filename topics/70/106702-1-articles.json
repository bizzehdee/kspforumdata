I am fairly certain there is a memory leak without (my first crash did not have it -force-opengl turned on) but almost seems worse with it on."},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:50:11Z","Content":"I did run a memory test. Opengl no longer has near the benefit that it used to, and has some significant video quality negatives. I only gained about 75MB as opposed to the nearly 700 MB I used to gain from using it. It also caused mesh tearing and terrain blinking that is rather annoying. All in all probably not worth the trouble any more."},{"CreatedByName":"OtakuD","CreatedById":116561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:06:06Z","Content":"Yeah I\u0027m crashing every 30-60min without fail, really sad as I really dont remember 0.9 ever doing this but maybe I never played that long.\n\nEdit: Also on the larger ships I\u0027m working on now, I can only crash/revert a handful of times before my memory approaches the 3GB range."},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T23:33:07Z","Content":"I\u0027m crashing constantly. There seem to be a lot of memory leaks. I just now locked up while at the mission control screen, and I have amod that disables the overheat gauges too. The process just grows larger and larger out of control. I\u0027m going to try running without -force-opengl for a while and see if that improves things."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T03:57:20Z","Content":"I\u0027m not crashing constantly, but I am noticing a slow memory leak coming from somewhere (which got faster while I was biome hopping), and lo and behold I do have -force opengl on.
