Now at this point in time I have absolutely no clue on how I am supposed to install it yet alone make it work. I purchased the game on steam if that helps at all, and the game is on my C drive along with all the other games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow I am not a computer savvy person, so if you could please explain to me how to due this like your talking to a 6 year old it would be much appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthank you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aelfhe1m","CreatedById":142910,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-19T01:24:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst thing I\u0027d recommend is to go into your Steam folder and make a copy of the entire Kerbal Space Program somewhere else on your computer. Use that new copy as the version you mod. When KSP updates, Steam will automatically update its version of the game but quite often mods you might have installed will not be compatible with the new version and may even prevent the game from running. By only modding a separate copy you can reduce the risk of this happening to you.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond piece of advice. Start slowly. Install only a few mods at a time and resist the urge to try everything at once. There are a lot of shiny treats on offer but moderation (at least at first) is a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird - the simplest way for someone new to modding KSP to install mods is using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154922-ckan-the-comprehensive-kerbal-archive-network-v1223-mahia/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/a\u003E - it\u0027s a pretty decent mod manager tool that will usually make installing mods easy (not that installing mods manually is difficult in KSP and is the route that I would suggest for the more experienced but \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0makes it just a few button clicks).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to what mods to install - well that depends what you are looking for in your game. More challenge? More pretty parts to play with? New worlds? Better graphics? Tools to help build better/more efficient rockets? etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-19T01:26:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/19/2017 01:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Aelfhe1m\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kscoble93","CreatedById":181476,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-19T01:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo after I started fooling around, i somehow managed to get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E mod from Curse to work and the game is running smoothly.
