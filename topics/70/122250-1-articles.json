When trying to dock two ships in cis-Dres space, I realized that the stock toolbar was not responding at all, to hovering or clicking. All three crafts in that SOI have the same problem. When going back through the KacBackup saves, I found that my supertanker had picked up the bug on route to Dres, with the last unbugged save being over a year ago in game-time. When focussed on other ships in other SOI\u0027s, or at KSC, the toolbar is functioning normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor mods I have VOID, KAC, ThrottleControlAvionics, ForScience, NF-DAI, Asteroid day, and StockFuelSwitch.
