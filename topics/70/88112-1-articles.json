Manjaro with all of that is really close in performance to Mint 17 with Catalyst. Manjaro Linux x64 w/ Catalyst driver from Ubuntu 14.10 (it\u0027s the only Catalyst driver that supports 3.16\u002B kernels and xserver 1.16; in the Manjaro repos as default Catalyst driver and AUR as catalyst-test for Arch users). Kernel 3.18 should bring us an even better Radeon driver. It\u0027s currently in RC1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never noticed this issue with Catalyst or with Xorg/Kernel/Mesa/Radeon all being updated to damn-near bleeding edge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you run the Radeon driver, it\u0027s best to be using a really up-to-date distro like Arch, Manjaro, or Debian Sid because driver updates come in the form of Kernel/Xorg/Mesa updates. If you use the Catalyst driver, it really doesn\u0027t matter as much because driver updates come from AMD and don\u0027t normally rely on bleeding edge stuff. That said, with the right combination of stuff, bleeding-edge \u002B Catalyst is the best for gaming, though it can be unstable. Hopefully we\u0027ll be getting the Catalyst 14.10 or 14.11 beta driver soon. The 14.9 driver release, while good, was a bit lackluster; likely because it\u0027s both a WHQL driver and designated as Linux stable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-24T15:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, i see... i thought this was a mac OSX specific problem, that occurred just after updating to the latest version of OSX...
