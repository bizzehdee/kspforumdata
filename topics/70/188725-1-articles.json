I was wondering if there are any existing mods, or if anyone would be willing to create one that will allow the changing of auto-strut settings during non-physics time warp. it may be the only way for me to save it at this point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-07T06:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know of none, however I may have a fix for you. Never tried it myself but I\u0027ve tried similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nFind your persistent.sfs file, then back it up. No, seriously back it up. Twice possibly.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOpen it in a text editor. Notepad will do but I personally prefer Notepad\u002B\u002B. Not word or winpad or something like that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSearch for the name of your station. You can get that without destroying the station in the tracking station at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. You should find that name in the file on a line that looks like:\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\nname = \u0026lt;Your station\u0027s name\u0026gt;\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNote the line number. If you are using a civilized editor it\u0027s probably on the screen. In notepad you can get it by hitting ctrl-G and noting the number in the box already.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSearch again, from this very point, for \u0022VESSEL\u0022 in all caps, without the quotes, with \u0022match case\u0022 checked. This should jump to the next ship you have in the game. Note the line number here as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGo back to the top and again search for your station\u0027s name.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFrom this point, start searching for \u0022autostrutMode = \u0022 again without the quotes. Every time you find one that says something other than \u0022autoStrutMode = Off\u0022, change it to that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKeep doing this until you line number is bigger than the second line number you noted above.

He\u0027s added a feature to KSPIE that will allow me to alter strut states during a time warp, which means I should be able to disable them on the craft before physics kicks in.. if I\u0027m lucky. I\u0027ll know Friday. Will be streaming to create a how-to and test video to see if it works. So the hope is to time warp the craft\u00A0before load, so that it doesn\u0027t ever enter physics render and stays together, kill all part strutting.. and see how it goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
