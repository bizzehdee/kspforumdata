I am running KSP on Mac OS X 10.10.3 and KSP v1.0.4. I will list all of the mods I have installed but none of them are graphic mods and my KSP is near stock at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- HyperEdit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- SpaceY Lifters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- HullCameraVDS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- NearFutureSolar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not believe it is a mod that is causing this, however at the moment, I have not yet gone through mod-by-mod and tried troubleshooting like that. Any help would be much appreciated and if you would like more info, just ask. Thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T08:11:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMore info is definitely required, what are these glitches?
