Ive had this install for a few months now, recently added principia. I Followed an installation guide for AVP (Without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E beacause i use mac). I installed it correctly but when i opened a save, only the atmosphere opacities had changed. i tried searching other methods, they all ended in the same result. i then swapped AVP for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s default configs (BoulderCo.) and it worked seamlessly. i Then swapped it back and it didnt work, tried using methods from reddit posts but none of them worked. Ive been\u00A0 looking everywhere so i decided to\u00A0 post here so someone more experienced can help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norman 5","CreatedById":225711,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-20T13:14:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIve since also re emptied my GameData, and it did not work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
