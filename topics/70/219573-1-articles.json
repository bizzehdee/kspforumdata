I have tried to rebuild the entire refinery module.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHint: the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E is able to fill external tanks. But only those parts of it\u0027s original module. It cant fill it through the docking ports.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is the other weird thing about this. Monopropellant, ore or even Metal is unnafacted by this problem. It only applies to chemical fuel for bipropellant propulsion. Exclusively stuff like oxidizer, hydrogen, liquid fuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI even tried to land a ship on the launch pad I made. It wont fill the vessel there either.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI recreated a smaller version of this base on my sandbox save on kerbin and it behaved like I wanted to. I wonder what the problem could be? None of the parts used has \u0022no cross feed\u0022 and I am able to transfer the fuel from the refinery module to the other modules manually... But this is rather tedious and requires me to have a large fuel tank attached to the refinery module. Which goes against what I want for it. The only solution seems to redesign some aspects of my base and just simply not have fuel tanks anywhere else.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs there a bug I could look for in the save file to fix this? I am just curious what specifically prevents this from being possible on my larger base. While a smaller base with the same refinery module and base modules on kerbin in creative works just fine... And as said. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E is able to fill other tanks. It just bugs out on my larger base and is unable to fill tanks on docked vessels there. As if it dont recognice those tanks as part of itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-21T09:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you enabled cross feed on the docking ports?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zefnoly","CreatedById":114671,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-21T13:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224324158\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219573\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221695289940\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you enabled cross feed on the docking ports?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes! Other fuel types like Monopropellant works fine! And they dont even have a toggle for it as it should be permanently enabled on the ones I use. I will mention I dock the stationparts with the expandotubes from Nertea\u0027s Stockalike stationparts mod as they make surface building more convenient to me and nicerlooking. This problem has never happened before and afaik their behavoir is the same as grappling hooks kindof but they should allow fuel crossfeed. When I try to recreate this in sandbox I cant seem to do it and it works as intended. If this is a known bug only for those expandotubes I will refrain from using them and rebuild my moonbase. But I did read somewhere this is a potential bug tied to refinery modules alone and happens on larger bases. Which would be sad as I installed simpleconstruction just to make larger bases easier and more convenient to make in my career game.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain as specified. It simply cant transfer fuel to parts of the base considered seperate docked vessels. It has no issue however sending fuel directly to tanks it was built with on its own vessel structure.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy other solution is to simply rebuild the refinery module. I just unlocked the largest cryogenic tank and it makes this problem workable in that manner as I can stil transfer fuel manually. So I just need to make sure it has as large buffer on itself as possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot380.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1133443564660080660/1154411159760412764/screenshot380.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
