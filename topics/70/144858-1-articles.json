When I install the mods in the KSP/GameData/Squad the mods won\u0027t work. I think its do to the mod developer\u0027s having the programs to look for the files in the\u00A0KSP/GameData not in KSP/GameData/Squad. I have tried to move the game files from the Squad\u00A0folder to the GameData folder then delete the empty squad folder. So make clear all the game files are in KSP/GameData When I try to run the game parts are lock or\u00A0missing, Kebals in the bottom right corner, and a lot more problems. I really hope someone could help me out on this I have been getting off working coming home trying to get this working for the past two days and would like to play KSP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMaplePie","CreatedById":167172,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T02:07:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMust not be my day, but why did my post make 3 discussion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxxQ","CreatedById":102622,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T02:38:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, mod files only go in the GameData folder, not the Squad folder. \u00A0Secondly, there are files in the Squad folder that need to be there for the game to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the first thing you did wrong was to put the mods in the Squad folder. \u00A0The second thing was that you pulled everything out of the Squad folder and put it all in GameData, including the stuff that\u0027s SUPPOSED to be in the Squad folder. \u00A0Your best bet is to do a fresh reinstall, and this time, don\u0027t take anything out of the Squad folder, and only put mods in the GameData folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMaplePie","CreatedById":167172,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T03:04:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks I feel like a complete idiot!
