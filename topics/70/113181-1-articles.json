I would like to make that a lot shorter.\n\nHere\u0027s the link to the mod folder:[http://prntscr.com/7hwtin](http://prntscr.com/7hwtin), I also have module manager. If you can find a way to fix this I will be very happy and start working on research and maybe work on my first KSP video.

I play with about 45 different mods and most recently, added the STX mod. In short, after deleting two part files within the mod that was causing it to hang up as it was loading, I decided to delete the mod. Things are back to normal with the exception of the ability to use the mod. LLL and LLL\u002B work without issue. \n\n[See the entire issue described here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24906-LLL-Lack-Luster-Labs-Dev-Thread-LLL-13-1-13DEC2014-SXT-19-07DEC2014-KSC-v3?p=2028871\u0026viewfull=1#post2028871).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T19:28:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**\n  \nAdded the information about diagnising STX"},{"CreatedByName":"WARodst10175","CreatedById":136962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T06:15:02Z","Content":"Something is happening.
