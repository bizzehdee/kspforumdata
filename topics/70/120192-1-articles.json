I can\u0027t click and pick squad landing struts. I mean at all. I\u0027ve read some posts about attaching problems or picking problems once the struts attaached other parts but its different. I cant pick the struts from the parts section in the first place. There is no problem with the mod parts tough. Any idea why and how to solve? Thanks..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
