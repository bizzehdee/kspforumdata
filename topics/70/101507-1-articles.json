Ive had few issues with the game randomly crashing. Not offten but this last time after the game crashed, and i rebooted it and loaded everything up the game just will not respond. Cant go to most of the facility. Im locked out of every thing but launchpad, and astronaut complex, and science window. However in the R\u0026D it locks me in as in i cant return to the main World. and i cant do anything outher then move camera around and change flow of time. Any idea on what happened? and how to fix it\n\nKSP: 0.90 (Win32) - Unity: 4.5.5f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\n\nUSI Tools - 0.3.2\n\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.3.3\n\nContract Configurator - 0.6.6\n\nCC-CP-SCANSat - 0.5\n\nContract Pack: RemoteTech - 1.0.2\n\nContracts Window Plus - 1.0.3.4\n\nDMagic Orbital Science - 0.9.2\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\n\nProcedural Parts - 1.0.2\n\nRegolith - 0.1.7\n\nRemoteTech - 1.6.3\n\nSCANsat - 1.1\n\nShip Manifest - 0.0\n\nTextureReplacer - 2.2.5\n\nTAC Life Support - 0.10.2.15\n\nKarbonite - 0.5.5\n\nKarbonite Plus - 0.3"}]}
