So I checked the values with an online dV calculator ([http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/](http://www.strout.net/info/science/delta-v/)) using the masses and ISPs listed below:\n\n**Mun lander, 4 x LV-N \u0022Nerv\u0022 engines:**\n\nFull mass: 45400 kg\n\nDry mass: 35400 kg\n\nEngine ISP: 800 s\n\n**Delta-V: 5900 m/s**\n\n**Mun lander, 4 x LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 engines:**\n\nFull mass: 35400 kg\n\nDry mass: 11400 kg\n\nEngine ISP: 345 s\n\n**Delta-V: 3833 m/s**\n\nNow, as you can see, the LV-N is clearly WAY underpowered in terms of efficiency since it achieves less than half of the delta-V it should. Or is it just Mechjeb being dumb and unable to calculate dV properly?\n\nDiscuss."},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T08:55:17Z","Content":"You\u0027re probably carrying oxidizer?

THe LV-N only uses Liquid Fuel now, like a real live NERVA would.\n\nRemoving oxidizer improved the situation a bit, however, it still only has 3306 m/s of delta-V compared to the 5900 m/s it should have. There is definitely something weird going on.\n\nE: Can someone else test this too and post results?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nDerp, I think I \\*might\\* be stupid. I ran the calculations again with no oxidizer mass included and it said the dV is a bit over 3200. I guess that\u0027s because the empty weight with 909\u0027s is only about half of what it is with the LV-N\u0027s. So apparently it **isn\u0027t** the go-to engine for almost everything anymore. In fact, it seems to be completely useless for anything under 60 or 70 tons. I tried the same thing on my asteroid tug (~55 tons) and I get nearly 30% more dV with the LV-909\u0027s.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T09:19:54Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 09:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainKorhonen**"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T09:18:45Z","Content":"We need more LF only tanks now... currently, they are only available for spaceplane parts...\n\nAs much as its cool to cruise around in a spaceplane looking thing....
