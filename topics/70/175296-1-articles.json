I set up a nice encounter, decouples the sat from the rover, and the rover disappears. Went to map mode, took quite a bit of effort to find it. Then i set up an aerobraking manouvre for the rover. I decouple my interstage. And the whole rover breaks to 10 pieces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have installed quite a number of mods, such as kws, malfunc armory, bd armory, hyperedit, vessel mover, mechjeb, physics range extender, stage recovery, and the alarm clock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know how to scare of Kraken?

I have been working on this for a few weeks. so I finally loaded the relay\u0027s(deploy able cargo) I attached the coupler\u0027s to the wall and struts between them and the satellite\u0027s (I have done this a hundred times) when i went to decouple it was devastating. so I mounted a girder on top and used many of the de-coupler\u0027s available to test. all had way to much explosion even when the setting of 0 for force and size=50 or less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\neven with nothing attached they still destroyed my 80\u002Bm long ship. so then yes I tested it with a simple tank and engine on the launch. seems much more explosive to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nas stated I\u00A0have done this before and never has this been a problem they are very explosive and didn\u0027t use to be.
