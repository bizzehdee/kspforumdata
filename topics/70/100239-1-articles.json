But some of the mods just don\u0027t work, like MechJeb and KerbalEngineer. Other mods like FuelTanksPlus work just fine. I figured out that it\u0027s the mods with DLL files that don\u0027t work, but I have no clue as to how I can fix this."},{"CreatedByName":"RatchetinSpace","CreatedById":65526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T10:15:18Z","Content":"Have you made sure the mods are installed correctly? Some mod makers can be tricky and put the GameData folder inside another folder or they simply expect you to put the folder into the GameData (I know that MechJeb has to be manually dragged into GameData). This confused me to until I saw the random folders around my GameData and outside my GameData, I felt like such a noob. ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T11:37:22Z","Content":"Have you made sure that you aren\u0027t running KSP in a protected folder? I\u0027ve heard of problems with Windows data protection in the Program Files folders on some install unless you do something specific to tell Windows that KSP is okay (that is of course if you\u0027re running windows).
