I\u0027ve been trying to get a decent science mod working and none of them are working. I installed kerbal engineer redux and mechjeb and those work fine but science alert, for science, and automated science sampler aren\u0027t doing anything. I install unzip\u00A0the files in the Gamedata folder just like I did with the working mods but when I start my game (in science mode) there\u0027s no indication on the screen of any science mods. It looked like for science was working because it was automatically performing experiments as I flew but I didn\u0027t have the button to turn it on and off like in the description video. I\u0027ve done tons of googling to figure out what I\u0027m doing wrong but can\u0027t find anything so I finally made an account to ask you guys. Any help is greatly appreciated. Also, I\u0027m currently running ksp version 1.1.2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlamoVampire","CreatedById":78020,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T05:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/164536-spoonman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022164536\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/164536-spoonman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Spoonman\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nare the mods in question the most current version of the mod, for 1.1.2? i know its a silly question, but, its one that needs be asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScienceAlert NOT UPDATED for 1.1.X. last known update was for 1.0.4.
