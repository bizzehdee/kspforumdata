I made enough money to upgrade the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E because the mass and size restrictions were holding me back. The model of the building changed, and the right click box tells me the upgrades should have applied (max parts now 255 etc) but i can\u0027t launch anything bigger than the basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E allows.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also changed the save file to upgrade the building fully, in case it was just the middle stage that had this problem. But even at the highest level I can\u0027t build anything bigger than the basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using kerbal construction time, this might be involved? As it makes upgrades to buildings take time. But that time has passed and nothing has changed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Emirhan","CreatedById":165957,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T11:37:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou must be upgrade the Launchpad\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harleyquinneth","CreatedById":161423,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-06T17:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell don\u0027t i feel like a right moron.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks very much!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
