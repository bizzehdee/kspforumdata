The in-game UI is manageable, and I figured out how to change its size by changing the \u0022UI_SCALE\u0022. Here is what it looks like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedOther ipsEmbeddedOther_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?app=core\u0026amp;module=system\u0026amp;controller=embed\u0026amp;url=http://imgur.com/a/jXXM1\u0022 style=\u0022height:458px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScaling down to 1920x1080 doesn\u0027t seem to do anything.
