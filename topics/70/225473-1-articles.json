I noticed it had a target orbit around the sun to get to that ir did not show on the map screen for some reason, but I didn\u0027t think much of it. I launched the rocket with the telescope on it and got into a Kerbin orbit, then I looked at my contracts and I had 1 less because it was gone. Decided to try the launch again, same thing happened. Then I just went to my space station before launching the rocket, quicksaved, reloaded and it disappeared just the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the exact contract\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nVO3b0v.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022104.49\u0022 height=\u0022605\u0022 width=\u0022579\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nVO3b0v.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
