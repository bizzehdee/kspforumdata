I noticed it had a target orbit around the sun to get to that ir did not show on the map screen for some reason, but I didn\u0027t think much of it. I launched the rocket with the telescope on it and got into a Kerbin orbit, then I looked at my contracts and I had 1 less because it was gone. Decided to try the launch again, same thing happened. Then I just went to my space station before launching the rocket, quicksaved, reloaded and it disappeared just the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is the exact contract\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022nVO3b0v.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022104.49\u0022 height=\u0022605\u0022 width=\u0022579\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/nVO3b0v.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-24T17:54:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/206606-joose/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022206606\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/206606-joose/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Joose\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0What Kopernicus planet pack(s) are you using?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome planetary system mods have conflicts with asteroids and I think that\u0027s the cause of your issue.
