I am playing with the need to purchase to unlock the parts in the VAB after research and that is suppose to make it so researched, but still-locked parts show in the editor as greyed-out and can be clicked on to buy and unlock but instead none of them show up at all. I can purchase them from their nodes in the tree from R\u0026amp;D and then that individual part will show up as unlocked and usable but they locked parts are still missing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo my knowledge I don\u0027t have any mods that affect this behaviour so wouldn\u0027t know where to begin trying to debug this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help is greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a player.log: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0BZCbirvqywWktHanByWFVuU0E/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0BZCbirvqywWktHanByWFVuU0E/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
