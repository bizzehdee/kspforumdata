If youd like, you can stick this one to the top.\n\nSo, on we go: I keep crashing to desktop and naturally, I expected some not-updated mod to be the culprit. I removed Firespitter and KIS and launched again but - as I just learned - to no avail. Theres only one mod remaining incompatible with KSP (According to KSP itself) which is MechJeb. Im not quite willing to let go of MJ just yet, unless someone can truly confirm MJ is the cause ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnyway - my latest Log:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3OvfUn1lRtRfjI3d0x5SUtOTHlnMVQtMHR0MktPa3FCVzEteXZSVnlSZVc4Qmp3eFFDbUk\u0026usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3OvfUn1lRtRfjI3d0x5SUtOTHlnMVQtMHR0MktPa3FCVzEteXZSVnlSZVc4Qmp3eFFDbUk\u0026usp=sharing)\n\nMaybe this little bit of Info helps - so far I seemingly only crash when flying my surveyor-planes around on Kerbin.

Memory usage slowly increases the longer you play so if the temp gauged leak got you close enough to the limit the other smaller leaks could have pushed over."}]}
