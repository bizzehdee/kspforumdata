Launch a ship, something goes hideously wrong, go to the menu and click \u0022Revert to Launch\u0022, only to have it take me to a different launch, e.g. one from an hour earlier. So far every time this has happened (I think) it\u0027s either taken me from a runway launch to a launchpad one or vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running a frankly absurd amount of mods, so I\u0027m presuming this is some weird conflict, but mainly curious as to what could be causing this or if anyone else has had it happen (couldn\u0027t find anything similar searching, but admittedly my Google-Fu is weak).
