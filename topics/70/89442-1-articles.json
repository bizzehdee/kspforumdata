This happened after I installed RemoteTech, Trajectories, and Procedural Parts, but I\u0027m not sure if any of them are the whole cause, or just interacting with the Visual Enhancements mod. I do not have Better Atmospheres installed. Normally I\u0027d start uninstalling mods one by one, but this seems like something someone would have seen before, and if that\u0027s the case it\u0027ll save me some time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: When viewing the ground from the in-game view, the ground on the night side seems to be covered with city lights, only stopping at the water and certain elevations that go above them.
