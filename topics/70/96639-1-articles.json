One of three things is occurring: first, there is a bug reporting subforum and I am blind, in which case I apologize to the mods; second, there is not and there probably should be; or third, Squad doesn\u0027t actually monitor these and I\u0027m an idiot (wouldn\u0027t be the first time that one\u0027s been proven).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I have two bugs to report. Running v0.90 32-bit on Windows 8.1 64x, along with Mechanical Jeb, Clouds and City Lights, and Enhanced Navball. I also have a program called JoytoKey running in the background but I doubt that affects anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is pretty obnoxious: when I send my Kerbals to go EVA, around a third of the time they get sent flying off away from the hatch. Normally this isn\u0027t much of a problem and I have to spend about 1/4 unit of RCS fuel to get them back. If it happens in-flight on approach or especially in atmo, though, that\u0027s a huge problem. I\u0027ve lost two Kerbals entirely because of this phenomenon, which might not sound like a lot until you realize that those were the first two I\u0027ve ever lost for any reason. I thought maybe it was caused by the Kerbals clipping with the stuff attached to the module, but I tested that and it also happens when the only things attached to the module are a parachute and a separator, so that isn\u0027t it. It\u0027s just a bug, plain and simple, and it is quite frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second is far more problematic, and a lot of things happened involving it. I was flying a pretty routine mission to test out a rocket design. I had the pilot go EVA in low orbit to go to the science lab, and when he boarded the lab he apparently entered some kind of dimensional phase. I no longer had a camera view on him and I couldn\u0027t get him back out of the module, but the module still registered an occupant. Amazingly I could still control the rocket despite having a wraith in the science lab, an empty command module, and no drone systems. I figured I\u0027d just try to recover him and rerun the mission, but the moment the bottom of the landing legs on the science module touched the water the whole assembly exploded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I went to the recruiting building, he showed up in the Active Kerbals total number, but I could view him in Lost (even though it only showed a count of two despite three Kerbals there). When I moused over him, a red X appeared like the ones you get in pre-launch crew selection. Out of curiosity I clicked it and that appeared to erase his existence entirely. I shrugged, recruited a new guy to run the test, and went to set up another launch, but when I actually clicked the launch button, it took me back to the KSC overview... but with the Recruiting Building music. I tried again, same thing. The only building I can access is the Recruiting Building; everything else just does nothing when I click except the Launch Pad and Runway, which let me do everything but launch or edit. I also attempted to go back to the main menu and that didn\u0027t work either. I couldn\u0027t even right-click the window to close it: I had to force it to stop in the Task Manager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks like everything in the entire save is corrupted. Luckily, the problem is restricted to that specific save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend that anyone reading this immediately back up any save files they actually care about, and do so every time you\u0027re about to launch any manned rocket. And I don\u0027t mean quicksaves, I mean go into your computer files and copy the saves. Maybe this was a really unusual bug, but if this had happened to my good save, I would have just deleted KSP then and there, and I\u0027ve invested FAR less time into it than some of you here, so better to have a backup and not need it than need it and not have it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T06:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe have the Support sections for bug reprots. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Since you have some mods installed, I have moved your post to the modded support sub-forum.

The first is definitely a known problem and can be \u0022fixed\u0022 by installing the EVAEjectionFix part of the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v0-90-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v0-1-7d-6-Jan-15%29-Misc-Utilities-%2813-Jan-15%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EStock Bug Fix Modules\u003C/a\u003E mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second part sounds like a combination of things. First, the science lab doesn\u0027t have an internal view which causes the crew portraits to not appear for the kerbals inside it. They can still be got out by clicking on the hatch of the module and clicking on the relevant EVA button or by transfering the crew to another part. The more serious part of the issue sounds like a known problem with kerbals who are \u0022fired\u0022 after gaining achievements and there is another fix in the Stock Bug Fix mod (CrewRosterFreezeFix) that should stop this issue occurring in the future though you may need to edit your existing save game to get it working again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
