So far not a problem but when I tried to complete a survey nothing happened!!!\n\nI tried to take out all mods and complete just the surveys but also didn\u0027t work.\n\nlook at this screen:\n\n![vsm7lz.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/vsm7lz.jpg)\n\nAnother thing that I realise was that the number on top right screen (the one wich looks like a wi fi simbol) didn\u0027t change anymore, always keep on zero. All others contracts works normal!\n\nMy Mods:\n\n![2udw2g7.jpg](http://i60.tinypic.com/2udw2g7.jpg)\n\nThanks Guys"},{"CreatedByName":"Juniorpasini","CreatedById":123274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T20:30:17Z","Content":"After a lot o time testing, I realise that Tarsier Space Tech was the problem, but 1 have 2 vessels with 10 kerbals inside with Chem Cam, how do I remove only this part from current Save Game?"}]}
