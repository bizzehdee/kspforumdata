How can I change the time in my save file? Also, when a kerbal is outside the craft, the craft seems to shake around, and my orbit randomly seems to change.

I\u2019m pretty sure KSP doesn\u2019t go beyond 1000 years and even if it did, it would take real life years to fast forward 5 million years in KSP. Changing the time in the save file will probably also move the planets; at this point you\u2019d be better off loading an earlier save and redoing part of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Minmus Derp","CreatedById":187595,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-18T13:36:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have bettertimewarp, and I accidentally clicked on absurd warp instead of standard warp and then warped way too far\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
