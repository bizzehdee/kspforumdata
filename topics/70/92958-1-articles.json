This means that, when I try to rotate ship A, ship B also rotates, making docking almost impossible unless I disable reaction wheels on one of the ships. This also happens when on EVA; rotating the kerbal with WSAD causes the ship to rotate as well. Does anyone have any idea what is causing this and how I can fix it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aravir","CreatedById":132141,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T19:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had this problem maybe twice.
