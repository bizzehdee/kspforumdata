However, I\u0027ve waited about 15 minutes and the game didn\u0027t load, I restarted it, loaded the save normally, and when I launched the craft from the tracking station the same thing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then decided to use a cheat to rendezvous another craft with the other one, but my game FPS fell to about 2 (where it runs at about 40FPS normally, some FPS drops when it\u0027s a big vessel but it was a small one) and after waiting 5 minutes my game just crashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis only happens when I am close to asteroids, everything else goes just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I fix this? And is it possible to teleport that vessel away from the asteroid (preferably to kerbin\u0027s surface) without having to be in control of it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil Kermstrong","CreatedById":201201,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-22T17:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNevermind, I \u0022fixed\u0022 it myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot an earlier quick save from before I reached the asteroid (in saves/youragencyname/backup) and hard saved the game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
