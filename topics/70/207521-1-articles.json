your laptop have?\u00A0 Since you didn\u0027t supply it, I\u0027m going assume you are still learning some things and so I\u0027ll simplify the following a bit so it makes sense.\u00A0 Looking at the RAM and CPU specs I think the GPU is probably an average or so laptop GPU from a few years ago.\u00A0 I suspect that running all those mods might be a bit much depending on what your KSP graphics settings are, and what the actual GPU is.\u00A0 You\u0027d need to look in the OS to see the GPU info.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the KSP settings, when you run the game, before you select which savegame to run, go into Settings and see what your screen resolution is, and what your other graphics related settings are.\u00A0 Turn them down until you get acceptable performance.\u00A0 Screen resolution is probably going to have the biggest effect.\u00A0 Some of them can be changed after in the game from the [Esc]-\u0026gt;Settings menu, but I think resolution can only be set from the pre-game Settings menu, not sure.\u00A0 Generally, the higher some of those settings are, the more RAM you may need.\u00A0 Others are more GPU intensive.\u00A0 But most graphics settings will need more of both.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8G RAM is I think the recommended minimum requirement for KSP so you may find you have a lot more fun running \u003Cem\u003Ezero \u003C/em\u003Evisual mods.\u00A0 With those machine stats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe number of parts in the craft will also have a big effect on FPS.\u00A0 A minimal machine with high part count craft is doomed to go very slow\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, with only 8G RAM you probably don\u0027t want to be running anything other than KSP.\u00A0 You can check the OS to see if you are using virtual memory or swapping and if that is happening it would definitely explain 2fps on a machine of that capability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, you can have plenty of fun on a minimal machine, you just have to dial down the graphics settings, visual mods, and keep your part count down to what the machine can handle.\u00A0 I think your machine qualifies, but given all the updates since I ran a machine more like yours I\u0027m not sure if KSP is still friendly on machine that tight but I\u0027m pretty sure it will.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t push the visual mods, graphics settings, and craft part count\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited

Unity and Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou first bottleneck is the amount of VRAM for your GPU. Drop the Textures Quality to free some VRAM (there\u0027re some metadata in need to be also on the VRAM, as the PQS cache, you can\u0027t use all of it for textures).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second bottleneck is the less than ideal decisions on threading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest to downgrade your KSP to 1.11 , you will get some good performance improvements only in this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf even on 1.11 you are not satisfied, try KSP 1.7.3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on how old your GPU is, your best option is 1.4.3 - seriously, 1.4.3 runs absolutely marvelously on a i5 mobile with Intel HD3000 and 384MB of VRAM. (About 2012 more or less). Just don\u0027t install a lot of parts with custom textures and you will be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom 1.4.4 to 1.7.3, an Intel HD4000 with ~1Gb of VRAM is alright (you will not get too much benefits by using i7).
