Docked several parts to it. A total of three mod parts (the smartparts mod so I could have a certain cone ratio for the adapters.) on the station and none on the plane, plus mechjeb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI finally figure how to make spaceplanes that can reach orbit. But now... when I dock that station and ship, this happens. And it\u0027s not like there\u0027s a colossal THUNK of impact, it\u0027s as if there\u0027s constant thrust being applied! Help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I can\u0027t rotate the station any more, nor does it consume any resources.

You say it is like there is constant thrust being applied, so does the orbit keep changing? Is there a claw on either of the vessels? They are known to cause all sorts of odd issues that could look like this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been quite a few reports of issues like this recently but without better (i.e. more reproducible) reports, it can\u0027t really be investigated easily. Can you supply a quicksave file from just before you dock the spaceplace to the station (and confirmation that smartparts and MJ are the only mods)?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Major999","CreatedById":131827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T23:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWas there a cargo bay on the space plane? Often if the contents of the cargo bay clip into the cargo bay doors, We\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00AFrd forces will start to affect the space station. It happened with my own, causing it to slowly change it\u0027s orbit inclination. open the cargo doors, or undock the spaceplane, and see if that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T16:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations, you have constructed your first kraken drive!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a more serious note: known issues with KJR, if you\u0027re running it, or part clipping - especially landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T00:36:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had similar problems at one point - craft that I couldn\u0027t control spontaneously accelerating without using any fuel, pices of a craft falling off and heading for kerbin.
