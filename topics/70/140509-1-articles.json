I can see that the KSC has the Mission Control icon over it, but I\u00A0have no additional UI showing a satellite connection or range. I tested a rocket with no antenna and it worked in full orbit with no line-of-sight. Is this a mod that doesn\u0027t work in Sandbox Mode? Also, is there a way to edit the settings file to allow for RemoteTech in Sandbox Mode?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torih","CreatedById":144304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-25T23:03:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes it works fine in sandbox, are you sure its enabled in the config window?
