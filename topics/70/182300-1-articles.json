Sometimes it does work, sometimes it doesn\u0027t, but even when it works, it doesn\u0027t update the display in the context-menu for the craft. I.e. I have to click it, click somewhere else, and right-click the command module again to see if it worked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven in the same part, if I launch a brand-new one, it works fine. Only loaded craft files that once complained about missing modules have this issue. Which would be fine... I can always just redesign the craft -- and do for most missions anyway. But this particular design is a very complicated and finely tuned rover I put probably 5 hours into, and I\u0027d really rather not have to scrap it and rebuild it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas of what in the craft file might be causing this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tonka Crash","CreatedById":189552,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-20T15:12:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d guess it\u0027s some lingering effects of Kerbalism. You should try comparing a newly created craft file against one of your old craft files to see what\u0027s changed.
