A 3.75 m Heatshield(stock) was also used. The fairing has a max temperature of 2600 K and the rover is only 1600 K. I tested it by putting it through Earth Reentry... and the rover overheats even when it is inside the aeroshell.

You\u0027re on 1.8.1 but maybe some of my troubleshooting steps can help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any deployable antennas in the fairing that extend beyond the edge of the fairing when extended? Sometime those don\u0027t get shielded properly. KSP might be heating up the antenna, which then conducts heat to your rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare these 3 counts and if they don\u0027t match there\u0027s an issue: #1 total number of parts in the fairing. #2 in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, right-click the fairing base to see the \u0022parts shielded\u0022 count. If they don\u0027t match there\u0027s an issue. You can try increasing the extra radius slider on the fairing base, manually reshape the fairing, or try rearranging parts. #3 after the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E count looks correct, launch and recheck \u0022parts shielded\u0022 to see if it\u0027s different on the pad and in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Sometimes, extending a part inside the faring and immediately retracting it fixes the count on the pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-04T15:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the fairing the root part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
