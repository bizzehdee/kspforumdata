But I mean pitch black no light no idea where the body is compared to you dark. I\u0027ve messed around with settings in PlanetShine, even toggling it on/off, messed with ambient light levels in game options, tried another Ambient Light mods... But everything is just so dark and I have no awareness of where I am sometimes so it\u0027s annoying. So if anyone had some suggestions on a way to raise that somehow I\u0027d appreciate it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using quite a few mods and can list them all if needed, but for visuals I\u0027m using the main combo of Scatterer, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, PlanetShine and then tossed on AVP and some textures from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022KSP Renaissance Compilation (mod)\u0022\u003EKSPRC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I made sure not to accidentally pull in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E configs from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E itself and just downloaded scatterer from spacedock by itself so it should be using the AVP configs. Indeed everything looks like it should judging from pictures... just again, so dark on the planets and nothing I do changes that even if I bump up things\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-17T10:06:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIngame you can vhange some parameter in the mod planetshine just popup the window when in flight.
