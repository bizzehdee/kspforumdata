I\u0027ve used MechJeb for some time now, and without any problems. Yesterday it started acting weird. I used the acsent guidence for the launch, but it started to send the rocket downwards. The lauch was fine in the first stage but when it switched over to \u0022Coasting to the edge of the atmosphere\u0022 MechJeb turned the nose downwards and accelerated downwards. This has been the case for all of my last launches. Anyone know what might cause this??\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
