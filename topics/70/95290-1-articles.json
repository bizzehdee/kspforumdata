So what happens is whenever I go in orbit around the Mun my spaceship disappears and my velocity spins out of control and wobbles back and forth. Every time i try and revert to old save (alt f4 faster than it autosaves, since im on hard mode), the same problem happens. I had Jeb go EVA for one of these events and he wobbled back and forth with the craft, and also the craft was in fact visible.

I had been to the Mun before without encountering this issue. I place the blame on the Kraken and his antagonistic forces. The only way to fight his wrath is with the aid of the boffins of the forums. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading my post. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
