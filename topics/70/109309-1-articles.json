Mono is the name of the code base that Unity is built on (and Unity is the engine that KSP is built on). You can read all about it at [http://www.mono-project.com](http://www.mono-project.com). A mono.dll crash means you have outdated mods. Also, proper procedure is to open a new thread for your problems, not post on a 2.5 year old one."},{"CreatedByName":"JonathanS223","CreatedById":60263,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-30T20:36:59Z","Content":"Having the same problem to.
