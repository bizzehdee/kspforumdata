Wiggling is a technical term.\n\n1. Build a rocket with a tall fairing at the top and add 6 radially attached long fuel tanks in such a way that the fairing shells will collide with the fuel tanks when the fairing gets jettisoned.\n\n2. Get in a vaguely circular orbit, 100km will do, the altitude seems unimportant.\n\n3. Turn on SAS, throttle down to 0% and kill all rotation. You just want to be drifting and holding attitude.\n\n4. Add a new manoeuvre node say 10 minutes ahead of you.\n\n5. quick save here for convenience.\n\n6. Jettison the fairing - ideally you want at least 1 of the fairing shell parts to get tangled up in your ship between the fuel tanks.\n\n7. switch to Map view and enjoy the weirdness that has infected your manoeuvre node GUI. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out and you\u0027ll see that something is very wrong.\n\nOn my machine (even with KER disabled) this happens reliably with a fairly typical \u0022asparagussed\u0022 rocket. If you have RCS you can try moving in reverse to attempt to free the tangled fairing shell part. Once the shell is clear of your ship the problem seems to go away and all is back to normal in the map screen.\n\nI noticed that while the shell is tangled in the ship, I cannot use time warp to get rid of the shell fragments (as you can with a clean jettisoning) because it complains of \u0022cannot warp while in flight over terrain\u0022 error message. Also the blue orbit path does not appear when this particular bug is in effect. Sometimes the shell parts don\u0027t look like they are touching the rocket, but SAS seems to be trying to do some heavy corrections very fast, the ship appears to be vibrating slightly, although it remains responsive to user flight controls (yaw, pitch, roll etc). Pitching hard up seems to throw the shells out of the way sometimes, unless the shells are actually clipping through the ship and then you\u0027re in trouble.\n\nThis has happened twice with two different ship designs (although the placement of the parts is similar).\n\nedit: This bug can also happen when in sub-orbital flight above the atmosphere, which might explain the terrain remark above.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T12:05:39Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 12:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wossname**"}]}
