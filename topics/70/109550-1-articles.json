Then i go back to the \u0022ksp base\u0022 and my card starts running normal again.\n\nI got no idea what this could be. mod related/msiafterburner related/driver related, im open for ideas. thank you.\n\nIt has been working fine for a long time.\n\n**mods**:\n\nKerbalEngineer-1.0.16.6\n\nKIS\\_v1.1.3\n\nMKS\\_0.30.2\n\nSCANsat-v12.0\n\nTacLifeSupport\\_0.11.1.20\n\nInfernalRobotics\\_V0.21.1\n\nDMagic\\_Orbital\\_Science-1.0.2\n\nChatterer-0.9.1\n\nKAS"}]}
