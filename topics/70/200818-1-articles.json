The included screenshot shows one of the four parts with crew: Mk 1 Command Pod, Cupola, Mk 2 Lander Can, and an MPL. This is one of three orbital stations, and the other two do not show this problem. I have discovered that I can remove the crew (via crew hatches) for EVA, but then they can\u0027t go back in because the part is already full. Also, trying the Transfer button (as shown below) doesn\u0027t highlight any of the other crew parts as valid destinations. The last weird thing: If I disconnect the two pieces (simply joined by a standard Docking Port), I cannot turn on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E (because \u0022no pilot is on board\u0022), but I do have complete control of the craft (see upper left of the image below) (because the vessel is \u0022crewed\u0022). By the way, I included a pilot in each of the launches that make up this orbital station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been possibly about 1 yr (in-game) since I did anything with this station, so I don\u0027t know how long the problem has been present (i.e. what update might have caused it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022XQfDEN1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002264.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/XQfDEN1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of updates, here\u0027s the listing of my GameData folder:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PuhL4Sr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.36\u0022 height=\u0022394\u0022 width=\u0022451\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/PuhL4Sr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running KSP 1.11 (the current version, updated via Steam).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNothing crashes, freezes, or explodes because of this problem; something just happened to change the crew slots on those four parts in that one orbital station to 0.

If you want to use mods, copy the entire KSP directory from steamapps/common and put it somewhere else before adding mods, this will prevent Steam from updating the modded save and potentially breaking your save because a mod was incompatible. You can have as many copies of KSP as you like on your PC, with different versions and different sets of mods (or none) in each, but leave the Steam copy unmodded to get game updates when they\u2019re released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hollyfeld","CreatedById":121771,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-10T15:49:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223936733\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221615020798\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/6/2021 at 1:53 AM, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like your save file has been slightly corrupted.

It was in the TweakScale module section of each of the offending crew parts on that vessel. (The \u0022originalsizecrewcount\u0022 was set to 0.) Since that vessel was launched so long ago, the TweakScale mod had at least one update since those parts were generated which fixed that crew count mishap; I just never had any reason to try pulling those Kerbals out of their seats until now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-10T16:28:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlt\u002BF12 (or escape \u0026gt; version information in the bottom right of the pause menu) \u0026gt; cheats \u0026gt; set orbit, you can set most of the parameters there and it\u2019ll put your vessel where you said.
