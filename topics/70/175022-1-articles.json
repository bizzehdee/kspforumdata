Here\u0027s how to reproduce: make a simple\u00A0craft with an MEU-500-A Pulse Drill on it, launch it, start the drill bits and deploy the drill, that all works. When you retract the drill the start buttons will disappear; sometimes when you re-deploy the drill the\u00A0tooltip menu will briefly show start buttons for all the resources than collapse to no start buttons; you can retract the drill, re-deploy it, but never see the start buttons again. Also the tooltip menu shows \u0022S1 Active separator: minerals\u0022, \u0022S2 Active separator: ???\u0022, \u0022S3 Active separator: ???\u0022; even though S2 and S3 are configured for substrate and metalicOre respectively and producing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRelated note: when selecting the drill tip separator in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E it says \u0022Reconfiguration from dirt to dirt completed\u0022 (or whatever the next enum resource\u00A0is).\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs there a working version of the MKS drills and material processors for KSP 1.3.1 available?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf someone has this all working can you tshare the exact versions your are using?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMany thanks in advance,\u003Cbr\u003E\nAJ\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion info:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$ md5sum MKS_0.53.2.0.zip\u003Cbr\u003E\nccd583b5f322692c8af811b7073c7ac7 \u00A0MKS_0.53.2.0.zip\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$uname -a\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLinux ASUS-Z170-P-4Ghz 4.4.0-59-generic #80-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 6 17:47:47 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbal Space Program - 1.3.1.1891 (LinuxPlayer) en-us\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOS: Linux 4.4 Ubuntu 16.04 64bit\u003Cbr\u003E\nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz (4)\u003Cbr\u003E\nRAM: 15991\u003Cbr\u003E\nGPU: GeForce GTX 970/PCIe/SSE2 (4096MB)\u003Cbr\u003E\nSM: 30 (OpenGL 4.5 [4.5.0 NVIDIA 370.28])\u003Cbr\u003E\nRT Formats: ARGB32, Depth, ARGBHalf, Shadowmap, RGB565, ARGB4444, ARGB1555, Default, ARGB2101010, DefaultHDR, ARGBFloat, RGFloat, RGHalf, RFloat, RHalf, R8\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-17T02:24:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThread moved to Modded Support and good luck with your problem.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-17T03:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour best bet is to scour the MKS thread.\u00A0 Honestly I cannot remember if the drill issue was patched in 1.3.1 or not fixed until 1.4.\u00A0 You\u0027re largely on your own for support with old versions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
