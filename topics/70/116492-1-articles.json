I suggest you check Distant Object Enhancement, Connected Living Spaces, TAC Life Support and MechJeb to see if you have the correct versions for the version of KSP that you are running. What version is it, by the way? It looks quite old and you have some rather old mod versions installed too..."},{"CreatedByName":"icedown","CreatedById":129659,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-23T22:35:49Z","Content":"PF is what does it for me"}]}
