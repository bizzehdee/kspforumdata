I have transferred a science save from 1.0 to 1.0.2. All my mods are there, and I\u0027m not getting any errors on start or load.\n\nEverything seems OK except that when I select the science tree, there is nothing there at all. The tree is completely missing. Everything else from the save is there but that.\n\nAnybody else have this issue, and hopefully a fix?\n\nThanks\n\nUPDATE: I fixed this by loading a quicksave. It set me back a little bit, but the science tree now displays like it should, so I\u0027m happy. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T03:46:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 03:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JerryT87**"}]}
