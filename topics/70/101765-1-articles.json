Kerbin never loads, the rocket never loads, and the Navball itself is also all black. KSP at this point stops responding, and nothing seems to work (including trying to take a screenshot to illustrate).\n\n**Recreate/symptoms:**  I crashed (memory limit after a couple of hours of play) while launching a satellite. The satellite had not yet cleared the atmosphere. Upon reloading the game, the satellite launcher appears on the launchpad, but when I try to go into it to launch it, the above happens. \n\nClosed the game again, relaunched, and now the rocket is not on the pad. Go into the Tracking station, and it has the satellite listed as \u0022Splashed down\u0022 but the Tracking station screen showing Kerbin doesn\u0027t load, and is all black. I click on the satellite name and click the \u0022kill/destroy\u0022 button. The game stops responding again. I repeated this, same result.\n\nI make a backup of my save directory. Then I go into the persistent save file and delete the satellite from the save file. Relaunched the game again, this time everything seems better, the satellite isn\u0027t listed, and the Tracking Station loads. However, any attempt at launching any craft recreates the black screen issue described above. \n\nRevert my save folder, relaunch the game, and go into the tracking station. It loads fine. Fly a vessel in orbit, and it loads fine. Do a ctrl\u002BF9 to recover an older quicksave that should not have any corruption in it (I\u0027ll lose a few hours, no biggie) and the same thing happens when loading this lander on the moon (GUI fully populates, but the rest of the screen and navball are black, game freezes).\n\n**Log File:** [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62531235/output_log.txt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/62531235/output_log.txt)\n\n**Mods List:** (I think I have them all, and correctly listed)\n\nActive Texture Management x86 aggressive 4-3\n\nALCOR 0.9\n\nALCOR IVA 0.9\n\nASET Props 1.0.2\n\nB9 Aerospace R5-2-8\n\nBetter Buoyancy 1.1\n\nContractConfigurator 0.6.5\n\nContractPack-AnomalySurveyor\\_1.0.1\n\nContracts\\_Window\\_3.2\n\nCrossFeedEnabler\\_v3.2\n\nOuter Planets Mod 1.5.5.1\n\nDistant Object Enhancement 1.5.2\n\nEditor Extensions 2.5\n\nEnhanced NavBall 1.3.5\n\nEVE 7-4\n\nFASA 5.22\n\nFAR 14.5.1\n\nFreeEVA 0.3.0\n\nFuelTanksPlus 0.6 \n\nHot Rockets 7.9\n\nKerbal Attachment System 0.4.10\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement 2.4.5\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock 3.2.3.0\n\nKerbal Engineer 1.0.15.2\n\nKSPRC 0.1.9.5\n\nKW Rocketry 2.6d2\n\nLazTek SpaceX Launch Pack .90\n\nMagic Smoke Industries Infernal Robotics 0.19.3\n\nMechJeb2 2.4.1.0\n\nMechJeb and Engineer for All v?\n\nMOARdv FASA Gemini IVA 2.0\n\nModular Rocket Systems Parts Pack 1.5.1\n\nModule Manager 2.5.4\n\nNavyFish DockingPortAlignment 4.0\n\nNear Future Construction 0.4.0\n\nNear Future Electrical 0.3.1\n\nNear Future Propulsion 0.4.0\n\nNear Future Solar 0.4.0\n\nNear Future Spacecraft Parts 0.3.1\n\nPlanetShine 0.2.2.1\n\nRasterPropMonitor dev19\n\nRCS Build Aid 0.5.5\n\nRealChute 1.2.6.1\n\nRemoteTech 1.6.2\n\nSafeChute 1.6\n\nSCANSat 10.0\n\nSCART91 head textures\n\nScienceAlert 1.8.3\n\nSmokescreen 2.5.3.0\n\nSoundingRockets 0.2.0\n\nSpaceY Lifters 0.11\n\nStageRecovery 1.5.2.1\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer 2.4.1.1008\n\nTexture Replacer 2.2.5\n\nToolbar 1.7.8\n\nTrajectories 1.1.3\n\nTweakable Everything 1.6\n\nTweakScale 1.49\n\nUniversal Storage 1.0.0\n\nVNG Parachute 1.2\n\nVNG Plugin 0.7.2\n\nWaypoint Manager 2.1.2\n\nAny help here would be great. I\u0027m guessing the save file got messed up with the vessel in a position where it probably couldn\u0027t be easily saved, but I would think that loading a previous save without this would resolve the issue. I\u0027m really not sure what to do, and I really don\u0027t want to lose my progress on this save. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-15T02:24:04Z\u0022 title=\u002203/15/2015 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cetera**\n  \nEditing Prefix to Workaround"},{"CreatedByName":"Cetera","CreatedById":109237,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T00:07:11Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a new output log.

I was able to successfully take a named quicksave file, copy it to a new folder, name the folder as a new save, rename the named quicksave to persistent.sfs, and then edit the save file to put the folder name as the save name. Load the game, and load this new, renamed save, and everything works. Works well. I lost some game time, but it isn\u0027t the end of the world. I haven\u0027t fully tested everything yet, but it sure looks promising.\n\nHowever, trying to load this quicksave from the original save-game still results in the black screen as shown above. I have no idea what could be causing corruption from the save that breaks other loaded saves, but that seems like something wrong more with KSP itself than with any mod I might be running. Especially since I can make a new save from a quicksave file and run it in the same installation of the game with the same mods, and have no problem.\n\nAny thoughts there?
