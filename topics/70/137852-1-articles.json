Now when I go to start it when I press the shortcut nothing happens. I have tried opening without the launcher as well. I am running KSP\u00A0on a mac without steam.

Whenever I click the icon a crash window immediately pops up. It\u0027s pretty lame. I\u0027m on a mac as well. Seems like games just aren\u0027t made to work very well on macs. I\u0027m pretty sure the optimal platform for this game is windows but what are you going to do? I just wish the developers would put a bit more time into the mac side of the game. Sorry that I don\u0027t have a solution for you but I just felt like commenting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-07T09:08:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAICT, the patcher is bung on \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E platforms.
