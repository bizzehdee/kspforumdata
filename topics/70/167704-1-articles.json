Then I got \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, and installed groups of mods at a time and booted the game up. I started out loading all the baseline dependencies first, since they are least likely to be a problem (stuff like USICore USITools NFE Core, etc) and other things that don\u0027t mess with the interface or gameplay. Then I added in all the parts kits since they are unlikely to be a problem. And then after starting the game and making sure I didn\u0027t get the crash, I added in widely used things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E MechJeb etc since they are not likely the problem or else ther\u00A0 would be a lot more reports.
