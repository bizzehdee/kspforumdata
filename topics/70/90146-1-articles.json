I built the ship (Mun One) out of 68 parts. The ship launched well and left Kerbin with out a hitch. My final stage transited to the Mun where I made orbit and stared correction maneuvers to circularize and to bring the orbital plane in line with Kerbin for the return (Mission was a simple orbit and science mission, then return.) The problem occurred after I took my first could science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the Orbital Science US Goo module and the OS US Sci Jr. pods. I then had the Kerbal take a little walk to get the high orbit EVA report. I returned him to the capsule and moved into map view to make my orbital change for low orbit. When I returned from the map for the burn, the ship was unresponsive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExiting to the space center and returning to the ship I found that parts of my ship were just gone. The OS US modules, US Science modules, the three Batteries that contained. Stranger still was the Mun was missing and the rest of the ship was being dragged away (Below the US parts) along the trajectory. I reloaded KSP and nothing changed. So here I am...any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not do any clipping and this section of the ship (final stage) did not have any parts scaled.
