Whenever I attach an engine in the VAB or the SPH they fire constantly. It just started happening. I think it started when I added a Sub Assembly to a build and now it happens for everything! In addition to this, the engine doesnt appear in the Staging on the right. I have to wait until launch to sort out the staging.

I removed TweakScale and the issue went away, however why did this only just start? Ive been using tweak scale for a while ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T10:34:45Z","Content":"It was the same with me in 0.25, same tweakscale worked fine for months! and then poof."}]}
