KSP crashes like every 5-30 min, specially when i enter vehicle assembly, launch vehicle or anything that actually includes loading something. I have interstellar, kethane and the engineer. Any clues why is this happening? I searched around the internet, but everything i tried has failed.

So i think i quite overloaded the game and it was exceeding the ram i have. I installed active memory manager and the memory usage dropped to no more than 1.5GB and its running just fine now.
