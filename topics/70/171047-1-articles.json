After each flight, regardless of craft or flight time, when I return to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or recover my craft the game no longer allows me to do anything. I\u0027m just stuck in the space centre and can\u0027t exit the game unless I force close via task manager (Exit to main menu does nothing).\u00A0If I came back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E via the recover button the craft does not actually get recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClicking on the tracking station does nothing, the R\u0026amp;D building says it\u0027s closed, and if I go to the astronaut complex it won\u0027t let me leave. I can see my spashed down/landed craft if it\u0027s near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, but I can\u0027t fly or recover it. If I force cloase the game and load back up I can recover my craft and launch another flight, but the whole thing repeats itself each time I return to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve already resolved a few mod conflicts/issues with this install, but this issue has me stumped. I\u0027ve had a look at the ksp.log and ouput_log files, but I honestly don\u0027t know what I should be looking for. The install is heavily modded, so I\u0027m not really sure where to start (Short of doing some kind of binary search through my mod list).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve uploaded my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/fvfnn9upkqp124f/KSP.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eksp.log\u003C/a\u003E , \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/zsnhvwbkmq25eak/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoutput_log\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0, and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/i1y9pjiht4hz448/131-Mods.ckan?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003C/a\u003E list to Dropbox.
