Try copying the whole of the \u0022Kerbal Space Program\u0022 folder out of the steam folder into a newly created folder, e.g. C:\\KSP, and then running it from there instead. This also allows steam to auto-update the game without it messing with the install you actually play which can help to avoid issues with KSP updates breaking mods and/or saved games."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T10:40:34Z","Content":"Argh, seems I\u0027ve misplaced my crystal ball again ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Have a look at [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29), then post the required information."}]}
