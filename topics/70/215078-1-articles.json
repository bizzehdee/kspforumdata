(the visual ones) I removed them all from the GameData folder (except Engineer Redux \u002B Lunar) and of course this made my game not able to start anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a uninstall \u002B reinstall while keeping only the two mod folders \u002B save folders and the game started correctly but now I have this really weird bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022border:;white-space:pre;\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/8AvDIEs\u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/8AvDIEs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/8AvDIEs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems that I can\u0027t right click on components, the window doesn\u0027t open and also there\u0027s a visual issue with the bar near the map (it doesn\u0027t show the yellow bar which would decrease). I also noticed sometimes the buttons on the right side duplicate (like where you see your fuel)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to happen only when getting to space, i don\u0027t know if there is just some specific components that make it this way...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s bugging me so much that I reinstalled 3 times the game and also tried new career save and same issue occurs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone know what I should do to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
