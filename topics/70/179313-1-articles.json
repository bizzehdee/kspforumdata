Every time I load in this particular vehicle, which is using parts from the OPT mod, it spawns about a KM in the air above the runway. Looking at the debug menu gives me the error \u0022ground contact! - error Moving Vessel up 997.025m\u0022. I\u0027m willing to bet that its just a part i have on the plane acting up and i\u0027m gonna do some more testing but I was wondering if there was a known fix for this or if there was a way to stop the game from trying to self fix any ground clipping issues. It seems kind of strange for the game thinks that the solution to the problem of ground clipping to spawn the craft a Kilometer into the air.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSidenote: I did some research on this problem before posting this and one of the fixes that someone found was to just remove the Firespitter mod. I tried that but it still didn\u0027t fix it. I thought it might have something to do with the fact that OPT is out of date, however I put all of the parts that I have on my current craft onto a completely new craft in a new file and it worked just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-26T19:36:19Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2018 07:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Jkrazor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matheraptor","CreatedById":231497,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-11T13:57:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having a similar, if not the same, issue as yours.
