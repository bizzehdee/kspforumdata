It first appeared when trying to switch to a vessel that was on a sub-orbital trajectory. I ended up deleting that save game and starting a new one. The last time I encountered the bug was after doing an orbital survey on the Mun. After the survey I went to the tracking station and it said there was \u0022no orbital survey data\u0022. When I try to switch back to the probe, all sorts of wonky problems happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
