With ATM, i can run 64 mods (most are either plugins or mods with a couple of parts; save for B9 aerospace, KSPI, KW, better atmospheres) simultaneously (at low terrain detail and half-res) without crashes! (although the game does get a bit laggy sometimes and occasionally freezes for 20 sec before continuing). I, myself have used the Trans-K pack and it is awesome \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E but i think the problem is not with trans-k but what it depends on (namely, planet factory since it is no longer being updated (for at least half a year now)). But a replacement (Kopernicus) is being developed and i have heard that (some) of the PF mods will be restored with Kopernicus. Haven\u0027t heard of trans-k though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
