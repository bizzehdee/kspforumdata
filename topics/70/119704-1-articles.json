I\u0027m not a newb and have re-run every line on several different ships and nothing is behaving the way it has always in the past. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my large fuel array I have narrowed the problem down to one fuel line that, god knows why, refuses to work. I hooked it up again and again, even resorting to running 2 and 3 lines, to no avail. I\u0027m having other goofy issues with the fuel simply not going where it should as well. Can someone explain this?
