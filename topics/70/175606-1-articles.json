I saved an F-18 Hornet i made on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E about a week ago and this morning i still flew it (and it was on the craft list when you click the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Runway) but now it has disappeared from the list. I\u00A0didn\u0027t quicksave at all during the time i had the craft. And minutes ago i tried going back to an old quicksave to see if the craft was on the list and it wasn\u0027t. Is there any way i could get the craft back\u00A0(preferably without any coding etc, i\u0027m not very good on those things) because i really used a lot of time making it\u00A0(2 hours may not seem much to you but still) and tweaking the little details to get it fly well. And, can i somehow go \u0022forward\u0022 in saves, i mean like from the quicksave i\u0027m now on to the \u0022present\u0022 time or something?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-04T15:37:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo start: The ships you save in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E / \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E are not saved in the save file.\u00A0 They are saved in the Ships folder inside the save\u0027s folder, but they are not saved in the actual save file itself.\u00A0 That just has all the ships in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s disappeared from the load list in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, check the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E - you never know.\u00A0 If it\u0027s not there either, you can manually check the folders to see if it\u0027s in there, somehow.\u00A0 However I doubt this to be the case.\u00A0 The game checks these folders every time you go to open a craft, it\u0027s not cached.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, if you do have an older save that has this ship launched, it is possible to extract it from the save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2733482695\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/173656-pulling-craft-file-from-save/\u0026amp;page=0\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3349198\u0026amp;embedComment=3349198\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-3349198\u0022 style=\u0022height:282px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspguy77","CreatedById":189458,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-04T16:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello again. I checked on\u00A0Ships folder both the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E files, i couldn\u0027t find my craft there. I also went to the \u0022saves\u0022 file, clicked a file with my username in it, then Ships and i still couldn\u0027t find it. There was one named \u0022Auto-Saved craft\u0022, though my plane was named \u0022F-18 Hornet\u0022 but is there any possibility that this could be what i\u0027m looking for? Now what i did was i took the Auto-Saved ship .craft file and moved it to Ships folder on Kerbal Space Program directory, i\u0027ll hope that helps. I will restart KSP now and see if there\u0027s a change. Geonovast, thanks very much for your help. *EDIT* Hi, what i did (moving the .craft file to Ships folder didn\u0027t help.
