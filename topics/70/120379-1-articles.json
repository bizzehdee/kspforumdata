I\u0027ve recently built a very quite basic craft, nothing special, only using parts from another mod by the name of BD Armory. I will list all other mods I have installed below as well, in case they have any relevance to the matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 Aerospace (Beta, not released yet on Curseforge and otherwise, still available for public use) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBD Armory\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnvironmental Visual Enhancements\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETextureReplacer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(any other folders within the GameData location, are presumably associated directly, or indirectly with the stated above mods.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is, that the command module, was decoupled after having upwards momentum, in a 45 degree trajectory, or around that. Most other times this made little to no difference, but it particularly stood out when the craft did not stop, and maintained a steady speed, not increasing nor decreasing. The craft did not stop, despite the lack of anything propelling it forwards. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to get an Apoapsis on Kerbin of 79,054,693m. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually it got to a orbit at the sun, the very bottom of the orbit from the looks barely touching the surface, but not going through.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
