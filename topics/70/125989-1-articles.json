I know that at any given time the game becomes buggy for one reason or another for us individually but I am trying to gauge this overall for the community.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy problems are mostly encountered in the VAB. When I save a sub-assembly the game begins to act slow(er) and many times when I try to put the assembly back onto the vehicle (after the save) it many times won\u0026#39;t let me (the attachment nodes are gone or unresponsive). ctrl-z to duplicate small assemblies seems to be totally broken atm.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I bring in a previously saved sub-assembly it is far worse and more often than not breaks the vehicle where it won\u0026#39;t save it, allow me to modify the stages or it won\u0026#39;t even recognize that there are any stages at all. It doesn\u0026#39;t seem to have anything to do with size / complexity of either the sub-assembly or the main assembly - in one instance it was a simple (stock) lander (40 parts or so with the science attachments) and I was trying to add the launch engine assembly (again stock parts) which was 24 parts and it placed it to the side and wouldn\u0026#39;t let me select it, remove it or anything, I ended up starting over (after restarting the game). In the past when this on occasion would occur, leaving the VAB would remove the unattached assemblies and leave the main - not now. I have to exit the game and restart it before it will remove the corrupted assembly (and it will save it as the last auto-saved ship...and so help me if I reload it...) \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nStruts attach correctly, fuel lines attach correctly, I save, exit and return to find them either missing or totally rearranged (incorrectly).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nProbe cores don\u0026#39;t recognize that they have SAS when they in fact do - I tried to send an engineer into orbit to perform an eva repair, I would turn on the SAS, but when I switched to map view to time the launch, and returned to the ship view, it had turned it off and said that I had no SAS capabilities when I tried to turn it back on. If I take the exact same vessel and launch it straight from the VAB without switching views it works fine. If I remove the engineer and launch it unmanned, it launched fine - even after switching views, etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDoes any of this sound familiar? When Steam auto-updated my 1.04 install (Grrr) it was a total game breaker and I uninstalled and reinstalled a clean copy of the game - with no mods. But my addiction couldn\u0026#39;t be sated until I added some mods back in...\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T17:35:50Z","Content":"\nYou could have reverted your update back to 1.0.4.
