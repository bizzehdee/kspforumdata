Most of the programs I run is based on single-core speed so I picked myself up a 8086K. Since it seems KSP is more based on speed than core quantity, this CPU seems to do. Now about the RAM, does KSP benefit more from a larger quantity or faster ram? Cost is not too much of an issue, I just want to squeeze every ounce of power for my epic BDA battles and space missions when I feel like it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-05T19:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t skimp on RAM, or you\u0027ll regret it when the next big piece of software gets released. When I built for KSP I went with 32 GB, which was the most one could cram onto a consumer board at the time. Be careful on RAM speeds; your board choice is going to affect that more than your processor choice will. Board manufacturers will often certify certain RAM parts, so stick with what the board manufacturer says will work with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had KSP exceed 8 GB regularly but never exceed 10 GB. But at the same time I have NVidia Share running, which consumed some RAM as well. I also tend to build for reliability instead of speed, so I gave up on the xxxxK processors and went with a non-overclockable version of the same thing. In my case I went from the i4771K to the i4770 on the same board. Of course that was four years ago, and now I feel old.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t skimp on the power supply either. Those 80 Plus Platinum PSUs cost more because they work better. Back in 2014 Intel was picky about what PSUs would work on Z87-based boards and their Gen4 CPUs because they had lower tolerance for under-voltages and poor sleep-mode behaviour. I doubt they\u0027re any less picky these days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, get a decent SSD to run your OS and KSP on. If you\u0027re careful you could get away with 250 GB but I went with 500 GB because of temporary storage for video captures. I regularly offload my captured video to a hybrid 4 TB drive, though I\u0027m no expert on which ones of those are better. I used to keep a RAID-0 array for raw storage plus File History to an external hard drive because I figured I\u0027d get more speed out of the spinning rust, but that only gave me a PC-sized space heater. A single large drive is just as adequate, as long as you keep File History running on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd ignore those that say to disable this built-in service or disable that built-in kernel driver or what-have-you. That too will bite you in the long run when you install something else you\u0027ll need in the future. Assuming this is Windows 10, it runs KSP just fine without its built-in stuff getting in the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-05T20:01:55Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2018 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Gordon Fecyk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-05T20:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223462787\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022178754\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221538769553\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157121\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gordon Fecyk\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n29 minutes ago, Gordon Fecyk said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I built for KSP I went with 32 GB, which was the most one could cram onto a consumer board at the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile I\u0027m stuck over here with 8GB....
