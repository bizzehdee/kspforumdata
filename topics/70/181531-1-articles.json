Jebadiah was the main pilot and for fun I was doing an EVA at 300 m/s with Valetina. While she was close by, within 20 km or whatever the limit is, I was swithching back and forth with [ ] keys and the plane was staying in a stable flight without me touching any keys, but when I was out of range and had landed I switched via the tracking station and the plane had disappeared and Jeb was declared \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Killed in action\u0022\u003EKIA\u003C/abbr\u003E. This was just a split flight. I\u0027ve been in the habit of having one Kerbonaut base jump while having my landers come down with fully deployed \u0027chutes. Passes the time better than just watching the numbers sink. I land my kerbonaut nearby and re-enter the capsule or what not.

If you notice the [ ] switching is almost instant and I don\u0027t think their is a savings going on like when you switch out to the tracking station and the long load in between each, which should not be reflected in the \u0022game chronology\u0022 of events. After switching to the tracking or such you can\u0027t revert flights, but it shouldn\u0027t kill them off either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feiwuzei","CreatedById":193792,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-20T03:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just thought of what may have take \u0022time.\u0022 If there is a significant amount of time auto lapsed for the recovery of a \u0022flight\u0022 which ignores other flights.
