I don\u0027t have any modded part mods as far as restock for visurals all stock and dlc parts. Context, My ship im building started to have a issue where iI have a x8 row of thermal sheilds on 2 sides of my ship. what would happen is the part would glitch and 1 would remain still if I moved my entire ship. After deleting this and redoing the x8 row this message would pop up after I saved my game. After trying to reload the ship it would pop up with this message not allowing me to load it. Only way to load the file was to connect to a previous auto save.\u00A0\u00A0What could this be? Latest KSP on steam.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
