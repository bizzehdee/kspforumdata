Out of the blue, the \u0022Limit Throttle to\u0022 feature just stopped working. I first uninstalled and reinstalled MechJeb2 via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, which didn\u0027t work. I deleted all mods and reinstalled just MechJeb2 and Module Manager, that didn\u0027t work either. Even when I uninstalled the game, deleted all its files, and reinstalled the game from scratch manually, MechJeb2 still didn\u0027t work. I have no idea how to fix this and I couldn\u0027t find anything in KSP\u0027s LOG files about a possible MechJeb2 error. Can you help me out? Maybe I\u0027m not sure how to fix it, as stupid as it may be, but I\u0027ve been using MechJeb2 for years. Thanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
