Looked at the audio settings and they were all 50% to 100%. I removed all my mods, loaded it up, and no sound. Validated game files to see two were missing and I got them back, Loaded it up, No sound, Validated it again and it found another missing. I\u0027ve now reinstalled the game twice, and restarted my computer about five times, still no sound.Help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
