Maybe that will reset whatever weirdness is going on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen odd behavior from vessels moved with Hyperedit one time before. I wanted to test a lander before flying it to Minmus, so I hyperedited it to Minmus orbit and would try landing from there using Mechjeb to known coordinates. On descent the lander seemed to teleport\u00A030km\u00A0during the landing. It was a night side landing, so I couldn\u0027t really see what was going on. Toggling back and forth to map view I could see I was on target during descent, but when I could finally see the landing zone from lights on the lander\u00A0I was always way off. I did this about 5 times before giving up. Flying it to Minmus and landing normally had no problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedeyePete","CreatedById":114116,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-09-06T22:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRestarting the game did the trick.
