I\u0027ve never played\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP1 and since I haven\u0027t yet been able to build a rocket (I have no idea how so I\u0027ll have to watch some tutorials) I am not sure if it also looks like that when you are actually flying a vehicle. I followed the installation guide for\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP1 so I have scatterer, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, DOE, PlanetShine, and RSSVE installed. I have changed the settings to max in the regular settings menu, since I have a pretty fast computer, so I am not sure if this would cause it? If you need computer specs or any other log, I will try my best to post them. Thank you in advance.
