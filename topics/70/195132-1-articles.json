I am putting the PlanetWiki_v4.1.KSP and the Source folder in the Game Data Folder. The Wiki works fine - BUT I start having issues with other parts of the game. One issue that is consistent is that when setting up a Maneuver Node I no longer can see the Progress bar on the right side of the Maneuver Node. I do have the pointer that shows the amount of m/s I am using but I depend on the slider bar to side\u00A0when to shut down the engine. There may be other issues such as general glitching but I have not researched other issues. If I remove the Source folder and the KSP file the Slider bar returns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone else having this issue? Am\u00A0I putting the source folder in the wrong\u00A0location? I like the information presentation in the Wiki but I cannot use it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
