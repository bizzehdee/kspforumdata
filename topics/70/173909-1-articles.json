I took them out and it worked fine. Then I added TweakableEverything/Toadacious back in and it ran fine. Next I added\u00A0 MP_Nazari/CoolRockets and ContractConfigurator/ContractPacks and it failed. Then I added MP_Nazari/CoolRockets and it ran fine so obviously it was ContractConfig/Packs right? Well for some reason after adding everything else, I re-added ContractConfig/Packs back in (in order to take out the packs one at a time to figure out what was causing the crash) and... it ran.

I updated that and it ran, so then decided to update CC to it\u0027s latest version (which I believe was the same version however when updating one file was smaller) but it has worked since that update. I imagine it was a file that cocanates the packs for loading, and there was lingering data in that file so re-adding it from a vanilla point and having the packs update said file may have been the fix however I can\u0027t be sure because I don\u0027t remember the file\u0027s name as I clicked \u0022copy over\u0022 too quickly...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-15T05:11:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2018 05:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by shoe7ess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
