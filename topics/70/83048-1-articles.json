I was playing with Kerbal death in my mod, so I know how to trigger this. Basically, when you kill a kerbal you have to do two things - register them as dead (ProtoCrewMember.Die()) and remove them from the ship (Part.RemoveCrewmember(ProtoCrewMember)). If you register them as dead but don\u0027t remove them, you get the KIA screen. However, it still allows EVA/IVA. Simply exiting the ship and reentering it will cause the KIA status to clear.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
