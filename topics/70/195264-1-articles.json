There was some osculations of the added piece and my station which continued to become worse. In fear of damaging my station I elected to release the added portion and that portion flew out into space. Shortly after that happening KSP crashed. I reloaded KSP without any issues, however anytime I go to the tracking station and \u0022 Fly\u0022 my space station the game becomes very odd and I cannot select anything. I still have normal functions while in the Space center, tracking station and flying any other vehicle but once I select the station the game becomes unplayable. Any ideas on how to fix this other than \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022terminating\u0022 the station? Thank you in advance.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
