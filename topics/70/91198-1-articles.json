I have tried everything that I can think of. I have replaced the folder with one from my main install, one from my back-up mods folder, I\u0027ve copied and pasted the same folder back in, and I\u0027ve moved the AIES folder from the parts folder to the GameData folder. I have tried loading the game five times and always freezes at the same point. I have just installed Real Fuels and the Stock alike engine configs and that is the only difference between the two installs. I also would post my mods list but I stopped updating it and as a result it no longer reflects what I do have installed. Any help would be amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mike8005","CreatedById":130092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T03:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease upload your logs to pastebin\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uncle natzer","CreatedById":97775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T11:06:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/bdbcxkfj6jkol9p/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bdbcxkfj6jkol9p/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E Sorry, I guess I forgot to add that before I went to bed last night.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T11:33:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne of the AIES engines appears to be using a resource type that doesn\u0027t exist (or is incorrectly installed) and this is causing the loading process to hang.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EPartLoader: Compiling Part \u0027AIES_Aerospace/Engine/AIESdest5engine/part/dest5Engine\u0027\u003Cbr\u003EAdded sound_rocket_mini to FXGroup running\u003Cbr\u003EUDMH not found in resource database.

You may need a specific RealFuels engine config for AIES to adjust the engines\u0027 resources or you may have a mismatch in mod versions. Make sure that AIES, RealFuels and the Stockalike engine config are all up to date and try looking in the AIES and/or RealFuels threads to see if there is anything special you need to do (i.e. install a specific AIES engine config).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"uncle natzer","CreatedById":97775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-25T13:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk awesome.
