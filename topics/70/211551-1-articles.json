However, this problem persists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve done a clean install and it DID actually work then, including being able to open saves - however, when I install my list of mods it all breaks down and it just refuses to go beyond the loading screen.

For anyone that stumbles open here, here\u0027s what I did:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Re-installed all the mods MANUALLY and on versions I knew for sure would work (not using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E) as quite a few of the mods were corrupted // relaunched game and still did not work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Deleted settings.cfg to reset graphics settings // no luck\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point I realised that the problem may lie with the shortcut settings that I\u0027m using in steam:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E%command% -popuwindow -force-opengl\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(The above simply gets rid of the PDLauncher and forces the game to render using OpenGL\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. So I removed all the above shortcut targets // game actually launched, but was incredibly laggy and took extremely long to load due to it being in D3D11 - nevertheless, at this point I set all the graphics settings to how I\u0027d like them to be set as the game had already launched\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Forced OpenGL rendering // game launched, again, and faster, but still had some lag due to the AWFUL PDLauncher\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Added the %command% -popupwindow to launch the game without the launcher // game launched, no lag, and quickly, and is now working perfectly fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how, or why, this had fixed the problem? I\u0027m sure glad it did though, and I think I won\u0027t question it too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
