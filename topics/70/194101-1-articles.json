I ran through the entire mission, and none of those modes worked. To-orbit autopilot caused my rocket to just fly off the pad, turn south sharply, and then spiral out of control until it crashed. Took it to orbit manually on my second try, and then got the Munar intercept and circularization. I move kerbals into my lander and separate it from the CSM. I pick a spot on a relatively flat and low altitude section in one of the craters for the lander to land in, then start the landing sequence. It timewarps a bit, then does a short deorbit burn, then timewarps again until the lander smashes into the ground. Again, worked completely fine doing it manually, but I want to automate these missions so I can set up my Mun colony and mining station. Is TCA broken in 1.9 or something? I can\u0027t ever seem to get consistent results with any of its autopilot modes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
