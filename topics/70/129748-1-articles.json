Started getting several crashes\u00A0right away. So I went through and manually updated every mod, it seemed to help as many were outdated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter a while I noticed RARELY the game would hang loading, but mainly I would get dropped to desktop with no warning or displayed error (log folder still created). This usually happened when reverting a flight, bouncing to launch pad to VAB or other buildings. It slowly seemed to get worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I verified game files (steam), 1 file was reacquired, seemed the same though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWiped all mods and KSP, fresh install.
