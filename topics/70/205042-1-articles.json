Where it is now it overlays the Warp and Time widgets, and sometimes when I click on it I also activate the Warp.\u00A0Ideally I\u0027d like it along the upper right edge, but I can\u0027t seem to find a way to move it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) When I do select an item from the MJ2 drop-down, I see it\u0027s window open for a moment, then it disappears. I can see one corner of the item\u0027s window in the upper left corner of my screen, and I can left-click and drag it around the screen, and as long as I\u0027m dragging it the window is visible, but the moment I stop moving it, the window disappears (though it reappears the moment I start moving again), and when I release it, it goes back to being off-screen, with just the window\u0027s bottom right corner barely visible in the upper left corner of my screen.\u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve uninstalled and re-installed using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E multiple times without any change.

Then, when I clicked the \u0027Settings\u0027 button on the MJ2 drop down, the drop down jumped to the right closer to where I wanted it, and the MJ2 utility screens appeared on screen and stayed where I wanted them. I was then able to go back to the resolution setting and play with it until I had a display that worked for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-30T12:56:44Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2021 12:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by maddog59\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
