But I recently bought a new one (not because of KSP of course but because it was quite old) and first thought everything would be resolved : in fact it remained quite the same ; at least my computer doesn\u0027t tend to overheat like my previous one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Basically, when I say KSP is running slow, I mean the mission timer is ALWAYS yellow, at least until I get into space, and even up there, the timer is often yellow. The time passes by 2 to 4X\u00A0less than its normal rate, making it somewhat challenging and upsetting to fly my ships. I apologize in advance for the possible mistakes as I\u0027m French. Here\u0027s my KSP folder :\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022NG3wiDY.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NG3wiDY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlienFromTrappist-1","CreatedById":180077,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-23T21:56:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod count, computer speed, and computer power settings can effect the speed of the game. Also make sure you launch the game in 64 bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mraerospace","CreatedById":169260,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-24T14:29:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reply. Well I only had four mods installed, which are \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, SVE, Reentry Particle Effect and Scatterer but I deleted them as I updated by game to 1.3. I had realized that for 1.2.2 I had the 32 bit version of the games so I\u00A0made sure to download the 64 bit version : things have slightly improved, the timer still\u00A0remains yellow most of the time.\u00A0Here are my computer specifications :\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c05310180\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c05310180\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlienFromTrappist-1","CreatedById":180077,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-24T15:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest running the game in 1.2.2 64 bit, more mods are compatible and more \u0022kinks\u0022 are worked out.
