Since the craft is landed below the ground, the surface harvest does not detect the surface and will not start. I have a similar issue in water\u00A0except opposite. There\u0027s a sort of soft barrier 32 meters above the ground, and when you \u0022splash down\u0022 into it you bob just as if you were in the water. I say it is a soft barrier because if you are going fast enough, you can break through it and land in the actual water.
