For me, thats rather unsual, though not surprising. I held my main 64 bit (the one with astronomer\u0027s visual pack) back on 0.25 for stability reasons (though I\u0027m so in love with the gizmos its gonna be hard to go back, prayers for Unity 4.6.1 being slightly more stable in that department). This was not my 0.25 win 64 install so I\u0027m stuck dealing with instability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrash 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI loaded the game. I created a new savegame. I timewarped the first 100 days off my MET clock from the space center screen to bring a Duna window closer. I went to the tracking station for no reason at all. I left it and attempted to go the VAB. Crash. The output log looked a heck of a lot like a standard memory crash on 32 bit.

I loaded the same savegame. I went to the VAB, no crash. I played around building a lander hab in the style of Mars Direct using Nertea\u0027s station parts expansion. I went to launch as a TWR/landing leg clearance test. Crash. This one did not give me a \u0022the game has crashed\u0022 dialog and did not generate an output_log.txt, so sorry, but all I have is the KSP.log.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_BVD9gAcd6BcnpEa0VDcWktUVU/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP.log\u003C/a\u003E (this is huge too and pastebin is not happy)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELemme know if yall need error.log files too, because i have those ready to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T03:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnything? has anyone actually looked at the logs?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raven.","CreatedById":99340,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T05:26:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently troubleshooting similar issues with my 0.90 install that also has Astronomer\u0027s pack installed.
