I\u0027ve trawled Reddit, these forums and the rest of the internet for a few days now trying to find somebody with a similar issue/solution and I can\u0027t, although I won\u0027t believe I\u0027m the only person to see these. They happen randomly, although they tend to appear a lot after staging, and follow the vessel at a set distance, anywhere from inside the part to several hundred meters away [maybe further but I doubt you\u0027d notice them] EDIT: The one in the picture below is about 200m above my splashed down craft. It shot upwards from my vessel during descent at approx. 1000m altitude while I was dropping at about 110m/s. \n\nFor me personally they\u0027re also ultimately infuriating and are beginning to ruin the game because they just look too crazy. Yes, I use a metric poo-tonne of mods but I\u0027ve seen these on fresh installs as well, been noticing them on Windows and Linux 32 and 64-bit since version 1.x... Any thoughts you crazy cats?\n\n![screenshot10_zpsrtmuqa8e.png](http://i1333.photobucket.com/albums/w629/JimTaplin/screenshot10_zpsrtmuqa8e.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T14:49:45Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Space Cowbuoy**\n  \nNew observation"},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T16:08:43Z","Content":"The disk of light you sometimes get is a KSP bug in the way it handles lighting. One way to reduce the frequency of this error is to increase the number of light sources being used in the graphics settings menu (default 8, I think)."},{"CreatedByName":"Kaa253","CreatedById":68628,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T11:02:09Z","Content":"Try un-installing Distant Objects.
