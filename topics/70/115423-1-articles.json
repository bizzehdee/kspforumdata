My request is twofold:\n\n1) Would somebody be kind enough to take a look at my player.log to see if they can identify the issue and,\n\n2) Could they then post a short guide as to what they looked for to find the issue. I think doing that would be a great help to not only let the non-mod wizards among us self-diagnose but it may well help the mod creators themselves out by having to deal with less reports.\n\nThe reason I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on is that it just crashes and I\u0027ve got about 60 mods running, in Linux on a 8GB 64bit system. I\u0027m hoping that a quick look by someone that knows what they\u0027re looking for will narrow it down, saving me from having to add and test each mod one by one (which I think would be the final nail in the coffin for me and KSP! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)).\n\nAll pointers in the right direction are gratefully received - if it would be too much work to write out a guide for dummies then no worries.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Log**\n\n[http://www.filedropper.com/player](http://www.filedropper.com/player)\n\n**Mods**\n\nKSP: 1.0.4 (Unix) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Linux 3.13 Ubuntu 14.04 64bit\n\nFilter Extensions - 2.3\n\nUSI Tools - 0.4.1\n\nB9 Aerospace - 5.2.6\n\nB9 Aerospace Procedural Parts - 0.40\n\nCapCom Mission Control On The Go - 1.0.1.1\n\nChatterer - 0.9.5.86\n\nCommunity Resource Pack - 0.4.3\n\nConnected Living Space - 1.1.3.1\n\nContract Configurator - 1.5.1\n\nContract Pack: Anomaly Surveyor - 1.2.2\n\nContract Pack: Field Research - 1.0.6\n\nContract Pack: RemoteTech - 1.1.4\n\nContract Pack: Tourism Plus - 1.1.5\n\nContracts Window Plus - 1.0.5.2\n\nDMagic Orbital Science - 1.0.7\n\nEditor Extensions - 2.12\n\nFerram Aerospace Research - 0.15.3.1\n\nFirespitter - 7.1.4\n\nInterstellar Fuel Switch - 1.15\n\nRasterPropMonitor - 0.19.4\n\nKAS - 0.5.2\n\nKerbal Inventory System - 1.1.5\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\n\nKerbal Construction Time - 1.1.8\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.17\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.1.4\n\nKineTechAnimation - 1.1.2\n\nInfernal Robots - 0.21.3\n\nModularFlightIntegrator - 1.1.1\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator - 6.2\n\nFinal Frontier - 0.8.6.1370\n\nCivilian Population - 1.7\n\nPlanetShine - 0.2.3.1\n\nQuickScroll - 1.3.1\n\nQuickSearch - 1.1.3\n\nQuickStart - 1.1.2\n\nRCS Build Aid - 0.7.2\n\nRealChute - 1.3.2.3\n\nRemoteTech - 1.6.7\n\nSCANsat - 1.1.4\n\nSETI-Contracts - 0.9.2.1\n\nSETI-CommunityTechTree - 0.9.0.2\n\nSETI-Greenhouse - 0.9.2\n\nSafeChute - 1.7.1\n\nShipManifest - 4.4.1\n\nStageRecovery - 1.5.6\n\nTextureReplacer - 2.4.7\n\nThermal Monitor - 1.2\n\nTAC Life Support - 0.11.1.20\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.4\n\nTweakScale - 2.2.1\n\nUSI Exploration Pack - 0.4.1\n\nFreight Transport Tech - 0.4.1\n\nKarbonite - 0.6.2\n\nKarbonite Plus - 0.4\n\nKSP Interstellar Extended - 1.2.6\n\nWaypoint Manager - 2.3.4\n\nWider Contracts App - 1.1.2\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T20:31:19Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 08:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ryds**"},{"CreatedByName":"OddFunction","CreatedById":143805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T21:01:38Z","Content":"Hi,\n\nFor starters I would suggest removing FAR until the new update for it comes out. There have been reports of some gimbal issues, and lots of nullreferences. \n\nSecondly I did not notice any specific nullreferences.. other than EVE (which is normal) although I didn\u0027t look as thoroughly as I could. May I suggest along with uninstalling FAR, that you install the \u0027Stock Bug Fix Modules\u0027? The reason for this is because parachutes in 1.0.4 are causing FPS lag and crashes in linux. This may be your case. \n\nIf you try those two things and still crash on ascent please let us know.\n\nStock Bugfix Modules link\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Could they then post a short guide as to what they looked for to find the issue.

A good general process is to find nullreferences in your player.log file and to remove offending mods to test if that specific mod is the issue. Or a better process is to post here with lots of info and get help from somebody else ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) (my strategy!)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T21:07:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 09:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ryds","CreatedById":108453,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T21:11:30Z","Content":"Thanks for the comprehensive and helpful advice OF.
