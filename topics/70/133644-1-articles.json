Every time I try it, it won\u0027t work. The SPH works so I can make tanks and planes but nothing can come out of the VAB.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-07T04:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello,this will maybe sound silly,but did you put probe core or command pod on your craft and are you have sufficient electric charge?\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe you can post\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/128907-how-do-you-post-pictures/\u0022\u003Escreenshot\u003C/a\u003E of your craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeathKerb142","CreatedById":141060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-08T03:54:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not a n00b issue, it\u0027s an ICBM with a probe core, Z-4K battery, Weapon Manager, and a rotary bomb rack holding X payload(Usually nukes) covered by a faring\u00A0with solid boosters for an uppermost stage, i\u0027ve tried launching sats and and everything but it won\u0027t even exit the VAB.
