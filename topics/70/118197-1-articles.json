Secondly, when I stripped to stock to test a separate issue I noticed my VRAM usage in the Flight Scene was actually *less* than in the Space Center and got a better appreciation for how much mods can allocate additional memory when loading into the Flight Scene. So I did some more comprehensive testing, starting with a bin sort of my entire GameData folder (minus Squad of course) to see if I could track down any large memory hogs. Along the way I recorded several instances of the Flight Scene loading with less VRAM than the Space Center even as I put more and more mods back into the GameData folder. Two stood out however: SCANsat and HullCameraVDS. Here are the full results from Excel:\n\n![ofwR0hh.png](http://i.imgur.com/ofwR0hh.png)\n\nAs you can see, my 1.0.4 install now matches up properly with my 0.90 install for the Main Menu and Space Center (my 0.90 install has a larger GameData folder but I\u0027ve confirmed that the additional size is from textures, in which case ATM would treat them in 0.90 similar to how they are loaded in 1.0.4 so the GameData folder size difference is not a factor).\n\nMy 1.0.4 install is loading up an extra 200MB VRAM more than my 0.90 install, and removing HullCameraVDS and SCANsat confirm that they can more than make up for this difference, although interestingly when they are both taken out at the same time the RAM savings isn\u0027t quite as great as indicated, yet still substantial.\n\nDoing the same with my 0.90 install also provides some interesting results - most notably the fact that with both mods out of both installs, the VRAM usage in the Flight Scene is very close to identical, with 1.0.4 actually coming in slightly under 0.90.\n\nMy guesses are that for HullCameraVDS, the addition of the new camera filters and docking cam view are what bloated the mod in the Flight Scene. For SCANsat, DMagic came up with a way to have maps load faster, but I fear background loading of the maps is bumping up its RAM usage. I\u0027ll be addressing these issues in the appropriate threads. I know it doesn\u0027t seem like much, but 200MB of extra RAM is a couple of more scene changes before the game crashes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T04:16:25Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 04:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaiiden**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wolf Baginski","CreatedById":138549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T08:30:44Z","Content":"While SCANsat is one of the Mods that gives a good science return without being crazy, I can certainly see the point of not using it. I may be setting up a separate install for sandbox-style ops, without the extra Science stuff, though it does seem to rather miss the point. Maybe somebody should set up a decoration-only science mod which just has a few colorful boxes to stick on your craft?\n\nA quick check of the .cfg files shows that everything is done by the .dll, so just removing that folder would kill both the data collection and the part animations. I suppose the Module section would need deleting from the .cfg to stop any error messages. But that would give you a SCANsat lite as a placeholder, so that existing savefiles wouldn\u0027t be broken. The actual models and textures would still be there, referenced by the same internal name.\n\nAnd now I am wondering where SCANsat stores its data. It must store the locations scanned somewhere, even if the actual map data is generated from existing in-game sources.\n\nYep, that data is in persistent.sfs\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-18T08:33:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2015 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wolf Baginski**\n  \nAn obvious answer found..."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T09:00:34Z","Content":"DMagic has put in effort to reduce SCANsat\u0027s memory footprint, with good results too.
