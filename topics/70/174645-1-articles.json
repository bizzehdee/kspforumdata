Inside the right click menu the motor bar moves when I attempt to turn the wheels but other than that nothing happens. I\u0027ve read a couple post that said to make sure they weren\u0027t crammed or hitting things but they are all in the open. The only factor I can think that could be causing this other than a bug or outdated mod is that they are moving a huge load. I don\u0027t know how big exactly but it\u0027s by far the largest I\u0027ve ever moved. I\u0027m also using the wheels at maximum scale. They move forward and in reverse fine just\u00A0slowly but they don\u0027t even twitch when I try to turn them.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m also having a pretty annoying issue when it comes to clicking. It doesn\u0027t always happen and I believe it\u0027s related to performance when I\u0027m working on a massive design. If I switch out of build mode and go into position mode or rotate mode sometimes I have to click the part numerous times before it actually registers the click and displays the move or rotate menus. This is probably an out dated mod or my old pc but I thought I\u0027d ask to see if it was something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"guesswho2778","CreatedById":170733,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-09T03:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/185297-barons/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022185297\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/185297-barons/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Barons\u003C/a\u003Ethey dont \u0022turn\u0022\u00A0they lower rpm on one side to \u0022turn\u0022 like a tank\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-09T03:08:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2018 03:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by guesswho2778\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
