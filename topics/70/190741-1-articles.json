Find that folder on your old PC, copy it to a new spot on your new PC, and you can play directly\u00A0from that new folder without needing Steam. You might want to reset your graphics settings if your new PC is much better than your old PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany Steam users keep 2 (or more) KSP folders. 1 folder is the official , clean Steam install. Copy the folder elsewhere; put mods into\u00A0the 2nd folder and play from there. Only use Steam when you want to download a new KSP version, and immediately copy the new version to a 3rd folder.\u00A0This lets you test a new KSP version and new mods without jeopardizing your current saved games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Steller dude 63","CreatedById":196559,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-04T16:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeadJohn,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the clear great reply!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery nice to know this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will be doing a redone PC soon so this be great way to sort it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nout so I got the game and mods done again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne odd thing I just found doing a orbit rescue of some poor kerbals\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstuck on a part build station I had tumbling so I could not dock a\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrocket to get them off?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I had to design and build a big rescue rocket with 4 big space tugs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfitted to the robotic control rocket, planned to go up and using the tugs to grab the\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nstation and stop it tumbling and hold in stable way so another crew pick rocket can than dock and save my poor kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe odd thing I found was even with a well filled upper stage, the oxidizer which normally is higher than the liquid fuel, was used up in the burns faster than it should be?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuch that the rocket run out of oxidizer and left the rocket without enough to help burn the rocket fuel in orbit?\u00A0 I had to use the far slower Ion engines of the 4 tugs still on the sides of the rocket to get to the station orbit!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did the rocket system again after destroying the old one to help clear the orbit as it can\u0027t power up enough by Ion to be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new redesigned version had a better less fuel use!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nusing orbit rocket engine and more oxidizer and still the oxidizer got used 1.5 times more than I even had before this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe the 1.8.1 has a new fuel use bug?\u00A0 The tanks were the normal higher oxidizer compared to liquid fuel such that before now they always worked well burning the two equal.\u00A0 So much problems.\u00A0 So I having to redesign the craft again with 2.5 times more oxidizer just to run the rocket. very odd.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas you or anyone seen this too?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-04T22:42:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t used 1.8.1 yet.
