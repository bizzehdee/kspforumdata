On average, at least. The texture config for the volumetric clouds is missing, which I bet is a part of it, although I can\u0027t seem to find one. Not from the default config or AVP, which I\u0027ve uninstalled because it messes with my game in general ways. I\u0027ve concluded this because they seemed to resolve themselves once I deleted it. This part is a bit different from the rest, but every time I click \u0022add segment\u0022 to an Astra Porta part from Blueshift, my game crashes. First, the screen goes black while the session continues. Next, I hear explosions. While the screen is black, I can\u0027t press any buttons most of the time, so I have no choice but to end the game. When I can press buttons, I usually go to either the space center, where it\u0027s usually not black anymore, but right after that I go to the tracking station, where it\u0027s black again and I can\u0027t press any buttons again. Other times I\u0027ll just go straight to the tracking station and I get the same result. Apparently, once the screen goes black, my vessel deletes itself, only for me to load the game again and It\u0027s just sitting where it was untouched like nothing ever happened, still not counted as a ring segment. Also, I can\u0027t find the file location for the flags. (it\u0027s not in the root file) My full ksp save is\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zyLDB4g4k-c7DHqLBy_V69XTnDgR3IsP?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(including ksp.log)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
