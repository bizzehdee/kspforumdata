Not too long ago silly me accidentally modified some stuff in the GameData folder while the game was running and absolute hilarity ensued (and a very furious me). I was unable to find anyway to fix the problem so I literally had to go and build the game from scratch again (downloading a new KSP, downloading all the mods, modifying them to how I like, etc.). It took quite a long time to rebuild it. Now I\u0027m finding I\u0027m having the same issues I had in this new fresh build\u00A0(phantom forces, parts partially clipping and spazzing, random accelerations or decelerations while in the tracking station, stuff exploding, etc.). So before I throw my computer out the window I was hoping some other people might have experienced a similar problem and hopefully may have found some sort of solution (or can at least tell me what the problem is). I\u0027m more than happy to provide log files, screenshots, etc. if needed. I\u0027d really like to figure this out as I\u0027m trying to start a miniseries here on the forums and this keeps delaying it.
