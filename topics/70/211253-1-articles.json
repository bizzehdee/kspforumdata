Before all this mess, I was running at least 56 mods (or files, not all of them were full mods, maybe like integrity things but nonetheless 56 files) all in tandem and without issue on a world. I\u0027ve played like this for a couple months (since it wasn\u0027t too long ago, mid-late 2022 at least) and hardly anything ever went wrong, I\u0027d like to note that all these mods were installed manually\u003Cstrong\u003E without\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. The crash started when I was time-warping my LH2 rocket to the dark side of Kerbin, 5-8 times Time Warp to see the EC usage when all of a sudden the values of usage skyrocketed (no pun intended), the last value I saw was NaN and it crashed after freezing for a couple seconds.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI took a week long break from KSP after that but when I returned, the game \u003Cem\u003Ewouldn\u0027t load \u003C/em\u003Epast the Internal file of the Mobile Processing Lab, it was stuck for 7 hours nonstop (because I overslept while waiting). I found out that some of the mods I had installed were able to load the game but when working with some other mods I had before, would not load any further. Very rarely, it would even be unable to load certain aspects of a mod (real example; Heat Control Radiator not loading). So I ended up removing one mod at a time, if the added mod wasn\u0027t loading the game then I got rid of some of the files of that mod and introduce them one by one until I found the file that was the issue. This did seem to work but when I added a mod it, something happens and a mod that I haven\u0027t tampered with which either I already fixed or wasn\u0027t a problem, stopped loading.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis issue persisted for a week, without consulting anyone for advice yet, I\u0027ve completely removed all the mods and resorted to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to download what I needed.

Some are 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12. Mods that were giving me a headache were mainly ScanSat and SSTU.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried searching online for possible answers but I wasn\u0027t able to find anything, if anyone knows what\u0027s going on here, or by some miracle, a solution to revert it to normalcy, I\u0027d greatly appreciate it, please, thank you. I\u0027ll try my best to supply more info.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T03:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis tech support question has been moved from the KSP1 Technical Support (Console) section.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
