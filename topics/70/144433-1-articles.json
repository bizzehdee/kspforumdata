There were a few minor issues but mostly things seem to work with my old save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem started when I tried to simulate an interplanetary transfer to Moho. I get up into a stable orbit and then I want to start planning the maneuvers to escape Kerbin\u0027s gravity, align with and intercept Moho, etc. Maneuver nodes within Kerbin\u0027s system seem to work as I remember them more or less, but when I zoom out to an interplanetary view it feels like there are UI elements missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) I remember there being icons that showed where the planets were located. Now all I see is the colored orbit line itself which is brightly colored where the planet has most recently passed and fades to pale where it was a longer time ago. No icon to select or anything else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) When I make maneuver nodes in the interplanetary view, I can create them, manipulate them, see the resulting trajectories etc, but then when I click anywhere else to deselect it,\u00A0the node icon (the little honeycomb) vanishes. The dotted trajectories are still there and if I very carefully hover in that general area I can sometimes select it again, but that icon that makes it easy to spot and select the node just disappears. This doesn\u0027t happen when I make maneuver nodes in Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, only in the interplanetary region.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) I feel like there used to be a lot more information when you set a planet as target and tried to plan a maneuver to intercept, such as closest approach/pass etc. I can\u0027t see this info any more, and have only been able to occasionally get up that relative planar angle figure (forgot the technical name)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo any of these things sound normal or like they are caused by my own errors, or perhaps caused by the mods, or perhaps caused by my old save? I feel like something\u0027s not quite right here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you very much for reading!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-24T04:30:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm, this is a tricky one.

This was from flight mode map view with a ship, and yes I do have the tracking station upgraded to show conics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an update and what I\u0027ve done so far. First I tried restarting several times in both x64 and x86, as well as doing quick save and reload to refresh the scene (read about similar problems elsewhere and they said that it helped), but none of those things worked. I investigated it more closely and realized that the craft icon and honeycomb node icon would appear in the interplanetary region\u00A0if I zoomed in a great deal, but would vanish as I zoomed out far enough to do anything useful like see how my maneuver node trajectories were changing. That seemed to be the underlying issue (icons vanishing when zoomed out) but I couldn\u0027t figure out what was causing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I saw your reply and went with your idea to disable the mods (silly of me not to try this earlier, but thank you again for the recommendation). I pulled both mod folders out and started the game - BAM, things looked completely different. Suddenly I can see all the icons again even when zoomed out. The crafts, the ascending and descending nodes, the close approach, the maneuver node honeycombs, the planets, everything. I basically had no icons earlier but now it looks like before and feels right again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the weird part though: I put both mods back one at a time, and tried both x64 and x86 launches\u00A0and nothing has\u00A0broken it. Now I have both mods running again like I did before and the problem hasn\u0027t come back. I was hoping to figure out what caused this glitch and how to fix it but unfortunately I have nothing to report beyond my experience here. Thought I would write it down anyway in case anyone else has a similar issue or it helps track down the bug. I will update this thread if I encounter it again and can try to isolate what happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-24T15:19:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222688878\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144433\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469339433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166958\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Zo San\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, Zo San said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI pulled both mod folders out and started the game - BAM, things looked completely different.
