However, AVP doesn\u0027t show up on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s list, and the only post I can find here or anywhere about something similar\u00A0seems to be regarding a KSP beta from 2014.

And the two -HIGHLY RECOMMENDED- mods - TUFX and KS3P - do not show up either; I haven\u0027t been able to determine whether or not either has been updated yet. Few of the additional recommended mods show up either - most glaring is OPM, which I desperately want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any ideas? Am I missing a repository? Is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s list not up-to-date? Am I doing something wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPls help I want KSP to be even more awesome. I used to be ideologically opposed to mods and many KSP mods are really changing my thinking around this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-28T11:50:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re probably not seeing AVP because it isn\u0027t marked as 1.10 compatible- you can either switch the filter to \u0027all\u0027 or go to Settings \u0026gt; compatible KSP versions and add 1.9 (and 1.8) so \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E will accept all mods compatible with those versions as well as 1.10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a general rule, most mods that work in 1.8 and later will be OK in 1.10, though some changes to fairings and drag calculations in 1.10 can break parts that are made for older versions; for planet packs like OPM you\u0027ll need the bleeding edge Kopernicus- go to Settings \u0026gt; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E settings, click \u0027new\u0027 for metadata repositories and add the Kopernicus BE repo to get access to it via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khardankov","CreatedById":208396,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-29T07:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!
