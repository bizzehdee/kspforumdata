Whenever I zoom out, the view sort of distorts, as if it\u0027s extending the FOV/POV or something (I don\u0027t really know how to describe it). When I zoom in, the opposite happens. It seems that when I restart the game, it returns to normal, but it starts happening again after a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease note that this problem happened\u00A0on a second KSP install, which I copied into my Desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovAlpha","CreatedById":207200,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-04T00:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI experience a similar bug and the only way thus far I have been able to avoid it is to \u003Cu\u003Ehold down the alt key\u003C/u\u003E temporarily and \u003Cu\u003Etry scrolling in and out\u003C/u\u003E until it resets.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI hope it gets patched soon but until then I hope this helps!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
