If you open the debug console (Alt\u002BF12, or Alt\u002BF2) and attempt to Resume Saved, it should tell you which file it cannot load. Once you\u0027ve located the broken file, you\u0027ll need to either remove the persistent.sfs (along with the entire savegame) or restore a recent backup by copying another file in (a quicksave will work fine if you have a recent one) and renaming it to persistent.sfs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GFox8408","CreatedById":129865,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-22T03:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using a laptop (like i was having this problem with) one must press the \u0022Fn\u0022 key whilst holding F5 to save....and then HOLD \u0022Fn \u002B F9\u0022 to load!
