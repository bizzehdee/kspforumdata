I\u0027m hearing you can overclock just a single core and down clock the rest? Sounds like a pain but if it helps I might do it. GPU/HDs/PSU are all newer so no worry there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it really just all how fast a single core can go? Should I worry about ram speed? 32 gb enough? 16 is not!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ryzen 7 770x looks pretty nice... Trying to avoid Intel!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
