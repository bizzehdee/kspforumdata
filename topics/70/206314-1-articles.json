It can show you all the different parts for recovery and the estimated speed under parachutes. Now it is not correctly showing the full stages. It seperates stages at certain parts, although they are actually connected. Do I need to attach parachutes to all parts individually until everything highlights green or does it actually calculate properly when used? I\u00B4m running a long mission to the outer Kerbol system and would like to know how to save my upper stage after returning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/Gmk5Dvd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/Gmk5Dvd\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
