My ship would get a lot of different errors from this point so I stopped using mechjeb, didn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 error is my ship would lock up RCS/SAS wouldnt move the ship it was locked pointing in a fixed direction, Engines also didnt work, they would increase my m/s compared to the target in respect to the navball, though on screen it looked like no change. It would fluctuate a bit but i cranked it out to 300 m/s diffrence pointed at the target and the distance never changed in fact it would fluctuate in same cases the distance increased. The ship has power, exiting to the space center and jumping back into the ship fixed it temporarily, also reloading a previous autosave fixed it.. temporarily.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd error, despite having matching speed with the target in some cases when I time wrapped even to just the lowest power above 1x , my target shot off into space. I tested it I let it sit at normal speed 1km away with matching speeds no change for 5 mins. I hit the 2nd chevron the thing just shot off and was out of view range in about 3 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I use mechjeb a lot so complicated maneuvers like this arent really my forte if i have to do em manually and ive never tried to rendezvous with something with this eccentric of an orbit ( about a 4mil KM difference between ap and pe ) even with mechjeb. ( though mechjeb worked fine when I first captured the asteroid and that thing was on escape velocity, a combinations of commands finally got it close as to my knowledge there is no rendezvous with asteroid command and the regular rendezvous command dosent work well with stuff not technically in orbit )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this is just down right unexplainable the thing is either under its own considerable amount of power judging by the speed changes, which is impossible... I hope\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr somthing is very very bugged\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMod List- Mechjeb , MKS/OKS, Asteroid recycling technologies, a few parts packs , Lack Luster Lab ( both ships in question use parts from this including engines) KAS , Kerbal Joint reinforcement... plus quite a few more but i don\u0027t think they would conflict. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea/help.... ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
