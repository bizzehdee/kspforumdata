Are you using 1.1.3, the latest version? It fixed a lot of the crashes in 1.1.2. Do you have the latest versions of all the mods? \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/101540-113-tweakscale-v2213jun-24-the-chainscaling-update/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ETweakscale thread.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Because there are in fact two.

I can\u0027t find the 1.1.3 thread, so... Anyways. If you have all fully updated mods and it is still happening, try uninstalling them one by one. When the problem stops, if it stops, you\u0027ve found the mod that (should have been) is giving you trouble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope I helped!
