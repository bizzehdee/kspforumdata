You\u0027re also posting in the modded support area so I\u0027m going to assume you\u0027re using mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few things could be causing the game to not load, but to get a definitive answer we\u0027ll need some more information:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPC specs- CPU, GPU (if you have one) and RAM are the most important. Running too many mods will eat up your RAM and can cause the game (and indeed your entire PC) to grind to a halt; CPU affects in-game performance more than loading but since KSP is bottlenecked by processor speed it can make a big difference.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA list of mods that you\u0027re using- you can get this easily via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E if you used that to install your mods, or alternatively screenshots of your GameData folder are usually enough to get most of them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLog files. There are two main log files for KSP- one is KSP.log, found inside the KSP root folder, which is less detailed, and the other is Player.log which is buried deep in a folder tree inside a hidden folder and is harder to find, but has more information in it. Here\u0027s how to get the logs and what to do with them once you have them:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83212-how-to-get-support-read-first/\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Please don\u0027t paste the logs directly into the forums, it\u0027s really hard to read even on a PC, let alone a tablet or mobile.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s unusual for the game to stop loading on a stock part, which might indicate that your installation of KSP has been corrupted in some way- reinstalling the game, or verifying the files through Steam if that\u0027s where you got KSP, could fix the problem. Just remember to back up your save games first, copy\u002Bpasting the folders inside KSP/saves to the desktop will do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-11T12:50:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my experience the thing listed on the screen is the last thing that loaded correctly, so likely the problem is in the NEXT thing that loaded (or failed to load).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022199902\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/199902-jimmymcgoochie/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@jimmymcgoochie\u003C/a\u003E suggested, log files are the only way to know what is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-11T12:51:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2021 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Superfluous J\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
