Is this something that has happened to others as well? It\u0027s the last step to recover my old save (and by extension those older craft saves as well). What\u0027s even more interesting is that some stock craft are throwing the same error (even after a full reinstall).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf necessary I can upload one of the troubled craft saves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-01T12:11:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2020 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by simtom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
