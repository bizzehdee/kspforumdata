I just have a... unique way of expressing my passion for things shall we say (and leave it at that) ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)."},{"CreatedByName":"Ald","CreatedById":121195,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-10T18:03:08Z","Content":"Perhaps I could throw in my two cents into the discussion.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Samsung 7 Series Gamer\n\u003E \n\u003E A 2.4GHz i7\n\u003E \n\u003E 32GB of RAM\n\u003E \n\u003E A 675M GT\n\nKSP and Unity basically is CPU heavy. While having a much worse CPU here (Phenom II x4) I\u0027m able to run about 80-100 mods without much problems in a sensible framerate. GPU influence is negligible (well... maybe not in the AMD-Linux-opengl case).\n\n1) First of all - you need to answer a question: 32 or 64bit? Second question would be: Windows or Linux? Possible scenarios:\n\n- **Windows 32bit** - basically you play till you hit the 32bit RAM limit. You can delay it by not using RAM hungry mods, or by cutting out parts you know you won\u0027t be using (example? I reduce my part list on loading by removing most fuel tanks and fuel adapters in favor of **Procedural Parts**).\n\n- **Windows 64bit** - You can try stuff mentioned in **Windows 64 bit community workaround.** It is considered a hack, so no warranty it will work properly (but you can always check it out). Keep in mind, that you better not make any bug reports while using this method, as generally win64 unity player executable is considered unstable and therefore mod authors are not supporting it and/or disabling it in their mods. I do understand the motives behind it, as for getting a spam of support requests can be frustrating (as it is not the fault of the mod that something crashes, but the broken win64 unity player exe). You\u0027ll also need **[WIN][1.0.X] KSP x64 Total Unfixer** for mods that disable themselves when detecting that KSP runs in 64bit. Assuming you\u0027re using them. **Also (again) I would like to point that important thing about not bugging mod developers while using this method**. It is a crash-sandbox for you only. If it is too buggy for you - choose other option. \n\n**- Linux 32bit -** I don\u0027t see the point of using this combination, so i\u0027ll skip it (similar to win32bit option).\n\n**- Linux 64bit** - This is the place, where fun starts. 64bit linux build of KSP is rock solid (my main career is hosted on this option). It can take tons and tons of mods and still run quite fine. Only downside of massive modding would be initial load time and loading times in scene switching. Everything except that is golden. Well... maybe the borkyness of using AMD drivers under linux (my case), but it is manageable. **\u003C- BEST OPTION** if you can spare few gigs on making a dual-boot on your laptop. And it ain\u0027t that hard (trust me).\n\n2) clean KSP installation. Your base (if you don\u0027t want to download it all the time). Keep one vanilla copy. Then make an actual gaming copy (it is nice to also make a testing copy for... testing purposes).\n\n3) If you\u0027re going with the Windows variant - try \u0022**-force-d3d11**\u0022 option to save some ram. Or the opengl variant \u0022**-force-opengl**\u0022 (\u0022**-popupwindow**\u0022 for those alt-tab problems).\n\n4) If you\u0027re going with the Linux variant - \n\n     [B]LD_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022 __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1 LC_ALL=C ./KSP.x86_64[/B]\n\nor \n\n    #!/bin/shexport LC_ALL=C export LD_PRELOAD=\u0022libpthread.so.0 libGL.so.1\u0022export __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS=1\n\nI\u0027m never sure which one is better. Both work though.\n\n5) Go fiddle with the ingame config. \n\nExperiment with the ammount of physics done in a timeframe. \n\nExperiment with renderer.\n\nExperiment with the texture quality.\n\nExperiment with shadows and lights.\n\nTry different options. Go crazy.\n\nHope this may help you. \n\nIf in doubt - test it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nStuff I mentioned above is basically bits and pieces I managed to gather from various topics.

Any ideas what/why?\n\nWould I also be better ditching CKAN and just downloading the mods manually? I know what to do there as that\u0027s how I was doing it before on Windows.\n\nUPDATE: Followed this: [http://linuxgaming64.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/how-to-play-64-bit-kerbal-space-program.html](http://linuxgaming64.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/how-to-play-64-bit-kerbal-space-program.html) to the letter and now it won\u0027t run. Steam runs fine, this doesn\u0027t even attempt to launch.\n\nUPDATE 2: And what I did there was invoke Sod\u0027s Law as it\u0027s now running after a cache reverify. I\u0027m using the little applet that gives you the RAM and FPS usage and even after the first gig it turns red - I\u0027m assuming that\u0027s because it\u0027s freaking out about the custom app, Linux, x64 and so on and so on? KSP just broke the binary 4GB mark (i.e. 4096) and seems perfectly happy to keep loading at... speed! I\u0027ll configure the applet if I can to flag up at a higher figure.\n\nI\u0027d still find having CKAN about to keep track of my mods useful - can anyone provide any advice on what to do next without breaking what I\u0027ve managed to get working? All my mods are copied over from the Windows partition\u0027s GameData folder so weren\u0027t loaded in with CKAN.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T11:06:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 11:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CorporalRutland**\n  \nLots happening all at once!"},{"CreatedByName":"Ald","CreatedById":121195,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T17:19:54Z","Content":"You can try this tool for mod management: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26031-AnyOS-KSP-Mod-Admin-v2-Mod-install-with-a-few-clicks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/26031-AnyOS-KSP-Mod-Admin-v2-Mod-install-with-a-few-clicks).

I totally forgot KSP-AVC will at least tell me when to update and I also completely forgot ModMan (shame on me). \n\nIt\u0027s weird - CKAN works fine for a while and then the mouse controls get really unresponsive unless you double click. Then it gums up so if you\u0027re lucky you get to install your list so far, only the list finishes but never actually allows you back to the main page, so you have to log out of Ubuntu and back in again...\n\nHowever, let\u0027s focus on the good - flies along like butter even with a whole gamut of mods and parts installed and looks great too. I\u0027m still finding Ubuntu very tricky to get to grips with but some of the terminology is beginning to actually mean something now and I can actually see its merits as a separate OS for gaming.\n\nThere\u0027s a chap doing an x64 shell for *The Sims 3* (another game that encourages mod-happiness but can\u0027t cope with it, although it does at least have a crude load-on-demand system) that I hope I\u0027ll be able to make talk to Ubuntu.\n\nThanks again to everyone for the help, pointers and, above all else, patience. Much appreciated.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T23:00:39Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CorporalRutland**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainGeoluread","CreatedById":149542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T10:10:50Z","Content":"sudo apt-get install preload\n\nMove CKAN.exe to the KSP directory\n\n    chmod 7 ckan.exe\n\nPartial result.
