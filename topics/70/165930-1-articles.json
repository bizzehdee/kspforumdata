After the patch installation and reboot, I started up KSP and I\u0027m having some very strange things occur. A ship which was working just fine, suddenly the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters came on and won\u0027t shut off\u00A0causing the ship to (pitch or yaw) rotate, continuously. This was when attempting to fine tune the closest approach to a target, using mechjeb. Also, the math seems to be weird now...the next maneuver node is listed as \u00221h\u00A095m 76s\u0022 away, the ship doesn\u0027t seem to want to auto warp...just a ton of things all over the place. I uninstalled and then reinstalled \u0027better burn time\u0027, and \u0027better warp\u0027, and the time for the next node got better, but everything else is still a problem. Maybe uninstall and reinstall mechjeb?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I tried an uninstall and an install of mechjeb. That didn\u0027t seem to do much. I also noticed the maneuver icon on the navball is not moving at all. Yes, the ship is changing orientation...it did a full 360 rotation (again I wasn\u0027t paying attention to if it was pitch, yaw or some combination) and the maneuver target icon never moved. So it is possible that the patches applied have broken something in mechjeb, or in the game where mechjeb interfaces to it. I\u0027m getting the following error message:\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechjeb module MechjebModuleNodeExecutor threw\u00A0an exception in OnFixedUpdate: System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object:\u00A0 at ManeuverNode.GetBurnVector(.Orbit currentOrbit) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 at MuMech.MechJebModuleNodeExecutor.OnFixedUpdate () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 at MuMech.MechJebCore.FixedUpdate () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did try removing the previously set target, and then setting it again, aborted the maneuver node, removed all nodes, asked it to create node, and I get the same burn time, and time to node, and I get the same thing...the ship does a 360 degree rotation, stops close to where it started, but not on the maneuver node icon, which still is not moving when the ship changes attitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-28T02:21:43Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2017 02:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Michel Bartolone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadditional information available after some other changes\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
