Everything is in a constant state of wobble and doesn\u0027t even center on the spot its supposed to center on. Happens regardless of if I have the RCS on or not, happens instantly with any SAS of any kind.\n\nThis NOT a gimbal issue, I\u0027m aware of that issue, but I have no engine attached for this stage, and it happens without any kind of thrust.\n\nI have a list of 38 mods and version checker won\u0027t copy to clipboard for me, if you\u0027re aware of any mod that could be the problem please suggest it (could be stock too? I\u0027ve not launched anything this small in a long time).\n\nEdit: I repeated an earlier test with low SAS probe cores and it now works, possibly because of removing Intersteller and Tweakscale?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T23:39:28Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Requia**"},{"CreatedByName":"TORCHWOOD","CreatedById":144040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T03:01:29Z","Content":"Tweakscale caused numerous issues for me, so I removed it before the 1.0 release.

Sometimes they will not scale correctly. Too much SAS is uncontrollable even in stock. Also on smaller vessels having more than 1 SAS source can be uncontrollable. If you launched multiple sats from one rocket, if they were upside down on the parent vehicle, they could be confused and torquing in the wrong direction. (bast practice is to have all probes facing in the same direction.)\n\nAnother possibility - it sounds like you may be using Better Than Manned? If you are using directional antennae, or an antenna in the chain is continuously powering/depowering, your sats might be continuously losing/gaining control rapidly. Make sure you have enough batteries on every satellite to buffer any SAS or transmission drain to prevent brownouts."}]}
