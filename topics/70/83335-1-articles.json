Fun? Or is it perhaps a chore, a chore we take on in *addition* to giving you lots of mods (not like that\u0027s a business either), and so maybe it\u0027s fair to expect to meet in the middle in regards to the workload of support?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it happens to be the case that 3.6GB is right in the danger zone (as Padishar says). And we appreciate your at least collecting logs and having *some* information about what mods are installed. But when you start complaining about chores, consider that even if you follow the sticky, the modder (or mod or helpful person) who answers your question has to do...perhaps somewhat less work than you, it\u0027s true.
