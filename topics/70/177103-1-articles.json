I uninstalled all my mods and\u00A0reverted back to 1.1.3 as\u00A0hellblazer uses on almost all his amazing videos, and tried to install with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E but it always says incompatible. Also tried 1.2.2 but still no luck. I tried to manually install\u00A0the mod\u00A0but it seems more involved than the usual copy and paste of the gamedata files. I attempted to copy and paste the files to the corresponding folders that I found, but there was a folder from the mod that didn\u0027t exist in the game. there are also a lot of files just randomly listed with nowhere to put them. can anyone help me install this mod? thanks!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-27T21:19:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt sounds like you are making this a lot harder than it needs to be.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to specifically play with this mod (i\u0027m not familiar with it, but then again, there\u0027s a lot of mods out there), then go to the mod\u0027s forum thread, figure out what the latest stable version of KSP it supports, install that KSP.\u00A0\u00A0 Then down load the mod.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Install the mod folder into [KSP Directory]/Gamedata.
