Alshain is very likely correct regarding the graphics card having nothing to do with it. While I have no idea what\u0027s causing the problem, here\u0027s how I would approach finding it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECopy your KSP folder to somewhere else (desktop for easy access?). Remove all the non-Squad mods from the GameData folder in the copied KSP folder. Launch KSP from that folder, and since your saved game will now almost certainly be broken, create a new sandbox game and test out docking in there. If it works correctly, exit the game and add one of the mods. Test again, and keep adding new mods and testing until the problem comes back. If it doesn\u0027t work with all mods removed, then the next step is to try an updated KSP (remember you can keep a copied 0.90 elsewhere) and see if the issue persists there. That\u0027s a pain in the backside fix, but from here it looks like your best bet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cosimas","CreatedById":82021,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T16:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks danfarnsy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve just started a new game, in the current KSP folder, with all the mods, and launched two simple ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey docked as normal, targeted each other fine etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the graphics card making the game run a lot faster, the autopilot \u0022point at target\u0022 option is now quite jerky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m now going to go back to my main game, and on the next docking, see if I can pinpoint the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this stage, I think it may have something to do with switching ships whilst docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it will be easier to explain if I can capture what happens on video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be back with more news later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T17:13:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso danfarnsy\u0027s method is slow. Don\u0027t add mods one at a time, list out all your mods and add (or remove) half at a time. So if you\u0027ve got 100 mods and it\u0027s in the 82nd mod, you\u0027d add 50, test, add 25, test, add 12, test and see the error, remove 6, test and notice the error is gone, add 3 and notice the error is back, remove 2 and see the error is still there, and thereby know that it\u0027s in the 82nd mod.
