I am building a base on the mun, and ya its had its issues, like one where I just launched a supply vehicle back off the mun after it brought some parts that made a flag launch into space. I hit quick load because a flying flag is fine if its rooted, but, it killed bill\u00A0in the process. I check my tracking station to make sure that flag is back where it belongs after the quick save, and notice something. One of my ships that I had parked in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E is gone. just flat out GONE. I did not deorbit and recover the crew, I did not recover the crew via ANY MEANS. I check the astronaut complex and the ONLY missing kerbal is Bill. That ship that vanished had 4-7 crew on it, and they are not listed as assigned or missing. I cannot remember their names, because I launched that ship in year 9-10 and its now \u00A0year 14 day 108.
