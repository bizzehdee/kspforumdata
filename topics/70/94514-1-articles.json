Traditionally I play the game in x64 with little issues (surprisingly), however with the new .90 release the upgrade features are unavailable in 64 bit so Ive reverted to 32 (much to my dismay). Oddly enough, I was playing for a better part of the day yesterday when suddenly my game crashed... as it occasionally did with little issue restarting. However, this time and ever since then, I have been unable to get the game past the load screen. My game was running at approx 2.5ishGB before, whereas now apparently it jumps to something like 4. Ive been running in opengl, Ive removed mods, Ive replaced EVE textures to lower resolution, Ive manually changed the settings.cfg file to run textures at 3... and Ive manually \u0022unblocked\u0022 each of the .dll files.. nothing works. So I ask you this... for you log reading gurus out there... maybe you see something in my most recent output log that points to a troublemaker mod? or... do you all have a means to get the upgrade facility feature to work in x64 and steps to import my 32bit game to 64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutput Log here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/prr3bfkkm27n7ie/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/prr3bfkkm27n7ie/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything else is needed please let me know.
