I had the opposite problem where control surfaces would deflect to maximum positive yaw without input. My advice is to fall back to 1.0.4 until things settle down. A lot of mods are broken in 1.0.5 because of various aero/drag/thermal model changes.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheBarnetts","CreatedById":117269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T23:39:37Z","Content":"\nAh, should have known.

Right now MechJeb\u0026#39;s developer is working on an official release for 1.0.5 but it is likely going to take some time between Fallout 4 and the potential impact of certain current events (he lives in Paris).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would personally recommend playing with 1.0.4 so you can get used to how MechJeb works, then switch to 1.0.5 when the official MJ version is released. There are some changes in the main game in 1.0.5 that are better than 1.0.4 (more realistic aero/drag/thermal models, plus buoyancy model that makes water landings actually possible), but nothing that would make 1.0.4 unplayable.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"genericeventhandler","CreatedById":149557,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T22:30:54Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027TheBarnetts\u0027]Hello,\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechjeb will not turn or actuate the control surfaces despite saying it\u0026#39;s gravity turning.
