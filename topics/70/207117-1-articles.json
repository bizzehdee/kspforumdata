For some reason my crafts have nodes just disappearing on the bottom of parts. The modes may work and allow me to place a few parts;... but then I try to drop a new part on the stock, but the bottommost part\u0027s node just disappears. I can put a new part in its place and it changes nothing. Then, I can even pull off old parts from the stock and suddenly nodes will stop working farther up the chain, that were working prior.\u00A0 In these example pictures, the decoupler on the ship actually had a fuel tank originally on it... when I pulled off the tank, the node it was originally coupled to just totally disappeared.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-03T04:37:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m seeing issues with restock and kerbalism and configs.\u00A0 kerbalism is complaining about nodes.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know what parts are specifically affected, but I would look at those two mods to start with.\u00A0 I saw only a few exceptions in the log...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince I saw texture issues with restock, and node issues with Kerbalism, I would look at removing those mods and reinstalling them.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst remove those mods and try creating a vessel.\u00A0 \u00A0if that works, then reinstall each and test after each installation.\u00A0 they might be corrupted, or just out of date... not sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-03-03T04:38:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2022 04:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Papa_Joe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-03T09:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you tell me what lines you saw what you saw?
