They are docked inside with the jr. docking port. When launching, I first have to click something called \u0022disconnect node\u0022 before I get the \u0022undock\u0022 button. Now, when I switch to it, the fuel is still in the satelite, because I have locked the fuel tank before launch. I just unlock fuel and activate the engine, but do not throttle up. Instead, I switch immediately back to the cargo shuttle and throttle it up; then I switch back to the satelite, it is suddenly magically out of fuel. \n\nSecond bug: I then launched the second satelite, unlocking fuel, activate engine and throttle it up before switching to the cargo shuttle. After the maneuver, the satelite which I launched first and is faulty, has vanished. This might be due to a naming collision?"}]}
