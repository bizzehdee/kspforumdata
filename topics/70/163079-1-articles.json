Another glitch or bug is when I add particular parts to my craft, I think it\u0027s the winglets, like the 3x5m, 5x6m or whatever, when I launch the craft, it just gains speed at like 500m/s within 3 seconds or something, and then breaks apart and explodes. What could be causing these? I\u0027ve installed B9 correctly, so it isn\u0027t that, but what are your suggestions as to why these are happening?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
