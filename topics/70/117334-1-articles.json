When I ran my tests, including stock tests such as mystery goo, it said it was a Class C. The asteroid weighed a tad over 250 tons, and when I let go of it to test again it registered as Class-D in the observatory/tracking station. So it appears there is something off about the way the science systems determine the class of the asteroid you are attached to."}]}
