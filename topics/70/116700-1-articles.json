I built a ship using stock, porkjet atomic age and quiztech aerospace engines and now I have issues. Mechjeb says that I have infinity delta v while Kerbal engineer says that I have 0. This is for all engines, no matter which one I select it always says this. I have fuel and oxidizer left over in the tanks connect to the engines. Note, this problem only appeared once I entered orbit, so before the delta v calculations were fine. Any suggestions as to what to try?"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T01:58:55Z","Content":"Don\u0027t the porkjet atomic jet engines run forever?

Also, the engines still consume fuel so it\u0027s not true infinite power like MechJeb says \n\n![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"dbmorpher","CreatedById":77927,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T01:13:50Z","Content":"It could be that the two modes are messing with MJ\u0027s calculations"}]}
