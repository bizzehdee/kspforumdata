Per unattributed suggestions (sorry to forgotten person) I modified the part to increase thermal conductivity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@PART[stackPoint1]:AFTER[squad] {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E heatConductivity = 0.95 // default is probably 0.12\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut the problem continues. I turned on the thermal data and noticed something strange. One BZ-52 usually \u0022fails\u0022 after warping and four are attached to a \u0022Rockomax X200-16 Fuel Tank\u0022. I noticed this tank had a Cond Flux of several thousand (about 8K IIRC and dropping rapidly) shortly after one of the failures. I did not notice any unusual temperatures (all around 200-300) but one (of four) BZ-52\u0027s had already failed due to overheating (temp \u0026gt;2K). That seemed odd, especially since you would expect that after warping all temperatures would have reached equilibrium or that each BZ-52 would have heated roughly at the same rate. Before warping there had been a short burn with a Skipper engine and the temperatures had appeared to be in equilibrium after the burn. I\u0027m wondering if some attempt is made after a warp to all at once equalize temperatures starting in some sort of pattern and that is somehow leveraging a weakness in the BZ-52/temperature interaction?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize other people have temperature problems with the BZ-52 and just do not use them. I am curious if anyone else that is having trouble with the BZ-52 has seen the same thing or may know of other solutions to the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, how is heat conductivity modeled in the game? Heat conductivity should be the rate that heat moves through a material. But each part is only modeled with a uniform heat. In other words, the heat on one side always equals the heat on the other (infinity thermal conductivity). So what exactly does the game use \u0022heat conductivity\u0022 for? Does a low heat conductivity make a part heat up faster, cool faster, both, neither, how does it interact with the heat conductivity of surrounding parts, etc... Does the game use the attached surface area to model heat transfer between parts and is there something about the BZ-52 part model that is impeding this? If a part has a Cond Flux of 5K does that mean that the Cond Flux from all attached parts has to equal -5K (not assuming flux into or out of these parts too)? Why would I see a large Cond Flux without a corresponding large temperature change? The mechanics are all very fuzzy so thank you to anyone who can clarify some of it. :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 1.0.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EColor Coded Cans\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel Tanks Plus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyperEdit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKIS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModular Rocket Systems Lite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENav Ball Docking Alignment Indicator\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETAC Life Support\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer Window Planner\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUniversal Storage\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
