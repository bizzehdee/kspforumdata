I\u0027ve been putting together a nice customized install for my newest JNSQ playthrough. My system has 16GB of RAM, and is technically able to handle everything. However, the issues soon arise. First off, the game will not load without a database reload, as the loading itself stops with a\u00A0System.Reflection.ReflectionTypeLoadException. After the database reload which only takes a few minutes, the game can continue to the main menu... kind of. The game loads, but all you can see is Kerbin and the three Kerbals, without any Scatterer features or the main menu buttons and title ever popping up. The music also stutters badly, and my entire PC has actually locked up before due to this. It required a hard restart. I found this error in the logs, which may be related to this. However, if at all relevant I must mention that all of these mods were installed by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, which is not exactly known for allowing incompatibilities.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[LOG 22:26:50.143] EVEManager: Issue loading PQSManagerClass!

I have here the KSP.log and the ModuleManager logs from my final session while troubleshooting. I also have a screenshot of the full modlist, if it helps at all.

However you do have a few patches that can\u2019t be applied because you are missing dependencies. I also saw 4 x MiniAVC mentions (these are to do with version checking) but this is known to be buggy now. There is a mod that disables them all by default (or i just delete them manually).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E nre and lack of Scatterer obviously points to issues with those although looking at your mod list it doesn\u2019t look like you have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E installed?

I\u0027m a very busy person, and I simply do not have time to debug such a mess of an install. But thank you anyway!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
