Then i went screw fairings and i figured it was aerodynamic enough. Then when i got to the rocket first stage engine i realized what was wrong... some of the parts i was using from KW rocketry had shrunk even though the green little ball for connecting was in the same place so it would have space between what you attached it to and the engine. I realized that all the 5m engines had shrunk to 3.75 meters even though their stats like thrust are the exact same. same problem with my fairings too. it might just be my graphics or something i have no idea im not some kind of computer genius. i didnt check any other parts except the fuel tanks for 5m and they were completely fine. Stock parts and other mod parts seemed fine too. What is wrong? please help (its kind of hard to assemble a space station when my rockets arent exactly working)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-18T20:27:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate your mods.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DARGON606","CreatedById":126393,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T13:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUpdate your mods.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already said i did update them and i just checked and every KW rocketry engine is glitched.
