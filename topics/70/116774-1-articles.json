I have a ton of mods installed, but they all worked fine up until today, and nothing changed to my knowledge. I\u0027ve gone through and tried to isolate the mod that\u0027s causing the issue, but for whatever reason I can\u0027t seem to find out. KSP crashes if I have any mod installed. The only way it works is if there are no mods. I tried a clean install and verifying local files, but still nothing. Any suggestions?\n\nHere\u0027s my GameData folder\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/qxbpy9a1lq7q9p9/Screenshot%202015-07-24%2019.53.45.png?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qxbpy9a1lq7q9p9/Screenshot%202015-07-24%2019.53.45.png?dl=0)\n\nAnd the latest error log (with all original mods back in place):\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f972cmon9ujuhl9/AAASRjOINc4Ga9EUFiUFvHJWa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/f972cmon9ujuhl9/AAASRjOINc4Ga9EUFiUFvHJWa?dl=0)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!
