I have a modded install that adds another solar system and the outer planets mod. This means that I have 2 suns in the sky. I don\u0027t know if that affects it or not but I am listing it to give as much info as possible if needed. I first noticed this when the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E was in darkness with the sun high in the sky. If there is any more information you need then I will provide it to the best of my ability. Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T00:53:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may want to edit your post and mention the other solar system and your KSP version. In any case the other solar system may be out of date and is causing Kopernicus (and Scatterer if present) to malfunction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
