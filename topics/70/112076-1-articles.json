But you might still be crashing because of exceeding the 32bit memory limit. Can you post:\n\nYour operating system \u002B whether or not it is 32 bit or 64 bit?\n\nTell us if you use 64bit Kerbal Space Program or 32 bit? This will be different from your operating systems \u0027bittage\u0027, of course.\n\nCan you tell us through the task manager what your games memory usage is after 7-8 minutes of active playtime?\n\nAnd finally, are you aware of the temperature gauge memory leak, and have you taken steps to alleviate that?"},{"CreatedByName":"McPoisoned","CreatedById":138265,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T08:20:09Z","Content":"It\u0027s probably caused by the temp gauge leak (will be fixed in 1.0.3)... Are any parts overheating before your game crashes?"}]}
