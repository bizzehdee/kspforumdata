I figured out how to edit the \u00A0power of individual antenna parts to increase their effective range - is there any way to do the same for the KSP deep space network? Currently, the stock highest level antennas (100G base) with a level 3 DSN can\u0027t reliably communicate between the equivalent of Kerbin and Duna (Gael and Tellumo - I am using GPP).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan I find and edit a cfg file for the deep space network?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
