But the problem is it using too much RAM! I can\u0027t even open my browser cuz it would use up all remaining memories and crash the System. Many people said that add the -force-opengl to the shortcut but everytime I switch from the game to the desktop it just automaticly crash. Same thing happen with -force-glcore. I haven\u0027t try -force-d3d11 though but my GPU\u0027s DirectX version is 12 so it should able to run DirectX 11 right? If I do that what is the impact?
