I bought Extreme 3D Pro joystick and had it plugged in, I even tried KSP with it. When I unplug it, though, all gameplay and graphics settings reset to default, and it doesn\u0027t save the settings even after quitting and starting up the game again. When I plug the joystick in again, it does keep the settings I set, and when I unplug it again, it doesn\u0027t."},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T20:23:37Z","Content":"This is a well known bug. There is a large thread about it somewhere. \n\nThe way to fix it is this:\n\n1) Delete the Settings.cfg in your KSP\\_win folder (or steam game location) this will cause the game to generate a new one with default settings\n\n2) load up the game\n\n3) add all the settings you want, including joystick axis\n\n4) exit the game\n\n5) copy the Settings.cfg file and paste it somewhere where you can easily locate it. \n\nThis way, if your settings start to bug out again, you can just delete the settings.cfg and replace it with the one you copied and saved. (Also, I think the bug starts when you plug/unplug in a joystick mid-session, I would advise to plug the joystick in before starting the game and not unplugging it during the game)\n\nHope this helps! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Fun1k","CreatedById":121690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T10:33:12Z","Content":"Thanks very much, that helps"}]}
