After aerobreaking a few times I came in for final approach. the plane was reacting fine the entire time since take off; Upon reaching low altitude, 6k, i ejected rear rocket engines (while less then 22 away from runway) to make the plane more stable and recover the parts later. It still has jets. once below 5k, i get massive roll issues. the craft seems perfectly balances, and has acted that way since mission take off, but it seems to roll in on direction like a wing or aileron has been taken off, but i can see no visible damage to the craft. It would not remain airborne and i deployed emergency parachutes to save the crew members. the quick save loads right when i was starting to feel the problem, shortly after ejecting rocket engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould someone take a look or help me understand why this is happening? i have tested this craft for tens of hours getting it perfected and i got it there, but for some reason phantom forces are at work on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmod list:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKAS/KIS\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal engineer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\natmosphere trajectories\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nkerbal alarm clock\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nclaws stock bug fixes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-11T20:38:57Z\u0022 title=\u002212/11/2015 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fireblade274\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nemeko","CreatedById":154318,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T00:23:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, i have similar problems because i hold shift an press A for 3 seconds by accident and i didn\u0027t realize, this make a little torque by default in sas, I suppose is used to compensate unbalanced ships anyway i didn\u0027t know this function so many ships end uncontrollables and kill kerbals so you can check it or use this to compensate the torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
