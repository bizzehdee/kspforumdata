The clock in the top left slows to between 1/3 and 1/2 real speed, though it never turns red, and the frame rate drops significantly as well - I don\u0027t have an FPS counter but it looks like it approaches 5 FPS, down from the 60 FPS I set the limiter to. My Space Shuttle replica does something similar, though it does not deploy any fairings (it just slows the game down once I reach the upper atmosphere - maybe that one has to do with its rather high part count). My CPU, an AMD Ryzen 5 2600, is showing roughly 30% use in the Task Manager, my GPU, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, shows around 40%, so it shouldn\u0027t be slowing down at all, but just to make sure I tried turning the graphics settings down a lot (particularly atmospheric effects) but it didn\u0027t help. I\u0027m running KSP 1.8.1.2694 on Windows 10 with Chatterer, the Docking Alignment Indicator and the Trajectories mod installed. As far as I can tell, it doesn\u0027t matter very much whether I\u0027m in space or not (the clock and frame rate stay slow even when I exit the atmosphere), but the problem seems to solve itself as soon as my periapsis is outside the atmosphere. Does anyone have an idea as to what might be causing this, and if so, what I might be able to do to fix it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-15T14:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck if the Trajectories \u0022Use cache\u0022\u00A0 setting is enabled, having this not enabled can cause massive lag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WesleyWestland","CreatedById":139912,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-15T14:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat appears to have fixed the problem, thank you very much! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VoidSquid","CreatedById":196199,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-15T14:22:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re welcome, glad I could help \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
