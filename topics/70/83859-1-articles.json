The other is FASA Mercury - Apollo and finally Mechjeb2. I play only Career Mode, 64 version i believe, latest ksp update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been having a very weird issue happening. Every time i brought the Three man command pod back for a splash down or hard landing i was unable to retrieve either the pod nor the kerbals. I had to actually EVA one kerbal in the end to retrieve him then go into the Space Centre and retrieve the pod (I\u0027m aware there\u0027s two retrieve buttons), this issue was happening to me literary every time i returned a command pod, eventually i was having to restart the game just to get my kerbal and pod back (restarting the game seemed to almost stop the loop the game got into). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately a few days ago i the issue became a bigger problem, where by before these work a rounds would work they eventually just stopped working. In the end i had to eject the three kerbals into the ocean, retrieve the command pod. But it wouldn\u0027t let me retrieve nor even terminate the three kerbals that were permanently left in the water. I did notice however that when i went to the Astronaut Complex that the three kerbals i wanted to retrieve were available for the next mission, but when i viewed the Assignments Section it said they were still on EVA, so it ended up being a permanent loop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did read up on other people on the Steam forum but there was no real help there. One thing i saw was that sometimes the game thinks that the command pod is still moving (it won\u0027t let you retrieve a craft/kerbals if the craft is moving), but obviously it would be moving as i have splashed down. I tried landing on the ground but the same thing happened. As there was no fix and now restarting the game wasn\u0027t working i had to reinstall the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t had a chance yet to see if it happens again, but to note i was having this occasional problem when i was on a fresh install with no mods but it wasn\u0027t as bad until now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould i have a fresh copy of ksp every time in install a mod? is that something you would recommend? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank all\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-05T08:24:06Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2014 08:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jabbashouse\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T08:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease follow the guideline in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-(READ-FIRST)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERead First sticky\u003C/a\u003E.
