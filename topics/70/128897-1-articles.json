When I start it up it extracts 0.006379 units of ore per second with a thermal efficiency of 5.6%. As it heats up, the thermal efficiency goes up along with the indicated load to an equilibrium of 83.5%, but the production is still the same: 0.006379/sec. On the other hand, the Convert-O-Tron seems to be working fine. Its production changes as supposed with the thermal efficiency (until I run out of ore, of course).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I remember, when I first installed these systems, everything was working fine, though I didn\u0027t pay too much attention to it. Also, not that I think it matters much, but I brought up the excavators and the converter in different launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone else having the same problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
