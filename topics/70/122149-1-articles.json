I think my Hardware isn\u0027t that bad. I currently running my system on Win10 but i had the same problems under Win7... I have quite a bit of mods installed right now, but the problem also occured when i played vanilla... So i would be glad if there is a solution for that Problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
