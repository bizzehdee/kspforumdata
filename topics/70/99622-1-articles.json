While it almost works, if there is a decoupler involved (even on an adjoined part, rather than the part with the fairings), the ModuleJettison modules will ALL trigger and detach ALL fairings, not just the one associated with the appropriate attachment node that was decoupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn SpaceY Heavy-Lifters, I\u0027ve been making good use of the ModuleJettison fairing system to make multi-sized adapters, and self-adapting parts with multiple attachment nodes. However, this limitation ensures that I can only put optional attachment fairings at one of the part, or the other, and not at both ends.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
