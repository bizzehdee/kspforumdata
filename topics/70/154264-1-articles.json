Im on windows 10. Any clues how to fix this?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe bug says it throws an access violation on NTDLL.DLL. Any clues how to fix this would be greatly appreciated as I am building a sim pit and really need the bezel correction this gives... It seems to work in 32 bit mode. From reading it seams that some 64 bit games need patches to work. I posted on SoftTH\u0027s forum and am waiting for a response but I figured it wouldn\u0027t hurt to put the question out on here. I know ive seen many people in the community request multi-monitor support and getting this working will give just that!
