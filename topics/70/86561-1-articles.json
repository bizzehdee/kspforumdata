After launching a number of flights I noticed I was unable to recover any of them regardless of how far they landed from the space center. I tried clicking on the Recover button above the altimeter, tried clicking on the icon in the KSC screen, and tried recovering the vessel in the Flight Tracking Station. Nothing works. I have the Recovery Transponder Fitting strategy active too, but it doesn\u0027t make a difference. Even when I leave a vehicle on the launch pad, I can\u0027t recover from there either so I know distance isn\u0027t the issue. They only time I actually did manage to recover a vessel (and get the pilot back as well as the science points from the flight) was when I tried to launch a new flight which prompted me to recover the vessel that was still on the pad. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless I get this sorted out, the only way I can get science points is by beaming science back. All other science as well as the pilot remains with ship wherever it landed on the surface or in the oceans of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E************\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eby the way, this is the list of the addons that I have running, in case it\u0027s relevant:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- B9 Aerospace R5.2.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- HexTruss 0.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- kdata\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Davon Supply Mod 008\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- DMagic Orbital Science v0.8.5.1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ProcFairings 3.09\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Better Atmospheres Mod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Environmental Visual Enhancements v7.4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Kronal Utils (ship schematic viewer)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ISA MapSat X4r2\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-08T23:12:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile I don\u0027t see VOID in your list, that one gave me issues.
