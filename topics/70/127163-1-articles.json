One of my boats mysteriously vanished, leaving no trace of anyone aboard. I\u0027ve started calling it the silent kraken, but I haven\u0027t been able to check it. If you are willing to cheat a bit, you can bring the lost kerbals back, but the ships are gone. You\u0027ll need to retry the missions for that. I have not been able to find out what happened, but this is definitely a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I for some reason feel like quoting Dave Bowman on this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh my god!
