Clicking on them would have no effect, nor would the keyboard shortcuts. I could still control the craft, and I could lower landing gear, deploy airbrakes, and toggle lights by right-clicking on the parts. (This isn\u0027t really a workaround since not everything can be done that way.) It was a manned craft in the atmosphere at 1x time warp. I\u0027ve only noticed it since 1.0.5. I recall it happening each time when I pitched up for aerobraking and then switched to the map view to watch my periapsis. When I switched back those buttons would be locked. Perhaps that\u0027s a coincidence. Does this sound like a bug, or is there some gameplay \u0022feature\u0022 that would lock these action groups? I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s a \u0022feature\u0022 because the button colors are actually desaturated a bit, as you can see in the following image (top: locked, bottom: normal).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022q918AvI.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/q918AvI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Come to think of it, the buttons also get desaturated when you pause the game by pressing Escape. Maybe the game is partially stuck thinking it\u0027s paused?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: That seems to be related to the problem. I can\u0027t reliably reproduce it (it happens very often when time warping in the atmosphere, I think), but when it happens, pressing Escape partially fixes it. The brakes and lights become unstuck, but RCS, SAS, landing gear, and custom action groups remain stuck, it seems...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: This may be related to the Hyperedit \u0022change time\u0022 feature. Setting the time back far enough that MET becomes negative seems to cause this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-15T12:51:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2016 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by AdamMil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AdamMil","CreatedById":150800,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-16T01:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe this was caused by me changing the time in Hyperedit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
