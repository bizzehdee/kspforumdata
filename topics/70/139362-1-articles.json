I have 14 stages, when I go to launch, initially all stages appear. Once the ships settles in, all but 6 stages disappear. If I leave the game and come back in the stages appear as they should, but only once. If I want to relaunch I have to leave the game again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tomvreomfodj","CreatedById":151165,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-03T20:26:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never managed to actually prove it, since I modified the ship and the problem went away, but I think the problem was that the ship was breaking on the pad, as the first response to this post suggested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
