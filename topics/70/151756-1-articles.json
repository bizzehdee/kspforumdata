While testing landers for said planets and moons I ran into a time warp issue. When I would timewarp the orbit itself would \u0022move\u0022 a little or change completely. I had an encounter planned with one moon when time warp got rid of the encounter (which nearly impacted the surface), changed my crafts position and made the orbit move a little around the planet. I don\u0027t mean that I timewarped past apoapsis I mean that the apoapsis teleported behind me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you know what might be causing this?

I thought they had fixed it but looks like they didnt.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngenerate a bunch of rescue contracts with the alt f12 contract screen and warp and see if their orbits decay quickly and the crash and burn if so then thats whats happening.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncould be something else just saying what happened to me. I wish they could fix all of it because like i said stuff like that new horizons and others are really pretty but not being able to put a relay network and it stay put means i cant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
