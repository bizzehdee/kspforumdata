I visited the easter egg in the desert and while the flight there was uneventful, once I got close I started crashing 10-20 seconds after loading my quicksave. I eventually gave up and used Hyperedit to put the craft landed in the right place. Everything was fine while I was there, but trying to take off to leave caused repeated crashing again. I again edited the craft to a patch of desert some ways away to see if that would help, but it still kept crashing shortly after takeoff.\n\nI stripped down my mods to just that which was necessary for the craft to work and GCMonitor to check my mem usage:\n\nAdjustableLandingGear\n\nBDAnimationModules\n\nDangIt\n\nFerramAerospaceResearch\n\nFirespitter (plugin only)\n\nGCMonitor\n\nImprovedChaseCamera\n\nKAX (radial prop only)\n\nModularFlightIntegrator\n\nTAC Life Support (none of the included parts)\n\nMemory usage eventually gets up past 3.5GB and crashes. My error log seems to have a lot of \u0022d3d: VB or IB is null\u0022 spam, but I don\u0027t have much of the knowledge necessary to read these things. Could anyone give me a hand?

I could go to tracking, directly load the vessel I wanted to land, do a straight landing, and boom, crash when I\u0027m close enough to see surface features.\n\nThe last time it happened, and again recently, I went into Steam and right clicked KSP in my library, selected \u0022Properties\u0022, Clicked the \u0022Local Files\u0022 tab, and then clicked the verify game cache integrity. Both times I had the issue, i had it detect a bad file. I let it redownload that file, and either it works, or it crashes again and the file fails to verify again. It seems like there is a file that is getting gnarled during KSP\u0027s frequent crashes. Whatever is getting re-downloaded is small, as it barely registered as a blip in the Steam download screen, even if you have the download screen already open."},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T08:09:23Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had the same thing in a number of Kerbin spots, typically deep inland, where I\u0027ve spent, uh, way too much time lately.\n\nThe big \u0022fix\u0022 that helped me personally was turning down ground detail and scatters (trees and rocks, and cacti). I had them up, because hey why not, but setting them to saner levels helped. As far as I could tell being in the more inland areas of Kerbin just results in more ground detail getting loaded to memory than usual, resulting in out of memory crashes on the reg. I see it a lot less if I\u0027m closer to the oceans which leads me to believe that water is simply less demanding. Turning these two settings down resulted in a lot fewer crashes (about the number I expect to put up with playing KSP)."},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T09:32:25Z","Content":"Not sure what it is about deserts, but they have always jacked up my RAM usage and crashed the game, as far back as 0.25 when I first really started visiting them often (desert to the west of KSC mainly)"},{"CreatedByName":"jondugger123","CreatedById":149541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-19T10:51:43Z","Content":"What I do to fix this same issue I had was the following;\n\n- Create a .exe shortcut of KSP and drag it to wherever you want.\n\n\u003ERight click\n\n\u003EProperties\n\n\u003EIn the \u0027target\u0027 line you should see this; \u0022C:\\Users\\Jonathan\\Desktop\\Kerbal Space Program\\KSP.exe\u0022 \n\n\u003ETurn it into this; \u0022C:\\Users\\Jonathan\\Desktop\\Kerbal Space Program\\KSP.exe\u0022 -force-openGL\n\n\u003EMake sure -force-openGL is after the quotation marks, and put a space in between the last quotation mark and -force-.\n\n I use a lot of mods and this has pretty much made crashing a thing of the past, no matter what bunch of mods I have installed.
