When I add any mod that incorporates this mod my parachutes do not work properly. My ships crash into the ground as if the open chutes were not even there. I cannot just remove the mod and have things go back to normal. I have to start from square one and download a new copy of KSP and all the mods that do work. This is very frustrating. I have lost count on the times I have had to start as a new recruit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T01:30:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222437422\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133291\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456873208\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022159653\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Linkdeous\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/1/2016 at 3:00 PM, Linkdeous said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone have problem while running FireSpitter in the 1.0.5 version of KSP ?
