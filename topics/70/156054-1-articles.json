They will link but fuel transfer doesn\u0027t work for some reason--the \u0022in\u0022 and \u0022out\u0022 buttons don\u0027t pop up (They do appear when I select two tanks on one ship, but they all disappear when I select a third tank on a linked ship). I have the R\u0026amp;D unlocked far enough that resource transfer is allowed, and this always used to work fine before 1.2 was released. Is this a known issue or could I be doing something wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee picture: \u003Cimg alt=\u0022z0U6NRE.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z0U6NRE.png\u0022 width=\u0022600\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-06T04:16:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2017 04:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Spangle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded picture\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spangle","CreatedById":174655,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-06T09:49:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found the answer.
