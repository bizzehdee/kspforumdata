Note I\u0027m still using 1.9.1 because some of the mods I need are not yet available, so this is _not_ a 1.10.x problem. I have a ship that has a 2.5m cargo bay. In the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E I put some parts into the cargo bay and close the doors. I launch, rendezous with a station, land on Minmus, open the cargo bay, and...the parts are missing! I reverted to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, open the bay and there they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else seen this sort of issue with parts just disappearing from within a cargo bay?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if it is related, but I\u0027ve also had a couple of ships (just in the last few days) suddenly explode, for no reason at all, when coming out of warp, BUT only if I\u0027m in the map screen...if I\u0027m on the main flight screen, they don\u0027t explode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Additional info: I MAY have found my parts. The parts made up a BG DLC robotic arm. I checked the status of the contents of the service bay at multiple points during the mission, and the parts are where they should be, at least until they are landed. Once on the ground, the arm is now partially clipped into the upper surface of the service module, and completely detached from the point where it was mounted up to that point. I\u0027m really hoping the bug fixes that were listed for the 1.10/1.50BG release fix this issue, but I won\u0027t be playing much until the mods I require are all up to date...and given other life activities, I MAY get around to this again in November!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-10T20:11:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2020 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Michel Bartolone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadditional info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
