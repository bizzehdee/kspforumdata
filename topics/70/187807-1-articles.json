Everything was working fine until I installed two mods this morning. 1st one was Station Science, which I have used in a previous playthrough. I\u0027ve never experienced a problem with that mod in the past. 2nd one was Kerbal Environmental Institute, a mod which i have never used in the past. After playing for a little while i noticed an uncharacteristic frame rate drop on a very small craft. I assumed it was time to reboot KSP as it was using too much memory (has worked in the past). When i booted back into my career and reloaded said craft the frame rate was what seemed like single digits, kerbin was transparent, and I could not switch to my map view at all. When I switched back to the space center the game was stuck in a loading screen and never loaded up. It just doesn\u0027t seem like these two innocuous mods would have caused this problem, but I have tried the following with no luck...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n1 uninstalled both mods\u003Cbr\u003E\n2 reinstalled KSP (keeping \u0022good\u0022 mods and save file)\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 reinstalled visual mods (as i thought a transparent kerbin was a symptom of broken visual mods)\u003Cbr\u003E\n4 tried loading previous saves\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not experienced at this sort of stuff but i dug into my log and im getting a \u0022null reference\u0022 from what seems like Kopernicus.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) I reinstalled Kopernicus and the Outer Planets Mod also to no avail.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere is also mention of \u0022null reference\u0022 with Unity in the line so i\u0027m not sure if its a problem with my game file. I went to validate game files in steam and it says 74 filed failed to validate. This happens every time I load the game and quit. These 74 files always need to be required. Does anyone have ANY idea at all about what is going wrong here and what i can do to correct it? Can you point me in the direction of a forum in which I can post my issue? I\u0027ve spent my entire day off messing with trying to fix this problem and I\u0027m extremely disheartened lol. I don\u0027t want to start another career playthrough as i\u0027ve already done so after the 1.7 update in order to fully use the surface features and phase out ven\u0027s stock revamp. I\u0027ve just made too much progress this time. ANY HELP would be appreciated.
