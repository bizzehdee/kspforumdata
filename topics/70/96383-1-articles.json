Mechjeb works off of the default game. Heck Mechjeb has troubles with FAR which just replaces how aerodynamics work. I couldnt imagine how Mechjeb would deal with everything being 10 times bigger with Real Solar System. The code would be like \u0022Whats going on? I dont know where I am?

MechJeb handles RSS (and/or any alternate config for RSS) just fine. This sounds like some other issue in MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaxdor, welcome to the forums! If you make a backup of your save, remove RSS, and load it and try the exact same rocket, does it still have the same issues?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T12:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow are we supposed to do support when people who did not even try our mods or look at the code come and post comment like that....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emaxdor : as NK said Mechjeb works fine with RSS.

I wasent trying to being mean or anything just trying to be funny because I ran into similar problems with mechjeb on FAR. Obviously I didnt have the answer he was looking for but this is a forum and his post was going unanswered for days until I posted. At the least I figured it would bump him to the top...believe it or not I was trying to do something nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
