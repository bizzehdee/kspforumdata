I actually don\u0027t even have B9 installed and before I was never crashing and now I CTD in the VAB literally every 10 minutes. I don\u0027t really know all about posting crash logs but they are all as you guys say the code for a memory crash and I have Never had this particular ctd before. This one being the one where it literally goes to desktop instantly with no messages at all. However a crash file is created each time. Sorry I know you need more info I don\u0027t really expect a perfect answer just wondering if it\u0027s a known issue generally since the update because ATM isn\u0027t working at it\u0027s best or something, which still seems strange since I\u0027m talking about 10-15 parts in the VAB with settings extremely low (the same I always use)..

As the amount of stock assets increased in .25, it\u0027s very possible you were much further under the limit in .24, but are now very close so it\u0027s easy to spike above the limit. ATM is indeed working agani, though you should download the latest version. That said, logs are really, really not hard to find and to upload; the sticky tells you exactly where to find it. If you can\u0027t upload the log, just start reading from the bottom up, and see if you come across anything regarding memory (if it\u0027s an out-of-memory crash, you will).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
