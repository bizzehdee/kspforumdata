Although why the problem should occur only when using this particular, insanely popular mod is strange indeed.\n\nIf someone replies and they are using the mod I suspect, I can suggest (horrors) that they remove the individual mod to see if the problem persists. \n\nSo at this time, just gathering data. not calling the mod I love, a dirty backstabbing tramp who\u0027s just throwing my love back in my face."},{"CreatedByName":"Mindog101","CreatedById":138895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T04:27:20Z","Content":"I actually have had this problem befor i forget what it was lol i also fixed it.....damn"},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T07:32:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I actually have had this problem befor i forget what it was lol i also fixed it.....damn\n\nSo someone has seen the graphics glitch before.
