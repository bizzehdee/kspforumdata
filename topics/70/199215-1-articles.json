Since the part (Stratus-V Cylindrified Monopropellant Tank) could not be stored in inventory parts, I added one to my vessel to later weld it to the target satellite and made sure that the Kerbalnaut was an engineer. Unfortunately, I noticed that I could not target the tank once I was in orbit next to the satellite. Other parts, e.g. the solar panels on my vessel or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters on the satellite, were targetable, and I could reassemble them as i pleased.

I do not use external contract generation addons nor part mods, see my modlist below.\u00A0 Before reporting it as a bug though, I wanted to know if maybe I\u0027m missing something.
