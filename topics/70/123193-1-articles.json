The only problem is - some batteries explode on launchpad due to overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no problems if nothing is attached to batteries (but it\u0027s covered with fairings) OR if there are no fairings (but there are parts attached to batteries). Attaching some parts to batteries and covering it with fairing makes batteries inside fairings explode (both Z-100 and Z-200, mainly Z-100). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was trying to find a solution online, but found only some info that some ppl had some issues similar to this one using FAR.

Any ideas how to send it to space using Fairings? I can do this one without fairings, but I\u0027m afraid it won\u0027t always work with some other sattelites without breaking anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CGCq2g3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022CGCq2g3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-17T09:47:17Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2015 09:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jamqdlaty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jamqdlaty","CreatedById":88293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T09:47:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve edited 1st post to make things more clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-17T10:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t really know without seeing the logs, but if it\u0027s just overheating, turn off heat in the debug menu (alt\u002Bf12) until you are in orbit and can ditch the fairings, or try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EClaws stock bug fixes.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
