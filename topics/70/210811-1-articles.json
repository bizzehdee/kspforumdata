I was wondering if anyone knows how I can make my game look like this? I really like the colors the lighting and the shaders. Just the whole look in general. If anyone knows how to make my game look like this I would be happy. And if I need any configs maybe someone knows them.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/xUAGlEG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/xUAGlEG\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(The image)\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-11-27T09:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTUFX and KS3P might do what you want- both are post-processing mods that change how the game looks, which could include the background blurring in that loading screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you also want the additional \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E buildings featured in the loading screen, you\u2019ll need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Extended- this has been updated since that loading screen was made so it doesn\u2019t look exactly the same, the diagonal road coming off the crawlerway isn\u2019t there any more.
