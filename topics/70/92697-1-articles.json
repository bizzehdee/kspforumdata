Now on 0.25 i have 5-6 mods i don\u0027t installed that mod and it run\u0027s like butter no more 5s waiting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use Interstellar mod but most possible it has large / complex parts ( big textures , etc ) , other bad side of Unity is that they refused to update the PhysX 2.8 ( it\u0027s old , limited only to 1 core processing , etc ) this is the main problem getting lag when you have a big orbital station. Now we need to wait Unity 5 witch will use the latest PhysX 3.3 , it\u0027s 2.5X faster , supporting multi-core processing , etc ... So it will help a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want to delete all the mode, try to remove some parts you don\u0027t use this way you can save some RAM ( KSP it\u0027s 32 bit so it will use only around 3.2GB RAM ) maybe then it will be less laggy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-13T17:20:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lohan2008\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lohan2008\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUpdated Interstellar mod \u0026amp; Kethane, now my KSP game crawls like a slug \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI replaced my old game data, so I can\u0027t go back; will this mean I am sunk with going back to vanilla / no mods ??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E/CRY\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck your output.log see if any errors are showing up.

Odds are you are getting more than a few errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would unistall KSP, reinstall fresh and install the mods you want one by one checking to see if the fault is with any one mod. If everything works and there are no errors, you may want to download and run the Active Texture Management mod that will reduce the memory use of alot of the textures. This will help with frame rates a fair bit and with your memory use.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T18:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome more information would be helpful.Check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHow To Get Support\u003C/a\u003E sticky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically what version of KSP are you running, and is it 32 or 64 bit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat versions of the mods are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen are you getting this lag, Space Center, VAB, in flight, all of the above?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are experiencing the lag hit Alt\u002BF2, this pulls up the DeBug log, is it showing a bunch of red NullReferenceExceptions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can always go back, delete all the stuff that came with the new updates, and re-install the old versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
