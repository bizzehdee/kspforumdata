My steam client autoupdated ksp to 1.2.2, but I am getting impatient waiting for certain mods to be updated for 1.2.2, so can someone give me a brief rundown on how to get 1.2.1 back? I tried going under the steam properties and opting out of the auto updates and such, but this happened after the 1.2.2 update was already downloaded and installed.

They only offer the last stable major releases but not the point releases. That\u0027s why you should make backups of your game files or should even play from a separate copy of the game that Steam won\u0027t touch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-15T08:37:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBTW, any mods that work with 1.2.1 NOT working with 1.2.2?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-15T15:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far every mod I use at least has a compatibility patch (well, everything that\u0027s updated to 1.2 at all).
