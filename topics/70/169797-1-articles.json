I forgot to extend solar panels after I made orbit and the generators on my antennas courtesy of the Stock Antenna Balance mod ate all my EC! Of course, this wasn\u0027t my first satellite design, and I had a single\u00A0OX-STAT perfectly positioned in case something like this happened. By \u0022perfectly positioned\u0022 I mean positioned in such a way that it got no sunlight at all, and therefore was useless. I also had neglected to switch on my reserve power. However, Valentina, currently on an endurance test for Project Thursday, was in orbit nearby and adjusted her ship\u0027s orbit to intercept the probe. She made a daring spacewalk over to the Mango 7 probe, and manually extended one of the solar panels, and returned to her capsule. Yay! Probe saved! Except... when I switched over to the probe, I still had no EC. The solar panel was tracking normally, and it showed full sunlight AND indicated that energy was flowing, but wherever it was going it wasn\u0027t into my batteries. I checked the log but didn\u0027t see anything obvious. My probe was sitting, in orbit, with a single solar panel tracking the sun, and yet it was still dead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI checked the save file and compared the extended panel\u0027s characteristics with its mirror. They were the same except for the items that related to one panel being extended and the other not. I compared the extended panel to another ship with an extended panel. Same states on both. I gave up, added a little EC to the battery in the save file, reloaded it, and watched my vessel come to life. I noticed the extended panel still did not appear to be accumulating EC. I extended the other panel and it works normally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny one with any ideas? I do use NFE / NFS and Dynamic Battery Storage, but those are the only mods I can think of that touch the electrical system. I have the save file and my mod list available, as well as the logs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbinchaser","CreatedById":160817,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-20T01:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you restart the client?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eightiesboi","CreatedById":133828,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-20T18:00:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223272714\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169797\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516412639\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022160817\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lo Var Lachland\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, Lo Var Lachland said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you restart the client?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep.
