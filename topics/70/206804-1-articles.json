After loading up all the changes, the screen goes black, background music starts playing and in the right down corner there is the loading logo.

It\u0027s never going to load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, I can also see from the logs that you\u0027ve put mods into the Steam copy of KSP. This is A Bad Idea- Steam breaks modded KSP very regularly, especially when mods with DLLs are involved (Kopernicus is one of them). My suggested fix is this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCopy your save games to your desktop for safekeeping.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to install your mods, make a modpack and save it to the desktop (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E \u0026gt; File \u0026gt; export modpack). If not, keep that screenshot of your GameData folder handy as you\u0027ll need it later.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDelete all mods from KSP, leaving just Squad and SquadExpansion inside GameData. (Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll reinstall them later!)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn Steam, right click KSP \u0026gt; Properties, then disable Steam cloud for KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCompletely uninstall KSP using Steam.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCompletely reinstall KSP using Steam, then verify the files (KSP \u0026gt; Properties \u0026gt; Local files \u0026gt; verify integrity of game files). This should get a fresh, working copy of KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOpen the local files (right click KSP \u0026gt; browse local files), then go up one folder level and grab Kerbal Space Program (C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/\u003Cu\u003EKerbal Space Program\u003C/u\u003E) and copy that entire folder.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPaste KSP somewhere outside of Steam\u0027s control, anywhere will do. Rename this new copy so you know what it is (e.g. KSP 1.12.3 New Horizons/OPM), then reinstall your mods into this new copy using either the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E modpack you made earlier or by hand, and put your saves back into the saves folder.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should now have a fully functioning copy of KSP and the problem should be gone. You can create as many copies of KSP as you like, on different versions and with different sets of mods in each copy; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E makes it easy to manage them, keep them updated and can even create new copies in a few clicks, though there\u0027s nothing stopping you from doing it all yourself (it\u0027s just a lot more work).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you still have this problem after reinstalling everything, the first exception I saw for Kopernicus was related to New Horizons, so try removing that mod and see if it persists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
