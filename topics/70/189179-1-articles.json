So the next thing I know when I open KSP it doesn\u0027t even make it past the loading screen. I figured out through messing with\u00A0the files that a mod I had installed called \u0022surface lights\u0022 or something like that was causing the issue. I removed the mod from my game data and re opened the game. However, this time the issue was that my save game that I have been working on for 2 years was not loading. An error message would appear saying that a certain ship was missing x number parts (aka a ship i just launched\u00A0had those same stupid surface lights on them) and asked if I would still like to continue, I clicked yes however it would just glitch out and nothing would happen. I tried everything I could think of: Removing the craft file, removing a recent\u00A0quicksave so that only the quicksave I had from before I built the craft was there, and ive been researching everywhere since but ive hit many dead ends. I managed to just take the entire save and copy it onto my desktop for safekeeping and ive uninstalled the game. I am going to reinstall it to see if I can try a couple more things but Im not getting anywhere and I\u0027d thought I\u0027d give this a try.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Thank you all for your help, recently I discovered the betas tab and was able to load the last update and everything was functional. I removed the craft that was causing the issues,\u00A0quicksaved, and removed another quicksave file that was causing issues. I will try removing the persistent files and see what happens. Worst comes to worse I still have a copy of the original save. If it still acts up I\u0027ll evaluate the situation in terms of testing all the mods I have. And for now I managed to load up another world in the meantime to have some fun with the new update lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-28T08:05:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2019 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Another KSP player\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zhetaan","CreatedById":125721,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-23T12:47:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding your troubleshooting steps:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223692622\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221571759885\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200953\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Another KSP player\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Another KSP player said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI removed the mod from my game data and re opened the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s correct so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223692622\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221571759885\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022200953\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Another KSP player\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 hours ago, Another KSP player said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAn error message would appear [...] I clicked yes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe careful with this;

I strongly suggest, after downloading from Steam, to make a copy of the whole KSP folder and play from there, not from the Steam installation, this way you won\u0027t\u00A0get an unpleasant surprise from a sudden update and resulting incompatibilities.
