I am not sure what I am doing wrong or how to find it. \n\nBut I have no rendezvous planner with the others. I have many of the nodes to the side from ascent guidance to vessel info but I do not have rendezvous planner there and I cannot find it...I am trying to rendezvous with some debris to recover someone and I suck really bad so far at doing it manually I cannot get myself anywhere near its orbit or if I do then close to it. So I was hoping to use mechjeb\n\nI cannot find the information anywhere so I thought I would make my own post to ask if anyone knew why or how to get it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bev7787","CreatedById":136501,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T01:13:23Z","Content":"Are you playing career? Parts for mechjeb is added when you unlock different science nodes"},{"CreatedByName":"brianorca","CreatedById":109756,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T01:15:24Z","Content":"MechJeb has some of the modules enabled by the tech tree, so you have to research more tech to get the advanced planners. But you can use the maneuver planner to do most of what the rendezvous planner does, you just have to pick the maneuvers step by step. (Match planes, transfer, fine tune, match velocity.)\n\nThe accent and landing modules are also enabled later, so you still have to fly the launch using smart SAS until you can unlock those."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T03:00:18Z","Content":"Moved to Modded Support."}]}
