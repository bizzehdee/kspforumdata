From the very beginning, I began to have random crashes due to RAM limit violation. That seemed weird to me, I play heavy modded KSP from 0.23 and I usually know when stop putting mods in my GameData. However, I began to delete mod after mod, deleted parts unused from various mod, but no changes. After a flight, when I click the Recover or the Space Center button, KSP crash.\n\nCan someone please take a look at my output and see what\u0027s wrong? I use Active Texture Management, Aggressive Release.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/kcstdu0jhh7ry92/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kcstdu0jhh7ry92/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nIn my previous 1.0 install, I had more or less the same mods, but it was messed up a little cause I used that for testing various mods."},{"CreatedByName":"westamastaflash","CreatedById":110546,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T03:00:18Z","Content":"Have you turned off the atmospheric heating gauges?
