I do this by putting an unmanned capsule under a control module, so I can launch it unmanned.\n\nIn this case, every time I hit 66km, one or the other just explodes for no apparent reason. Whether I am under power or not, when it hits 66km, one of them explodes, usually the control module (the command pod only exploded once).\n\nThe only mod I have installed is MechJeb, and it explodes whether Ascent Guidance is running or not.\n\nThere is no apparent reason for this... I\u0027ve even turned off all the SAS/torque wheels on the vessel.\n\nStrangely enough, after the control module explodes, I still have full control of the vessel, despite the fact that the command pod is unmanned.\n\n![lW3M5Wa.png](http://i.imgur.com/lW3M5Wa.png)\n\nI think they might have overheated on ascent, somehow, although not sure why they would wait until 66m to overheat. I launched again with MechJeb Ascent Guidance, and noticed that MJ\u0027s \u0022Limit to Terminal Velocity\u0022 trigger was going off at really low velocities for the altitude. I was at 21km, only going 400 m/s and it was slowing the engines down. Have the aerodynamics changed that much?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T01:16:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 01:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RocketBlam**"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:58:32Z","Content":"ETA: I think it is an overheating problem. I relaunched after redesigning the craft, moving the command module inside the storage bay. Also, when launching, I didn\u0027t accelerate as fast as before. It made it into orbit.\n\nI suspect it had overheated, but if this is the case, then it should have stopped heating up well before hitting 66km."}]}
