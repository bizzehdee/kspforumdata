The mods i have installed at the moment are the following: (i\u0027m not sure what all of these mods do, since some of them are included as packs for other mods i have installed)\n\nAstronomers Visual Pack\n\nCrossFeed Enabler\n\nDDSLoader (dont know what is)\n\nDmagic Orbital Science\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux\n\nHullCam\n\nKopernicus\n\nMunar Surface Experiment\n\nNear Future Electrical and Propulsion\n\nOuter Planet mods\n\nPlanetshine\n\nProcedural Fairings\n\nTexture Replacer\n\nTrajectories\n\nI don\u0027t know why any of these would cause problems with OPM, and i hope i dont have to remove any of the mods to get OPM working. ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nAny help is appreciated ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shurikeeen","CreatedById":114554,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T14:55:57Z","Content":"You are probably running out of RAM. KSP 32-bit can only use 3.8 GB of RAM. Astronomers Visual Pack and Outer Planets Mod are very RAM intensive. Also, DDSLoader allows KSP to load Direct Draw Surface (.dds) textures."},{"CreatedByName":"Valkyria90","CreatedById":81931,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T22:39:15Z","Content":"Running out of ram was a good approach. I saw the ram approached 3.5gb before it crashed so i removed Astronomers visual pack completly and ram went down to 2.4gb but the game still crashed. The newest version of OPM comes with not only one, but plenty of folders i dont know if i even need, like Custom Astroids, Kittopa Space and Nereid.\n\nAll my mods are up to date, and ive tried reinstalling the game, but it still crashes when i launch the game."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T22:56:15Z","Content":"Would you mind uploading your output\\_log and error.log files to a site such as Mediafire or Dropbox, then providing us with a link?
