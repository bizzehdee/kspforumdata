There is no dragging, my mouse just moves alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Then let\u0027s try the old way: I click the part in the build menu, move to the construction area (just as we do with any other parts - tanks, engines, etc.). I try to \u0022attach\u0022 it to the container, and even that the container gets highlighted, a click leaves the deployed science part unattached, somewhere at the floor of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.

So I open the command module, click on the option \u0022Seat 0 inventory\u0022, and try to drag the deployed science unit. Now the dragging works! A miniature of the part is following my mouse cursor. So far, so good. Just to test, I drag the part into the opened inventory window of the command module, in exactly the same way as we are dragging there the electric screwdriver and beer bottles. So far, so good - I get the message \u0022Use stock game abilities to handle this part\u0022. I kinda expected that. Now, I try to drag the part into the opened window of the SEQ-6 container. Aaand... nothing happens. Also dragging the science unit over the container itself does not change anything. The part just disappears. Dragging a screwdriver (a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E part) into the inventory of the command module works OK, but the screwdriver disappears when dragged over the opened menu of the SEQ-6 container. This is not surprising.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, in short: by default, dragging parts does not work. Dragging parts works when the \u0022Seat X inventory\u0022 window is opened, but that does not handle the non-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom some older times I remember that I was able to pack the deployed science units, because in KSP 1.9 I had a working deployed science location on Mun. However, I also remember that I have some deep fear of doing that. It may be that it never worked intuitively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn that older game I had also the same set of mods. This game is a newly started career after upgrading my KSP to 1.10.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it that I forgot how to pack the deployed science units, or has it been changed in 1.10, or maybe there is some conflict with the mods in that new KSP version?

Of course, there\u0027s a range (10m for a Kerbal to reach the cargo box). And to deploy it, once your kerbal is in position, you open their menu, and click on the white arrow on the Deployed science. Not on the part itself (you\u0027ll just try to transfer it), the little arrow in a white circle in the bottom left corner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah. What you describe is what seem to remember how it worked before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time I have tested the SEQ-3 container part (I\u0027m almost sure that SEQ-6 is also stock, but better safe than sorry). I\u0027ve removed the old SEQ-6 ones, and attached a single new SEQ-3 (just in case the symetry would be significant).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI clicked on the science part (I\u0027ve tested both \u0022Control Station\u0022 and \u0022Go-ob ED Monitor\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis time I noticed that as soon as I select the part, the container (or all suitable containers) highlight green at the same moment. Previously I was also opening their inventory windows, so I haven\u0027t noticed them being highlighted also when the window was closed. They may have been, I just weren\u0027t observing that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried to place the parts as you have described (even that I have tried that before), and initially I had no luck. However! After a few tries (because you never know what could happen the third or tenth time) I have noticed that even that the opened window of the container does NOT show the science units inside, the container highlights YELLOW and not GREEN as before. I recall that it means that it is full. I was lucky trying the SEQ-3, so it needed just 3 successful tries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have added one more container to the ship, and tried to place the parts in that one. The first few times the part was \u0022disappearing\u0022 or being found on the floor of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut one time it suddenly became visible in the inventory! I guess that it might require some specific angle of view and/or specific point on the container where I click.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the state is that I have 2 containers, both highlighting YELLOW, and in their opened windows only one of them shows only one \u0022Go-ob ED Monitor\u0022. Hovering over that Monitor I see the normal description pop-up. Hovering over the other empty \u0022boxes\u0022 they behave like really empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was never able to place (visibly) the unit using the opened container window. After some practice (or purely because of luck) I can place the unit if I click over the green-highlighted container, but it seems to heavily depend on some area of the container.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may probably explain why I have that feeling of danger when adding deployed science units. It was probably failing the same way in 1.9 (or even before), but maybe I used to have more luck more often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, now I am sure that this is a bug of KSP, or some mod error, and not PEBKAM.
