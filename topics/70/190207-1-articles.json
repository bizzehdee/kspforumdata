This happens regardless of landing speed, craft design, and landing apparatus used. It does not decrease over time, and usually becomes more violent. Is this a glitch or have I missed something? If anyone has experience with this or a solution I\u0027d love to hear about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-12-06T18:24:00Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2019 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by BJM1990\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
