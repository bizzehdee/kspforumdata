But when the game loads MM says 9 modules couldn\u0027t be loaded and were hidden, or something like that. It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve messed with MM, where do I go to see which mods weren\u0027t loaded?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-01T17:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC, hidden modules means that you don\u0027t have mods\\plugins for them to apply.

Plus, I found out half way through that my virus scanner didn\u0027t like the DLLs, so it might have 86ed some of them before I caught on. Is there a log file that will tell me what dependencies I\u0027m missing?

For example, Space Plane Plus includes support for Deadly Reentry, NEAR, FAR, and RPM, but doesn\u0027t require any of them.
