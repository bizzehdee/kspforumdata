The photo is of a station that was behaving normally (1.5GW of thermal power per Molten Salt reactor), but after loading up last night is only producing ~MW.\u00A0 The one reactor over performing the others spent some time shutdown.\u00A0 I thought maybe it was actinide buildup, even though the storage is low, so I dropped several different reactor/generator/radiator setups on the ground, and all seem to be producing much less heat than their theoretical supply.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas on what I am doing wrong would be greatly appreciated.\u00A0 My install is running KSPI-E 1.12.22, Kerbal Alarm Clock, Kerbal Engineer 1.1.2.8 and\u00A0MechJeb2 2.6.0.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022IR%20Station%20-%20Reactors%20Broken_zps\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k96/ParoleGA/IR%20Station%20-%20Reactors%20Broken_zpsjcodnh8r.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-15T16:32:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2017 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Parole\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
