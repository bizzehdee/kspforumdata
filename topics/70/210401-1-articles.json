No problem there, and I was able to keep Eve, Duna, Jool, and reinstall Kerbin. I have tested the addition of the black hole, neighboring stars, and adding planetary bodies. No problems here, and have been able to mod it enough to understand how to install those.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother preface, I did install the heightmap DLL from Kcalbeloh that some of those planets use, not an issue.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy problem is starting to come from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNormally, I use SVE for my Kerbin with GPP or JNSQ for my citylights because they look better. Not an issue there, I know how to do that.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problems started when I attempted to move everything from SVE into my custom install that I am calling CSS. My Kerbin was showing the custom SVE before attempting to move everything so it is doable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have gone through these config files a hundred times, and it just seems like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is, not working anymore. I can get the citylights back on it by manually doing this ingame with the citylights configure manager, but Auroras, Clouds, everything just will not show at all, and I can\u0027t quite figure out why. My paths seem right, and I\u0027ve even tried to force them by manually typing in the pathways to the config files, making sure to pay attention to the [Modname] and the modname/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/textures pathway.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdditionally, the planet that I added from Kcalbeloh, Anneheg, is WAY less bright/has no glow like it did just stock installing and many other stock planets don\u0027t seem to have the same effects or auroras and all. It just feels like for some reason, moving these even though I redirect the pathways, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is broken now. I don\u0027t have any configs in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E folder itself and no other planet packs or visuals installed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is my guess:\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen everything was in SVE, it was loading separate or in a specific hierarchy that let it load. Now that I\u0027ve moved it, it may just not be loading these configs. This still is confusing why even though I manually put the paths in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E ingame, it doesn\u0027t do anything on apply or save. I\u0027m just really lost as to why I basically followed the same config as SVE and just changed the config pathing, now it won\u0027t load like it used to. It really was not that big of a change. Additionally, all of these other planet packs have the same type of style where their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E configs are right in the pack Game Folder itself, so, not sure.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDo I maybe need to use an @ or % command somewhere at the top in my config files to make it load after Eve/Kopernicus/CSS? I\u0027ll link below to what I have so far as a .rar file. Would really appreciate anyone that really knows this stuff to take a look and help point me in the right direction. I could probably make this work if I did a bunch of separate installs and changed some values and reference between packs, but I want to use this as a learning experience for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and Kopernicus because I\u0027d like to eventually start making my own planet packs and mods. Additionally, I would just prefer to have all of this in one place so as I download packs and sift through planets, bodies, and stars, I can more easily add when wanted. Constructive critique, pathing suggestions, limitations for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/Lopernicus I should be aware of etc all welcome as well.
