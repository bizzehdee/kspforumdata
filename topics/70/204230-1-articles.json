You can delete the debris in the tracking center, or, as I do, send a craft into orbit to de-orbit the junk.

Junky space stations that were launched for contracts? You could delete those, or you could try bringing them back down to the surface and recovering them for a refund, stations tend to be more valuable than other crafts. Got old landers or rovers elsewhere that have served their purpose? Yup, delete those too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeeping more than 50 craft on the go at once is likely to start creating performance problems even on a good PC, so try to design your launch rockets so they either run out of fuel while suborbital (periapsis \u0026lt;20km so they get auto-deleted) or with enough fuel and a control point (probe core) that they can deorbit themselves once they put the payload into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeadJohn","CreatedById":201293,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-11T15:14:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding debris, you can additionally go into settings and reduce the maximum debris count.
