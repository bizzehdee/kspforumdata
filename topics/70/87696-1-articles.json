I have used far for countless hours in the past with no real hiccups after the first couple hours of using it. But now all the planes I build seem to flip out... I put the center of lift behind the center of mass a good ways. It\u0027s even far enough back that no matter how hard I pull up the plane won\u0027t go too far from prograde. BUT for some reason when I get up to high speed the plane flips out starting horizontally... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo idea how to fix this. Can you have too much lift? Like too many surfaces? The center of mass on my aircraft are usually located in the middle of the craft and the CoL some ways back..

It\u0027s definitely a good idea to stick to the basics, but I would also like to encourage you to make nutty designs for fun! Let\u0027s tone back your design a bit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven under small amouts of yaw those wing tips will provide forces which the craft has no answer to. No amount of tail will help. So remove those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, consider that the craft will produce a high positive feedback during high angles of attack due to two significant sets of wings (before and after the center of mass). You\u0027re flying like a leaf on the wind, and no this is not a good thing, Wash! Consider reducing the size of the leading \u0022canard-wing\u0022 and rebalance your lift to suit. This new design will probably produce a noticable pitch oscillation, but overall, yield a less dramatic transition between positive and negative angle of attack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the tips are gone and the lift is rebalance, fix that tail. You need some yaw control up in this ----- and there are a few ways to achieve it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Drop the v-tail and give it two wide-set, vertical tails with independent rudders (if possible). Have a look at some plane designs featuring wide-set tails for ideas: e.g. This one even has that nice canard-wing I mentioned \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutan_Voyager\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutan_Voyager\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Drop the tail completely, move your main (rear) wing forward, and design it to produce more lift closer to the center of the craft.

Look up \u0022Northrop flying wings\u0022 of the 1940s for ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might help to place winglets (90 degree tips) on the rear wings, but that only complicates things at very high speeds. However, this sort of design really isn\u0027t any use under high dynamic pressure anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
