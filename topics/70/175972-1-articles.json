If I\u0027m not in orbit and i\u0027m just sitting on the launch pad it\u0027s a stable 60 frames. In normal 3rd person camera my fps is always stable 60 with very few dips. Rig is i5-2500k 4.3, 8gb ram, SSD, radeon rx 480.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just wondering if there are any setting tweaks that I can to do to stabilize FPS.

It could be that the IVA has a lot more objects that are really detailed in it. Other than that (because I don\u0027t have the mod in my game), I can\u0027t really provide accurate help. Try posting it on the actual thread about the mod as well.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
