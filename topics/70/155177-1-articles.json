I then unzipped the file, put the engineer file in GameData, and started to play. I then opened the game in a sandbox mode game I had a few ships in, started creating a ship with a probe, and placed the ER-7500 Flight unit on it. Thing was, no HUD popped up, although it seems like something should be there. Anything I missed or should do?
