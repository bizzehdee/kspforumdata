Then you should have an nvidia-settings icon in the settings. Open it, look for the antialiasing settings (am on the wrong computer right now and can\u0027t check out but can do later if you wish ...)\n\nK"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T15:54:09Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Disable AA in KSP.\n\u003E Which Linux ?\n\u003E \n\u003E Did you install the proprietary nvidia driver (not nouveau) ?

Disabling AA in KSP worked though ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Thanks!\n\nThough another issue I have is that it\u0027s really laggy. The FPS is pretty bad. I don\u0027t have this issue at all in Windows and it makes it almost unplayable.\n\nI\u0027ve gone back to playing KSP on Windows now, as I\u0027d rather have the occasion memory leak that crashes the game rather than a game that\u0027s constantly laggy. If there\u0027s a fix for this I\u0027ll go back to Linux (Ubuntu) though."}]}
