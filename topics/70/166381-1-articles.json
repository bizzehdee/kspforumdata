Mine was so bad it was blowing ship up it also will make fairing blowup with everything inside it. as of now you can do 3 things, adjust it in your option don\u0027t clip or the best I have found is turn on unbreakable joints while loading to pad and than turn it off once things have settled down.

I changed\u00A0damperRatio = 1 to\u00A0damperRatio = 10 and this caused the strut to spring back quicker which solved the problem. Maybe the force of the bounce is relating to the length of time the part is clipped?
