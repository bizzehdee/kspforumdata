Docks sometimes, sometimes doesn\u0027t. I have also ensured that the parts have the correct orientation, is controlled from the port, the destination port is targeted and everything else (disabling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E just before docking). Didn\u0027t work out. I then tried editing the save file from various VERIFIED sources, but all i found was that they were in perfect order. Nothing indicated that the ports had erroneously considered itself docked when it wasn\u0027t. So drew a blank there too. I simply can\u0027t figure out the pattern of successful or unsuccessful docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like the ports have a mood of their own. What am I missing?? The game runs smooth as butter, but a huge headache when i have to start docking stuff. If it doesn\u0027t dock, start the mission all over again and HOPE to work perfectly. I have come to notice that docking had issues in previous versions, say before year 2015. Very rarely have docking problems been reported in 2016-17, so I assume it\u0027s been debugged. So what would be my issue?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I would have attached my quicksave.sfs file, but u cant figure out how.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T15:31:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, and welcome to the forums!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI note that you\u0027ve posted this in the sub-forum for modded installs.\u00A0 The first thing I\u0027d suggest checking is whether one of your installed mods may be causing the problem.\u00A0 Try running a plain-vanilla stock copy of KSP that has no mods at all installed.\u00A0 Do you still have docking problems, or not?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the problem goes away when you uninstall your mods, then that tends to point the finger at a mod as being the culprit.\u00A0 The next step would be to narrow it down to figure out which one.\u00A0 Even if you have tons of mods installed, you can narrow it down fairly quickly by doing a \u0022binary search\u0022, like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nRun with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehalf\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of the mods installed.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDoes the problem still occur, or not?\u00A0 This tells you which half contains the culprit (i.e. the currently-installed half if the problem occurs; the currently-not-installed half if the problem doesn\u0027t occur).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBased on that, pick the half that presumably contains the problem, split \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eit\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in half, and repeat the process.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this way, you can cut the list of candidates in half with each cycle, which means it\u0027ll pretty quickly narrow down to just one, even if you\u0027ve got a hundred installed mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing that I\u0027d suggest is to provide more details so that people can help you better.\u00A0 When you say \u0022doesn\u0027t dock\u0022, meaning \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewhat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, exactly?\u00A0 Does the magnetic docking field engage, or not?\u00A0 Could you provide a screenshot of two ships trying to dock, where you would expect docking to happen but it doesn\u0027t?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KroShan","CreatedById":90357,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T16:41:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177913-caviar/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022177913\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/177913-caviar/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Caviar\u003C/a\u003E ,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndocking is one of the fine arts in KSP - it needs practice and patience (i asume that you are pretty new to KSP).

I sure would have done the above suggested steps if it the same set of ships have never docked with each other, EVER. But prior to this, it had docked perfectly, and then due to a stupid mistake of mine that\u0027s totally unrelated to docking (wrong cargo bay size, mission to capture\u00A0a rogue floating part in career mode), the ship was severely damaged. So now I\u00A0reloaded to the prior launch stage, put in the correct size and relaunched it again. But only now it doesn\u0027t dock. Plus the port is opposite to the corrected part, so no dependency of the port on the new part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would do the bug hunting method you suggested, but lack of free time and the reason stated above are preventing me from doing this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the exact problem,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/123980-docking-port-bug/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sums it up perfectly.
