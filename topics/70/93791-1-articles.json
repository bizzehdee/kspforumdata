I run 32 bit with a host of mods and also have this happen on my stock ksp before I added mods. mostly I run in half to eighth res due to the amount of mods I have\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou load your game and the world is all wonky like your space port is under water (in one case i had). Or you build a ship and load to the launchpad only to find your ship is in x-ray mode and all the graphics are out of whack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you pause the screen go to settings and hit either accept or apply it will reload all the graphics... the only caveat is you can\u0027t do it inside the VAB/SPH. I\u0027ve also noticed this happens sometimes when I am in windowed mode and for some odd reason my laptop looses focus on the window with KSP in a not responding status.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s annoying but it\u0027s my minor fix for now and it may help others with this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
