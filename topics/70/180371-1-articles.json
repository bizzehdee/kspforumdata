That is, no symmetry, mirror and 2x radial work properly but at 3x radial and above, the ghosted preview of the parts does not appear, no parts get placed when clicking\u00A0and the framerate chugs down. It happens both when the part itself is being radially attached and when the part is being attached via node to a radially attached part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout half an hour ago, it happened again, but only to fuel tanks. Landing legs worked fine even at 12x radial, but whenever I picked up a fuel tank and hovered it near another part for radial attachment, no ghost, no placement and framerate tanked. Alt-clicking to copy a placed part also stopped working. Yet if I mount said fuel tank on a radial decoupler, grab the decoupler and increase symmetry level, it works just fine!\u00A0Console window showed ArgumentOutOfRangeException spam sandwiched between rapid-fire \u0022ship changed, auto-updating my stuff\u0022 log entries from ShipSections and BetterCrewAssignment, which also appears in output_log.txt with the following stack trace:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArgumentOutOfRangeException: Argument is out of range.\u003Cbr\u003E\nParameter name: index\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[PartResource].get_Item (Int32 index) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at DictionaryValueList\u00602[System.Int32,PartResource].At (Int32 index) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at PartResourceList.get_Item (Int32 index) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at Part.OnCopy (.Part original, Boolean asSymCounterpart) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at EditorLogic.createSymmetry (Int32 mode, .Attachment attach) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at EditorLogic.\u0026lt;SetupFSM\u0026gt;m__D () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at (wrapper delegate-invoke) Callback:invoke_void__this__ ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at (wrapper delegate-invoke) Callback:invoke_void__this__ ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at (wrapper delegate-invoke) Callback:invoke_void__this__ ()\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at KerbalFSM.UpdateFSM () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 at EditorLogic.Update () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExiting and reentering the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E didn\u0027t fix it.
