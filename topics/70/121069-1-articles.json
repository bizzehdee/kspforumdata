Every time I run KSP (v1.0.4.861 for Windows, now on Windows 10) I find that all my settings get reset to defaults. It also asks me, every time, about KSP stats tracking -- I click \u0022Don\u0027t send my IP,\u0022 and \u0022Send anon...\u0022 is already selected, and I click Continue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Audio, I turn the music volume down to zero; on Graphics, I Enable full-screen and increase the resolution to match my monitor. I click Apply, and I click Accept, and I think, \u0022I\u0027ve done this before! Why do I keep having to set these back?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt didn\u0027t always do this to me, and I wonder if it started when I added Kerbal Engineer (Redux 1.0), which was my only mod.
