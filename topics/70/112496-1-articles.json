I\u0027m using about 50 mods. I have i7 processor, 8BG RAM and GeForce GTX 765M. It was working just fine. Then i changed Ship manifest and KAS mods to latest versions, now my KSP freezing on loading screen in very early stages on the loading bar. It doesnt make sense to updating some mods causes this issue. Ive tried to add active texture manger but it didnt solve my problem. What do you think, is my problem occurs because i update those mods? And how can i solve this without deleting any mods."},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:46:55Z","Content":"Okay. Soo 64-bit is TOTALLY buggy.
