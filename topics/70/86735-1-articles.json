Whenever my orbiter comes into view, it looks like it has a chain of duplicates along the orbit of the craft. I can\u0027t take a screenshot because the game then slows to a crawl and then crashes. When I select the ship itself from the space center it is uncontrollable despite having a probe core. It\u0027s acting like the last stage of the craft (the landing capsule and parachute without anything else) has fired.
