I haven\u0027t tried it before on windows (I used it on the MacOS partition and it worked). I use a MacBook Pro with 16GB DDR3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that the RAM becomes full while the game is running and then the program crashes. I checked the resources and it seems that after loading KSP the RAM holds about 6GB of data (I have some mods). When I start a scenario, the amount of data in RAM starts to increase at a rate of about 250-300 MB per second. When the RAM is full, data is placed in\u00A0the virtual memory. When the count reaches 32 GB (16GB RAM \u002B 16GB virtual memory) the game crashes with an access violation error.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to reduce texture complexity and the graphic settings in general, but the crash happens anyway... it\u0027s just a matter of time after loading a scenario.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will try to remove all the mods to see if that is the cause of the problem anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Falco251","CreatedById":167941,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T20:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, as expected it looks like a mod problem. I will try to add a mod at a time to see what is causing the problem and then I\u0027ll contact the mod publisher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Falco251","CreatedById":167941,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-28T16:24:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems that the problem was caused by Scatterer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter reading through the log I found that there was a missing file in one of the folder.
