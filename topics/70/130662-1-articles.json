I intercepted completed the flyby, and on the way back, I got the message \u0022Jebediah Kerman refuses to work.\u0022 I had forgotten about my install of USI-LS, and it seems I had exceded the time that a Kerbal could go without \u0022snacks\u0022. I uninstalled USI-LS, and rebooted the game. I went to the tracking center, selected my craft, and tried to take control. The \u0022Fly\u0022 option was greyed out, and I could not take control of the craft. I looked at the crew menu for the craft, and it said that Jebediah Kerman was a tourist. I returned to the main menu, edited the perisistent.sfs file (crew section) and change \u0027type = Tourist\u0027 to \u0027type = Crew\u0027 and \u0027trait = Tourist\u0027 to \u0027trait = Pilot\u0027. I loaded the save, went to the craft in the tracking station, and it told me Jebediah was Crew, but it still would not let me fly the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat variable do I have to edit to make it let me control the craft?
