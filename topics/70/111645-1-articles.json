I build a simple moon-orbiter, which launched fine the last few times, but now after an upgrade it no longer wants to leave the launchpad, like it is super-glued to it (despite enough TWR). But after some seconds of burning it seems to hit a magical number and suddenly skyrockets upwards (literally).\n\n![rocket.jpg](http://s27.postimg.org/5ypywdvpv/rocket.jpg)\n\nThe first stage launches only the T30 engines.\n\nThe problem seems to be related to the total weight. If I remove some parts to make it lighter (even fuel) it launches below a certain weight (22,7t total, launches at about 22,5).\n\nThis is technically a modded game, but this rocket only has stock parts.\n\nMod I use: KIS, KER, MechJeb2, Simple Science Fix, Stage Recovery"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T18:10:10Z","Content":"It\u0027s likely the sticky launchpad bug, sometimes colliders get stuck together, if you use decouplers as feet you can avoid it."},{"CreatedByName":"Two","CreatedById":144535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T08:07:13Z","Content":"That probably was it, thanks. I added landing stabilizers to push it up a little and it flew like expected."}]}
