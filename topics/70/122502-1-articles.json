The other buttons (social media, KSP store, Mods@Curse) still work. At that point I have no other option, than clicking on the [x] in the upper right corner to close the launcher and start the game either by restarting the launcher and clicking \u0022play\u0022, or executing KSP.x86_64 directly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022news\u0022 box seems to work fine at all times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m unsure if this is due to a few mods I\u0027ve installed, but I seem to remember that this behavior was present in the un-modded state, too.
