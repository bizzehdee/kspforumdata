I first noticed that I was not gaining science (via transmission) during a flyby of Venus. Some experiments gave science (temperature, pressure, magnometer boom) while others did not (meteorite, geiger, telemetry). For both working and non-working experiments, the transmission completes and says \u0022done\u0022 but for the non-working experiments, no green text shows up saying science has been added. I later added [x] Science and noticed that my recent Mars flyby produced similar results that I did not notice. It hasn\u0027t always been like this because I have telemetry data from space around the Moon and from the surface of the Moon. My output log can be found at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/yo8fyuf7tu2npqc/output_log.txt?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yo8fyuf7tu2npqc/output_log.txt?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis problem is game breaking for me since I am potentially missing out on hundreds of points of science. I have uninstalled all mods and reinstalled them using CKAN but that did not help. I also replaced my remotetech.dll file with one that Fancymouse had modified to fix a similar sounding issue and that also did not resolve it. Any help at all is greatly appreciated. If needed, I can provide screenshots showing examples of what I mean when I get home later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
