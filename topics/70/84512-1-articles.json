Im wondering if there is something wrong with my plugin folder for KSP. I opened the plugin folder up and there is nothing in there. Could that be the problem? maybe I need to reinstall. I have mechjeb2 and its working well but Keathane and KW Rocketry are not working. I have all the parts for Kethane but the converters wont work, and only have limited parts for KW Rocketry. I have not tried to install any other mods just those three, and all mods are up to date with KSP 24.2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monthar","CreatedById":117764,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-20T23:38:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you putting the mods in the Plugins, PluginData or GameData folder?
