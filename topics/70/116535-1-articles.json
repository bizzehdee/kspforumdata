I have also tried installing only Astronomer\u0027s by itself and it doesn\u0027t work. However, I typically play the game with 80-something mods, with it being somewhat stable."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T05:58:08Z","Content":"stibbons is correct, you are running out of RAM. That symptom of crashing while loading is always running out of RAM. \n\nAstronomer\u0027s pack hasn\u0027t been updated in quite a while and as a result it is temperamental. Installing it with CKAN is not a good idea unless you are running 0.25."},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-22T08:20:30Z","Content":"FWIW, AVP (via CKAN) runs just fine at max-res on GNU/Linux x86\\_64... and consumes a gig or so of RAM by itself, even with ATM. Getting it to run on 32bit will be hairy.\n\nThe only way to know for sure is to look in the logs, where memory crashes are blindingly obvious.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-22T08:22:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2015 08:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by steve\\_v**"}]}
