It\u0027s hacky, but it fixes the bug. So go to newly made quicksave.file (game location/saves/campaign-name) from there open the new save file in notepad, txt, enable edit on the file, find the kerbal/s under ROSTER, which are making you the trouble, find their flight log and delete the line of the log that mentions n(number) - Die, remove them all from the log of the kerbal. After saving, you can load up the save and they will gain the xp that\u0027s missing. You can do it while the game is running.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHopefully that helps a lot of lazy people that do not want to fly their kerbals around to gain xp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Filed.Teeth","CreatedById":178610,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-12-19T04:43:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnow this is old post but it IS the one that helped me....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNoticed a scientist who wasn\u0027t leveling up, though I didn\u0027t notice until he\u0027d orbited Eve and Gilly, then planted flags on both Ike and Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe was stuck at Level 3 only showing flag plantings on Mun and Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDeleted, the Die and subsequent Spawn that apparently happened on the Minmus launch (years ago, don\u0027t even remember it) and it fixed it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
