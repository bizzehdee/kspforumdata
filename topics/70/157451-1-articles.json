As of recently, I\u0027ve been doing missions from places such as the moon or even Mars and I\u0027ve had problems with the actual trajectory changing upon time warp. I set my maneuver node and complete the burn and it shows the correct trajectory but once I do a time warp, the trajectory changes drastically when going to the moon but when going to the Mars, it\u0027s only a slight difference that\u0027s easily fixable. Has anyone else experienced this before?

The option in the settings menu to mitigate the issue works by trying to balance the craft so the phantom forces apply on both sides of an orbit, if I understand that thread correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the issue persists... and yup, for me too... it\u0027s starting to ruin my fun.

I\u0027ve been trying as you suggest since. However, the problem seems to not be associated with the speed/incidence\u00A0of warp spamming or otherwise... Rather, it seems to be associated with moving certain ships around on a career save, and it especially happens in low orbit. For example, after an aerobrake maneuver, I\u0027ll set a maneuver node at 0.0m/s to mark a spot for Kerbal Alarm Clock... and the m/s creeps up for that node, independently - in vacuum with all engines off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas would be really appreciated, as it\u0027s killing this save file for me! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:/\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon1.png\u0022 title=\u0022:/\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
