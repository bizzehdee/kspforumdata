So I could\u00A0check both parts were fine to control, dock, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the krakenty problem started: I undocked both the ship and the lander and after some maneuvers (with the UI too, I should suggest KSP changes the way you change from ship to ship, it\u0027s a pain in the ass). I was nearly docking when I realised that the docking ports I used couldn\u0027t dock. I still don\u0027t understand because I\u0027ve searched everywhere and I didn\u0027t find anything about any problem with two shielded docking ports. \u003Cstrong\u003EBoth the same and they are not able to dock\u003C/strong\u003E. Am I missing something? Does the shielded docking port only dock with other \u0022regular sized\u0022 ports except the shielded one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: I\u0027ve just realised that I can\u0027t close the shields.
