Set up a KSP-version with ckan, using almost the same mod-list, which I use with my manually created and working KSP install. After copying the saves from my old to my new ckan-managed ksp-install, starting the game, and loading the save, the bug occurs every time.\n\nI can\u0027t enter any bulding but the VAB and the Science Facility. If I click the exit-button in one of these building, the glitches show up and I can\u0027t do anything but closing the game.
