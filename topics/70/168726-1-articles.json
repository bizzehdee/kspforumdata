All attached in symetry mode.\u00A0Boosters are propperly seperated to three stages with propper connecting by fuel ducts with symetry mode off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExpected behavior:\u00A0last\u00A0stage feeds fuel to the engine and to the next stages. Flow priority of boar engines is fine. Each stage has priority smaller\u00A0than previous one. But all tanks on top of engines have the same priority and they are depleating together. It is not possible to adjust priority of tanks\u00A0added in symetry mode separately to match priority of the corresponding engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly workaround is to turn off symetry mode and build rocket one part by one. Which is extremely painful experience if you have some tilted nose cones, separatrons, struts etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestion: flow\u00A0priority of all parts of one stage should be\u00A0the same. Possibility to change priority of parts added in symetry mode would be also great.
