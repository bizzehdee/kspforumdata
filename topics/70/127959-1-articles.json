These are ships that have been in orbit for days and one is even on a trajectory to leave the Kerbin sphere of influence. The parts being broken tend to be wings. As these are spaceplane labs intended to land their science this is a mission failure. It is on at least two of my save games and two of the in flight ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I loaded on other nights had no problem\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say again ships flying in orbit and accessed over various times are now reporting in space they are hitting the launch pad\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecent updates done to Kerbal Alarm Clock but I dont think that would do a thing to the launch pad\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBacked game up to the main menu and loaded again. An earlier save still had all the parts and so far no explosions. So this is a problem that isn\u0027t always repeatable. At least I can keep flying for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-16T03:43:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2015 03:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by brygun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
