You need to merge the contents of those folders into your KSP/GameData folder. You can merge by hand, dragging and dropping each folder as needed \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 this is my recommendation. Alternatively, you can copy \u0026amp; paste all the folders inside FTT into your KSP/GameData folder and OS X will offer to \u0022Merge\u0022 or \u0022Keep Newer.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@toric5:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot quite \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the problem here is that the USI mods include several dependencies, which must be installed in KSP/GameData. Rather than moving the USI installations deeper into the UmbraSpaceIndustries folder, Evilyoda needs to move them out one level to GameData.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
