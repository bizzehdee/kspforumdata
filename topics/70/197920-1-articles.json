The log contains many exceptions and at least one report of a stack overflow. Since the log also reveals you have less than 8GB of RAM in your PC, I suspect that either the number of mods you\u0027re using or their size is causing your PC to simply run out of usable memory and crash as a result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease read this guide and follow the steps it contains, and if you still have no luck then come back and post the information it asks you to, it will make it a lot easier for someone to help you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd welcome to the forums!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-05T22:16:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout looking at the log, try installing ZeroMiniAVC and see if that helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThe old Mini AVC mod which was included in many many mods, got broken in 1. 8, and if it\u0027s there you will get many many crashes\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PalowPower","CreatedById":207829,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-21T14:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the help, but my KSP still crashes, even if I don\u0027t use mods.
