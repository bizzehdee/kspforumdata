Moving the camera around with each step\u00A0and walking diagonally can prevent the problem sometimes, but there must be a mod of some sort causing the issue. I might try removing Kopernicus and/or other mods to see what\u2019s causing it later today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HansAcker","CreatedById":195534,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-01T15:28:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223847292\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022196613\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221598953346\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022199902\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jimmymcgoochie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, jimmymcgoochie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might try removing Kopernicus and/or other mods to see what\u2019s causing it later today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s mod-related and as VoidSquid said, it\u0027s been a \u0022feature\u0022 for quite a long time.
