The weird thing here is that if I restore an\u00A0older, working\u00A0save and play for a while, the bug happens again. It already destroyed a lot of progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are some lines from the Debug Log:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html\u0022\u003E\n[Log]: Contract Log: Outdated save file detected!

The bug started to appear first when I launched a manned specraft outside of the SOI of Kerbin and wanted to set Alarms on SOI change. But I may be completely wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere is a download link.

I had this problem too. I discovered it was related to Kerbals that came from contracts, as if their sorta existence conflicted with the game. I fixed it by disabling any contract that created them (Tourism and Recovery in my case). Gonna try removing Roster Manager and see if I can reactivate the contract types\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-17T16:31:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2016 04:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jofe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
