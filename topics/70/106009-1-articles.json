To clarify what I want to access; you used too access it by pressing \u003Cdelete\u003E making sure \u0022LIN\u0022 was activated down in the left corner. When I do that now I still have the rotational(ROT) controls. I had to remap keys to make it work, but I\u0027d rather have it work as before. Also even if I change \u0022Control from Here\u0022 to another part which would translate in to the controls making different \u0022moves\u0022, but it always does the same \u0022movements\u0022.\u003C/delete\u003E\n\nI have tried restarting the game and all, still doesn\u0027t help.\n\n-MODS-\n\nI currently have:\n\nKerbal Engineer\n\nKW Rocketry\n\nIt said:\n\n\u0022- Completely revised Input Mapping system.\u0022 in the 1.0 notes at [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/336-KSP-1-0-is-Released](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/336-KSP-1-0-is-Released)\n\nMaybe this is what\u0027s happened, but seems like a weird change.\n\nWould appreciate some clarification on this matter.\n\nThanks in advance!![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"}]}
