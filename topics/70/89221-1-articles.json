But from the space center I cannot select the only other thing I had flying, which is my Space Station. It still shows it there, it doesn\u0027t have any karbonite mods on it. And while I can\u0027t select it from the space center, if I go to the launch pad with a craft and load my last quicksave, it\u0027ll take me to when I last saved my quicksave which was when I had my space station selected. So I can still fly it around and everything, but I can\u0027t even select it from the observatory. Any possible solutions to this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-05T02:19:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry no solutions to this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOnTheMun","CreatedById":119330,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-06T21:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had exactly this problem but unfortunately I can\u0027t remember exactly how I fixed it. I will try to remember and post here if I do, but I think it was something like this: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry launching another vehicle to dock to the space station. Then once docked, it may fix whatever is causing the issue. Go back to the space center and try to select it.
