I installed a few, and soon after I had issues. The icons at the edge of the screen repeated themselves many times and clicking them did not work anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI removed all mods and kept only Kerbal Engineer - 1.1.9.0. After a while playing, the issue happened again, only now the only icon that repeated was the Kerbal Engineer one. I removed the mod and things worked fine, so I thought there was a problem with that mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then installed MechJeb2 and soon after, exactly the same issue happened with the MechJeb icon. The game also became very unresponsive to the point where it was impossible to move ships around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI removed the mod and things are back to normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m trying to attach here the Kerbal Engineer and game log files (I couldn\u0027t find a log for MechJeb) but I don\u0027t see an option to do so.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCan someone please help me figure out why these mods are not working?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-30T16:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s worries me most is: why this is happening only now?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese Add\u0027Ons are around for years, I don\u0027t understand why this problem is happening only now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-31T09:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut your logs on a file sharing site (Dropbox, Google docs etc.) and post a link here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you installed mods in the Steam copy of KSP? If you have, don\u2019t- Steam breaks modded KSP all the time. U install all your mods, verify the game files through Steam (right click KSP \u0026gt; properties \u0026gt; local files) and then copy KSP (steamapps/common/\u003Cu\u003EKerbal Space Program\u003C/u\u003E) and paste it somewhere else e.g. on your desktop, then put your mods in this new copy instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JuanCarlos","CreatedById":228311,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-05T02:41:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks both.
