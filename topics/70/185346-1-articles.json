I am running the newest version of KSP with both DLC\u0027s. When I open the game with scatterer installed, the oceans and atmosphere are a bright white and the contrast is messed up. It seems to be a problem solely with the scatterer mod.\u00A0Is there anything I can to do solve this? Thanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
