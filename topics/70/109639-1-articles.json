Have you flown the exact same rocket in the current version of KSP you are using? No changes at all. nada. zip?\n\nIf you have changed it even a little bit, that will give you an idea of where the problem might be.\n\nYou may well have a mod problem but before we go assuming that is the case, lets perform a handling test.\n\nLaunch your rocket but see how it performs if you keep your throttle back so that your ascent speed stays less than 295 m/s for the whole of the first layer of atmosphere. Then increase throttle as normal.\n\nIs there a difference? Is it relatively steady in the first layer?\n\nBy the way, The COM and the camera view may well move down your rocket as it burns fuel because the fuel has mass and the COM goes down as your rocket burns it up.\n\nOn particularly long rockets, the axis for a turn can feel further away than it should be. Use Verniers at the top and bottom of your rocket and apply RCS. The amount of fuel they use is easily justified in the amount they save by helping you hold your course.\n\nOf course all this may well be moot and you may have a mod problem. If the test above doesn\u0027t provide meaningful data, then I will detail the easiest and safest way of checking for a suspect mod."},{"CreatedByName":"SpunSolo","CreatedById":3987,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T18:05:43Z","Content":"I get this same problem. it has to do with the survey scanner. the part will seem to break on ascent, then the rocket acts exactly as you have described. This happens with ANY part you add the survey scanner abilities to. I tried to just add the modules for scanning to a different part so i could move forward, but any part those modules are added to will cause the same problem."},{"CreatedByName":"Lubo","CreatedById":136723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T18:53:24Z","Content":"I figured out that this one asteriod science thing from Dmagic caused the bug, atleast it worked for me. My rocket without that kind of arm with a scanner for astroids was the problem for now.\n\nthx everyone"}]}
