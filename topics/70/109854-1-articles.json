You may lose a bit of saved progress however.\n\n1) You will know it happens to you when you get the screen below. \n\n2) Quickly enter your task manager and kill the process for KSP. For me its KSP.86\\_64\n\n3) You\u0027ll lose progress but if you do it quick before the game autosaves it will hopefully be coo\n\nGLHF\n\nAlternatively, [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105399-1-0-2-S-A-V-E-automatic-backup-system-1-0-1-672](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105399-1-0-2-S-A-V-E-automatic-backup-system-1-0-1-672)\n\n![vN0F3H1.png](http://i.imgur.com/vN0F3H1.png)\n\nMod List:\n\n![nKYcepp.png](http://i.imgur.com/nKYcepp.png)\n\nThanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T20:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OddFunction**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mihkel","CreatedById":144498,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:36:19Z","Content":"The same thing happened to me.

My munar lander was on its side with the door facing down towards the ground. I foolishly commanded my kerbal to exit the vehicle, and he fell through the mun surface, killing him. After that, I went to \u0027Tracking Station\u0027 and started to rapidly select different \u0027debris\u0027 for deletion, including the now empty mun lander. It was during the transition between screens where I got stuck as well.\n\nMaybe related to your story, maybe not.

One manifestation of it at least.\n\nI crashed a huge rocket into the ocean after attempting to get it into orbit. I probably hit 80k at my highest.\n\nWhen the rocket crashed into the ocean, several parts of the rocket flew back into space from the rebound. Specifically, I watched a probdyne core fly from the ocean all the way past the moon. I had to select the probodyne core with [ to see it. When it was past the moon and I had it selected, I pressed the Map key, and it gave me the same screen.\n\nThis time it was on Linux 64bit.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nOutput Log:\n\n[**http://www.fileconvoy.com/dfl.php?id=g44f9cea08ebf2657999668485d3f3f38dabde024e**](http://www.fileconvoy.com/dfl.php?id=g44f9cea08ebf2657999668485d3f3f38dabde024e)\n\nThe file set was uploaded on 2015-05-23 @ 19:57:29 GMT.
