One in the Steam folder and another outside of the Steam folder. Both are updated to 1.0. I deleted the .90 version not in the steam folder before copying the 1.0 version. I tried installing Engineer then Mechjeb on the copy and both did not show up in the game except Mechjeb\u0027s part which did nothing but use power. I assumed it was because of the mods having issues after the update but noticed other people mentioning they were using them.\n\nI then tried adding the mods to the copy in the Steam folder and both worked. \n\nDecided I must have made an error somewhere, pretty sure I have, and deleted the copy not in the Steam folder and copied it again. Installed Engineer on that copy and it did not work.\n\n I have installed and tried a lot of mods for KSP both adding them to the copy in the steam folder and the copy not in the Steam folder with no problems.\n\nWhat obvious thing am I missing here?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:24:36Z","Content":"Moved to modded support, where the right people are more likely to see it."},{"CreatedByName":"fraser82","CreatedById":142424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T20:16:20Z","Content":"I\u0027m having the exact same problem with a non-steam install.

Confirmed that I have the mod versions released for 1.0.\n\nLast time I installed mods was 0.25.

Best I can figure my anti-virus was somehow interfering with the game recognizing the new files."}]}
