But 2 different saves even just launching a command pod all do this now. I can zoom and rotate around like normal. Can\u0027t launch, can\u0027t change any staging.\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-pbDE0TWtlMM/VJJvt-hAGAI/AAAAAAAA2N0/EI026inLYM0/w1383-h768-no/screenshot6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods I have installed:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebtw, I\u0027ve tried to only install mods that have been updated to .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll mods from Bob Palmer/UmbraSpaceIndustries - this installes firespitter, which gives me an out of date mod warning on loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERCSBuildAid\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorkingMultipleStarSystems\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T12:10:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease see the stickies on what info you need to provide, we cannot diagnose this issue without more information, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
