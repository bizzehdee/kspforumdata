If you want a mod list screenshot I can give one later when I boot the game back up agian)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-08T12:10:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223668774\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188088\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221567931970\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022165941\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Acronza1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Acronza1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\now heres the problem, I cant remember if this is a stock feature that was recently added this year or if this is because of a mod, I would very much like to know as its driving me nuts sometimes, not realy that I\u0027m not getting much science but more that I can figure out if this is modded or not (and yes I do know I could just remove all of my mods and find out for my self but that still wont answer the question as to which mod is causing it.
