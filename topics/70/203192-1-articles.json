With lifetime radiation turned on though, you are more likely to retire Kerbals early and replace them more frequently, which might be a strain on funds in career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-22T20:14:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith lifetime radiation turned on, if Jeb goes up and gets 50% radiation exposure on a mission before landing on Kerbin and recovering him, he\u0027ll start the next mission at 50% radiation; with lifetime radiation turned off, he\u0027ll start at 0%. I assume that the lifetime radiation on setting is for more \u0022realistic\u0022 gameplay, and would probably suit those who don\u0027t want to use the \u0022magic\u0022 active shield and the radiation detox unit in the Hitchhiker, both of which substantially reduce radiation exposure on long voyages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, radiation is the single biggest threat to any crew with Kerbalism installed, but a few little tricks can make a really big difference:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMake the propulsion section of your interplanetary ship (the engines and fuel tanks) at least one size bigger than the crew section- so if you\u0027re using Hitchhikers and MPLs for your crew, make the fuel tanks at least 3.75m wide- and point the engines straight at the sun; the fuel tanks will act as very effective radiation shielding, completely blocking solar radiation as long as the crew modules are completely concealed by it. This is the only way to survive frequent solar storms.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nShielding is averaged across the entire ship so having one module heavily shielded as a radiation shelter doesn\u0027t actually work; divide it up evenly or according to weight distribution or ease of launch/construction if you like.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPassive shielding is heavy but effective against high radiation levels, active shields work better against background radiation and require power to operate but are a bit lighter. For going to Duna, a couple of active shields and pointing away from the sun will be enough to prevent any radiation exposure at all, but it\u0027s always a good idea to have\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esome\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0passive shielding in case your active shields fail or you blunder into a planetary radiation belt.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe radiation detox unit (RDU) is an upgrade for the Hitchhiker that can actively heal your crew\u0027s radiation exposure, using oxygen and power to do so. It\u0027s unlocked late in the tech tree and is very slow, so don\u0027t rely on it as your only means of defence against radiation exposure; it can only work for one crew member at a time per Hitchhiker too and uses quite a lot of power, but it can make the difference between life and death.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDo not- repeat DO NOT- try and gravity assist your way into Jool orbit. Just don\u0027t. Jool\u0027s radiation belts are insanely powerful and the outer belt will kill you in mere days even with maximum radiation shielding on every module; the inner belt will fry you in mere minutes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
