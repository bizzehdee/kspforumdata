I have installed Very few mods. ( Have installed way more then this in the past) Just wanted too test out the new Infernal Robotics \u002B the Add ons for it. I have run the game threw steam or not threw steam, and have tryed -force-opengl also. Game randomly crashes, and if I am reading the error right , I am running out of memory. The last time the game crashed I was AFK for 20mins or so, So why they game was just running in VAB it crashed ... ran out of mem I think ?\n\nThis happens if I run the game in 1080p or 5760x1080p. I have not had any crashing issues like this in long time.\n\ncrash.dmp [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xccfzb6dsbusk64/AABQBQXy5qmShhe97yfQoEGna?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xccfzb6dsbusk64/AABQBQXy5qmShhe97yfQoEGna?dl=0)\n\nerror [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xccfzb6dsbusk64/AABQBQXy5qmShhe97yfQoEGna?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xccfzb6dsbusk64/AABQBQXy5qmShhe97yfQoEGna?dl=0)\n\nreport [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91601268/report.ini](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91601268/report.ini)\n\noutput\\_log [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91601268/output_log.txt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/91601268/output_log.txt)\n\nI think this is all the info ... anyhow thank you for looking or trying ... anyone.\n\nInstalled mods are. / GameData [Folder]\n\nActiveTextureManagemnt ***(installed after I started having issues, did not help)***\n\nCIT (This was part of another mod I installed, not sure )\n\nKAS\n\nMagicSmokeIndustries ***(this is new just released the other day) \u003C---- Have installed the rework parts in here***\n\nNasaMission\n\nProceduralFarinings\n\nSquad\n\nToadicusTools\n\nTeakableEverthing\n\nTweakScale\n\nModuleManager.2.5.10.dll\n\nModuleManger.ConfigCache\n\nModuleMangerConfigSHA"}]}
