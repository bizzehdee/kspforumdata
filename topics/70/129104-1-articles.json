First a docking port would not undock, so I used Claws manual how to get it to undock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now the airbrakes on my lander wont extend. They move just a little bit and then stop. When I enable the aerodynamic forces overlay I can verify that they don\u0027t produce any drag. I\u0027ve tested the lander design on kerbin and the airbrakes extended without problems there (well, except from sometimes the \u0022you can\u0027t extend etc.\u0022 bug with the service bays, even though the airbrakes weren\u0027t mounted to them. But that\u0027s not the bug here, I opened the service bay and didn\u0027t get the message either)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what is wrong here and how can I get the airbrakes to work again?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T13:00:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you by any change using Claws \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/87737-ksp-v105-stock-bug-fix-modules-release-v105a3-27-dec-15/\u0022\u003EStock Bug Fix\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the previous version was a bug that could hinder airbrake functionality.
