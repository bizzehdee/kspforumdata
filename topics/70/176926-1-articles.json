No hireable kerbals (list is empty and cost for next hire also says 0), none active ( although it says there\u0027s 10 active out of 12 max), none available and none lost. I have the 4 starter kerbals, Jeb, Bill, Bob and Valentina. I have no vessels in flight/orbit. I\u0027ve checked persistent save and changed idx of the 4 kerbals to -1 from 1 (read that -1 value signifies available) with no effect, positive OR negative. I\u0027ve timewarped in an attenpt to populate the list (read that it might fix it) but again, no effect. Mods are all in working order to the best of my knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I was unable to find a fix for this issue, so I removed all the mods, un installed Kerbal and started over with a fresh 1.3.1.1891 install. After some permissions tweaking for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E I was able to reinstall my old mods, plus some additional mods I didn\u0027t notice before and start a new career with a working astronaut complex. I\u0027m guessing there was a corrupt save or maybe a bad mod install (tried modding without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, failed)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-07-24T02:59:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2018 02:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by SuckFail\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\u0026quot;Fixed\u0026quot; the issue\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
