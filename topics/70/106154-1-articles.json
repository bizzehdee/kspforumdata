The left one is the roll angle you want to turn to ASAP after launch. The right box (labled turn) is the roll angle you want after entering the gravity turn phase.\n\nThe latest default ascent profile starts to turn very soon after launch. If you\u0027re still getting the turn that starts at 7KM, delete the cfg files MechJeb generates. Since the souposphere is gone, horizontal velocity has become more important to gain sooner than it was before.\n\nDev build 446 is finally capable of landing with an atmosphere, at least on Kerbin, if your craft doesn\u0027t behave like a lawn dart. It must either have the aerodynamics to drop in a stable, engines forward orientation, enough control power for MechJeb to overcome aero forces trying to make it lawn dart, or use parachutes. It was able to set my lander down without crashing, within walking distance of KSC.\n\nBuild 447 is now the latest as I type, I haven\u0027t tried it yet."}]}
