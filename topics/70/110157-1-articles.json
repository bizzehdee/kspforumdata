I did some tweaking to the settings cfg file and I\u0027m getting better framerate, and now even with large crafts (about 25-33 fps), but time is still slow, even if I use an 8 parts craft. I know the framerate is ok, because it says so in the debug menu, and because everything looks surprisingly smooth and not laggy, but the mission timer goes reaaaally slow. You can see in this picture 25 fps but the timer is yellow. I\u0027m getting the same even with 8 parts craft, and yesterday craft below 70 parts ran at normal speed. I did not install any mod or change anything beforethis started to happen.![MeMBMfx.png](http://i.imgur.com/MeMBMfx.png) I know normally at 25\u002B fps you usually get the \u0022green\u0022 mission timer, but mine is yellow andvery slow. Any Ideas?"}]}
