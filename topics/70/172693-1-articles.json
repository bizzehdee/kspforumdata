I launch a vessel, and I try to give it an opponent. (I\u0027m using BDArmory Continued) Everything works except the X wing. I got this from Jett Quasar, and I modified it so it would stand a chance. When I load the craft, My ksp freezes for about 5 minutes, and when I finally works again, I\u0027m under the planet for half a second, then I\u0027m being launched into space. The navball displays a massive number, then gives up and says N/A\u00A0 m/s. I can see no planets when I hit m for map view, and everything is gone when I\u0027m in normal view. When I go up and hit Space Center,\u00A0 the game crashes. Despite how entertaining it is to watch my X wings get shredded,(\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u00A0it gets a little annoying.
