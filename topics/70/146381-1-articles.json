I\u0027m fairly certain that it has to do with part clipping but \u00A0I can\u0027t pinpoint it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll admit I\u0027m running a ridiculous number of mods 100-120 or so. And I\u0027m not too concerned with pinpointing the issue on any one ship design as I\u0027m ok just scrapping the ship and starting fresh. What I\u0027m asking is what type of design guidelines can I follow to minimize the possibility of running into this bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to give a little bit of background on the most recent of my run ins with this bug I had an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E plane where I had moved the wings very high on the fuselage and just slightly in so that there\u00A0was no space between the wing base and the body. The plane reached orbit and maneuvered to minmus orbit just fine. But as soon as I opened the bay doors the doors clipped through the wings and immediately I began experiencing some really weird phantom rotation and thrust. I couldn\u0027t time accelerate because my craft was under acceleration even though throttle was at 0 and all of my pith was trimmed to 0 (I\u0027ve read on the problem and alt\u002Bx \u00A0did nothing to help). I tried jumping to a different satellite in orbit and the orbital view showed that my space planes apoptosis was no longer changing but the bug followed me and would effect any craft that I was piloting. reloading the game to prior to opening the bay doors\u00A0did not fix the bug but restarting the game and reloading did... until I opened the bay doors.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was finally able to restart the game client a third time reload to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E slide the wings down to ensure that the bay doors had a clean path to open and everything was fine. I suspected it was a part clipping issue as Id run into the same problem a few launches prior when I accidentally had the edge of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E clipped into a fuel tank, again sliding the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E a few inches in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E fixed the problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I guess the question is what part are safe to clip and what clipped part have a high likely hood of resulting in the bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
