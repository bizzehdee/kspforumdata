I downloaded \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E to do this. Unfortunately my kerbal cannot hold anything in his inventory because his inventory volume is 1 L and every object is huge compared to that. Is this because he is a level 1? I tried looking through the save files to increase his inventory size but all I saw was max inventory which didn\u0027t fix the problem. I have read the user guide and looked all over the Internet and these forums for more information but I can\u0027t find anything. Everything is up to date. Other mods are Mechjeb, alarm clock, kerbal engineer and planetshine. Thanks in advance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Astronaut #1","CreatedById":161393,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-27T22:42:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel for this before.
