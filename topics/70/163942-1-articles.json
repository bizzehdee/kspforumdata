I am streaming a heavily Modded series, I do posses the means to add them to the Extended CTT, but my question is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes Procedural Dynamics or B9 Procedural Wings exists in the standard Tech Tree in Career. I would assume not since I have not seen them, but I can be blind at times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they are added to a Vanilla Tech Node, or a CTT node do they cost money based on size of the wing? Similar to how TweakScale has a price point that is adjusted based on scale?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do understand how to add the wings to the CTT but not sure about the Vanilla if they even could be, next and final question. If they do not have a scaling price metric based on shape and size of wing.
