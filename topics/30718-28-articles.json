Like humans, kerbals also have a creative attitude towards alcoholic drinks. If something can be fermented, it\u0027s\u00A0a safe bet that somewhere, somewhen, an inventive kerbal brewer has experimented with it. As such, many of the drinks available on Kerbin would be recognisable to humans and are produced in much the same way. Kerbals generally prefer lighter drinks and are particularly fond of fruit based beverages of all kinds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERT-5\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs on Earth, Kerbal beer is produced from fermented malted grains. However, kerbal brewers tend to be more varied with the range and types of botanicals that they add to their beer, mainly because kerbals aren\u0027t as fond of bitter flavours as humans - plants similar to hops do grow on Kerbin but they\u0027re rarely used as the sole flavouring agent in kerbal beer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRT-5 is a local craft beer peculiar to the town of Barkton and inspired by the RT-5 \u0027Trashcan\u0027solid rocket booster used to launch the famous \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 1\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EKerbal 2\u003C/em\u003E suborbital spacecraft.

Local \u0027citrus clubs\u0027\u00A0are common and competition between clubs can be intense. Traditionally, a citrus wine is produced solely from a blend of citrus juices with no added sugar or flavouring agents. Developing a blend that combines acidity, balance and flavour with sufficient natural sugar for adequate fermentation is regarded as a real skill. One exceptionally well known citrus club releases its produce by batch number (not to be confused with date of production) and their \u002778 batch is very highly regarded by connoisseurs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLatterly, a number of clubs have also begun to experiment with sugared blends. Historically, \u0027adding more sugar\u0027 has been frowned upon as being against the spirit of the craft but proponents of the practice argue that it allows for much more creativity and the accommodation of a far wider range of palettes. The commercial success of heavily lemon based citrus wines does seem to have lent credence to this school of thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill Kerman is an amateur blender of the traditional school, although these days he doesn\u0027t have much time to devote to the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPrickleberry cider\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the less imaginatively named fruits to be found on Kerbin, prickleberries resemble the Terran lychee, although with darker flesh and a somewhat stronger flavour. Prickleberries are a versatile crop which can be eaten as a fresh fruit, made into preserves (prickleberry jam is an excellent accompaniment to many cold meats and cheeses) or processed into a number of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. First pressing prickleberry juice is normally consumed as a fresh juice, whilst the second pressing is laid down in specially prepared wooden barrels for up to a year. The juice absorbs tannins and other phytochemicals from the barrels, which act both as flavourings and natural preservatives. Third pressing juice and pomace is typically used to make prickleberry cider, a light, sparkling drink of no more than 3% abv.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESapwood\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWild sapwood trees originated in the Kerbin rainforest and Kerbal scientists believe that they became insectivorous as an evolutionary adaptation to wet, nutrient leached soils. Long parallel grooves in their trunks exude a sweet viscous sap which traps insects and gradually carries them down to the base of the tree where they decompose and are absorbed by a network of near-surface roots. Sapwoods have long been cultivated by kerbals and in the equatorial and mid-latitudes of Kerbin they are very nearly as ubiquitous as the Kerm. Domesticated sapwoods are larger than their wild cousins and less dependent on insect consumption. This is partly due to centuries of selective breeding but mostly because they are grown in Kerm enhanced soils.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough sapwood sap can be fermented and then distilled into a strong liquor, similar to a Terran rum, this is not a particularly popular drink on Kerbin. The vast bulk of harvested sap is cleaned of insects and then dried to make a sticky, toffee like substance, beloved of kerbals and kerblets alike. The dried sap is also used to make a number of extremely popular non-alcoholic cordials, which are consumed with water, sparkling water or milk. Two notable specialist cordials are smoky sapwood (produced in old-fashioned wood fired evaporating pans) and wild sapwood (colloquially referred to as \u0027crunchy sapwood\u0027) which is harvested, insects and all, from wild sapwood trees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-17T11:42:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2017 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"macdjord","CreatedById":5630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T21:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYay worldbuilding!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T20:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInsects trapped in sap... so THIS is why everyone seems to look at Bob with a half -eye when found with sapwood extract \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T15:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s a bit shorter than the last few but... the next chapter is up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPilgrims\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerm branches lashed wildly against the roof of Jonton\u0027s hut, scattering glossy green leaves into the gentle afternoon breeze.

For a moment they stopped, held unnaturally still against the afternoon sky. Then they relaxed, swaying back and forth in the stiffening breeze.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EMy friends. All of them - my kerbals and my friends.

Carefully, he fitted the syringe into the side arm, feeling the usual brief resistance as the needle punctured both membranes inside. The syringe piston slid out smoothly, coming to rest against its stops. Erlin eased the barrel out before depressing the plunger, twisting the syringe clockwise, and pulling it free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe tugged the probe out of the soil and swiftly dismantled it. Laying the core tube flat on the ground, Erlin tipped the probe head into the palm of his hand and examined the small, silicone capped, stainless steel vial that fell out. Satisfied, he dropped it into a matching aperture in the lid of the small but heavily insulated box by his side. Then he took the last core tube and vial from a nearly empty second box and reassembled his soil sampler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Kerm tree stood in the centre of the copse, it\u0027s thirty-six companions arrayed about it in a loose circle. Neatly tended fields spread out in the distance, some left fallow, some newly harvested, others planted with a selection of crops. The pollinator breaks separating the fields were vibrant and diverse enough to satisfy the most exacting of kermol farmers. Of the farmers or their village however, there was no sign. Pairs of tall, brightly coloured and numbered flags waved jauntily in the evening breeze, each flag marking one end of a slim metal plate that jutted out from the soil. Seen from above, Erlin knew, the effect was striking; concentric rings of colour centred on the Kerm copse. He shivered, tightened the drawstring at his jacket collar and set off for the last pair of flags on his round.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe setting sun cast long shadows over the ground, its reflected light staining the marker plate a deep orange. Erlin gently tugged at the plate, frowning as it refused to move by more than a few centimetres. He sighed and climbed to his feet, brushing dirt and twigs off his knees, then picked up his equipment and set off across the fields towards his van.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time Erlin drove up to the Berelgan, twilight had long since faded into dusk. Eve shone in the darkening sky, bright against the first few scattered stars strewn across the sky. Brighter light spilled around the edges of shuttered windows as he strode towards the chemistry department, clutching his sample box in one gloved hand. Half of the laboratories were still occupied; white-coated kerbals standing by fume cupboards or bent over their lab benches. Occasionally, one would look up and briefly acknowledge Erlin as he walked past. The mingled solvent smell of the wet laboratories gave way to the tang of ozone and hot dust as he turned the corner, the ever present whine of electronic equipment buzzing like a trapped mosquito in the back of his skull. He scratched the back of his neck absently and pushed open the doors to the mass spectrometry laboratory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy was waiting for him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow are they looking, boss?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell the new plates seem to be intact,\u0022 said Erlin. He lifted the sample box onto the nearest bench and flipped open two catches on its rim. Icy white vapour billowed out as he lifted the lid away, revealing the frosted metal tubes fixed to its underside.\u00A0\u201CAlthough it would be a rare beetle that could chew through steel. Dispose of the dry ice would you - I\u0027d better get these in the freezer.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy upended the sample box into the sink, carefully not touching the double handful of steaming white pellets that cascaded out. \u201CSo the plates were loose then?\u0022 he asked Erlin\u0027s retreating back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CUp to a point,\u0022 said Erlin. \u201CThe newest ones still had some give but the five-lambda series looks like a wash - couldn\u0027t lift any of them more than a few centimetres.\u0022 A stainless steel vial clicked against its labelled sample rack. \u201CWish we could work out what\u0027s causing that wretched chemotropism. Apart from anything else, if we had some kind of handle on its effective range, we could correlate root fouling of the plates with Kerm repulsion. If we ever \u003Cem\u003Efind\u003C/em\u003E a repelling factor that is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMaybe we won\u0027t,\u0022 said Halsy sombrely. \u201CGoodness knows we\u0027ve been looking long enough.\u0022 He waved at a tottering stack of paper by the printer. \u201CGC-MS for the last lot of soil vapour samples was inconclusive. Most of it looks like typical background pheromones, some of them are out of their normal ranges but nothing startling. EGF-alpha tends to be high as you\u0027d expect, phenolamines are all over the place. There\u0027s nothing consistent though - nothing I can pick out that matches up with observed fouling rates.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalsy rubbed his eyes. \u201CKerm are sentient, boss. They were smart enough to knock out the wooden plates and they\u0027re sure having a good go at the steel ones too, however they\u0027re doing it. Maybe the blasted fibres \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E be repelled - maybe they\u0027re not even chemotropic at all.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nErlin shook his head. \u201CThey have to be,\u0022 he said. They\u0027re effectively nerve fibres - too valuable to risk them in unhealthy soil.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhile they\u0027re growing, sure,\u201C said Halsy. \u201CBut after that?\u0022 He tapped the side of his head. \u201CDunno about nerve cells - can\u0027t see those - but I definitely can\u0027t wiggle my veins around at will. Maybe Kerm are the same.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n----------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe living Grove. Trees providing shade and shelter for countless animals and birds; their roots the anchors that hold the soil in place. Ferns spreading across the forest floor, roots exuding subtle poisons which protect the anchors from burrowing mites, the grubs of a dozen species of insect, and other predators barely visible, or quite invisible, to the naked eye. A myriad of other plants carpeting the ground, each with its part to play in the finely balanced whole. Fungi feasting on the corpses of fallen trees, returning their essence to the soil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut in the fields, the crop plants thrive, carpets of clover around their stems trapping water, their roots absorbing gases from the soil and turning them into vital nutrients. Lines of sweet scented flowers threaded through the fields attracting - and feeding - the insects, on whose tiny wings, the next generation of crops depends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne guardian binds them all together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAncient as they are, the thirty-seven gnarled and knotted trunks dotted across the Grove are only markers of the true - and incalculably older - Kerm beneath. Far under the soil, wrapped around the taproots, an intricate knot of fibres lies hidden under each trunk. Densely tangled, finger-thick fibres form the core of each knot, a core that sprouts countless slender offshoots which spread through the soil, dividing and dividing again, surrounding the core in a cobweb lace shell. Over time, the shells have merged, knitted together until the boundaries between them are all but invisible. Twisted bundles of fibres thread the shells together, linking the thirty-seven fibrous knots into a single sentient being.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the ferns, the Kerm fibres exude poisons, as well as a subtle arsenal of thousands of other compounds to repel or distract any creature that would feed on them. The fibres sit at the focus of the myriad food chains threaded through the soil, holding them all in a fluid balance. Immune to the depredations of time and predators, the Kerm has endured for millennia.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now the barriers are crumbling. Along the edges of its domain, the Kerm\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s defences are failing, not breached from without but methodically dismantled from within. Bit by bit the outer fibres are gnawed away, feasted on by swarms of tiny predators flocking to a new source of food.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n--------\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou\u0027re very welcome. No, I\u0027m afraid that nobody has any spare beds but there\u0027s still plenty of room in the village hall if you can wait until after supper. Sorry - what was that?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle smiled. \u201CYes, I have - I couldn\u0027t find the words to describe it either. And yes of course I\u0027ll convey your thanks to the Keeper.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe grey haired kerbal picked up her walking stick and shuffled off down the path. Gerselle watched her go, waiting patiently as she fumbled with the gate. Eventually the latch snicked shut and with a last tremulous wave, the kerbal plodded away towards the village proper. Gerselle waved back then went inside, closing the door behind her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of the section of Kerm trunk forming the inside wall of the living room was hidden behind an ungainly, ladder-festooned cross between a bookshelf and a set of bunk beds. Each of the shelf-beds was big enough, with care, to accommodate a single kerbal and contained a thin mattress and a pillow lying under a Kerm leaf cluster. Each bed also sported safety ropes and ceiling pads; Communion-dazed kerbals had a tendency to sit up or roll over, forgetting that they were resting in narrow wooden box.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnoring the pile of laundry at the foot of the shelves, Gerselle made her way to the sleep room, pausing just long enough to retrieve a bottle of prickleberry juice and two glasses from the kitchen. Jonton looked up as she pushed the door open.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPrickleberry?\u0022 He smiled wanly. \u201CYou read my mind love - you didn\u0027t sneak in on the last sitting did you?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle shook her head. \u201CNo room - I had to turn the last of them away as it was. Going to be another busy day tomorrow too.\u0022\u00A0She handed Jonton a glass of juice. \u201CYou need to drink more of this, Jonton Kermol - it\u0027s supposed to be good for wrinkles around the eyes.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow about grey hair?\u0022 said Jonton. His face spasmed and he hastily grabbed the glass with both hands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle looked at him anxiously. \u201CAre you sure you\u0027re up for another long day?\u0022 she asked. \u201CWe could just do the afternoon groups?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton willed his jaw to stop trembling. \u201CI\u0027ll be all right, \u201C he said. \u201CHonestly, love - the distraction will help. Better than...ow...standing here...owww...brooding all day.\u0022 He forced himself to smile. \u201CSo - did we break the record today?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGerselle took a long drink. \u201CKallahat,\u0022 she replied.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cem\u003EKallahat?\u003C/em\u003E said Jonton, \u201Cbut that\u0027s...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u0022\u00A0said Gerselle. \u201CHe\u0027s on a walking holiday apparently. He was on his way through to Barkton when he stopped for the night, two or three Groves away - didn\u0027t say which - and found the whole place talking about the \u201Clore-Keeper\u0022 and the \u201Ctruth-teacher.\u0022\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJonton shook his head. \u201CI prefer \u201Ctruth-teacher\u0022 to \u201CGreat Sage\u0022 he said wryly, \u201Cbut Kallahat? What on Kerbin are we going to do if a whole kerman town descends on the Grove?\u0022 He gestured at the wall of shelf-beds arrayed agains the Kerm trunk.\u201CWe\u0027re going to be turning away more kerbals than we take in.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CPatbro\u0027s Grove is already helping with the catering,\u0022 said Gerselle, \u201Cand plenty of other Groves have volunteered to help too.

So you could \u0027evolve\u0027 from the LV-9 to the LV-909?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T19:02:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot familiar with KSPI but that sounds feasible. You\u0027d probably want to do something with the LVT-30 as well to reflect its evolution from the LV-15.

Like all early KIS engines it was ablatively cooled. The LV-10 was Wernher\u0027s first attempt at a regeneratively cooled engine but his first design (which relied on a coiled tube around the combustion chamber) never worked and resulted in a number of costly failures before he abandoned the idea. Much later on the invention of a double walled combustion chamber, paved the way for development of the the LVT series of regeneratively cooled engines, most notably the LVT-20 which powered Jebediah Kerman\u0027s first orbital flight aboard the Moho 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockomax made extensive use of SRB\u0027s in the early days because of their heritage as the Speciality Fireworks Company. However their SRB\u0027s were a lot more sophisticated than the KIS \u0027Trashcan\u0027 boosters. In particular, they developed shaped propellant loads which gave them some degree of (pre planned) throttling and also experimented with steering by liquid injection into the exhaust stream. Rockomax were fairly late to the party when it came to gimbals, their first proper gimballed engines were the breakthrough SK1 series.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minepagan","CreatedById":132643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T23:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1st: Ok, I can wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd: Ok.
