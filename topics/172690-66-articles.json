The amount of work is huge and putting it on a set of judges is likely to go down the same path, though the scoring system you suggest should already make work a lot easier. I would also suggest just rebooting it without the backlog, yes people are waiting for reviews, but if they still care they\u0027ll just resubmit.

But I have had a better idea: I\u0027d run some sort of game, manually. We had companies going on before, and I think it\u0027d be interesting if they actually did things. If you could actually have companies, doing real things and having totals running of budgets and whatnot, that would be interesting. Maybe I could run it (if you\u0027ve ever played Gearcity you will know what I\u0027m talking about) on a system of monthly updates. Everybody who participates can have company, and I will set up a few rules. (I\u0027m thinking it will be mostly anything goes, so long as it\u0027s explained to me so I can keep track of it somehow) I\u0027d set up a world (probably based on Kerbin to some degree) and each company could operate planes, hire pilots, build airfields, design planes, build planes and whatever else crops up. A company could do any of those things, it could do just one or all. I\u0027m imagining players running companies and airlines, making deals and selling or leasing things to one another. (Creativity here will only make it more interesting!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d run a design and manufacturing company. (I won\u0027t operate planes if I do this, since that relies mainly on my own rules of how Kerbin\u0027s economy works, but if I design and sell planes it\u0027s more dependent on what other players think of them.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayers would send me messages or post in a thread somewhere (I can work out the specifics later) before every month is over and I\u0027ll go and let things play out in my simulated world. We clearly had a good idea. (it\u0027s the only KSP challenge that I\u0027ve done much of. I started about 2 or 3 years ago, and I still see some of the same people coming back, so it must be good)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, I\u0027d like some opinions on this.

Since jumbo jets are becoming obsolete, what about replacing it with an Ultra Long Haul category, where you can enter either a traditional jumbo or newer widebody aircraft and compete over cost per passenger mile (with hard minimums for range and speed)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: To clarify, a system of:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nS Helicopters\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nS/M regional prop\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nS/M hopper\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nS/M/L regional jet\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nM/L Ultra Long Haul\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-02T10:52:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2019 10:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by life_on_venus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NightshineRecorralis","CreatedById":167612,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-02T13:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think the limits play well with time progression, as it is unlikely for a new company to immediately jump into building large airliners (except\u00A0Airbus, apparently, but that\u0027s not a fair comparison), and so I think not only should part counts be limited by the RnD cost but also what parts to be used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay for instance new companies are limited to low cost, low budget parts in the beginning and then would have to progress to newer, better parts. I think that will introduce a handicap enough so that the \u0027market\u0027 does not get flooded. I think it will also encourage the development of variants and promote a more realistic progression and evolution in a company\u0027s lineup of airliners.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor categories, here are my thoughts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLight aircraft - just in case someone thinks a 2 or 4 seater is worthwhile - Skyhawks and such\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeederliners - this would include both helis and small aircraft that fill the role of feeding into regional airports from airfields and/or small airports to larger ones. No jet engines in this category - think of King Airs and 1900Ds as real life counterparts, 10-20 seaters?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegional Aircraft - These would fill the role of flying between destinations w/o much demand or need fast turnarounds -\u00A0analogous to CRJs, ERJs, Dash 8s, etc, these may conflict with small jets even though they have different niches. 40-120 seats\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJet Aircraft - you know and love these, and I\u0027m not sure on how to categorize them, probably just small and large, or Narrowbody and widebody, maybe? With long haul and short haul classes in each?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the demand and design of each category will likely be influenced by other factors should they come into play. That will probably require a deeper dive into the simulation side of things - how much demand is there between cities, fuel prices, maintenance costs, cost to buy vs lease,\u00A0company reputation, and more, but this is just a generalized overview.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"life_on_venus","CreatedById":28185,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-02T15:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, those categories sound good.
