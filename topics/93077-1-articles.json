I didn\u0027t really expect 5 pages for that simple question, I guess this is due to the great community. Anyway lets get on my next question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I wanted to see what Pro.Players here think on gathering biomes from another planets. In my case first I did 2 landings on Mun with command pod, mobile lab and all science instruments. Was very hard since I did this as soon as I unlocked laboratory. I had issues on how to put Poddle engine and support this with basic leg set which barely managed to touch ground first so my engine doesn\u0027t get damaged ( I had to lock suspensions to keep the engine off the ground) the margin for error was small but how much science I would gain was a good reward. This made me think on placing a station with a Mobile lab as core and storage for collected samples and light lander that will go up and down and refuel at station as necessary. When I sample all the Mun I will decouple tanks, lander and other stuff and just return with my 3 Kerbs, command pod and lab. Anyway I needed excuse to learn docking since I know I will need that skill sooner or later. So guys what you think? Should I place stations around every planet and when we get the update with biomes on every planet I just start descending and gathering all science or do those two way mission launch, land get back, repeat until you exhausted all biomes on a planet? Lets see what you think about it? Keep in mind that I am talking about stock game I do not intend to mode it yet. I like it they way it is for now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-16T11:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor science mining, I usually prefer to stick a lab and fuel tank in orbit with an attached lander.

The satellite stations would carry a smallish one-crew lander capable of returning to orbit, with enough fuel to refuel each lander a couple of times and still have extra to return to the mothership. The third satellite station would enter a high orbit around Vall and would release a lander which could collect data easily from Vall and have enough fuel remaining in the station to send out trips to Bop and Pol.

The kerbals would then take the science into the mothership and leave the landers to fall into Jool. The mothership would return home, a husk of its former self, but carrying a tremendous amount of precious science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would not do that without quickloading enabled.
