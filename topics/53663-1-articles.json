Pytheas is a Starmade-esque voxelly-spaceship buildy thing. It had a kickstarter a while back but it failed completely. I think it was because it hadn\u0027t enough publicity at the time to do it. But we have too many of those voxelly-space thingys anyway, I hear you say. We do. It\u0027s an overused Idea, that is never executed well. Perhaps if someone did it right, we\u0027d be laughing. But nobody does. Except Pytheas. The thing is, Dyvox, who make pytheas, have another one. Dyvox Sandbox. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame engine as Pytheas, but lets you build ANYTHING. It\u0027s currently in a Multiplayer pre-release thingy, set to war mode, this means players can build ships, planes and tanks. The video on the front page is made with entirely player built vehicles. I think this game has potential. Lots of it. Download the Alpha build and give it a go, see what you think. The thing with the game is, it will be based around capital ships being manned by multiple people, which would mean more in depth battles than fighters. Also, its got some nice destruction, that games like Starmade lack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.moddb.com/games/dyvox-pytheas\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.moddb.com/games/dyvox-pytheas\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KvickFlygarn87","CreatedById":76314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T21:06:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill try this one tomorrow.
