Maybe I need to arrange the landing gears a certain way. BTW I use the landing gears on B9 pack a lot. I just need to know whats going on.

Wheels need to be a certain distance apart to provide stability, true. Unfortunately there comes a point where putting them farther out makes them less stable. On a side note, you probably are going to want to put more inclination into the gear, bring that nose up, tail down. Doesn\u0027t look like there is any as it sits right now.
