If you\u0027re interested in re-creating the Juno mission in KSP, I have a tutorial on how to do a fly-by of Kerbin to get a gravity assist to Jool. It can save 400 m/s and it\u0027s not as hard as doing fly-by gravity assist by other planets. The link to it is below.\n\n[Juno style Kerbin fly-by to Jool](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122780-Juno-style-Kerbin-fly-by-to-Jool)"},{"CreatedByName":"XxToksik_RevoluTionxX","CreatedById":165468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-18T00:12:50Z","Content":"The link provided is broken.
