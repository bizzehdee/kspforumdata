Do you want to try an become one? The KAPE challenge is created to put your plane building to ultimate test.\n\nYou must build a plane that flies under 20000 meters and overcomes the following challenges: You want the heaviest, longest flying, land-able, fastest, furthest flying plane\n\nout there. You will be scored as shown below: \n\n-Weight: 1 point for each ton = base score. Weight is weight in space plane hanger, \\so what your plane looks like in the hanger is what your plane looks like when you land.\n\n-Time: Each minute your plane flew, add a point to your base score.\n\n-Land-able: If you landed your plane at the ksc runway and used no parachutes to land, add 6 points to base score, if you landed at the island runway or a Kerbin side airbase, add 5 points to your score, and if you landed using parachutes or off of the run way, add 3 points to your base score. If you crash landed, but your kerbals survived, add 1 point to base score.\n\n-Speed: Every 100 meters a second you go, add a point. (EX. If your fastest speed was 510m/s, you get 5.1 points for speed)\n\n-Kerbals: \u002B.5 for every kerbal\n\n-Distance: \u002B1 for each 1000(km) meters traveled\n\n-Circumnavigation: \u002B25 for each circumnavigation of Kerbin\n\nNow that you know the scoring, how about requirements and rules? \n\n-You MUST provide photo evidence of your flight, including f3 menu after the flight has ended, 2 in flight pictures, 1 picture of landed plane, and 1 picture of your plane in the Spaceplane hanger. If you crash landed(Your ship came apart, but your kerbal survived) add 5 points to your score.\n\n-No overpowered mods(More on this in Mods section)\n\n-No f12(debug) menu\n\n-No cheating\n\n-You must land your plane\n\n-You may use mods, but you will go on the modded leader board(Again, more on this in the Mods section).\n\n-MUST stay under 20000 meters\n\nNow what about mods?\n\n-You may use any mod that does not alter game play and still be on the stock leader board. And example of this is KER\n\n-You may use mods such as FAR, KWrocketry, B9aerospace, Kerbal Aircraft Expansion, B9 Procedural wings and Adjustable Landing Gears, MK2 expansion, LLL, Firespitter etc... (I will keep this updated)\n\n-NO modding parts to produce tons of lift, thrust, or ISP\n\n-NO hyperedit\n\n-NO mods like hyperedit\n\n-If you are unsure if you are able to use a mod, ask me first\n\nMy own entry is below:\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Looks like this circumnavigation is going to be really close, almost half the fuel used for almost half the journey. It should make it though, as it\u0027s getting more and more efficient as weight reduces (now 112 tonnes, which means about 60 tonnes of fuel burned) and required thrust and angle of attack decrease. It now uses 1.37 units of fuel a second in cruise, from over 2 a second early on.\n\nI really love these long, slow flights, just letting it fly, doing some revision (I have exams at the moment) and watching the scenery.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
