If you want to put a nose cone on top, you\u0027re better off with one that\u0027s roughly the same size as the part below it. So in this case, something that matches up to the docking port / science module, rather than the large nose cone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the lander\u0027s fuel tank will cause quite a bit of drag since there\u0027s nothing tapering up to it.
