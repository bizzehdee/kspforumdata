I just love space and rockets and just anything that flies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was messing around with some parts and wanted to build some of these FL-R1 RCSs on my rocket. The first ones I tryed collapsed before the launch. I figured the tanks could not support the weight of the later stages of the rockets (am I right here?) So I built a test rocket with just the capsule, one tank and a RT10 solid fuel booster. The rocket launched, but the booster didn\u0027t use the fuel of the tank. I tryed several different layouts or connecting the tank to the booster with an external fuel duct (I know this is meant only for liquid fuel) but nothing worked. How can I use the fuel out of the tank and how can I build more tanks in a rocket without them to collapse?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeckknoedel\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speckknoedel","CreatedById":54968,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T20:49:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just discovered the wiki and found out RCS and solid fuel boosters are two completely different things... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry bothering you.
