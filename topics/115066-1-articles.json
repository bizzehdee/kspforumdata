Later it will replace things wholesale, building on the work of goozeman and SRFirefox in addition to those above.\n\nFeatures\n\n- Calculates a shock temperature based on atmospheric composition and velocity.\n- Calculates gamma based on atmospheric composition and velocity.\n- Recalculates background radiation temperature (and the density-based interpolation factor used there and in other things) based on the above.\n\nInstallation  \n\nExtract RealHeat folder and ModularFlightIntegrator folders to GameData.  \n\nNote: [Includes **and requires** ModularFlightIntegrator by sarbian](https://github.com/sarbian/ModularFlightIntegrator), used under license.  \n\n[Download](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealHeat/releases/latest)  \n[GitHub](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealHeat)\n\n**License: CC-BY-SA**\n\nChangelog:\n\nv4.3\n\n\\* Update to KSP 1.1.3\n\nv4.2\n\n\\* Lower convective coefficient at low density and velocity (we were overestimating convection then).\n\nv4.1\n\n\\* Update for KSP 1.1.2.\n\nv4\n\n\\* Update for KSP 1.1.  \n\n\\* Use KSP 1.1 feature of changing convective coefficient rather than shock temp when varying convection behind attached and detached shocks. All these are stated in the cfg for tuning.  \n\nv3\n\n\\* Fix an issue with too-high background radiation temperature. This prevents blowups for low-temperature parts, but it may understate radiative heating during lunar-plus reentries. Pending 1.1 for a workaround KSP-side.\n\nv2  \n\n\\* Updated to KSP 1.0.5.  \n\n\\* Removed AeroFX bits (done by stock now).\n\nv1.1  \n\nSupports changing aeroFX now. Defaults to making it intense down low, so you can set the normal aeroFX settings to much lower scaling to not have flames on ascent. Supports aeroFXdensityExponent1 (default = 2.0) and aeroFXdensityMult1 default = 90), and the final density passed to aeroFX will be (density^aeroFXdensityExponent1 \\* aeroFXdensityMult1 \u002B density^PhysicsGlobals.aeroFXDensityExponent) instead of just density^PhysicsGlobals.aeroFXDensityExponent.\n\nv1.0 Initial Release"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T21:54:08Z","Content":"I have made changes to stock physics variable to compensate for playing on a resized system.

The next update after that would likely have any Real Heat specific tweaks, IF I think they\u0027re necessary for either compatibility or to take advantage of Real Heat, but I haven\u0027t yet had a chance to play with RH so I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027ll need or want to.\n\nNow, that said, Deadly Reentry isn\u0027t just about heat.

Without utilizing a heat shield, should it be feasible for an SSTO or any lifting-body configuration to re-enter in 64k? I don\u0027t normally play with scaling configs. I\u0027ve managed to put an SSTO into orbit after many many attempts and rebuilds. But I can\u0027t bring the thing down safely. A Stock Mk 1-2 command pod with a stock 2.5m heat shield makes it through just barely. Without providing to much more info and derailing this discussion to far, does that sound about right? Obviously it SHOULD be possible (We had STS program in real life afterall) so I\u0027m under the impression that its simply a stock parts limitation. I\u0027m tempted to change some temp limits on stock parts or play with the heat difficulty slider a bit, but I wanted to hear from the \u0022pros\u0022 first.
