I accidentally clicked the exit button but when I clicked the VAB, nothing happens. Not only that, every other building except the Astronaut Complex opens up. I tried restarting ksp, the issue remained. I tried restarting my laptop, still, the issue remained. I verified the game file\u0027s integrity in steam. Help please, my station isn\u0027t gonna build itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide Notes: Yes, my laptop can run the game in at least 30 fps. The game is legit and I bought it in steam.
