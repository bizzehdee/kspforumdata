Doing a bit of research for a possible story I\u0027m writing. A human medical student from the modern age finds himself in a stone-age society, trying to deal with an infection that is wiping out the populous. I have it figured out, generally, how he can solve the dilemma, but I want to push human ingenuity to the max here. What kind of equipment could be built that would be analogous to a modern med-lab? Yes, I\u0027m assuming a \u0022tech tree\u0022 could be involved here; if something had to be constructed for rudimentary fabrication, that\u0027s fine, but there are only a couple of months available in which to do all of this. Mortar and pestle is easy enough. How about a glass lens? How hard would it be to create a robust microscope with 5x magnification? In a nutshell, I\u0027m looking for boy scout solutions to advanced scientific instruments. Nothing too fancy required.

Make two or three lenses, and you can easily do multiple times that by assembling them in a tube. But the higher your magnification gets, the more problems you\u0027re going to get from impurities. Now, you\u0027re not going to need high-tech glasses to do do the job; simple quartz glass does the job. Lead glass is even easier, but is likely going to be unsuitable for optical lenses because it isn\u0027t completely clear. So the question is, how can you tell if you have the right kind of quartz sand available to you, and how pure is it? You\u0027ll probably need to test sand from different sites all over the place, and develop washing techniques to make sure that the stuff you\u0027re processing is as pure as possible. Once you have it, you\u0027ll want to mass-produce glass lumps and then polish them with hide (or better, tanned leather, if available), which hopefully gets you nice and clear surfaces. Select the best, most clear ones out of your whole batch, and put them aside. Then take all the other ones you don\u0027t need, and practice grinding them into lenses on stone surfaces. Once you feel confident you know how to get the shape you need, it\u0027s finally time to process the best pieces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnergy is the primary technology driver. Melting glass, for example, takes more energy than a neolithic society can manage. Thankfully, the reason is more that they never had a reason to try before, rather than it being hard. The answer is simply: charcoal. Making high purity charcoal is surprisingly easy with even the most primitive of methods; your bare hands are enough, in fact. Though tools certainly make it faster and easier. Once you have charcoal, a clay kiln with a manual blower and a lot of patience will get incredibly hot. Hot enough to process glass, and most common metal ores. Iron is within reach, in fact, though getting it right requires skill and good conditions. And once you can make iron, steel is not far off either - because steel is just an iron/carbon alloy, and if you have one element in high purity and unlimited abundance, then it\u0027s carbon. The trick is controlling the mixture, because you have a relatively narrow band between 1% and 3% carbon content where the alloy takes on the right properties to be called steel. Given modern knowledge, primitive furnances could be rigged up that can do it, but unless you\u0027re a trained metalworker you\u0027re likely going to have to invent your way there from scratch, with a metic ton of trial and error. If the right mixture can be achieved, you can try adding chrome, if available (identifying ores will be a huge problem). Chrome steel is the simplest form of a rust-free tool metal that there is. In other words, it would give you the closest thing to surgical steel that is possible with primitive technology. Something quite useful to a doctor, I imagine. But given the sheer amount of effort and reliance on certain ingredients (that need to be identified and purified first) probably means you\u0027re going to have to make do with less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, consider copper. Much easier to process and shape than iron, it may not be as hard or as rust-free as chrome steel is, but it does have a curious property: it\u0027s a microbicide. In other words, it kills germs on contact. Medical equipment made from copper would not require sterilization - though perhaps occasional polishing will be in order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo not bother trying for bronze, unless you literally find tin ore right at your doorstep; the stuff was insanely hard to get back in the day, with the entirety of the bronze age society spanning europe, north africa and the middle east relying on a single source. By contrast, copper and iron are nearly everywhere. Bronze, if well made, is a better tool metal than pure iron, and easier to melt as well, but it comes at the cost of being finnicky to handle. You cannot forge it properly, because its melting point is incredibly close to the point at which it starts being malleable. It will need to be cast, which is more limited than forging.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook up the channel Primitive Technology on youtube for tutorials on how to set up charcoal production and blower kilns from literally scratch (the guy walks into the wilderness with nothing on him but a pair of shorts).

Just getting the necessary infrastructure in place would take a couple of generations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-04T14:35:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImho the Yankee\u0027s adventures in Camelot would finish after the first spoken word.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause he speaks in Sassenach language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-04T15:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223427697\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177280\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221533393311\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022#\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EHide contents\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImho the Yankee\u0027s adventures in Camelot would finish after the first spoken word.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause he speaks in Sassenach language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe series is obviously really adult, but from a technical perspective,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EOutlander\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is just about the only realistic treatment of potential time travel...well, anywhere.

When would you go to? Your options are surprisingly limited. Unless you are some sort of extremely accomplished expert in ancient languages, your ability to arrive and converse with those around you will be pretty much nil for any destination more than a few centuries in the past. Going BCE is right out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot only do you need to choose a destination where you can speak the language, but you need a destination where you won\u0027t immediately be caught up in the middle of a war, or hanged for being a heretic. It would also be a pretty good idea to make sure that they won\u0027t bleed you to death if you happen to fall ill, and they will know enough to clean your wounds if you are injured. The American Civil War was the first time that even basic principles of sanitation became widely applied in medicine, so you probably want to target a time of low or moderate political upheaval some time after the 1860s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, you don\u0027t want to go to a time period too recent, for a couple of reasons. For one, you should probably avoid a period where having identification and papers and a social security number is assumed. You probably don\u0027t want to be caught on video or photographs either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if there was a good destination for a time traveler, it would be somewhere around the midpoint between the American Civil War and the First World War. Being able to visit a lot of destinations via rail is nice, so perhaps somewhere between 1880 and 1910?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell........when does fiction involving time travel first emerge?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn literature, we\u0027ve long recognized that most themes and devices we use are\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0old.
