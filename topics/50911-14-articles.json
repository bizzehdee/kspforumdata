Very nice. One thing that kinda trolled me for hours until I just figured it out was that the KW Rocketry 3.75m Ultra-Heavy Lift Subassembly for some reason had all kinds of wiggle in the fairing base which seemed to go away when I removed the part and replaced it. I\u0027m guessing the subassemblies were carried forwards from an earlier version of KW and there\u0027s some subtle difference between the part in the subassy and the part definition in the plugin so that one works and the other one doesn\u0027t... Looking at the working craft vs the subassy that wasn\u0027t working all I see is that the KW3mExpandedFairingBase that works has \u0022dstg = 5\u0022 while the one that doesn\u0027t has \u0022dstg = 1\u0022 but have no idea what that means to KSP...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Hmmm...
