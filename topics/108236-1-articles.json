Two scientists aboard, using remote guidance for piloting the vehicle. Unfortunately, I did not give it enough solar panels. When I started research, my batteries quickly drained, and the panels are not enough to power the whole ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, research continues - as soon as any charge comes in from the panels, the charge is immediately consumed. However, this leaves the craft just as good as stranded, because the charge is gone as soon as it arrives, and I cannot move the craft, transmit science, or do anything else with it. It seems it will be quite a long time before the research completes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith two nerds aboard, it would seem that one of them would be smart enough to turn off processing of the lab in order to allow some power for the ship to move. Can we get a button to stop processing, to help in such a situation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T17:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a button to stop research, but it is probably disabled when you have no power. Try having one of your kerbals go on an EVA, it might stop the research unless the system only checks for two kerbals when you first start it up. You might also see if the infinite fuel hack on the debug menu will allow you to salvage your mission (I\u0027m not sure if that helps for electric charge).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
