It\u0027s a bit of a bummer to have spaceplanes be destroyed and be redesigned all over again in 1.0.\n\nAlso, is there a certain speed limit until damage starts, or will it always happen?\n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T15:34:58Z","Content":"I think that there are multiple threads for this already.

They might have more than one, so if a space shuttle\u0027s bottom is exposed, only the bottom would get burn marks and the top would be fine.\n\nOr if we want a black heatshield tiling (I certainly do), but also want to keep the symetry of the Mk2 and Mk3 parts, you could have a system where certain textures are applied to a fuselage or wing depending on its orientation in the editor, with some tool for fine-tuning specific parts.\n\nOr, heck, maybe that neat idea of a spray-on ablative shield painting would be cool. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T21:58:11Z","Content":"Spaceplane parts don\u0027t need heat-shielding, players need to learn how to re-enter a spaceplane.
