(IMHO). Haven\u0027t played Kethane, so can\u0027t comment on that, but SCANSat is one of the few mods to actually give a use to satellite probes, and provides a great start-game when exploring a new body. The mid-game is the detail-scanning, and the end-game is the actual resource gathering (whether it\u0027s ISRU, science from different biomes, or landing at anomalies). It was an absolutely brilliant game-progression in combination with Karbonite and taught a lot about setting up scanning orbits which are both efficient as well as covering the planet.\u003Cp\u003EWith the stock scanning mechanic, there is no start-game. Just attach the scanner to your mission pod, polar orbit, BANG, dunnit, now straight off and perform the detail scans on the same mission, possibly even landing and starting to mine, all in one go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a SCANSat-like mechanic, you\u0027d FIRST send a probe off to scan your target, then \u003Cem\u003Ewhile it\u0027s doing that\u003C/em\u003E, design, build, and launch your detail-scanner/mining-rig/science-lander missions. By the time you get the actual mission launched and on it\u0027s way to the destination, your low-res scan is done. And for the people that just want to send a single mission, time-warp completes the scans in a couple of minutes anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, RD, but some people would prefer not to have the Insta-scan, no matter how you justify it. Not saying it\u0027s a bad solution, but it\u0027s not for everyone, and it would be awesome if modders could override it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure I\u0027m on the same side, so much that I always used one scanning add-on or another all of my KSP life, and I look forward to have SCANsat being compatible with KSP 1.0. I hope SCANsat will continue to provide what realistically has to be expected out of scanning a planetary body, and sure I will avoid to use the stock scanners for anything SCANsat can do better (IMO).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut while \u0022realism\u0022 is my way of playing KSP, I totally accept other players may not be interested in the same mechanic, and instead will be plenty happy with \u0022instascanning\u0022 a whole body (with the M700 orbital survey scanner, as the other stock scanners only show what is in range/contact). While I (and others) can easily accept to play KSP modded to have the features we like, most players still like to play with only what stock KSP provides, and in that view, the new survey mechanics are a huge step forward.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:34:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SydKhaos\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SydKhaos\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow...no one is seeing it....\u003Cp\u003EYou dont just attach one scanner and BINGBANGBOOM your done scanning....for you have only done 1/3 the scanning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmm, yes, we realize there\u0027s more to it than the high-level InstaScan.

When you scan a planet with the Survey Scanner the SCANsat coverage maps will update and allow you to overlay resource data on the big map. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell the Survey Scanner doesn\u0027t actually transmit science like everything else does, there is no ScienceSubject and so I assume the onScienceReceived event doesn\u0027t get fired, which means I\u0027ll probably just have to keep checking if the current planet is scanned. But either way, updating the map to show resources will be simple. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere will also still be the option to disable the biome lock (enabled by default), meaning that anyone who really hates scanning can just skip ahead and have accurate maps right away. Otherwise the resource overlays will work like they did under Regolith, giving minimum, then average, then accurate values based on surface scans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe primary difference will be in the availability of the zoom map that isn\u0027t tied to the narrow-band scanner, and isn\u0027t limited to your current location. Another option here might be to prevent zoom map resource overlays unless you have a narrow-band scanner onboard (this is simple to implement), that could maintain the usefulness of that part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESCANsat Mode:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor version 12 this will work much like the old SCANsat resource scanning. You will have to setup your orbit and wait until you finish actually scanning the surface to be able to display the information on the big map. Thanks to the new animation module this should be a little bit more coherent than before, where you could start scanning while a part was still retracted, but otherwise resource scanners should work just like regular SCANsat sensors. It will also required Module Manager (or manually editing part configs) to add the required modules to the scanner.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will have the same options for biome unlocks and zoom map availability as the default mode. The only difference is that the resource coverage map won\u0027t update instantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to avoid the instant orbital scanning you\u0027ll just have to exercise self-control in activating the map overlay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFuture Mode:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving on to version 13 and 14 modes; what I want to do is allow for the disabling of the stock scanner (basically just prevent the scanning event from showing up) and replacing it with SCANsat-style scanning. This would prevent any kind of instant scanning and would allow me to generate the map overlay textures myself so that they would match the big map overlay (planetary overlays will be lower resolution and simpler to generate, making them much faster than the big map; also, the same can be done with biome maps, replacing the debug menu overlays).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerating the overlay texture is simple, getting it to match the stock style overlays might not be so simple, but something similar to the blob-style overlay should at least be possible.
