I have made a SSTO plane recently that I feel pretty good about. I wondered if others might like to try it out and post some feedback in this thread. Much as I\u0027d like to publish it on spaceport, I\u0027d like to make sure I\u0027m not the only one that can fly it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/903249917205173336/5EAC6B881C5CD5255CB9D25BB6BDAE757A90F029/\u0022 alt=\u00225EAC6B881C5CD5255CB9D25BB6BDAE757A90F029\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gotten her as far as Eve and Duna already, I don\u0027t have any gas stations outside the Kerbin SOI yet, but I don\u0027t foresee it having any problems getting further if there is a place to refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight recommendations\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry not to pitch it above 50 degrees. She\u0027s heavy and may not climb at a higher pitch on the jet turbine alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring takeoff, begin trying to pull up immediately for extra takeoff speed. Must be something in the engine, I honestly don\u0027t know why that is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plane absolutely will make 2400 m/s off the jet if you hold her in the 30km altitude range to pick up speed. The rockets can be used for that little extra push to make a circular orbit above 69km. This tactic will save you tons of rocket fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe jet fuel is useless weight if you\u0027re not coming back down before refueling so feel free to just keep picking up speed until the liquid fuel indicator reads 540.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportant Kerbal safety tips:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI strongly doubt this plane could safely touch down on Tylo so I would not go trying that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, SSTO might also stand for Seriously Scary Take Off. This hog is very heavy. She will run all the way to the edge of the ocean before lifting off if you don\u0027t kick in the rocket engines (personally I don\u0027t use the rocket engines during takeoff, up to you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe will fight you for control at first in Eve atmosphere. Just hold a 30 degree pitch on re-entry until about 20k meters, then she should settle down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat about covers the basics. If anyone feels like trying this and posting a note or two about what is difficult to manage, or any other concerns about it, I\u0027d appreciate it.
