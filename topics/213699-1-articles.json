After activating the stack separator it kind of \u0022stuck\u0022 to the command pod on its side. Even after reentry to Kerbin it was still there. It didn\u0027t come off until touch down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) the parachute, even though it was set to auto activate at 1000 ft, deployed at 22000ish ft. You\u0027d think it would get torn off at that speed but nope it stayed on until touch down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) I got a weird blue vertical box on the right hand side of the screen blocking staging information in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E after recovering my craft and returning to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can not stress enough how completely disappointed I am with this game. Delay after delay we are left with a game much worse than even basic KSP1 and virtually unplayable\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CylonMike","CreatedById":226843,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T18:35:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2- had same experience with decoupling\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 - they stated they are still working on reentry physics\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TomKerbal","CreatedById":222333,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T22:25:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224246374\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213699\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677522929\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226843\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CylonMike\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, CylonMike said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4 - they stated they are still working on reentry physics\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s good to hear !
