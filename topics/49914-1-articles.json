The earth shuttle can use an atmospheric landing, but those wings are just dead weight for a moon landing (and transfer), where the landing thrusters for the moon vehicle would be a liability during earth reentry, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, as a veteran KSP player you have learned that it works much better to have specialized craft than a one-size-fits-all approach. One of the more interesting concepts in real life is a Mars-Earth shuttle (needing heavy shielding from radiation for the trip) which would be sped up once, would have a highly elliptical orbit around the sun so it would pass close by earth and mars on a regular basis. It would only have to be accelerated to it\u0027s orbit once, and from there shuttle craft would speed up to pick up and drop off the payload (passengers, goods) without having to speed up and slow down all the heavy shielding.
