If you travel around the world, you have to deal with electrical outlets that are of wildly different shapes and often connect to power grids that operate at different frequencies and voltages.

myriad of different aircraft and operators and national origin, and various other ground equipment just works for everything. the standard cargo container also is a story of widely adopted standards that just work. the universal docking port is still valid, and the only reason iss needs a bigger variety is that there was still considerable legacy hardware involved in its construction and operation. right now there just aren\u0027t that many players in manned spaceflight. but in the post-reusability era you are going to see a significantly more diverse population in space, and as that grows standards will need to be adopted. especially when it becomes unfeasible for everyone to carry a dock adapter for when 2 ships disagree with eachother about their docking capabilities. better to use the most common standard and avoid the losses from the additional mass.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso b5 is a notable example because it shows a docking procedure in the oft reused cgi stock footage that more or less makes sense (except for the pressurized docking bays and the single point of failure). it shows every point in the process from approach, landing on the pad/elevator and how the ships are brought into the docking area and even how you disembark, in extreme detail and done in a way that is not beyond our present engineering capabilities. fiction yes, but i like how much thought they put into the mechanics of it all. the hard sci-fi aspects are indeed only skin deep if you look closely enough and by s5/crusade its all star trek tech (though respect for clarke\u0027s third law is strong with this one). i actually think the b4 station was a better design and it would not be that hard to add a tangental docking platform to the larger rotating section. b5\u0027s zero g dock didnt make much sense though because you would probibly just have a container yard, either internal or external, and no reason to have only one opening, having separate personnel and cargo handling areas is a good idea though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nunless you go with skylon\u0027s approach to having everything as a cargo container, even ones capable of transfering humans, then you can just take all containers in the zero g dock, route the manned ones to the interchange and the cargo to the zero-g yard. passenger containers are a good idea because you could just dock them on the unpressurized side of the bulkhead to a ring of airlocks, sort of like chambering rounds in a gatling gun. any space suited dock workers can be transferred to the zero-g section by the same conveyance network.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited

rings. fluid stabilization will be required for any station where humans can freely migrate. with sufficient capacity it can handle docking of various manned craft. this can also be supplemented by physical ballast (say lead blocks that can be moved around with a forklift) which can be moved around as needed to take localized strain off of the stabilization system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhub docking is for small rings like the one in 2001 or the gateway station concept. first gen ring stations are not going to need more than a couple docking ports, as they will likely just be for space tourism. zero-g is preferred for science or freight handling. industrial stations on the other hand will have a diverse array of zero g and spin gravity areas. some processes are cheaper in zero g and others require gravity. and all require a lot of mass. and interchange systems will need to be able to exchange large volumes. tycho station
