I have got a good rocket design (Based on an existing one from Kerbal Spaceport) that got me to the Mun very easily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the Kerbals don\u0027t walk very fast on the Mun. It\u0027d be much more exciting to be able to explore the Mun through the use of a fast ground vehicle. I want to put a ground vehicle such as a Jeep on my rocket so that when I get to the Mun, I can deploy it. The jeep should be able to return to the rocket so that I can use it again in Minmus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, I have no idea how to do this. I\u0027m guessing my ground vehicle can be downloaded from Kerbal Spaceport, however, how can I mount it onto my already existing spacecraft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T11:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMoved to How to, hopefully you\u0027ll get some better suggestions here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnno","CreatedById":67618,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T12:05:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasiest way would be to use docking ports on both the rover and lander, attached in such a way that the rover just drives up to (or under) the lander and gets attached. Or you can build a boxlike structure under/inside/etc the lander, drive the rover in, then deploy landing legs to close the opening (by using a separate action group for example). There are so many different ways that it\u0027s all down to creativity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for using a downloaded vehicle with your existing spacecraft you can look into subassembly loader. It allows you to load your different saves into the same VAB instance. Otherwise open up your existing spacecraft and build your rover onto it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T13:51:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of using a docking port is that you can take the rover with you when you leave; of course, the rover will need to have a docking port as well for that to work. If that\u0027s not a consideration, one of the smaller stack seperators or decouplers will also do the trick and save you some mass in the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
