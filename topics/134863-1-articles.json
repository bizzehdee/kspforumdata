whatever the case, RTGs don\u0027t transfer their core heat directly to active radiators in the same way that, for example, ISRU converters or drills do.\u00A0 The ideal core temperature is 350 K and the shutdown temperature is 10000 K, but if the part or the outside environment is hotter than the core, heat won\u0027t transfer into it, so that 10000 K may as well be infinity. \u00A0The core-to-part heat transfer rate (the heat that can leak into the rest of the vessel)\u00A0is .01 % (one tenth that of ISRU--which also runs a lot hotter than RTGs do), so I\u0027m going to call it and say that\u00A0you don\u0027t need radiators except insofar as you need radiators for the other passive\u00A0parts on the craft. \u00A0The RTG \u003Cem\u003Ecase\u003C/em\u003E is relatively light at only 1200 K maximum temperature, so if you are taking a lot of them somewhere hot, you may wish to provide a radiator or two to keep them from blowing up due to imposed\u00A0heat from other sources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI will warn you, however, that the configuration values for RTGs are commented using old references, so it is possible that these numbers will get a balance pass with the next version. \u00A0Be on your guard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-24T19:15:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2016 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Zhetaan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T19:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222471823\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458845535\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157006\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Loren Pechtel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n17 minutes ago, Loren Pechtel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I\u0027m going to Mun, but I plan to send other copies around the solar system--it\u0027s a science hopper that can mine it\u0027s own fuel.\u00A0 Mining operations need a lot of RTGs, not just one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while you would certainly use solar \u003Cstrong\u003Earound\u003C/strong\u003E Moho the whole reason I\u0027m using the RTGs is to avoid the enormous battery stack needed to last through the night on the surface.\u00A0 Why can\u0027t we have vessels that shut down the mining operations during the hours of darkness???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would not recommend running drills or refineries on RTG\u0027s.\u00A0 If solar won\u0027t work for you (for instance, if you\u0027re going to Jool or if you want to run at night) then I would go with fuel cells.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t even imagine how many RTG\u0027s you\u0027d need to run even the small, inefficient ISRU equipment let alone the standard sized stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wibou7","CreatedById":155221,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-24T19:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222471823\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022134863\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221458845535\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157006\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Loren Pechtel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Loren Pechtel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I\u0027m going to Mun, but I plan to send other copies around the solar system--it\u0027s a science hopper that can mine it\u0027s own fuel.\u00A0 Mining operations need a lot of RTGs, not just one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while you would certainly use solar \u003Cstrong\u003Earound\u003C/strong\u003E Moho the whole reason I\u0027m using the RTGs is to avoid the enormous battery stack needed to last through the night on the surface.\u00A0 Why can\u0027t we have vessels that shut down the mining operations during the hours of darkness???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo support a mining operation on RTG alone does not seem feasible to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo support mining operation solely on RTG, you will need a lot of them...
