I have already seen some blender stuff for the model. \n\nI know there is a jump beacon mod out there already, but i wanted the mechanics of having to pass through a ring (size limitation) and just for the visual factor of using a stargate. Are there any modders who would be willing to help with the code side of the mod? We are looking for someone who might be able to do a simple interface and the mechanics for the transfer between gates. Anyway, if anyone is interested in assisting please let me know. \n\nThanks"}]}
