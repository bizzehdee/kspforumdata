Now, with that said:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck this out yall. If you have ever gone to the coast you know the wind tends to, most of the time, come off the water. Well, with that being said, what gives at the KSC, I am showing yall a picture that makes no sense from a reality point of view. The wind moving the flag at the pad is heading out to sea, not heading onto land. Now, before anyone barks at me that this is a game, and shouldnt be taken all that seriously, I point out, some of this game is being taken seriously, what with all the work on atmospherics and heating, why not have the flag point as if the wind is coming ashore? just askin.

I myself have spent copious amounts of time on the coast, and 99% of the time I am there, guess what, the winds are coming off the Gulf. You also ran right past the point of my post. Given what we all know of how wind works, why is the wind in KSP 180 degrees off of what we see 99% of the time?

If experience matters, until recently I spent 10 years living on yachts; mainly sailing around the North Sea and Mediteranean but including 3 Atlantic crossings and time in the Caribbean.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sea tends to maintain an almost constant temperature, while the land heats-up and cools-down much more during the day/night. Keeping it simple (don\u0027t base any forecasts just on this!) land warmer = air rising over land, falling over sea = sea breeze, usually during the day. Conversely land cooler = air rising over sea, falling over land = land breeze, usually at night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yes, if there were any wind at all in KSP the sea breeze (which is usually very weak compared to other weather influences) for daylight launches \u0027should\u0027 make the flag point inland, out to sea for night launches. But which way is inland? KSC is almost surrounded by sea on three sides and has mountains to the West. At 4km high those aren\u0027t insignificant lumps of rock and would act as a block on any wind blowing due West; both physically and because you\u0027d expect an almost-continuous \u0022fall wind\u0022 to be pushing East from there. The most open direction for the wind to flow would probably be Southwest from KSC, almost parallel to the coast there and South of the mountains. Overall, this guesstimate would suggest winds over KSC would vary roughly from NW to NE during the day, backing SW during the night, but probably never as far as South.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: hmmm, there isn\u0027t much of a sea breeze in your picture, the major effect being the prevailing and katabatic winds from the moutains. Were it a hotter day the bay to the North would have more effect and the flag would be pointing more South, even Southwest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeterology ^^.
