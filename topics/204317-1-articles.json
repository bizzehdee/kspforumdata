However! What if a remote probe is an light-hour away in distance?\u00A0 That would mean what you see the probe doing happens an hour ago. That also means when you give a command, the probe won\u0027t get it until an hour later.\u00A0 A pilot can be very useful to be in the same area as a probe or pilot a ship that is too far from Kerbin.\u00A0 If a probe and a pilot are in the same area, then a pilot can control the probe in near real-time.\u00A0 For some tasks like a flyby mission, the route is mostly pre-made and commands arriving hours late is not a big problem.\u00A0 Anyway, I hope to see some realistic use of the speed of light and give a pilot more to do. At least in some advanced setting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the engineer, nothing breaks so I never need one.\u00A0 I also never need a colony. To mine, I just land an automated miner and store the ore for processing later. This method has about only 5% of the speed as having an engineer on site, but with the long times of departure and arrival, the ore is ready dug up and refined ready for kerbals passing. I also made fuel transport that goes to a station near Kerbin, but that also doesn\u0027t require an engineer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, we need rare random breaking (in some advanced setting) and more things like parachutes that need to be repacked.\u00A0 Help me think of other ways an engineer is needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-11T16:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s confirmed that there will be no speed of light delay of any kind in KSP2.

I think you could also say that rather than those things representing a total disregard for what is physically possible, they more represent just subsuming their implementation, e.g.\u00A0 the fact that in-game you can control your probe in real time at whatever distance just sort of assumes that your mission control Kerbals at home knew how to issue the relevant commands in advance.\u00A0 Ditto for build times. Life support is obviously less like that, especially for really long missions, but again I think that was a question of it just becoming too much for the player to manage in that context.\u00A0 And FWIW you could also explain that away with some kind of implied Kerbal hibernation. Anyway, it will be interesting to see how they deal with that in KSP2.\u00A0 Magical propulsion systems that could never exist within physics as we understand it OTOH seem to me like the game crossing a key line between trying to adhere to some level of physical realism and entering\u00A0into the realm of pure fantasy. YMMV, but for me scaling interstellar distances down hugely, which is not completely implausible IMO, solves both the problem of needing to create an Infinite Improbability Drive and the problem in terms of gameplay of inter- and intra-system travel timescales being 3 or more orders of magnitude apart.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-13T22:30:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2021 10:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-13T23:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224019489\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022204317\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221628882898\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is a \u0022Doubletalk Drive that lets you do it Star Wars-style\u0022 super \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

That seems like it would limit the scope of the game way too much to me, so what I think you\u0027re left with is striking some balance between making KSP2 interstellar ships go 10,000 times faster than their fastest KSP1 counterparts and having the next star system be 10,000 times closer than that.\u00A0 My instinct is that roughly splitting the difference, i.e. putting the other stars 100 times closer and making the ships go 100 times faster, will be close to ideal in terms of both keeping the timescales in balance and not having to invoke Star Trek-type\u00A0 pure fantasy technology.
