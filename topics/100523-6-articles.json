Its completely generated via procedure. So I\u0027m guessing I\u0027ll have to make single user copies of that texture for the smaller plates. Then dive into the code a bit to see if I can adjust its scaling. Fun fun! lol \n\nDoing the tire tracks is a bit tedious but I\u0027m learning. Making a displacement map to show ruts in the ground is easy enough to do but I\u0027ve had some issues getting the ruts to display the tire tracks properly. So the idea is to use the displacement map to change the ground mesh with ruts from the tracks. Then where you have ruts appearing apply a texture that further displaces the area thus giving the appearance of textured tracks. I know it involves using a mask similar to the one you make for the displacement. Just need to break down and figure it out in cycles. \n\nUsing dynamic painting would be another way of doing this that might work. Certainly would make more sense for an animation. I might look into this method to see if I can get it to work. Getting the tracks to show should be easy using dynamic paint but I\u0027m wondering how you would get the displacement to go along with it? Wouldn\u0027t the tracks just appear as flat textures on the sand? Even with a normal map applied it will look wonky without a displacement to go with it. \n\nAs for others not rendering I\u0027m not sure.

Likely better than i could do in the same amount of time lol.\n\nJust curious as to what you used to do the deformation? Not exactly related to this but wonder if a wacom would help with texture/vertex painting. I have one that was given to me but never really got around to using it.

The major problem is the shear number of settings that need to be tweaked in order to get it working efficiently. Add to that those settings seem to be almost haphazardly littered about though your various settings dialog boxes. Now that you\u0027ve found those settings your usually in for some Google legwork for each individual setting because they are usually very poorly titled and the tooltips are usually horrible as well. Worse is that after doing said Google legwork you\u0027ll find a good deal of conjecture seems to swirl around properly setting this all up. I guess arcane would be a good way to describe getting it setup. Blender definitely lacks the polish that your used to in 3DSMax, Maya, etc. \n\nBut after you get things all tweaked for GPU rendering the render times fall dramatically. Throw in a newer model NVIDIA card with a high number of CUDA cores and your in business. Renders that could take hours are down to minutes. Its that dramatic.
