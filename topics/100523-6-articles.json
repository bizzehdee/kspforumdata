Its completely generated via procedure. So I\u0027m guessing I\u0027ll have to make single user copies of that texture for the smaller plates. Then dive into the code a bit to see if I can adjust its scaling. Fun fun! lol \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing the tire tracks is a bit tedious but I\u0027m learning. Making a displacement map to show ruts in the ground is easy enough to do but I\u0027ve had some issues getting the ruts to display the tire tracks properly. So the idea is to use the displacement map to change the ground mesh with ruts from the tracks. Then where you have ruts appearing apply a texture that further displaces the area thus giving the appearance of textured tracks. I know it involves using a mask similar to the one you make for the displacement. Just need to break down and figure it out in cycles. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing dynamic painting would be another way of doing this that might work. Certainly would make more sense for an animation. I might look into this method to see if I can get it to work. Getting the tracks to show should be easy using dynamic paint but I\u0027m wondering how you would get the displacement to go along with it? Wouldn\u0027t the tracks just appear as flat textures on the sand? Even with a normal map applied it will look wonky without a displacement to go with it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for others not rendering I\u0027m not sure.
