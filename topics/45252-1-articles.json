In fact, I\u0027m not even suggesting anything. I\u0027m just asking a question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut today I was looking at my Mun rocket and thought it looked as if it were just cobbled together. All of my rockets made with the stock game look as if someone built spaceships out of random bits of metal they found lying around (which is probably the case). This is not a particularly bad thing: it sort of goes with the theme of the game. But I think we all like the nice, streamlined tanks of NovaPunch and KW Rocketry. Those make your rockets look more legitimate and realistic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, as the title asks, will the stock parts ever be redone to resemble a more professional demeanor? Or is the scrap-metal look what Squad is going for? It has been done once before, and I know the spaceplane parts are in store for a redo, so are the rocket parts as well?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T00:12:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would absolutely love to see someone make a stock retexture pack using modulemanager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do also think that the stock parts look a bit too worn and pre-used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, they are kerbals, but they are smart enough to have ion engines and nuclear rockets (which even NASA doesn\u0027t have NERVAs) so I think it is reasonable to assume that the parts should look a little more polished (in the literal sense, not game design sense, they feel very balanced \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally love the visual appearance of KW.

Like, they said KSP is going to be a massively iterative process. Everything\u0027s they add is going to be reworked at least once. Granted, they\u0027ve already reworked all of the rocket parts once or twice, but there\u0027s no saying they\u0027ll never do it again, especially now that they\u0027ve got some more artists on-board. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if they overhaul the models AND textures at some point, though it\u0027d probably be long after career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, they\u0027ve never updated any of the spaceplane bits, so I think those are the next already existing parts we\u0027re going to see get a visual(and probably functional) upgrade.

The new KSC buildings look simply amazing, not just the style but the way they come from a unified design aesthetic.
