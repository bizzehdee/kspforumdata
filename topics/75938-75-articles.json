With the success of your compile, at least we know I can make little adjustments here and there without negative impact. For instance last night, while trying to figure out my problem, I discovered an odd case in one of the files (I forget which one presently) where you had two functions with events/actions defined above them. What\u0027s nuts about it is that the field labeled \u0022Gear\u0022 and attached to the default \u003Cem\u003EGears\u003C/em\u003E group was also attached to the function for \u0022brakes\u0022 and the other event/action (whichever it was) labelled \u0022brakes\u0022 was attached to the function called \u0022Gears.\u0022 I looked at the content of the functions and those seemed to be in the right place, so I just swapped the function names so it all fit properly. As far as what happens in each instance, considering the functions don\u0027t actually get called by name anywhere else in the code, it probably has no impact at all on what actually happens in game. As far as reading code, it\u0027s definitely an improvement. I\u0027m going to try and commit that one in a little bit here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Off topic, I\u0027ve been to a few sessions of my C# class now and it looks like the class won\u0027t even cover anything more complicated than single-file, single-function console programs. So, since I started messing around with KSP and your source, I\u0027m already way ahead of most of the class as far as experience with the language. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022See Mom?
