It also sends platform information (Windows, Mac or Linux), version information, and IP address. A bit thin, perhaps. I\u0027m suggesting including a whole lot more information, so long as it doesn\u0027t include so much info that you could call it spyware. Knowing what parts are popular could help Squad decide what bits to nerf or buff, for instance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, are some of those stats available on the web? If not, could they be? I\u0027m sure mod authors would like something a little better than download count to see how popular their mods are. Press-types can get usage figures without prodding Squad to ask. Curious people like me get to nose around for the sake of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-27T13:41:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbaldevteam.tumblr.com/post/80726433815/devnote-tuesdays-the-award-winning-community-edition\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edev blogs\u003C/a\u003E, it sounds like this is already in place:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alex (aLeXmOrA)\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alex (aLeXmOrA)\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m still working on the in-game stats page in the website that will let us know how far the players are going in the game (it will only be available for us to see it, I just have to make that clear.) \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
