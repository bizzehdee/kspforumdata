The MUS tanks are nicely suited for this and also have some rcs nozzle and monoprop tanks incorporated. This way you can add an additional 1000-2000dV in a small package.  \n\nIf you have the LH2 option enabled (rename patch file to .cfg) the weight is quite low meaning you can take more fuel/dV in the second stage while keeping the same first stage. Use the RL10 engines for this, they are light and efficient, especially in the LH2 option.\n\nMy little soyuz launcher:  \n![soyuz_01.jpg](http://kerbal.nl/soyuz_01.jpg)  \n\n4x Merlin 1B, 1.875m tank for LF/O, TWR 2.2, gets me up to 1700m/s and 32km   \n\n2x RL10A-3 with LH2/O, TWR 0.75, can get me to 150km LKO with 600dV left and then rendezvous with station with 200\u002BdV to spare  \n\nSoyuz really doesn\u0027t need to use it\u0027s engines to get to the rendezvous, but it turns faster than with the 2nd stage still attached.\n\nPS: I put all the things I need to do in an action group so I don\u0027t have to go through the GUI menu during a launch. If I press 1 the LAS jettisons, SM panels are dropped, solar panels extended, cabin lights turned on, docking lights turned on and docking antennas deploy. Saves a lot of clicking and scrolling. With \u0022Abort\u0022 I decouple the bottom of the DM and activate engines on the LAS, this leaves the SM behind. Then when I press 1 it decouples the OM and deploys chutes. This way I have a clean automated emergency procedure without panicking which button to press to open chutes before it smacks into the ground. I never use it as there is a Revert to Hangar option, but it\u0027s cool to play with it sometimes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-10T18:17:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/10/2016 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jimbodiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-10T18:09:55Z","Content":"Here is/was my Series-C launching rocket; though I believe this was before I decreased their mass; so should take even less rocket now:\n\n![VzjdOJf.png](http://i.imgur.com/VzjdOJf.png)![oG2Sm4d.png](http://i.imgur.com/oG2Sm4d.png)\n\nSingle lower/first 2.5m stage with a stock Skipper engine;  short and simple second stage with a single RL10A-4.

No I cannot, without inducing extra part count, which goes against the entire reason I\u0027m modding.

It could also be that you have other mods adding more controls to the parts; and there is nothing I can do about those.

I\u0027m using LC2-FL with a DC3 on it, and LC3-FL connected to the decoupler. Everytime I decouple the inner tank it is getting blown up by the decoupler, even if I set the force to 0, or either it gets stuck in the outer tank and hauls it upwards with no way to jettison it.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E What am I doing wrong? Before you guys ask - I\u0027ve made sure I\u0027m attaching the outer tank precisely to the decoupler, not the inner tank. Is it made to work only on low gravity, atmosphere-less planets?  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E From what I see when using a more powerful engine to propell the main stage of the lander - the decoupler might be getting stuck between the tanks after decoupling and causing damage when thrust is applied, but I\u0027m not 100% sure.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Any tips?\n\u003E \n\nHmm... they were intended for exactly that purpose, and worked last I tested them (1.04; using them in my career game which never got updated).

Is there a way, or a future plan, to make the modular fuel tanks and SRB\u0027s finely adjustable, sorta like procedural parts fuel tanks? So i don\u0027t *have* to jump up another whole meter to get just the last bit of DV i need\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Asking because as much as i like procedural parts\u0027 tanks, they don\u0027t have the right fuel ratios that the LH2/OX in SSTU burn.

Those tanks aren\u0027t procedural; they are pre-compiled models (16 of them!), and any non-uniform scaling will result in visible distortion of the piping on the side (would become non-circular) and of the textures (mostly the stringers would be effected).\n\nPerhaps if I\u0027m in an odd mood one day I\u0027ll play around with scaling the tanks in blender and see what they look like.  If they don\u0027t look like mud, I might consider implementing it in some fashion.  Most of the back-end code is already there (from the new unified model system from last weekend), and would mostly consist of adding in the GUI hooks and another persistent config/save file variable. No guarantees though...\n\nYes, I semi-recently changed the ratio to match up with that used by Nertea\u0027s CryoEngines mod (15:1).  From what I remember it shouldn\u0027t be too hard for you to do a edit/patch for the procedural parts tanks, it was a decently simple setup last I played with it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, Jimbodiah said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I can second that... tried to make a 3-stage lander and could not get the decouplers to work (they blow up the outer tanks).

I just end up connecting it such that it came with the upper stage for my RO SLS-Orion-Altair. further testing required, but I think something is funky there as well.\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the confirmation of the decoupler issues.\n\nWith those parts I had cheated a bit and used a non-convex collider for the octagonal portion, so it would effectively only have a collider for mouse-over interaction, and would never actually collide with parts.  However, I recently ran across some posts saying that they had removed the ability to use non-convex colliders on parts with 1.05; something regarding them getting auto-converted into a convex collider.\n\nWhat this likely does is turns the entire thing into a flat disc-shape, that cuts through your fuel tank.  A vessel cannot collide with itself; so its all good while it is coupled.  But trigger the decoupler, and all of a sudden they physics engine sees there being two *very badly* intersecting colliders, triggers the on-collision code and/or starts pushing the colliders apart (at extreme velocity)... and explosions are the result.\n\nIf this is indeed the case, the solution will be simple, though less than optimal.  I\u0027ll need to create specific compound box/mesh colliders for those parts and remove the existing non-convex colliders."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-11T04:18:22Z","Content":"1.0.5 does indeed force all collides to be convex.
