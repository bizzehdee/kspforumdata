All appropriate answers are greatly appreciated. And could someone tell me how to add my file on here so people can see what the problem is if needed. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif):P here is a screenshot through Gyazo [https://gyazo.com/58cf80a2b1bafab174f68586ae021b80](https://gyazo.com/58cf80a2b1bafab174f68586ae021b80)\n\n[https://gyazo.com/8fa7c6e87c9da8ce07a6730c1cd6f170](https://gyazo.com/8fa7c6e87c9da8ce07a6730c1cd6f170)\n\n[https://gyazo.com/1e35aa6076f20607f974b011a97f4105](https://gyazo.com/1e35aa6076f20607f974b011a97f4105)"},{"CreatedByName":"Chewy","CreatedById":115853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:07:47Z","Content":"I\u0027m not at my computer, so I can\u0027t check this, but I think your problem is that you have your batteries between your fuel and your engine. I don\u0027t think fuel flows through batteries, so if you move the batteries further up the stack above the fuel tanks, I think it will work in space."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:17:36Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m not at my computer, so I can\u0027t check this, but I think your problem is that you have your batteries between your fuel and your engine.

Maybe you accidentally had it drain the liquid fuel out of the tank. And are you sure you have fuel left when you leave the atmosphere?\n\nOther than the fuel lines, I don\u0027t see any reason why it wouldn\u0027t work, from what you\u0027re showing anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"Phil deCube","CreatedById":120897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:21:37Z","Content":"How far are you trying to send that satellite?
