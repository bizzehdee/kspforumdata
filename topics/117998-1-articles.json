All appropriate answers are greatly appreciated. And could someone tell me how to add my file on here so people can see what the problem is if needed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E:P here is a screenshot through Gyazo \u003Ca href=\u0022https://gyazo.com/58cf80a2b1bafab174f68586ae021b80\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://gyazo.com/58cf80a2b1bafab174f68586ae021b80\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://gyazo.com/8fa7c6e87c9da8ce07a6730c1cd6f170\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://gyazo.com/8fa7c6e87c9da8ce07a6730c1cd6f170\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://gyazo.com/1e35aa6076f20607f974b011a97f4105\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://gyazo.com/1e35aa6076f20607f974b011a97f4105\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chewy","CreatedById":115853,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T05:07:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not at my computer, so I can\u0027t check this, but I think your problem is that you have your batteries between your fuel and your engine.
