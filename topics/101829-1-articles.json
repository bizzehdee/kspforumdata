I was shocked and angered at how badly the physics worked. If you have to make up the rules of gravity in a game, I thought, you\u0027re doing it wrong; considering that gravity is a simple inverse square attraction law. (And also the Moon is in a totally different place from the planet)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t recommend Space Agency. If you want a Mobile KSP, SimpleRockets would be far better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, today, while looking for an image, I stumbled upon this article.
