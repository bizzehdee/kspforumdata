Could there be something called \u0022Program\u0022 where multiple contracts would follow with logical milestones (close to real NASA-like programs) to reach and after you fullfill all the contracts you will be rewarded with a new subasembly related to parts tested during the program. Also all kerbal paticipants should get a medal for achievments in that program. Also the admin building can reflect this and add some more options to tweak the programs for example to make the milestones more manned-unmanned-spacelabs-partstesting focuse or something else may be limiting the number of simultal programs by utilizing the game curencies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
