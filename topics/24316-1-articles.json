Three reasons large tanks are better than using multiple small tanks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1\u0026gt; You don\u0027t deal with the structural strength issues you have when you try to connect multiple smaller tanks together. A single large tank is really convenient as the center of a large station, especially if you experience high stresses during launch. It\u0027s not just about reducing part count; a single tank CAN\u0027T warp, no matter how much stress it undergoes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Tanks expend fuel in a different mass distribution. A series of small tanks will drain the frontmost tank first before expending anything from the aft tanks, which very quickly results in your mass being concentrated at the back of the vessel. Depending on what you intend to do, this can be either a really good thing (trying to land a brick on Duna) or a really bad thing (trying to take off with a spaceplane). Larger tanks drain in a more uniform way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; When you\u0027re transferring fuel around between multiple tanks (like when you\u0027re refilling your ship\u0027s tanks at a space station), you can only pick one start and one end tank. Refilling a dozen small tanks is just a pain, whereas refilling a single large tank is easy. Also, big tanks transfer fuel more quickly, although this isn\u0027t a big deal in practice. Now, if/when we get a more robust fuel transfer system, this one will go away; all we really need is the ability to select \u0022Out\u0022 or \u0022In\u0022 on a single tank and have it transfer to/from all other tanks on the same vessel (minus the ones you\u0027ve explicitly blocked from being used by engines, like on lifeboats), and we\u0027ll have a much easier time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sathurn","CreatedById":58040,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T00:43:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk I get the arguement that, kerbal is scale to make \u0022Easy\u0022, so real world tanks would be over powered.

As much as I try to keep things sensible... I ended up having to start slapping on aerospikes and LV\u0027s.
