Think I had most of the transmitters tuned down to ~50%. Either way, I still had ~2 Gw of power from the network. Yet I was seeing on the ground more power from my Microwave Thermal Receivers than you are with more power in your network. I had only 4 relays up in GKO, each 90 degress apart from eachother.

I only had the MW Thermal Receivers. I did not rely on the network to also power my crafts (solar panels, RTGs, etc for that). I only used the power network for propulsion. I do not remember the exact numbers I was seeing on the surface, but they were often at least 500 MW and climbed sometimes to ~1GW as I was flying. I also used the thermal turbojets as I was working on an SSTO spaceplane. At the time, I did not have Fusion Power, so the thermal turbojets were not of the hybrid type, which means I had to switch out engines at a certain altitude (i.e. when the jets were no longer able to provide a TWR of 1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022philotical\u0022 data-cite=\u0022philotical\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, I correct you, since you are wrong.\u003Cp\u003EYou must be the AntiTrecky to confuse the plasmathruster with an ImpulsEngine ala ST.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStar Trek is NOT Star Wars my friend!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut never mind...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou, sir or madame, are hereby expelled from the Trek Fan Club.
