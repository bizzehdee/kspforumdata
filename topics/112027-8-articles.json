Squad is constantly trying to balance initial playability versus realism, and they have messed that a few times. They come up with gameplay mechanisms like thermal loading, then they tweak everything so the only thing it really does is blow up a few batteries and solar panels. They add a lot of heat to a nuclear engine that WORKS BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH HEAT and people complain so much that they cut the heat back and back and back until basically you can just use it as a regular engine. They add a whole system for distributing heat all through the ship, and then when people get confused they add magic radiators to just let you completely ignore the heat system by sticking them anywhere. They keep trying to make re-entry deadly without actually being deadly, so they give this skin heating mechanism but then they up the heat tolerance of the parts so much that you can still drop a capsule straight down onto Kerbin from Munar altitudes and it will survive with no heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want some mods that are more than just extra parts.

You made your call, and I just happen to be in the not-pleased camp this time (I\u0027ll deal). Besides, I\u0027m putting this ball as much (if not more) in Squad\u0027s court. You work on the game, but ultimately the decision of what mechanics to implement and what to do with them lies with a higher power. It\u0027s Harvester and Maxmaps and co. who need to decide what they want - an abstract representation of thermodynamics, in which case the current stock heat system is (in my opinion) vastly overcomplicated, or a detailed representation, in which case they need to actually start giving the player details and let them do something with the heat system. Doing this whole skin heat thing that ratchets the complexity up another two notches while simultaneously saying it\u0027s okay to greenlight a set of radiators intentionally built to be abstract, all in the same patch...

It\u0027s the conceptual side, because these radiators have invalidated the reason for this mod\u0027s existence from a conceptual standpoint. Heat Control is all about routing heat around the vessel, but the new radiators don\u0027t care where the heat is. So for those of us who like the idea of purposefully routing heat around the vessel, having these parts in stock is akin to a death sentence to any sort of depth in this regard. If Heat Control wants to continue existing and offer this kind of gameplay and have it make sense ingame, it needs to nerf or remove your radiators. Either that, or Heat Control completely changes what it is and does. That\u0027s just the consequence of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear Future Electrical may work well with the stock radiators. I say \u0022may\u0022, because as mentioned, NFE\u0027s balancing is really quite sensitive to radiator mass, and without a test build of the mod, there\u0027s no telling of how many stock radiators you actually need to mount to achieve 12 MW of radiation flux without exceeding 900K reactor temperature (the high watermark test for NFE).
