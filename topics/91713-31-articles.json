Is the intent to include a \u0022pod\u0022 style arrangement where a cargo container is lowered/raised through a middle \u0022frame\u0022? Or alternately is the intent to make a variation on the existing ventral door cargo bay with a platform/elevator? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the former, obviously there are problems with something like a cargo section being a separate piece. I don\u0027t think KSP would handle that very well. You can\u0027t just \u0022swap out\u0022 pods like the original TB2 could and not have some significant stability/wobble issues. At least not in that exact fashion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I expect the \u0022pod\u0022 will either be a permanent part of the module/part, or you\u0027ll be working with something more along the lines of the latter moving platform idea. (which has been done before with a few mods - Wayland\u0027s Devo once had a large shuttle mod with such a design, but that was about 4-5 versions of KSP back and it had some other unrelated issues that made it impractical to work with.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case - I\u0027m wondering if a \u0022cargo pod\u0022 could be developed that would fit with the existing model - something with perhaps an integral pair of docking ports opposite each other so they can be secured even without the use of something like KAS/KIS? My experience with the Wayland Eagle tells me that it\u0027s better to have close-fitting sets of opposing docking ports/CBMs for flight stability. I don\u0027t think it matters whether they are a fore/aft config or a port/starboard config. But any \u0022pod\u0022 that is a separate piece that docks with a larger craft to become an integral unit MUST have an opposing docking port arrangement for stability. Otherwise you have to secure it with KAS or something (like I did with the rover above in my earlier post). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe even have an integral set of \u0022rollers\u0022 or wheels integrated like a rover so that it can be manipulated or rolled into place by other rovers? Or maybe even make an optional pod that can configure like a KIS container that can fit larger volume stuff inside and can be placed aboard? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intent with my ideas above is to provide a suggestion for a cargo pod/container that is NOT dependent on a particular cargo bay/part arrangement. In other words, it could work as both a \u0022roll-on/roll-off\u0022 container for a regular aft ramp load in the field or be able to work with the vertical arrangement of a TB2 style ventral/dorsal cargo section. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m considering putting something together using existing parts/mods to better illustrate the above concept.
