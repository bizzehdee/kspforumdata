Next stage is for orbital insertion and pushing through last two atmosphere stages, or thereabouts. I build this to around TWR of 1.05, roughly try to get 3000\u002B Delta V out of it. Then I build a launch stage with TWR of 1.4 1500\u002B Delta V for takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI read somewhere while looking for stuff to do on ksp. that solid boosters are sometimes paired with liquid engines to help with thrust. I was trying to think how to incorporate them into my design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI imagine solid boosters are used in the launch stage, but if I use say the 250 thrust ones, pair them with a 200 thrust ones. I would want to keep my TWR at 1.4 for lift off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enormally I would do this. 215 thrust, \u002B 500 from two side boosters. 715 total. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I do, 715 / 9.8 / 1.4 = 52.1 which would roughly be my total mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen do 52.1 minus Payload of what i\u0027m building. Then subtract engine mass and any bits that are not fuel. The rest of the mass I use as fuel. Then calculate its Delta V. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is when the boosters finish the TWR always drops below 1, so it falls backwards. I know I have to build whatever is left to have twr with the liquid engine of 1.4 as well or a bit higher since it would have travelled anyway. The mass of the fuel becomes much less, so TWR with the two boosters is no longer 1.4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot to the point, where I don\u0027t know how I am enhancing the liquid engine by using the boosters as a sort of hybrid thing to increase thrust. I\u0027m sure it has something to do with the time the engine is active, till it runs out of fuel. I don\u0027t know how to time the booster to match the time of the liquid engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdea is if booster with more thrust lasts as long as the liquid engine, during that time, the liquid engine could lift higher payloads, even though engine is much smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust can\u0027t figure out a way to do it while i\u0027m building a rocket. I have always wanted to find a genuine use for boosters, I think this may be it f or me. As a thrust booster, not as delta V, since in terms of Delta V the liquid engines are far superior.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"celem","CreatedById":91132,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-18T16:02:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont let my srb\u0027s enter the math like that. Rather than allow for them, and then have your TWR dropping off halfway through your main launcher\u0027s ascent, you still design the launcher to have the TWR you want. You then run it at greatly reduced throttle while the srb\u0027s are active, and ramp it up again once the srb\u0027s are dropped. Net result is usually extra fuel reaching orbit in the form of a half-spent orbital burn stage or whatever. Just take it with you as bonus fuel or use the left-overs to de-orbit your insertion stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise as you point out, your craft ends up a little gutless in that window between srb\u0027s dropping and ditching whatever jumbo/mainsail style launcher you are using. For me this is often round the 20km point, which is a dangerous place to be strapped for thrust. An alternative is to use several rings of the smallest booster instead of a single larger one, they burn a little over half the duration, so 2 rings equals out to about 1 ring of big boosters, and by carrying that second ring into the trouble-zone with you, you can kick through the low TWR phase by applying that thrust exactly when you need it. (On some of my launchers i carry a ring of the smallest srb\u0027s to fire \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter\u003C/strong\u003E I drop the last asparagus tank, this is a point where im suddenly on 1 mainsail yet still pushing a pair of orange jumbo tanks from the launcher, along with interplanetary/payload.

The reason for boosters to have good performance is their \u0022zero\u0022 engine mass, their mass efficiency of burning fuel is bad and if we don\u0027t use all of them from launch it just means that we tug along an inefficient dead weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for OP\u0027s question. The original idea of boosters comes from increasing burn time (fuel amount) of current design filling the thrust gap at launch with them. The problem with KSP is that we don\u0027t have much parts to choose from right now. And current boosters have really big amounts of thrust. For example for only two RT-10 boosters it takes rocket with two mainsails to have same launch TWR at launch and at booster separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is more to them, due to way KSP does drag. It is most efficient to fly just below terminal velocity, and that takes only ~1,8 TWR mid flight to maintain it. It takes much larger TWR thou, to just accelerate the ship from launch pad to desired 100-120m/s early. This is where it\u0027s good to have boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile building, just design for around 1,5-1,6 after booster separation, and let any excessive thrust at launch reduce deltaV requirement to reaching orbit.

Drop tank asparagus is one of the best options there is. If it\u0027s a light payload, then you could still use drop tanks, or an air lift to high altitude and then fire an orbital engine. I would recommend building a \u0022one size fits all\u0022 lifter solution and drop it into the subassemblies area. That way, you can just build your payload, fix it to the transfer stage, then just grab the same lifter and use it every time. In case you haven\u0027t tried it yet, the drop tank asparagus design allows you to maintain full thrust the entire time until you run out of drop tanks and then it switches to regular asparagus staging.
