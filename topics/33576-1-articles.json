It features Kerbin TWR of 1 and ample delta v, allowing it to land and return from all but the most massive barren rocks. It can reach, land and return from mun and minmus without refueling, and doesn\u0027t need a transfer stage to reach Eve, Duna or Jool and their moons (provided it can refuel before landing). It comes with a standard crew of 2 kerbals but has seating for 6 more, plenty of lighting, balanced RCS for docking, a wide landing base to provide stability on slopes, and a detachable rover capable of stability at high speeds, night operation, and reattaching to the lander for a return to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover is carried inverted atop the lander during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/6bmt7lhm1/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s20.postimg.org/iq9l7x94d/2013_06_17_00001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_06_17_00001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eonce in orbit the rover is released and picked up on the bottom of the lander, freeing the upper docking port for rendezvous and refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/45sid3e5l/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s20.postimg.org/q4yx0auzx/2013_06_17_00004.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_06_17_00004.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/h153dlisp/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s20.postimg.org/oh4cze6i5/2013_06_17_00006.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_06_17_00006.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/692xkrdyh/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s20.postimg.org/k2ra9t6jx/2013_06_17_00008.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_06_17_00008.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/9rexh5euh/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s20.postimg.org/sjqskqb8t/2013_06_17_00011.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_06_17_00011.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rover uses RCS to hover and return to the lander\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/j4ax7it7t/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s20.postimg.org/9wioqtm5p/2013_06_17_00013.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_06_17_00013.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always a party with Igaluk!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://postimg.org/image/o5p7bi2qx/full/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s20.postimg.org/62w4ka6wd/2013_06_15_00023.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013_06_15_00023.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo courtesy of Malkuth:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/u--OgkiUENw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eaction groups:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) disabled gimballing on outer engines \u003Cstrong\u003Epress twice before every launch or the rocket will wobble\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) extend solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) open antennas\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E0) disable rover RCS thrusters (for docking with stations while the rover is attached)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ/Engineer pictured but not included. .craft file is as always 100% stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://herpnderp.info/KSP/Munar%20Service%20Lander%20Lifter-S.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://herpnderp.info/KSP/Munar%20Service%20Lander%20Lifter-S.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-23T04:45:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2013 04:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Colonel_Panic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir_Tramalot","CreatedById":62713,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T06:23:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is not stock, it has mechjeb on it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Colonel_Panic","CreatedById":61997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T06:30:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sir_Tramalot\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sir_Tramalot\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat is not stock, it has mechjeb on it!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMJ is in the picture, not in the .craft.

I\u0027m not an expert, but I -think- it\u0027s pronounced ig-uh-luck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurning with the LV-Ns during late ascent increases the overall specific impulse of the burn, since their high isp offsets the low isp of the mainsail engine. You could possibly save more by using a cluster of LV-30s around an LV45 as the core stack, but that might also cost you more in weight and part cost, since it seems like you\u0027re going for low expense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is definitely true that by having fewer LV-Ns on the lander, you would increase efficiency, and you could probably land fine with 2, however this is only the case if you\u0027re actually removing the engines from the design, and not just disabling them (since it\u0027s the weight of the engines that you\u0027re burning extra fuel to support. -using- them just trades off burning fuel -faster- for faster acceleration, but your total delta v does not actually change, and in fact may suffer with less thrust due to less precise burn timing (due to the Oberth effect, you burn the least fuel if you can complete your entire ejection burn closer to the prograde vector, and closer to your periapsis, aka, faster.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to include clamp jr ports on all my lifter stages to siphon off unused fuel in orbit, but I kinda stopped caring about it since cost wasn\u0027t an issue, and just minimized waste by fine-tuning most of my lifters for ascent efficiency to not have a ton of fuel left. Another thing you -can- do if you want, though, is to begin your transfer burn with the lifter stage attached, and using only LV-N engines (disable the mainsail), and then decouple it just before the lifter tank runs out of fuel, then continue on with just the lander, and de-orbit the lifter with the last bit of fuel when it reaches its apoapsis (however, for this particular lander I did NOT include a solar panel on the lifter, so you\u0027d want to add one first.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the amount of fuel you use for an inclination change is proportional to your current velocity (the actual formula is something like delta-v=sqrt(2)*v where v is your current velocity), and the most efficient place to do it during your transfer is somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of the way to your apoapsis. (since changing it earlier takes a smaller change in degrees to line up your orbits, but changing it later takes less fuel per change in degree, because you\u0027re moving slower.) You want to fine tune your inclination to match your landing site or rendezvous orbital plane immediately after entering the target body\u0027s sphere of influence, since you\u0027re moving slowest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor best rover use, turn on your SAS with T, turn on precision controls with capslock, and then switch to docking (translation) mode, so your input won\u0027t cause it to try and torque forward/back or side to side while turning. If you use a soft touch on it you can cruise pretty safely at 35m/s, just be prepared to tap spacebar to switch back to rotation mode in case you manage to get airborne and need to re-align yourself to land flat and in the right direction. Also this rover has enough spin torque due to all the attached probe cores to right itself and to pitch up and down without using its RCS, and you could use that to drop the towing hitch by pitching up while holding the brakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t actually test the towing hitch yet, so it might just be bugged. sorry. The game doesn\u0027t like cubic octagonal struts near docking ports very much. The original plan was to make it so I could tow fuel tankers along and use the upper port to connect to a ship to refuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are looking for a good way to transport kerbals to and from munar orbit for rendezvous, you might check out the Arrow or Dart SSTO I have in the link in my sig, as it can carry 2 (1 for dart) and return unmanned using nothing but fuel (needs to refuel in LKO before going to mun). I might be working on an even more efficient shuttle for those purposes soon.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-22T22:16:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2013 10:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Colonel_Panic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T04:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes feel free to link the video:) and thanks for the tips.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Colonel_Panic","CreatedById":61997,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-23T05:20:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022malkuth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022malkuth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes feel free to link the video:) and thanks for the tips.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enp, hope it helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
