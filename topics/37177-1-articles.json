Because you cannot deal with the polys it is not within the realm of posibility for inventor to export something that is ready to run in Unity unless you\u0027re going to put a solid uniform material on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such you will have to import it through a program like Blender that is poly based to prepare the model in various ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Inventor is parametric it is going to be really inefficient in it\u0027s use of polys because it rebuilds the model dynamically for optimal accuracy to the features given the current viewport, so anything round, bendy, or even vaguely circular will have obscene numbers and the layouts won\u0027t necessarily be consistent or easy to work with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite this, if you are familiar with Inventor it is a viable approach, and Blender is hardly straightforward (if you know how to use Blender you are not qualified to comment on the matter anymore). Starting with an imported model and learning how to fix it in Blender is a good way to go in my opinion, you won\u0027t have to know everything immediately and you can over time rebuild the model more and more until you\u0027re ready to make it from scratch. To make it easy on yourself make sure you avoid circles, fillets, revolves, and holes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
