As the name suggests, it is an open source library made in python for the KSP community, to help with designing and developing new rockets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea is to have something that empowers the user to make quick prototyping and to verify\u00A0designs feasibilities. The library also allows the user easy interactivity with other python libraries, in order enable a great deal of functionalities, like plotting and optimization. While still being accessible to new programmers and python users.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re interesting in checking some examples and learning more about the library, check the repository and documentation at:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/fred1608/KSPython\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/fred1608/KSPython\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://kspython.readthedocs.io/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kspython.readthedocs.io/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if you\u0027re interesting in contributing to the project, feel free to reach in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
