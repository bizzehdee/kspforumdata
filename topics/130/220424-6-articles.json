Not heavy enough to actually drop the KLSS completely, because it becomes inconvenient and\u00A0needs a extra stage just to bring the snacks into orbit. But at same time\u00A0 heavy enough to prevent players from stuffing their manned rockets to the top with snacks.\u00A0Especially if you go into deep space or play with transit method or all that in a x2.5 scaled sun system, then the life system ressources will weight a lot themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can support KLSS with a \u003Cstrong\u003Egerman translation\u003C/strong\u003E, but i wonder where the file is located or how i can submit the translation.

I have absolutely no idea what can be made in KSP 2, so yeah might be a bit utopian.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be interesting to have something like home sickness or a depression state, where lonely Kerbals stop working now and then (f.e. give a uncontrollable vehicle state for a few days). That could be triggered after a initial period of a normal Kerbin system travel time like 60 days (like Kerbin - Minmus and back). This depression state could be prevented with a second or even a third Kerbal onboard (like after 360 days with 2 kerbals they stop working as above, while 3 kerbals = never home sick). That way deep space missions would have a higher challenge with a reasonable snacks management and it would give a bigger crew roster a right to exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-01T02:37:18Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2024 02:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 1\u0022\u003EApril 1\u003C/time\u003E by LeLeon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Safarte","CreatedById":227546,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-01T12:04:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224376631\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022220424\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221711938287\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022118287\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LeLeon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n9 hours ago, LeLeon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nplugin_template/localizations/localization.csv is 2 month old\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the right file, the updates are made in the \u0022dev\u0022 branch and then later merged into the \u0022main\u0022 branch.

Probably this would be sort of a Addon to the life support you created, that can also exists standalone. But it\u0027s beyond my ability to create things.

May i suggest \u0022Cultivation System\u0022 or maybe \u0022Plant Cultivation System\u0022 instead to better describe all processes/modules around growing food sources? These are used terms for the plant growing cycle also in space. PCS looks fine on FHD resolution, so does CS. CS is for plants and other sources like algae (who are not plants), if you ever decide to expand KLSS modules in a different way, \u003Cem\u003Ebut don\u0027t wake the Kraken\u003C/em\u003E. Algae are quite popular for space stuff. They also can be used for 3D printing. ^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
