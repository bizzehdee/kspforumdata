Well, actually, I\u0027ve installed and deleted it a few times. Does any one have any suggestions on how to quickly set up a comm network around Kerbin.

Provided they use the right antennae, this will give you coverage of the whole planet except the poles. Their altitude needs to be high enough so that they have a line of sight to each other; people often like to put them into a geostationary orbit, at 2868.75km, but this is not really necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can use four satellites to allow for a little drift without creating gaps in coverage. If you want, you can add satellites into other orbits to give coverage to the poles, and there\u0027s even a wacky arrangement that allows you to cover the entire planet with just four satellites, but you\u0027ll probably want to stick to the simple stuff for now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The satellites don\u0027t look like anything in particular; give them an antenna, a probe core with RemoteTech functionality (which may include all probe cores or just the mod parts, depending on whether you downloaded the compatibility patch), a power source and a battery, and you\u0027re good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crater","CreatedById":48907,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T12:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, my first (few) attempts at this failed because I was trying to launch unmanned probes to be the sats, and they all went out of comms range before I could stabilize the orbit.
