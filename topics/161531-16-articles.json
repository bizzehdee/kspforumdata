I already provided the numbers for ISP multiplier and Thrust multiplier- which is all that should be needed to add it... I\u0027ll even write up the code for the fuel mode and post it here so all you have to do is copy\u002Bpaste into the appropriate file...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just a little perspective as your faithful co-developer of this mod- this is a mod that started out with a Warp Drive- which by any account was OP\u0027d compared to stock- and only later added things like reactors, antimatter, and an energy-intensive process to create ExoticMatter... Thus, by all means, I don\u0027t think we should by shying away from any technology- especially when it exists in real life. Hydrazine is already a commonly-used rocket propellant for resistojets and RCS- which are basically just simple thermal rockets that rely on the increase in gas volume created by Hydrazine decomposition and either heat from that reaction or additional added heat with resistojets, to generate thrust... The only difference with putting it through a Nuclear Thermal Rocket is that the temperatures it is exposed to are much higher- which creates more complete decomposition and improved the Gibbs Free Energy of the reaction and energy released by an increase in the volume of gas...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you should try penalizing or punishing players for using it somehow either. Players could already use nuclear rockets (either KSP-I or stock) right off the launchpad anyways. While Hydrazine is much more toxic short-term, radiation is still much more dangerous in the long run... (whereas Hydrazine rapidly decays in the environment into harmless gasses) It\u0027s not up to us to make decisions for our players or our Kerbals about what sacrifices are or are not acceptable in the name of space exploration...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I particularly strongly advise against any mechanic that steals away player\u0027s hard-earned Science. Not only is it much less realistic than losing Reputation (realistically, a Hydrazine rocket probably isn\u0027t going to kill anyone- it\u0027s just going to lead to the creation of a restricted-access zone around the launchpad to prevent exposure to residual Hydrazine shortly after launches... Also, even if a scientist or engineer DID die, science has never been set back too far by the loss of one individual. Their data and records remain intact, and it wouldn\u0027t be too long before somebody else picked them up and continued their work...) It\u0027s also a bad idea from a gameplay perspective...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is supposed to be !FUN!, and that necessarily means making some sacrifices of detail in realism to gameplay. While players might disagree about where the optimal balance between !FUN! and realism lies (for instance, I like using realistic fuel-densities and ISP values, and a larger solar system, other players might not like that...)

(although Atomic Rockets confirms the Thrust/ISP for Carbon Dioxide, it undergoes no reaction- so this is the only one that is a mystery to me... It\u0027s probably due to its heat capacity being more optimal for thermal rocketry or something...) They also all make sense for balance reasons- the fuels that fall out-of-order in the ISP vs. Thrust/MW lists (Meth/LOX, CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, and Hydrazine) all require substantially greater effort to produce via ISRU (Hydraazine especially- which requires 3-4 separate reactions to produce, and 2-3 different raw resources) or have limited availability- Carbon Dioxide (and Methane, by extension- through the Sabatier Reaction) is only really abundant on Duna after all- you can\u0027t get it easily in the Kerbin or Jool systems in any significant quantity as it is a very minor atmospheric component...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E I listed the propellants as they SHOULD be based on their base ISP, and additional Thrust obtained from the Thrust multiplier. It appears the thrust multiplier is currently not being applied correctly in-game: for instance in the SPH, Ammonia is listed as having a higher ISP than Meth/LOX (should not be the case- due to how much more energetic Methane combustion is than Ammonia-decomposition, and the much higher Thrust multiplier that results...) and Hydrazine has a lower ISP than Water (should be the other way around...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf applied correctly, a fuel with a base ISP of 500 seconds and a Thrust multiplier of 2 should have a higher effective ISP (1000 seconds) than a fuel with a base ISP of 800 seconds and no Thrust multiplier... This is not currently the case- so I\u0027d go back and check the code for the Thrust multiplier and try and figure out what is going wrong... Basically, a Thrust multiplier of 2 indicates a doubling of the exhaust velocity vs. what you would expect from the molecular mass alone- without a decrease in mass flow rate, i.e. a 4x increase in the energy of exhaust gasses...

Otherwise what you have is just the turbopump magically pumping more propellant through the rocket.

One of these reactions, Ammonia-breakdown, actually *decreases* the temperature of the exhaust stream, and adds energy to the exhaust for the same mass-flow rate solely by increasing the exhaust pressure (which is later converted into Exhaust Velocity in the rocket nozzle). These reactions add less energy to the exhaust stream the lower the exhaust temperature (as exhaust energy is proportional to temperature * pressure), so increasing the mass flow rate instead of keeping it fixed would lead to a decrease in the exhaust temperature and thus a decrease in the total exhaust energy...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T06:01:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan someone explain to me what FreeThinker did with my parts and why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso regarding this bit of code you posted:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u002BPART[kipactiveport]:FOR[WarpPlugin]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    @name = kipactiveport250\u003Cbr\u003E    @scale = 2\u003Cbr\u003E    @rescaleFactor = 2\u003Cbr\u003E    @title = Non-androgynous docking port 2.5m - Active\u003Cbr\u003E    @mass = 0.46\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    @MODULE[ModuleDockingNode]\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        @nodeType = nasize250\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    @MODULE[ModuleAdaptiveDockingNode]\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        @ValidSizes = nasize1, nasize250\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u002BPART[kippassiveport]:FOR[WarpPlugin]\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    @name = kippassiveport250\u003Cbr\u003E    @scale = 2\u003Cbr\u003E    @rescaleFactor = 2\u003Cbr\u003E    @title = Non-androgynous docking port 2.5m - Passive\u003Cbr\u003E    @mass = 0.6\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    @MODULE[ModuleDockingNode]\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        @nodeType = nasize250\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    @MODULE[ModuleAdaptiveDockingNode]\u003Cbr\u003E    {\u003Cbr\u003E        @ValidSizes = nasize1,nasize250\u003Cbr\u003E    }\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend you remove \u0022nasize1\u0022 from all of these.

I already provided the numbers for ISP multiplier and Thrust multiplier- which is all that should be needed to add it... I\u0027ll even write up the code for the fuel mode and post it here so all you have to do is copy\u002Bpaste into the appropriate file...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just a little perspective as your faithful co-developer of this mod- this is a mod that started out with a Warp Drive- which by any account was OP\u0027d compared to stock- and only later added things like reactors, antimatter, and an energy-intensive process to create ExoticMatter... Thus, by all means, I don\u0027t think we should by shying away from any technology- especially when it exists in real life. Hydrazine is already a commonly-used rocket propellant for resistojets and RCS- which are basically just simple thermal rockets that rely on the increase in gas volume created by Hydrazine decomposition and either heat from that reaction or additional added heat with resistojets, to generate thrust... The only difference with putting it through a Nuclear Thermal Rocket is that the temperatures it is exposed to are much higher- which creates more complete decomposition and improved the Gibbs Free Energy of the reaction and energy released by an increase in the volume of gas...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you should try penalizing or punishing players for using it somehow either. Players could already use nuclear rockets (either KSP-I or stock) right off the launchpad anyways. While Hydrazine is much more toxic short-term, radiation is still much more dangerous in the long run... (whereas Hydrazine rapidly decays in the environment into harmless gasses) It\u0027s not up to us to make decisions for our players or our Kerbals about what sacrifices are or are not acceptable in the name of space exploration...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I particularly strongly advise against any mechanic that steals away player\u0027s hard-earned Science. Not only is it much less realistic than losing Reputation (realistically, a Hydrazine rocket probably isn\u0027t going to kill anyone- it\u0027s just going to lead to the creation of a restricted-access zone around the launchpad to prevent exposure to residual Hydrazine shortly after launches... Also, even if a scientist or engineer DID die, science has never been set back too far by the loss of one individual. Their data and records remain intact, and it wouldn\u0027t be too long before somebody else picked them up and continued their work...) It\u0027s also a bad idea from a gameplay perspective...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is supposed to be !FUN!, and that necessarily means making some sacrifices of detail in realism to gameplay. While players might disagree about where the optimal balance between !FUN! and realism lies (for instance, I like using realistic fuel-densities and ISP values, and a larger solar system, other players might not like that...)
