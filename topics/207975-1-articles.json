I do want to mention that it didn\u2019t specify what changes were made, so Rask and Rusk might still be the only 3-body system but there might be other systems where immense bulges on planets perturb orbits or perhaps other interesting effects. As for the spatial graph, this isn\u2019t for deciding how many bodies there are, it is basically for dynamically subdividing the universe so that you don\u2019t get floating point errors and bouncing bases. Your ship will be in its own space bubble which is simulated at a much higher resolution than, for example, interstellar space.

The system that the craft is in does not contain the star or the planet it is orbiting, only the craft and some objects around the craft. This doesn\u2019t affect the physics at all, you will still see gravity between the craft and the planet even though they are in different subdivisions. The main point of this is to have a much higher degree of precision when in specific scenarios, so the system with the craft is simulated to the millimeter level whereas the craft\u2019s motion around the planet is only measured in centimeter precision or something. Ideally, you shouldn\u2019t have a different physics based on subdivision, because you will always be in the same one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigStar Aerospace","CreatedById":204131,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-02T03:15:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that one of the exceptions for the multi-body physics will be right there in the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u0027d love to be able to set up an Armstrong Cycler for the Mun where it actually swings around the Mun in an infinity symbol that moves around Kerbin slowly so we can get close to the Mun.
