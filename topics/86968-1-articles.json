See all those cars in the parking lot? Let\u0027s blow them up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, the idea is that you would have relatively low-poly cars and trucks, each of them using the rover wheel module. If you explode near them, they will get knocked around silly. You then lose reputation if you damage a car, and if it is exploded it costs you some money. Obviously there wouldn\u0027t be nearly that many cars in the parking lot, and perhaps when they are far enough away for physics range (\u003Cem\u003E1\u003C/em\u003E.5 km), they become static objects. These vessels can not be switched to, nor their parts found in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Kerbals walking around the KSC would be neat. Especially if they have an a.i. that makes them look at the player controlled vessel. They\u0027d run away from things coming towards them, and would ragdoll, bounce, and poof just like Kerbanauts would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf cities are added, this would also be added there as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nahvec","CreatedById":110276,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T18:16:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey probably won\u0027t add this, but if they do, they won\u0027t do it for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T20:48:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI want this.

Players would have to balance the increased productivity from having lots of employees vs. the growing cost of wages/salaries. Destructible parked cars should be merely a bonus to this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
