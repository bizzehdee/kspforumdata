If you liked it, you\u0027re going to love Disco Elysium.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the most part people playing it seem to really really love it. The ones that don\u0027t appear to fall into more or less these categories:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPeople who don\u0027t like to read. The meat and potatoes of the game are in the text, which is a contender for the best game writing in any game ever. If you don\u0027t like reading and just click through dialogue, forget it, you won\u0027t get much out of this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPeople who insist on combat in their games. There is violence in Disco Elysium, but there isn\u0027t conventional video game combat. This is not your usual power fantasy, it\u0027s about being a complete failure and trying to claw your way back into the human race.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPeople who can\u0027t get over the politics (of the creators, or the game). ZA/UM are self-described Communists, and the game has pretty strong political themes -- among other things, it lets you play as a violent, alcoholic, drug-addicted misogynist, racist, and fascist. (Also a conciliatory, straight-edge feminist and Communist fighting for racial and social justice, and everything in between.) Whichever politics you pick, it\u0027ll poke occasionally-merciless fun at you. (And if you try to avoid the politics, you\u0027ll probably get the \u0022World\u0027s Most Laughable Centrist\u0022 achievement.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty much everybody else seems to be loving it though, it has a crazy high metascore and very positive player reviews too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for me personally? I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the best computer role-playing game I\u0027ve ever played or even if it makes sense to attempt that ranking, but it is way, way up there. It made me laugh a quite a lot and cry at the end and gave me tons of thrills of discovery on the way. My personal recommendation is that if you\u0027re the least bit interested in computer role-playing games, adventure games, or even\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereading\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Enoir cop stories, then this is a must-play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime wise, a reasonably thorough play-through will probably take you 20-40 hours. It\u0027s a substantial game but not quite as huge as Robert Kurvitz likes to portray it in some interviews.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-08T12:30:48Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2019 12:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
