For example, my radial mounts are basically a cylindrical collider where you mount the objects to, and the part that clips inside (including the sides) are visual only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to suggest a variation of adapter for the 2.5m -\u0026gt; 1.25m parts that was offset in one direction horizontally... Kind of a bicoupler with only one smaller attachment point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, I love the ideas you have come up with and look forward to this pack\u0027s release. And I feel your pain on texturing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BLUAV8R","CreatedById":83302,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T22:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust bumping this back to the front page because i really want this to become even more popular \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrrpamplemousse","CreatedById":28225,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T22:48:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thing (which is, in the concept arts, very beatiful) look like B9, maybe we\u0027ve got the thing that will fill the gap in space station parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T06:05:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elooking forward to this\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrezado","CreatedById":32502,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T23:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny progress so far?

The 1.25 Meter have a couple of finishing touches, a couple of animated radial parts are just about finished (just polishing the animation) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of texturing I\u0027m having to really experiment, Ive been working with some bump mapping and its kind of trial and error as I\u0027d never attempted 3D Texturing before, so its taking a little while to teach myself how to get the maps looking nice and fine. If anyone has any tips or advice for texturing do feel free to contact me. However Once I can get 1 part looking the way I want to the whole lot should just feed off of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all your interest.
