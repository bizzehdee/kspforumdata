Why? Because you\u0027re relying on the control surfaces attached to the wing to take off, rather than a separate canard or horizontal tail. So when you switch to the rectangular wing, you have the control surfaces closer to the CoM, so they can\u0027t act on it as well. This is also the reason why you have trouble landing. Make the plane longer, add a separate surface for pitch control, make sure that the main gear are only just behind the CoM so that it can rotate well. The fact that you need a lower lift coefficient for flight at the same speed indicates that the wing is behaving as it should, but that the issue is elsewhere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks - it took me a while to work out exactly what you meant - with the swept wings the control surfaces are literally being placed further backwards from the CoM - with the rectangular wing, they are almost in line with the axis which they are trying to turn on. Adding a set of delta deluxe winglets right at the tail works much better (and the wheels back so that it can tip, also). I haven\u0027t worked out exactly why this affected Landing yet, but it\u0027s certainly easier now (I managed to land - stopping beyond the end of the runway, but with Jeb in one piece at least)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ferram4\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ferram4\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor turning, I\u0027m assuming that you\u0027re rolling and then pitching up to turn; in that case, the problem is almost certainly that your vertical tail is too close to the CoM, so you have basically no yaw stability or damping at all.
