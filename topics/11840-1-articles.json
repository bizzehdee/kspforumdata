If you wanna be making parts, just have a look around for some up-to-date tutorials for it. They almost always explain just about everything you need to know. For things specifically KSP (and how to export parts for it, etc), just ask around once you have your models made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jack","CreatedById":265,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-03T04:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESketch-Up works, but not directly.
