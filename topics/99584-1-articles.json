Having said that, what do you think is going to happen to massless parts during the overhaul? Will they still be massless? How will they contribute to the drag of a craft? How will we compensate for the change of these parts, since now it doesn\u0027t really matter where you put them? Has this already been discussed? If so, please point me that direction!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracer\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T20:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*shrugs*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-13T20:39:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect that at it\u0027s first implementation the mass-less parts will also be drag-less.
