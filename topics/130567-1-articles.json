The only disadvantage about the Panther is that it tends to sneeze out at 13,000 metres in Dry mode, where the Whiplash will still run at 19,000 metres.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy 2\u00A2: Try the Panther first, and tweak the living heck out of the aerodynamics to get the lowest drag model possible.
