It signals the R\u0026amp;D system to not treat it like normal science and to trigger a callback method upon transmission completion. There is a GameEvent, OnTriggeredDataTransmission that can be used to invoke these methods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe uint is the part id used by the new transmission interrupt system. When creating new ScienceData you add the Part.flightID number to the science data, the transmitter can then use that ID to return the data to its original location if transmission fails. The id gets changed whenever you transfer data to a new container (at least when using the stock mechanisms to do so).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think anything else has changed about ScienceData. The IScienceDataContainer interface has a new method ReturnData, used by the transmission failure mechanism. If this method isn\u0027t added to a class implementing that interface it won\u0027t work; old mods that implement the interface won\u0027t work at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-12T22:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks -- since Impact builds its own ImpactScienceData class on top of ScienceData, it looks like I\u0027ll have to tinker with that (I\u0027ve already added ReturnData to the science instrument classes which implement IScienceDataContainer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
