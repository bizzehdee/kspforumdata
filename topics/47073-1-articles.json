HORRIBLY inefficient and rather unstable too, but hey it worked up to a point and served me well so I never changed it. This payload however really is too much for it so its time for a new one!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first attempt was interesting. . . I was rather enamored of the idea of Jets as a first stage, so wondered how far I could take it. . . . this far apparently:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/867233077377787181/BC9AD825C1FDEC1DD41501152BF0FDB7B283AD39/\u0022 alt=\u0022BC9AD825C1FDEC1DD41501152BF0FDB7B283AD39\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is bat**** insane but it works. It gets to 19-20 km up before you really have to ditch the jets, which is best done early, one spark out in that lot and you have a tumbling fireball. The three mainsails then ignite and can carry it all the way to orbit (or very close):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/867233077377788873/84EB69B7EF1785AC18973E5F89D362214A67A572/\u0022 alt=\u002284EB69B7EF1785AC18973E5F89D362214A67A572\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Nuke powered interplanetary stage then kicks in (finishes circularizing if required) and begins the push to Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat craft is on its way and has completed its burn to give it a nice Jool intercept, but I\u0027m a little worried the interplanetary stage is under-fueled . . . Hopefully with some good areobraking to minimise deltaV it will make it to Laythe. We shall see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, interplanetary stage is a little weedy and jet powered rockets, whilst they work well are a little silly. So I thought I\u0027d build a proper big rocket lifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd after several stages of refinement this is what I got:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/867233077413391157/2CFCFA9DD5ADD34C64553A4303E22BCA0368FCDC/\u0022 alt=\u00222CFCFA9DD5ADD34C64553A4303E22BCA0368FCDC\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 mainsails and staged to hell and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe small tanks around the big orange ones asparagus staged, all the fuel is gone from those about 7.5k up, last ones being ditched below:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/867233077413392931/ABADF5FFD492AE9C2D3D699D0A0AE2D35BA6D532/\u0022 alt=\u0022ABADF5FFD492AE9C2D3D699D0A0AE2D35BA6D532\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I have 3 of the big tanks \u002B mainsails further asparagus staged to the other three.
