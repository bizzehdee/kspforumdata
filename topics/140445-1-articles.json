There are now two buttons to control how reaction wheels work. The indicator that says \u0022Normal\u0022 will show you its state when you toggle reaction wheel controls between Normal/Pilot/SAS which allows you to have them working for only pilot input, only SAS stability, or both. The other button turns them on or off (the indicator will say \u0022Idle\u0022 or \u0022disabled\u0022.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
