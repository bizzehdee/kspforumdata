Setup the model definitions (and texture sets, and solar positioning setups, and fairing setups), add the new CORE definitions to the MSM part config, and it should all \u0027just work\u0027 from there.\n\n(I already have intentions on offering both the 8-tank and flat octagonal form factors as MSM body variants -- but currently working on getting the implementation/back-end code functional before I spend any more time on configs)\n\nOn that note, the new animation/solar panel code is coming along nicely.  A little bit of initial in-game testing last night with the new module setup on the MSM, and the animations were playing properly (at least in the editor).  Didn\u0027t get around to testing any of the solar panel functions, but that should be ready for testing tonight.\n\nNext bit of new code development will be on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E-fuel-type switching feature.  Already have the code for it, but it is not in a place that can easily be used by other PartModules, so it will be going the same route as the Animation and Solar code -- a centralized class that handles all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel-selection related functions that can easily be added and linked into existing PartModule code.  Results in slightly longer PartModule classes (by number of lines code), but most of the added code is simple boilerplate setup code to add UI controls to the part right-click menu and link those UI fields into the new container class (the container class internally handles all updating of those fields... but the fields have to be defined in the PartModule itself... a KSP limitation).\n\nAfter I get this initial use of the code working (on the MSM), and all of the functions and features implemented, then I get the fun task of going back to the existing PartModules and reworking them to integrate the new code (ModularStationCore, ModularBooster, stand-alone solar panel, animation, and lights PartModules).\n\nOne solar panel related \u0027feature\u0027 that I have currently not carried over is the \u0027panel lock\u0027 and manual rotation feature.  Not sure as I\u0027m going to either, as there is simply no way to accommodate for it in the KSP part-action setup -- I need an arbitrary number of UI controls, one for each \u0027pivot\u0027 in the model (the model can have from zero to infinite pivots) -- KSP demands that you setup UI controls in advance in the code, and cannot add them dynamically -- thus there is no way to properly handle the UI setup for it using standard part right-click menu.  I could potentially make up a new GUI for it.... but that is quite a lot of work for a feature that will see limited use (and was of questionable utility to begin with)."},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-06T18:22:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3.125m COS M part docked to Orion.

Yesterday/last night saw the conversion of the SSTUAnimateLight module to use the new system.  Even went a few extra steps, and now do run-time compiling of the emissive and light animations -- should be more performant, and reduce garbage generation for handling those animations (it wasn\u0027t bad before, but now is even better).  The module takes the float-curves that are defined in the part-config, locates all of the transforms/etc, and turns the float-curves into Unity AnimationCurves-\u003EAnimationClips-\u003EAnimation Components that are added into the prefab part\u0027s transforms.  Ohh, and you don\u0027t need to touch the Unity editor for any of it (can even add new light/emissive animations to existing parts that previously lacked them if you provide an emissive texture).\n\nIt is actually going to be a bit more work than I had at first anticipated, so might take another week or so to finish up.  About 1/2 done with the code-side work currently, but then still need to go back through and fix all of the configs that will need to be adjusted.  Thankfully (so far) it looks like the breakage is limited to animation states, but will know more after I get a few more modules\u0027 converted and try loading up some old craft/saves.  Once I have all of the information, I\u0027ll post a list of what parts will be effected, and to what extent.  Some will have more problems than others, simply because the PartModules within the part will be changing, and KSP code sometimes has issues with that (it mostly loads correctly with modules add/removed... but only *mostly*).\n\nOne previously unrealized potential from all of this -- who would be interested in some fuel tank mounts that have integrated landing struts?  (not suspension-based, but rigid/animated)   Should be entirely doable after this code rework pass is done.  As the MFT module will support animated bodies/noses/mounts (for cargo bay use), it would be possible to include a mount that has a built-in set of animated and deployable landing struts.  (pending modeling/texturing time of course)\n\nAnother \u0027new\u0027 feature will be the support for looping animations, and compound animation setups.  Can have a single \u0027compound\u0027 animation setup that will play one animation clip to its end, and then loop another.

The adapter models would of course have to be built (and configured) with that in mind -- it would need an attach node that was underneath the hinged portion for docking port to be attached to.
