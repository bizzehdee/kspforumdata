I play almost everything that can be played grasping a control and staring a screen (except those boring sport games, I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m like \u0022Madden WTF\u0022) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, only a few times in my life I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve found games that are awesome, inspiring, exciting and fun, and Kerbal Space Program crashed its booster stage into my list with flying colors. The level of accomplishment is astounding as its difficulty is of borderline ragequitting levels, and that makes it all worthed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaying it sometimes I feel like I am Rocket Scientist / Cold War era test pilot / Mad Scientist in a quest to conquer unknown frontiers... some others like I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4m in a Monty Python sketch with \u0022Yakety Sax\u0022 as a soundtrack.
