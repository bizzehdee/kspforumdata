You could try adjusting your antialias settings to see if that helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"slowthrill","CreatedById":159264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-24T20:32:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried changing it. I use the x8 setting and have smooth gameplay. Changing it around didn\u0027t help though. What i noticed is when i use the scatterer mod the horizon and mountain ridges are not aliased. and it seems that that is causing the black line you see here too. Because i just deleted scatterer to test and you could\u0027nt see the dotted line anymore. Same for the mountains, those were back to aliased form..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShame, how does this happen? i LOVE the scatterer mod, so much atmosphere!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Uncle Mustard","CreatedById":159346,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-26T16:05:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am having the exact same issue.
