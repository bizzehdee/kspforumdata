I could say you are traveling \u00221 quanta per 14 billion years slower than light\u0022, and if 14 billion years have yet to pass, you\u0027re neck and neck until it does. And if that\u0027s the case and quantization of space-time is possible, there must also be a finite amount of energy that would be required to make you reach the speed of light (at least until a finite amount of time passes to where you lose ground on a photon). Said energy would probably be equivalent to the mass of a Galaxy or something, but I digress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#A9A9A9;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E*The following is subject to scrutiny by those who know more than me.
