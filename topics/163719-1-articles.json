unless anyone here knows of a cheaper printer that has a heated bed as well as a minimum printing area of 12\u0022x12\u0022x12\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSupposing the business idea falls through, I\u0027ll probably get a lot more involved in 3d modelling and printing other products... possible tabletop miniatures (for D\u0026amp;D and such).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving been 3d printing for a few years now, I can almost guarantee you 3d printing used for production will fail.\u00A0 I have a product line that I print, but they are one off custom deals for racing boats.\u00A0 If I had to make a business out of it, I would find another form of manufacturing for production.\u00A0 The time involved with mass production of 3d objects is extremely high.\u00A0 It may take me 6-8 hours to print off a boat part, but if I went to a glass reinforced injected plastic, I could make a few hundred a day with a machine in my garage, and a proper injection shop might be able to do a 1000 a day (but they usually have minimum orders of like 10,000 units before they\u0027ll even consider a product).\u00A0 I maybe sell a few a month, and easily cover my costs for materials and time, with a significant profit margin on each, but If tried to turn it into a full time business, no way would printing keep up.\u00A0 Not to mention there isn\u0027t a market for that many. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming given the required specs for your machine, you have a specific product or model in mind you want to print.\u00A0 But if it is a bespoke 3d printing based business, I\u0027d suggest you do\u00A0 little research.\u00A0 There are many companies that already do on demand printing, Shapeways for example.\u00A0 They take a model from the customer, print it, and ship it back to you.\u00A0 Depending on the model, that can take a week or so, and are quite expensive.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know exactly, but to keep up with their demand, they probably have 100\u0027s of printers running full time.\u00A0 There are also printing services, like 3d Hubs, that allow private owners of printers make them available to the public.\u00A0 The customer would send the file to the printer, and they would print it out for them, and then deliver it to the customer.\u00A0 Turnaround is down to a couple days now.\u00A0 But business is sporadic at best for most members of the service.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027d like, we can PM to discuss this further if you would like more input without publicly revealing your ideas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT:\u00A0 But the best way to get a 12\u0022^3\u00A0 printer is to make your own.\u00A0 Get yourself a smaller (6\u0022-8\u0022) printer, and learn how it works.\u00A0 3d printing is a rabbit hole of different ideas and approaches.\u00A0 Learn what you like best, and then design and build your own exactly to your specs.\u00A0 There are multitudes of open source based designs available.\u00A0 Then use the printer you do have to print the parts you need for the bigger one.\u00A0 This way, if you realize your idea won\u0027t work, or you just don\u0027t want to pursue it, you\u0027ll have spent half the money, and still have a printer to play with.\u00A0 If you think it will work, you can then have exactly the printer you need for your product.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
