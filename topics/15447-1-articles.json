So, how? And in the case that it was a mod or something.. Oh well \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E So far, I\\\u0027ve tried just boarding on the command pod, and can\\\u0027t fit it in, and just going up to an empty fuel tank gives me nothing. Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gormanmod","CreatedById":25712,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-28T00:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s only one mod I\\\u0027ve seen so far.

If you have mechjeb and put one on the pod, you can disconnect from the command pod and fly the container down to the planet while the CM stays in orbit. I believe it\\\u0027s called \u0027DYJcrewtankT\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A Fat Pokemon","CreatedById":29245,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-28T04:16:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAhh thanks, I was confused, I had thought this was part of stock at first :-[\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
