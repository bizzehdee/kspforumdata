Sal_vager touched on this above, but some content is really suited for specific channel: a new screenshot can very easily be shown on Squadcast, and then be shared in a Tweet. Creating an announcement for that one image on the forum seems... overkill to me. I think there you\u0027d have a more legitimate point if not all information regarding development could be found on the forums perhaps, but I can be confident that if I post an image to Twitter (for example, as in this case), it always finds its way to the forums and spawn a lively discussion. That process is not dependent on us actively placing the content here. I also think that it\u0027s nice that anyone could potentially have a nice scoop on the forums, and start a successful / popular thread. We\u0027re very much aware of the development discussions on the forums, in this case for example Roverdude read and replied to the thread that discusses the dish, and devs often reply to the Devnote Tuesday threads as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the forums are more suitable for sharing certain types of development updates than social media or Squadcast as well: look at the long devblogs HarvesteR sometimes writes, or lately the more in-depth information regarding update 1.1. These announcements are often in a format that can\u0027t be compressed into a Tweet or Facebook post, and sometimes not even into a Tumblr blogpost. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, nobody is forcing you to use social media; it\u0027s your choice to use them, or not to use them. I understand it would perhaps be easier for someone with your convictions if we posted all information here, but ultimately the question is (why) should we accommodate everyone\u0027s personal preferences?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-13T01:07:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2015 01:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KasperVld\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Columbia","CreatedById":135031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T12:22:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E~~~~ULTRA-EXTREME-SNIP~~~~~~\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this.
