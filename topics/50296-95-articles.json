And I quickly found it impossible because a mission to Jool in RSS is like a mission to Jupiter IRL. In stock KSP you\u0027re probably only looking at velocities in the upper atmosphere of about 7km/s. Even with the weaker heat shields that \u0027stock\u0027 DRE has, that\u0027s still survivable. In RSS you\u0027re hitting the atmosphere at about 40 km/s. I wasn\u0027t able to pull that off with three stacked heat shields. The reason is that no matter what we did to the atmosphere in RSS, every planet still had the same basic properties as Kerbin. A mission like that is possible if the atmosphere mostly has the density of hydrogen, but not so much if it\u0027s like Earth only bigger. The FAR changes coming will benefit users of FAR and NEAR, which not everyone uses.
