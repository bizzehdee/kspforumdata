Generally seems to follow the more versatile kerbal look that does look performant, but doesn\u0027t betray what it was made for originally.^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECanopies are a real problem in KSP. This is a bit low-res, but i think still underlines my earlier point. Look at the eyes in relation of the bodies:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://spaceflightonline.net/images/kerbal_spacecraft_scale.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kerbal_spacecraft_scale.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real astronauts have their eyes on maybe 90% of their body height. Kerbals have their eyes more on 66%, maybe even less. So if you try to make a capsule with a small canopy for kerbals, then you\u0027ll get into a situation where the window is on level of their foreheads (or the head sticks through the ceiling). The B9 mod had a similar problem, where the cockpit was more realistic, but that ment windows were so high you couldn\u0027t actually watch through them in cockpit view.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-26T22:01:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2015 10:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-26T22:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temeter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Temeter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf the pilot is place in the middle between the side windows, then you should be able to have a good look around.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027m thinking it might not is because in the current version the pilot is not in the middle between the side windows, they\u0027re pretty much in line with the back of the windows so that they can\u0027t see anywhere behind 90 degrees to the left or right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the canopies, I didn\u0027t realise what a problem that was, I guess that explains why the downward view is so bad in current cockpits.
