Especially where is the other ship that you are trying to dock with ( lukly\u00A0right\u00A0now thanks to Kerbal Alarm Clock i can set very accurate rendezvous up t0 5 meters of distance).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is; what is the setting that i have to change to have the distance back?

Then it will be marked with a lime green targeting bracket, and the distance to it will be shown underneath - provided you are within something like 25 kilometers of it. If you are further away that than, you need to mouseover either the targeting bracket, or the vessel in map view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flavio hc16","CreatedById":183153,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-27T09:10:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223306011\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022171459\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221519722498\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002298962\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Streetwind said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour description is very vague.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to see distance to another vessel in stock KSP, you need to set it as a target.

Do you have any onscreen brackets and markers at all? I don\u0027t think the targeting marker can disappear all on its own.
