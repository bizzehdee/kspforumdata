It became an interesting challenge due to weight distribution. Trying to make something resembling an old biplane while having almost nothing up front and the weight of a jet engine in the tail was tricky to say the least.\n\nFlight Notes: Before takeoff apply some pitch up trim (ALT\u002BS) as it is nose-heavy at full load to account for the eventual CG shift as fuel is used. It is a tail-dragger, but takeoff isn\\\u0027t too difficult. At the speed the gear starts to get squirrely (80 m/s or so) you can lift off if you haven\\\u0027t already. **Important:** It starts to get unstable after about a third of the fuel tank is gone (Jeb loves this part). At this point and beyond you should only apply small pitch inputs. If you give it a strong pitch down input you may not live to regret it.\n\nAnyways, enjoy!"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T10:14:48Z","Content":"Ever considered fitting it with actual propeller?

I copied the look you used. It turned out to be one of the most fun planes to fly that I\\\u0027ve ever built. It\\\u0027s not pure stock though, I used some liquid boosters from NovaPunch 1.2 ([http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4180.msg47107#msg47107](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=4180.msg47107#msg47107)) instead of a jet engine in the back and it helped with the stabilization issues. \n\nIt flies really well even without ASAS. It\\\u0027s very maneuverable which is why it\\\u0027s so fun to fly. Don\\\u0027t go full throttle. It tends to handle best under 80 m/s.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![W7hKuh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/W7hKuh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gYoaIh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gYoaIh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![1vg2Qh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1vg2Qh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Vostok","CreatedById":22467,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T23:19:31Z","Content":"You could try fitting an engine on backwards at the nose, which is sometimes possible via glitches in the HVAB....."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T23:23:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You could try fitting an engine on backwards at the nose, which is sometimes possible via glitches in the HVAB.....\n\nConsidering you can rotate parts in any direction with WSADQE, there\\\u0027s no need to glitch anything.\n\nCheers!\n\nCapt\\\u0027n Skunky\n\nKSP Community Manager"},{"CreatedByName":"Delvar","CreatedById":20696,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T23:55:40Z","Content":"buggrit i thought i was being cleaver building a biplane.. and theres already a few here lol. well here is mine!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ISjSlpJgFk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Delvar","CreatedById":20696,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T23:57:32Z","Content":"oh and here is the craft file for it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
