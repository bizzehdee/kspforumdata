It became an interesting challenge due to weight distribution. Trying to make something resembling an old biplane while having almost nothing up front and the weight of a jet engine in the tail was tricky to say the least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight Notes: Before takeoff apply some pitch up trim (ALT\u002BS) as it is nose-heavy at full load to account for the eventual CG shift as fuel is used. It is a tail-dragger, but takeoff isn\\\u0027t too difficult. At the speed the gear starts to get squirrely (80 m/s or so) you can lift off if you haven\\\u0027t already. \u003Cstrong\u003EImportant:\u003C/strong\u003E It starts to get unstable after about a third of the fuel tank is gone (Jeb loves this part). At this point and beyond you should only apply small pitch inputs. If you give it a strong pitch down input you may not live to regret it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-23T10:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEver considered fitting it with actual propeller?
