The upside to this is, that i have less plugins that i need to perform surgery on and then recompile, to stop developers from treating my computer as their own. The downside is that this way, the plugin into which updatechecker... err, i mean compatibilitychecker, is integrated... the plugin can only know, what was known at the time it was released (since it doesn\u0027t fetch current info over the network).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is pretty much the same as what you\u0027ve seen with firefox extensions. It\u0027s exactly the same idea: Define certain dependencies and maxversions - and if those requirements aren\u0027t met, trigger \u0022something\u0022. What is triggered is up to the dev, but usually you simply get the nagscreen you\u0027re familiar with. So right now, in practice, this really is exactly the same, as when you update firefox, and then all your extensions complain about versions - regardless of if they work just fine or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s simply a stopgap measure: \u0022Unknown version detected - assume the worst.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESooo, does this make compatibility checker completely pointless to the user, since all it does, is potentially break plugins that might work just fine, as soon as you update KSP? (On the upside: As explained, the reason for this uselessness, is that they do not access the network - neither with nor without your consent). Not neccessarily: The system could actually be used as a meaningful minimum-version check - as opposed to a maximum-version check. For example, if a plugin dev knows, that this plugin only works with 0.40\u002B, then he can alert a user of KSP 0.35 of this incompatibility. But again, this is just theory - the practice is, that 99% of devs will just set the minimum version to the most recent KSP version, because that will be the one they compiled on, and they don\u0027t want to support older KSP versions (at least no more than offering older versions of the plugin - and even this, they very often don\u0027t offer - upgrade or die!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL/DR: It\u0027s a clueless update nagscreen, that is nice enough to not phone home without your consent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-26T19:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that while most implementations simply check against the KSP version, it\u0027s entirely possible that some mods might do more involved compatibility testing, e.g. by unit testing parts of the KSP API.
