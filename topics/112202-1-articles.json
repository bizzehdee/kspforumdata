I pluck a blade of grass and hold it so that the blade was flat on it\u0027s wider side going horizontally. I move the grass up on one end and down on the other slightly, noticing how the light will appear as a point on a corner but much more \u0022spread out\u0022 on the actual plane. When moved with one side moving up, it seems to shift from one corner to the plane to the other corner, almost as if the actual light is \u0022stretched\u0022 out. This reminded me of spaghettification in black holes, but on the subject of black holes, it also reminded me of wormholes as the light traveled from one point to another in a \u0022black hole fashion\u0022. This connection of spaghettificaiton and wormholes brought to my mind a question; Does spaghettification happen while traveling IN a wormhole?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hypothesis: If black holes are thought to create the process of spaghettification while entering them and that wormholes are similar to two connecting black holes, does spaghettification happen while in the process of traveling from one wormhole end to another?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to hear all of you people\u0027s opinions on this matter (Heh, physics joke \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E) as well as other hypotheses supporting and against this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T21:16:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s a steep gravity gradient...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LavaCake","CreatedById":144183,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T21:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat could be very well the case, but I imagine the \u0022path\u0022 from one wormhole end to another having objects being \u0022tugged\u0022 by both wormhole ends in opposite directions, similar to how the massive difference in regular space-gravity and a black hole causes spaghettification, the massive gradient between regular space and warped space in a worm hole may be just as effective.
