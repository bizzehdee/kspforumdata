I have an astronaut (Valentina)\u00A0stuck in orbit without any propanol fuel left. I sent up a ship to save her, but it missed and too is stuck in orbit without fuel, so close and yet it can\u0027t seem to reach her. Without fuel, I can\u0027t slow down. However, in this run, I have challenged myself not to leave any astronaut behind, so I need to save both of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T23:40:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this early in a career game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIF you can EVA you can \u0022get out and push\u0022 a ship until the orbit dips into the atmosphere. Just don\u0027t run out of EVA fuel or you won\u0027t be able to get back in. Each time you go back in the pod, you\u0027ll start again with full fuel if you EVA again: it\u0027s a bit magic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore boring but much less gamey is to design another rescue rocket and bring a bit more fuel than your last attempt. Bring one of them home, then repeat for the other. Assuming you aren\u0027t using a mod that adds life surface requirements, they\u0027ll not mind waiting until you get to them, if you need to do other things to afford another rescue mission e.g.hiring another pilot or researching a probe core so that the rescue can be unmanned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I\u0027ve realised that if you can\u0027t EVA (early career it\u0027s not available until you upgrade a building or two)\u00A0 then you can\u0027t transfer anyone to the rescue ship... so I assume you\u0027re past that or not playing career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-06T19:48:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2016 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by ElWanderer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoonMan22","CreatedById":78400,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-06T16:41:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDepending on how high your orbit is the EVA trick ElWanderer explained above might be your best bet if you have trouble with completing an orbital rendezvous, but if you are confident you can achieve an encounter then just build a ship with more than enough delta v and save them one at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sardia","CreatedById":149922,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-07T02:04:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor astronauts without fuel, you\u0027re only choices is to capture them with a claw or to back an open cargo hold into them.
