It explains everything basic (fundamental) about how to program in C#. Useful for those that want to get into plugin modding. It uses Visual C# as its compiler. Its a bit outdated (2011), which mean you should probably use the 2010 version of Visual C# to stay with it. I dont know what the results would be with the 2012 version. Full source code for the series is available, and the individual lessons are free to download directly off the site. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Sharp-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C-Sharp-Fundamentals-Development-for-Absolute-Beginners\u003C/a\u003E Enjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torminator","CreatedById":78617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T03:47:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been using this, both for KSP and WinPho8 apps, and I agree; it\u0027s quite good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T03:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that KSP plugins can only target .NET 3.5 or earlier, and that version of the framework was released in 2007. Mind you, a lot of tutorials from 2007 will be for older versions like 2.0 and it would be really bad to learn from those, but you shouldn\u0027t feel like you have to keep very up-to-date.
