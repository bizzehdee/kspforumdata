Plato is first off the list for me, as we\u0027re already discovering loads of exoplanets with Kepler, and for me the ballpark estimate of their existence (\u0027lots\u0027) is exciting enough. Next off is Echo, measuring the atmospheres of exoplanets is super challenging and it would be great to know more about them, but our utter inability to get there makes it completely academic. Also the prevalence of exoplanets (\u0027lots\u0027) makes it likely that all kinds of compositions exist. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we have LOFT and STE, both picking away at the fabric of existence itself and furthering our understanding of it. Hugely exciting stuff, but it\u0027s going to off the list as well, but only because we have such an exciting candidate in MarcoPolo-R. Rendez-vous with an asteroid and sample return (as done by the japanese Hayabusa probe as well) and developing the technologies and procedures to make such routine is scientifically interesting, practically useful AND has nigh immediate, tangible real-world application.
