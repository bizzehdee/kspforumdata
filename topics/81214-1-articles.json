You may use stock aerodynamic physics or FAR, but you must state which. You may try this challenge on Kerbin, Eve, or Duna, separate leaderboards for each variation of physics and planet. You may use any sort of stock engines and parts you want, but no mod engines, and no mod parts that assist your design in any way beyond being a structural element. You must crash your craft on surface within 500m of sea level (or under 1000 meters on Duna) to rate properly on the standard leaderboards. Really any entry is valid as long as you give the details of what you did and what you used, and a screenshot of the crash.
