The Hype Train doesn\u0027t go anywhere I want to go, but I\u0027m excited for each and every release because I\u0027m utterly fascinated with watching this game develop and evolve. Squad gets flamed all the time for their development style, the choices they make, their programming skills (or lack thereof), their sometimes tenuous relationship to actual physics, their business practices, etc. And to be honest, I don\u0027t always agree with them. But you know what? I\u0027ve sunk over 300 hours into this game, that Steam knows about anyway, and I love it to death. The degree to which people become invested in the hype is just yet another indication of what a special thing Felipe and the rest of the gang have created. So I just mostly ignore the endless speculation, but I totally understand why people get this worked up about every update. Besides, sometimes there are some really good discussions that take place in those threads. For instance, one recent hype thread birthed a great back and forth about game design, and how the new fungible economics could be improved.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T23:40:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a fun way to blow off steam with a group of like-minded people.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t see how.
