Since you can\u0027t figure out how to fly if you can\u0027t get off the ground, here are a couple of planes I made that are easy to fly and stable in the air. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first one is the T-6d Mentor 2 two seat trainer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cFAIY.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cFAIY.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve made this plane intentionally sluggish so that it is less likely to get out of control in the hands of a newbie pilot, but even so, apply course changes gently. But best of all for a learning pilot/aeronautical engineer, it will takeoff by itself if you just engage SAS mode with the T key, throttle up with the left-shift key, and start the engines with the spacebar. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMentor craft file: obsolete\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other offering is the F-5f Francisca. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NuFQr6j.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NuFQr6j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yNQCXa5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yNQCXa5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is much more manueverable than the Mentor, and to be honest, is quite temperamental with the new SAS system, but a steady hand on the stick can keep it under control. The good news is, though, that if it gets out of control, simply take your hands off the controls and the balance of the plane will automatically recover from most tumbles and spins.
