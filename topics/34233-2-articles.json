The SR is quite nimble without the launch stage, plus the RCS is not needed when basic rotation occurs. \u003Cbr\u003EOther Aspects include a usable onboard toilet built into the back wall of the cockpit with full sanitary bots to keep the toilet and cockpit clean. The life support system onboard is a XL-199, the latest generation of Frozen Tech\u0027s Life support systems that will support the pilot for the many years they spend in space. there is also a small exercise machine shared within the bathroom for prevention of muscle atrophy of the kerbal pilot\u0027s while in space for extended periods of time. The weapons system is the next generation of targeting, laser guidance(not really, aim by hand obviously) torpedoes strike at pinpoint weak points within the target allowing efficient kills with less ordnance required(the torpedoes are placed pretty close to the center). The nose is the source of the laser guidance for the torpedoes(the nose is jutting out so its the perfect reference point for firing the weapons at targets allowing easy aiming).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAction Keys\u003Cbr\u003E2=LV-909 Engine\u003Cbr\u003E3=PB-Ion Electric Propulsion System setup\u003Cbr\u003E4=Ladder, for extra boarding distance for the pilot.\u003Cbr\u003E5=Power System Charger (PSC)(4 giga solar panels)\u003Cbr\u003E6=Arming Torpedo Set 1(Turning the Ant engines on)\u003Cbr\u003E7=Deploying Torpedo Set 1(Firing the Torpedo\u0027s)\u003Cbr\u003E8=Arming Torpedo Set 2(Turning the Ant engines on)\u003Cbr\u003E9=Deploying Torpedo Set 2(Firing the Torpedo\u0027s)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EInteresting Aspects\u003Cbr\u003E-The wings are forward swept giving a unique look to the wings.

Frozen Tech is also a weapons supplier to small independent nations on Kerbin for self defence and attack.\u003Cbr\u003E(that basically means You decide which team the ship suits and which team (no bias) you believe has more money to \u0027bid\u0027 for the ship)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EPossibly in one Episode towards the end of the 2nd season, the opposite to your winning bidder steals some of the plans, causing a security breach, that is quickly solved by a bigger ship that chases the design thief and disabling their transport and taking the thief into custody. \u003Cbr\u003EAlso once the ship has been bought, who ever bought it starts mass producing it.

Its prototype, the Dominus M2, will be placed into a Munar orbit with a similar support fleet, and we can only hope that Hanland *COUGH* doesn\u0027t STEAL IT *COUGH* while we\u0027re NOT LOOKING *COUGH*. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll future Dominus-class Dreadnoughts will be assembled IN ORBIT, BY HYPEREDIT.
