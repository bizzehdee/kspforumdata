I\u0027m using an old Magnavox television as well, which doesn\u0027t have the option in its menu to change the zoom. I don\u0027t know why a manufacturer wouldn\u0027t add that option on their t.v., you\u0027d think that would be very important.

I\u0027m playing Xbox and I do not currently see an option in the game to expand the zoom so I can actually play this game.\u00A0Thanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the way I have seen people suggest there is this arrow at the top left screen or whatever but this option doesn\u0027t exist and if it did, I can\u0027t access it because I cannot see it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-21T03:03:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy \u0027zoom\u0027, do you mean the aspect ratio?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikey117","CreatedById":169509,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-21T06:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I think this has been changed since last patch from aspect ratio to Overscan I believe.
