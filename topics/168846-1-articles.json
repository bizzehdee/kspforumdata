The problem is, it seems to be impossible to satisfy the cooling needs of a reactor (generating only just enough for the drill) and the drill itself at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, the... thing below is the only vehicle I have built that has managed to cool both. As soon as I disable one of the large radiators, the reactor\u0027s core temp begins to creep up, eventually shutting down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022tbn6aEe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/tbn6aEe.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have NF electricity installed as well.

Still,\u00A0am I right to assume that all that cooling is just for one drill \u002B one converter \u002B one reactor? There could be something wrong with your install,\u00A0 it always takes me much less cooling to have all of that working.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless... the reactor generates a variable ammount of EC. You can set it to produce less EC output in the part menu,\u00A0 and the resulting heat will be less too. Arent you just using the reactor at full\u00A0power? Because that will deplete nuclear fuel much faster and generate surplus charge that you cant store (besides the heat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dangerhamster","CreatedById":146944,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-24T20:29:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally that rig looks a tad unwieldy.
