I have a suitable satellite saved. I have a suitable platform figured out and saved. What I can\u0027t figure out is how to have 3 of the satellites and the platform in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E at the same time. It won\u0027t let me save the satellite as a sub-assembly because there\u0027s a command module (the Probodobodyne HECS) on the satellite. Is there a way to save a build that includes a command module as a sub-assembly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: I hate it when I find the answer shortly after asking the question.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E I changed the root to the stack separator and it now looks like I successfully saved the satellite as a sub-assembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-30T12:35:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2019 12:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Fadamor\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-01T10:11:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHoorah and congratulations!\u00A0 You have indeed found the secret to saving sub-assemblies, which is making sure there\u0027s a free node where you want to attach them.\u00A0 That usually means making the relevant separator / docking port or other part the root.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
