OTOH I do find myself wondering if I really want one more part cluttering my RAM when the thing is only a part that already is in game , just with a diferent filling. OFC that could be fixed with either ( or both ) a better handling of the RAM usage by the game ( hint hint ) or by letting us to choose what a container has inside ( say , you give us a FL-T400 and we decide if we fill it with LF, LFO, RCS, Xenon, or a mix of those, with according prices and weight and capacity penalties for using more than one stuff ) ( hint hint ), but as we\u0027re not getting any of those now ...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T19:05:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by r\\_rolo1**\n  \nNaming conventions are hard, man ... :D"},{"CreatedByName":"temporalExile","CreatedById":127675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T19:13:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E OTOH I do find myself wondering if I really want one more part cluttering my RAM when the thing is only a part that already is in game , just with a diferent filling.\n\nYou know this is the update where they are supposed to fix that whole part ram thing, at least to some extent"},{"CreatedByName":"r_rolo1","CreatedById":26192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T19:20:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You know this is the update where they are supposed to fix that whole part ram thing, at least to some extent\n\nI point out to the \u0022to some extent\u0022 of your sentence ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Yeah, the devs are to fix some issues with the RAM usage ( most likely the memory leaks ), but the real issue with RAM , that is the fact that the game loads ALL the parts at game start to RAM and DOES NOT unload them for any reason until the game exits or crashes even if you don\u0027t use 90% of the parts in the game at any moment most of the times, coupled with the fact that for some OS the game is locked to use 3,ish Gb of RAM, is not to be addressed in 1.0, if ever AFAIK.\n\nIn that context I reserve the right to be wary of any change that will increase RAM usage :/"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T20:02:40Z","Content":"Why, why, why is everyone so obsessed with clouds?
