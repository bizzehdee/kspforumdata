When I fired it back up, the keyboard lights up, but it doesn\u0027t boot up like the motherboard is fried (no hard drive activity). Put the old RAM back in... same result. The laptop is almost 4 years old and the CPU fan was sounding like its been struggling a bit on startup, so I figure its time for a new gaming laptop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m lookin for something for under $2,000 that can handle most of the latest games including KSP with a decent number of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo that I\u0027m considering after a few hours of research are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Toshiba Qosimo X70-AST3G25 - it\u0027s biggest plus is its the only laptop I can find for its price that has 32GB of ram, but it has a less impressive graphics card than others I\u0027ve found\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MSI GS70 StealthPro-024 - it has a better graphics card, but less ram at 16GB, and no Blueray/DVD drive.... And it looks really cool! I might also consider the StealthPro-210 possibly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m open to hearing opinions on these two laptops or if you have any suggestions for computers I should be considering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T20:02:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like the RAM isn\u0027t plugged in quite right :/\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chewy","CreatedById":115853,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T20:10:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI thought that at first and tried re-seating probably a dozen times between the old and new ram.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T21:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you unplug the laptop power supply \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E remove the battery before upgrading the RAM?
