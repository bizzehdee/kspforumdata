Although I\u0027m not sure if this will ever make it into a fully fledged add-on, I thought I\u0027d share it for testing, as well as some experiences trying to make it (from a non-programmer/designer perspective). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe story revolves around an organization known as N.A.N.A. and its pursuit of science as a mean to protect Kerbin. More can be read in the agencies description at the Mission Control... Or by expanding the text bellow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E 20XX K.D.: After the discovery of a mysterious, non-kerbal-made object outside the Kerbal Space Center, many started contemplating the idea that Kerbals were not alone in this universe. Although there were no apparent evidence of hostility, some became paranoid and concluded that it is better to be prepared for the worse, and the Nuclear Aerospace and Nutritions Administration was formed (rumoured to be named after something radioactive the funders had for breakfast).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the same period, scientists at BD Armory had discovered that overheating rocket parts would cause them to rapidly disassemble. As there had been an ongoing problem with aerospace traffic(read: crashing into old rockets), the discovery was soon commercialized into special equipment for clearing congestion. The management at N.A.N.A quickly adopted this technology as they realized that this could be used to disassemble possible hostility (which was more an excuse for playing with explosives). Thus, the BD Armory and Nuclear Aerospace and Nutritions Administration agreement was established, as they pledge to become their biggest business partner. Many now refer to this as the B.A.N.A.N.A agreement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo present day N.A.N.A is the forefront in investigating extra-kerbin activity as a mean to keep Kerbin safe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are currently 6 main missions (contracts) and one side mission, involving exploration, transportation, protection, and lots of lots of air combat (uh yes somehow all the action takes place in the air... for now .. queue Kenny Loggins!).

I am not really sure were I am going with this. It started out as merely testing out Contract Configurator and making some sort of scenario with exploration and action. Maybe someone will find it inspiring, or my experiences (further down) useful for creating better things (yes please) and share it (yes yes!). Personally, I have grand ideas of escort missions, boss battles (Aero Figther style), base/colony building and defence, obstacle course flying (Star Fox style) and exploration of the universe to find the truth! Lastly, I hope that the \u003Cstrong\u003EbahamutoD \u003C/strong\u003Eand \u003Cstrong\u003Enightingale \u003C/strong\u003Ecould check out the the stuff bellow (ahaha).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAlso, if you do try it out, please don\u0027t hesitate to share where I have done mistakes and how things can be improved!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off I would like to say that \u003Cstrong\u003EContract Configurator is really easy to learn and start using\u003C/strong\u003E with its detailed documentation, \u003Cstrong\u003Eeveryone should give it a try\u003C/strong\u003E and make make some kind of story driven scenario! (\u003Cstrong\u003Ekudos to nightingale!\u003C/strong\u003E). In fact I was thinking that maybe I could try turn this thing into some kind of crowd-sourced story mode, but that remains to be... thought about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for things that I would like to see improved, I would defiantly say that the VessleSpawn behaviour could use some tweaking to properly spawn things from the SPH. It seems that it only supports spawning vessels upwards VAB style, e.g. a rocket. I used a \u0022dummy\u0022 probe pointed upwards as a root part to bypass this issue. However, two issues arise trying to make everything work in automation, when I try to spawn in \u0022enemy\u0022 vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Efirst issue \u003C/strong\u003Eis to automatically (I.e. without user input) have the vessel change to a probe facing forwards (SPH style) after the vessel have spawned in safely. A workaround can be devised by enabling \u0022control from here\u0022 to be used with action groups (only works for docking ports) using TweakableEverything. Then use the \u0022Fuel action group trigger\u0022 from the Smart Parts to trigger an action group with \u0022control from here\u0022 (on a docking port facing forwards) as soon as the craft has loaded. This was combined with the \u0022Timer action group trigger\u0022 to delay everything in case everything hadn\u0027t properly loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Esecond issue\u003C/strong\u003E is z-axis (I think) rotation. In the VesselSpawn behaviour you can define latitude, longitude and altitude, but not heading. This means that the vessel seems to spawn in a (seemingly) set direction (185 degrees I think). The issue was solved by rotating the entire craft around/underneath the \u0022dummy\u0022 probe, I mentioned earlier, in the SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lUETwgr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lUETwgr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf these two things were to be addressed it would make it a lot easier to create action scenarios, especially in terms of ground based vehicle scenarios, colony/base spawning and of course action scenarios and combat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me conveniently over to \u003Cstrong\u003EBD Armory\u003C/strong\u003E, which is \u003Cstrong\u003Eamazingly fun \u003C/strong\u003E now that you can be chased down by A.I. pilots! I really hope that this will be expanded upon with land and space based pilots. Not to mention VTOL crafts! Currently, I am experimenting with kOS for my Aero Fighter/Star Fox-style boss battle and escort mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Efirst issue\u003C/strong\u003E was to automate it all. You cannot (to my knowledge) toggle Auto Guard and Auto Pilot in the SPH/VAB, luckily they are available through action groups, so the same method as mentioned above can be used. Also, engines have to be staged manually, which is also available through action groups. Alternatively, it is possible edit the .craft files to have it all ready when the vessel spawns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Esecond issue\u003C/strong\u003E is not really an issue, but those A.I.s are ridiculously accurate with projectile weapons. A tendency to tear up everything that is suppose to be protected in seconds. Lots of quick-loading (haha). On the other hand I don\u0027t think they can use bombs (correct me if I\u0027m wrong).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnother thing\u003C/strong\u003E I realized was that adding too many parts to one specific vessel will cause all the other vessels to explode when coming into load range at 10000 physics range. This could be sidestepped by either reducing the amount of parts on said vessel or reducing the physics range significantly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I am a big fan of the whole survival concept I tried to use Module Manager to add the\u003Cstrong\u003E Weapon Manager module to every command part\u003C/strong\u003E. This making all creations vulnerable (as well as using auto accept contracts for small surprises, encouraging constructing stationary defence). However it seemed to not work very well when adding more than one command module to a single vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E---\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to trying to do \u003Cstrong\u003Estory telling\u003C/strong\u003E through Contract Configurator \u003Cstrong\u003Eas a whole\u003C/strong\u003E, the biggest downside would that most of the more \u0022delicate\u0022 parts of the story (which can\u0027t be expressed through \u0022in-game\u0022 visuals or mechanics) would have to be conveyed through text in a small window. I.e. \u0022...after getting out alive, Jeb tries to kiss Val on the cheek only to realize they were still wearing helmets, and will always be wearing..\u0022 or \u0022Do a barrel roll\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI felt a great need to have some sort of on-screen \u0022pop-ups\u0022 with an image/comic strip and some text when reaching certain way-points.

It seems that it only supports spawning vessels upwards VAB style, e.g. a rocket. I used a \u0022dummy\u0022 probe pointed upwards as a root part to bypass this issue. However, two issues arise trying to make everything work in automation, when I try to spawn in \u0022enemy\u0022 vessels.\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cstrong\u003Efirst issue \u003C/strong\u003Eis to automatically (I.e. without user input) have the vessel change to a probe facing forwards (SPH style) after the vessel have spawned in safely. A workaround can be devised by enabling \u0022control from here\u0022 to be used with action groups (only works for docking ports) using TweakableEverything. Then use the \u0022Fuel action group trigger\u0022 from the Smart Parts to trigger an action group with \u0022control from here\u0022 (on a docking port facing forwards) as soon as the craft has loaded. This was combined with the \u0022Timer action group trigger\u0022 to delay everything in case everything hadn\u0027t properly loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnown issue [\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/issues/189\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E#189\u003C/a\u003E].

In the VesselSpawn behaviour you can define latitude, longitude and altitude, but not heading. This means that the vessel seems to spawn in a (seemingly) set direction (185 degrees I think). The issue was solved by rotating the entire craft around/underneath the \u0022dummy\u0022 probe, I mentioned earlier, in the SPH.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMakes sense.
