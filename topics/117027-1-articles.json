It\u0027s NERVA, VASIMR, or fusion. The exhaust coming out can be precisely controlled so it\u0027s perfectly aligned with the spacecraft\u0027s center of mass. (and you can detect this easily with accelerometers - if you are off center, there\u0027s net torque in the opposite direction, and so you can adjust your thrust direction in a control loop)\n\nHow many more engines do you need? Your basic mission profile is flying to other planets, docking with landers, and with massive rotating space stations. The engine exhaust is hazardous to space stations and the engines are nuclear (or nuclear electric in the case of VASIMR), and so there is an unshielded high intensity radiation source at the back of your craft."},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T02:25:23Z","Content":"The minimum?
