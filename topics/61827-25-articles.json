For now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing that was updated on the Wiki was to just change some of the hyperlinks to point at the newer Spacehub, github, and forum pages. Other than that nothing has really changed or kept up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo a certain extent, the motivation for that Wiki was the fact that Kevin Laity hadn\u0027t really documented things much and so people in the user community tried to document it instead, using trial and error to learn how things work and then posting the information for others to read.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@erendrake seems to be much more interested than Kevin was in making sure documentation gets updated and accurately released with new changes, putting the docs on github too so they can be version tracked and updated just like code. I much prefer this to the Wikia approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I like wikis and am comfortable with them, what they don\u0027t do a good job of is letting you release the docs as a set of pages all tagged together as being \u0022version xx\u0022, so you can have both a historical and a recent and an in-development set of docs. Instead wikis only let you have *the* current set of docs, each of which has an individual history you can go back and look at, but not a collected together history of the set of all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, Wikia\u0027s version of mediawiki is terrible, IMO. The Wikia website is full of advertising banner boxes with badly made nonstandard javascript crud in them.
