The one thing that bugs me is my kerbals start off at level 5. Is there a way to knock them back to level 0 so they have to earn their experience as if in regular career? I\u0027m hoping it might be as simple as a cfg edit, but I\u0027m not sure where to look - or whether they would earn experience at all during Science Mode after I\u0027ve reset them to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone point me in the right direction?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, bonus question, is there a mod that tracks Kerbal experience in a more detailed way?

That looks like exactly what I was looking for. I will install it and give it a go tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other suggestions - I thought about doing that with regular career and just ramping up the $ and rep rewards but that just feels weird to me, although it makes sense. Plus, I\u0027d still have to do \u003Cem\u003Esome \u003C/em\u003Econtracts, even though they would be so lucrative I would only have to do them once in a while. This is the best option so far, but I don\u0027t love it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that only the main 4 Kerbals start at level 5 in science mode, and the rest do not. I\u0027m at work so I can\u0027t test right now, but do the other kerbals that start at 0 level up in science mode as they do in career? I suppose I would be ok with not using the big 4 since I use them almost exclusively in my sandbox adventures, and it might be fun to build a space program around a bunch of unknowns that I will inevitably learn to love (especially with the final frontier mod helping me remember their exploits).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as cfg editing, I took a look at the persistent save file and there doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to change a kerbal\u0027s level. I see there is a log of what they have done, but no indication of their current level. Is this hard coded and not changeable?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PeterTaylor","CreatedById":95596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:54:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pearldrumbum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pearldrumbum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI also noticed that only the main 4 Kerbals start at level 5 in science mode, and the rest do not.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moment you enter the VAB/SPA they get all 5 stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to play Sandbox or Science while having to train my Kerbals too\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny mods that allow this???\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PeterTaylor","CreatedById":95596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just found a solution on the KSP Reddit page\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis enables Kerbal Experience in Science Mode, and if you upgrade all the buildings and unlock all the science, well then you have Kerbal Experience in Sandbox Mode too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34e4md/request_enable_missions_in_sandbox_and_science/cquh194\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34e4md/request_enable_missions_in_sandbox_and_science/cquh194\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big thank you to HarvesteR for this information, and I hope they add it to the stock game as an option too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T02:09:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022PeterTaylor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022PeterTaylor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just found a solution on the KSP Reddit page\u003Cp\u003EThis enables Kerbal Experience in Science Mode, and if you upgrade all the buildings and unlock all the science, well then you have Kerbal Experience in Sandbox Mode too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34e4md/request_enable_missions_in_sandbox_and_science/cquh194\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34e4md/request_enable_missions_in_sandbox_and_science/cquh194\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA big thank you to HarvesteR for this information, and I hope they add it to the stock game as an option too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis did not work for me in 1.0.4.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T15:51:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the simplest way seems to be a hacked career.
