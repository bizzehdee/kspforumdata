The one thing that bugs me is my kerbals start off at level 5. Is there a way to knock them back to level 0 so they have to earn their experience as if in regular career? I\u0027m hoping it might be as simple as a cfg edit, but I\u0027m not sure where to look - or whether they would earn experience at all during Science Mode after I\u0027ve reset them to 0.\n\nCan anyone point me in the right direction?\n\nAlso, bonus question, is there a mod that tracks Kerbal experience in a more detailed way? It would be cool if there were something that showed details of every kerbal\u0027s individual mission logs and how they got to the experience they\u0027re at now.\n\nEdit~ Bonus bonus: Is there a mod or cfg edit that makes it possible to also upgrade buildings using science points instead of cash? It would be cool to not start with everything already fully upgraded - but this isn\u0027t as huge of a deal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T16:52:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pearldrumbum**"},{"CreatedByName":"Reddeyfish","CreatedById":142160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:01:35Z","Content":"you don\u0027t even need to modify .cfgs.

That looks like exactly what I was looking for. I will install it and give it a go tonight.\n\nAs for the other suggestions - I thought about doing that with regular career and just ramping up the $ and rep rewards but that just feels weird to me, although it makes sense. Plus, I\u0027d still have to do *some* contracts, even though they would be so lucrative I would only have to do them once in a while. This is the best option so far, but I don\u0027t love it.\n\nI also noticed that only the main 4 Kerbals start at level 5 in science mode, and the rest do not. I\u0027m at work so I can\u0027t test right now, but do the other kerbals that start at 0 level up in science mode as they do in career? I suppose I would be ok with not using the big 4 since I use them almost exclusively in my sandbox adventures, and it might be fun to build a space program around a bunch of unknowns that I will inevitably learn to love (especially with the final frontier mod helping me remember their exploits).\n\nAs far as cfg editing, I took a look at the persistent save file and there doesn\u0027t seem to be a way to change a kerbal\u0027s level. I see there is a log of what they have done, but no indication of their current level. Is this hard coded and not changeable?"},{"CreatedByName":"PeterTaylor","CreatedById":95596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T15:54:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I also noticed that only the main 4 Kerbals start at level 5 in science mode, and the rest do not.\n\nThe moment you enter the VAB/SPA they get all 5 stars.\n\nI would like to play Sandbox or Science while having to train my Kerbals too\n\nAny mods that allow this???"},{"CreatedByName":"PeterTaylor","CreatedById":95596,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:06:20Z","Content":"I just found a solution on the KSP Reddit page\n\nThis enables Kerbal Experience in Science Mode, and if you upgrade all the buildings and unlock all the science, well then you have Kerbal Experience in Sandbox Mode too.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34e4md/request_enable_missions_in_sandbox_and_science/cquh194](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34e4md/request_enable_missions_in_sandbox_and_science/cquh194)\n\nA big thank you to HarvesteR for this information, and I hope they add it to the stock game as an option too."},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T02:09:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I just found a solution on the KSP Reddit page\n\u003E This enables Kerbal Experience in Science Mode, and if you upgrade all the buildings and unlock all the science, well then you have Kerbal Experience in Sandbox Mode too.\n\u003E \n\u003E [https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34e4md/request_enable_missions_in_sandbox_and_science/cquh194](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34e4md/request_enable_missions_in_sandbox_and_science/cquh194)\n\u003E \n\u003E A big thank you to HarvesteR for this information, and I hope they add it to the stock game as an option too.\n\nThis did not work for me in 1.0.4."},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T15:51:14Z","Content":"Yeah, the simplest way seems to be a hacked career.
