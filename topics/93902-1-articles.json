I understand that I can EVA save data, board, and do another crew report in another biome. I completely agree that you should only be able to do one report per biome. I just think we should be able to do a report for multiple biomes without having to do a song and dance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sure it was done for a reason, so i would be interested in hearing why it was decided as its more than possible that i\u0027m missing something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again and keep it up,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGadgetmerc\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
