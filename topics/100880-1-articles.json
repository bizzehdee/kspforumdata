I can\u0027t figure out how to do this so all the fuel is used by all of the engines. Any ideas?\n\n![3Ywx1ZT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/3Ywx1ZT.jpg)\n\nWith no fuel lines, each of the side engines use the fuel in the standard fueselage, and the inline engines use the fuel going from front to back, I believe. (This is however not the case, see below)\n\nThis is not balance related, it works fine no matter the order the tanks is drained. I just can\u0027t get the oxidiser to be distributed when switching to it. The bottom engines flame out \u0022no oxidiser\u0022\n\nLet me know if I need to upload the craft file.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T21:24:34Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by glen.mack**"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T20:48:21Z","Content":"Wow, that is one absurdly complex-looking craft...

The cubic octag part can be used as a funnel(multiple fuel lines into one) or splitter (one fuel line into many).

Various parts are marked as no fuel crossfeed.\n\nBe aware that radial decouplers are *not* no crossfeed parts. Rather, special coding prevents fuel crossfeed if a fuel tank is attached to them. If some other part is attached to them fuel will flow.
