My personal advice is forget about conventional launch windows and time your departure so that you can do a retrograde burn where Moho\u0027s orbit is at it\u0027s highest altitude relative to the Sun. Burn until there is a close approach, then time warp to this close approach and complete the capture burn. Yes the transit time is longer, but it makes for a fairly simple approach, and is reasonably efficient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T07:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA lot of players think Eeloo is the hardest place to go to in KSP, because it is so far away. This is not true. Moho requires more dV, and \u003Cem\u003Evastly\u003C/em\u003E more precision. Moho is the hardest destination to reach in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why many people opt for the \u0022depart Kerbin at Moho\u0027s apoapsis\u0022 strategy. It will not get you an encounter right away, but it will put you into a solar orbit from which you can get an encounter in a second step fairly easily, and it requires around 5 km/s dV if you do it well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe classic Hohmann transfer is still possible, but you\u0027ll want to budget \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E 6 km/s dV for it. That\u0027s ~5.2 km/s one way, i.e. from low Kerbin orbit to low Moho orbit, plus a decent safety margin because the precision required is so high that on your first try you\u0027ll definitely end up needing more than you planned spending. The way back costs roughly that much again, though it\u0027s much easier to fly, so you don\u0027t need that big of a safety margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T07:59:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 07:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T09:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might find this link usefull:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T10:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome other things to bear in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoho has a significant orbital inclination with respect to Kerbin, big enough that you\u0027ll have to deal with it in some fashion. There are various strategies for this... just be aware that the simplistic \u0022do a normal/antinormal burn at the AN/DN\u0022 approach that you may be used to (e.g. en route to Minmus) is going to be an expensive burn. One approach that can work is to launch when Kerbin is located at the AN/DN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nISRU can really save your bacon by allowing you to fill up before your return journey. Just be prepared for the fact that Moho is a lot heftier than the Mun and needs considerably more dV to land and take off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"radonek","CreatedById":84077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T13:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you opt for direct transfer (inclination change method does not matter) you should also pack a decent TWR for capture burn, not some puny LV-N. Trajectory to Moho is a long fall in Kerbol gravity well, you will arrive pretty fast. Forget about having hours for lowering PE and executing breaking burn, and even if you had time, excess energy make adjustments incredibly costly. You should set up PE on route (this is gonna be fun with decay bug raging) and avoid radial/planar burns until captured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther way is to just forget about direct transfer, do transfer to circular orbit somewhat higher then Moho and transfer from there. It is obviously less efficient, but you don\u0027t have to care about TWR and use most efficient engines which offset it somewhat. Also its easier to plan gravity assist from Eve and get most of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
