My observations have concluded that the brony movement has been infected not only from the perverse elements of other fandoms, but also from small tightly-nit groups which struggle to become individualistic in their ideals.

It was all about the show back then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen again, same could be said about the \u0027furry\u0027 fandom. Back then, it was all about liking cartoon characters. Nothing wrong with that. Just a bunch of guys and gals getting together to appreciate the Sunday and Saturday morning cartoons they watched. Same thing happened with them that\\\u0027s happening now. Perverse, corrupted elements brought that movement below the pits of depravity and twisted it beyond its pure purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut....whilst organized groups of bronies, pure at heart, try their best to continue the cause...we still have elements and intentions coming in that continuously bring it down. Will it ever stop? I\\\u0027m not sure. Few people know that Equestria Daily is actually playing a big part in this depravity. I was in on that game before EQD became popular. I could tell a story now about how when I was a member of a site called Pony Fiction Archives, before its renovation and obscurity, when EQD and it were pretty much considering partnerships. Fun fact: It didn\\\u0027t work out because of what we found out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was when I first realized what the community had become thanks to EQD and other elements.

I don\\\u0027t want fame, I can\\\u0027t draw and I certaintly don\\\u0027t like the perverse elements that have come in. I\\\u0027m only interested in the show. I like it for its morals. I like it because if I ever have kids, I have a show I can show them that I know for a fact will be safe for them. I support the shows efforts, which what was originally intended by the movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*grumble* Good things die fast, I suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ascensiam\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Ascensiam\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, due to my membership of the MLP:FIM steam group, i recieve links to the SD and HD uploads almost immediately, there\\\u0027s no way to prevent me from seeing the episodes, whether i get to see them a second time is what i wonder about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis trend will continue.
