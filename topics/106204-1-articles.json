I\u0027m also a fan of the Kerbal XP system and the effect it has on the game play.\n\nNot much interested in the finial and mission elements of a full career game though.\n\nScience mode is pretty much perfect for me but has no Kerbal xp system. Anyone know of a save edit or mod that could unlock that element.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T05:56:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 05:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tewkes**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T04:11:47Z","Content":"It\u0027s a bit kludgey, but you hack the save game and give yourself a billion funds.

Just wondered if there was a more elegant solution or a simple config toggle that could be used instead."}]}
