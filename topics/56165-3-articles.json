Back when the resource system was first announced, I said the same thing; giving finite quantities to deposits, and worrying about how much gets extracted, is horribly unrealistic. The amounts involved are many, many orders of magnitude more than any one vessel could extract. (It\u0027d be like saying that if you filled up your car\u0027s tank a few dozen times you\u0027d run out of oil in Texas.) And if you really wanted resources for profit, you wouldn\u0027t go down into a gravity well in the first place; you\u0027d just mine asteroids.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, the resource system is still the single most important feature yet to be implemented in KSP. As anyone who\u0027s used the Kethane mod can attest, the ability to refuel interplanetary vessels on-site makes a tremendous difference in terms of what is possible. With it, you can now do fun missions to places like Laythe, instead of limiting yourself, and THAT is the essence of Kerbalness. So, the official resource system will be incredibly valuable once it\u0027s implemented, because people will be able to visit the outer planets (including a hopefully soon-to-be-implemented second gas giant) instead of only limiting themselves to Duna, Ike, Minmus, and Mun as possible destinations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo it\u0027s the only system I still care about them adding, because it\u0027s the only one that\u0027ll actually impact the designs I make. (Unless they get around to adding deadly re-entry or a better aerodynamics system, that is.)

In my opinion it\u0027s made all the worse because resources have been \u0022replaced\u0022 as a focus with multiplayer, and to be honest I think at it it\u0027s core, KSP just isn\u0027t a multiplayer game (apples and oranges I know, but the same reason I don\u0027t like the idea of Elder Scrolls Online, or if they ever made a multiplayer Just Cause). I just don\u0027t think it\u0027ll work. Whilst we\u0027ve all known SQUAD as the dev\u0027s that can, in nearly all instances I\u0027ve seen companies have had to sacrifice precious time that could be spent on gameplay on multiplayer, ruining what would\u0027ve been a fantastic singleplayer game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, whilst I agree that it is definitely beneficial to ease the learning curve into a game like KSP, so it can also kind of be used as an educational tool as well as a game, there is only so much you can do. Resources are endgame, at least for me, but it gives something to work to, another potential idea. Whilst KSP has definitely snowballed in popularity over the last year or so, the reason I think it stood out before is because it offered a challenge. I\u0027ve always been interested in space, (so hoping for a course in aerospace engineering at Uni) so when I saw kurtjmac playing this space game on YouTube, before the maneuver node system, before docking, it was a challenge. I saw threads of great achievements on here, I remember when Temstar took on Duna and Ike double landing with the primitive docking mods at hand. My point is, KSP is an orbital simulation game, for those who are unfamiliar to the concept, it\u0027s going to be hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that they\u0027ve been shelved, I think SQUAD may have dropped themselves in it, because that would offer something else to do on the planets we land on.

Landing somewhere to gas up is only slightly different from docking with a station or tanker.

And what do you get as an end result? You can launch vessels, which is something we already do. Again, this is cool, and opens up new mission types, but doesn\u0027t change the game as much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this sums up what Squad feels was the problem with their proposed system. It was large and complex, requiring specialized single-purpose parts and an implementation for scanning, generating, and refining various resources. And the end result for a player was just a lot more work to do things the player was already doing (albeit in a cool way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey didn\u0027t like the way it boiled down, especially when compared to the features that have yet to be implemented in the game. They could have resources (refueling, off-Kerbin construction) or they could make the entire career mode (science, economy, contracts) and multiplayer which are whole dimensions of difference in gameplay. So they\u0027re putting more into the game by switching focus. These broad strokes will eventually give way to polish, and we\u0027ll start to see improvements on planets, EVAs, aerodynamics, and such at that time further down the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also said during the Twitch broadcast (in addition to \u0022no we\u0027re not doing resources now\u0022, which most folks stop listening after hearing), that it would probably still come in some form later down the line. They just haven\u0027t figured out what form it would take or when it would become prioritized. I personally believe we\u0027ll have a stock drill and the ability to scoop Eve juice at some point!

As some of the posts I\u0027ve read have stated, it takes a good deal of experience and knowledge to run a mining operation in this game.

For example, there could be simple mining missions because Kerbin is low on a particular resource. Or mining could be used while not on a mission to boost funds for future missions.

You design it, and then find out how much it will cost to launch through various means (one large rocket, multiple modules assembled in orbit, etc. etc.). You launch it, doing nothing other than paying the cost for the fuel, rocket, and other supplies for whatever given altitude you in which you want to orbit. Now, you\u0027ve got a station with crew that needs to be ferried up and down, adding more cost. Plus food and water for them. The usual logistics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, you\u0027ll be able to launch life support modules to recycle water, and your station becomes a little less costly to supply. Then, some greenhouses to grow crops. A little less costly to supply. You could build some more stations, in higher orbits (or, rather, lift your existing station into such an orbit). Maybe some as waypoints to the Moon. Build a lunar station, to mine Helium-3 and water. Go get some near-earth asteroids for metals, or comets, also for water. Develop an entire space-based economy, bit by bit. Your initial space stations replaced with giant rotating habitats, your temporary moon bases vast mining complexes... etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this isn\u0027t what Kerbal is going to be, but I\u0027d play that game for days at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HarvesteR","CreatedById":4,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T19:53:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there is a large amount of inaccurate overlap here between what the top-end of KSP gameplay needs and what the old resources system was supposed to add.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree that once you master the challenge of spaceflight and are able to get anywhere and pretty much do anything, you start to feel there isn\u0027t much left to do. This is true of any game. However, most games at that point just end and you get to watch the credits roll by. With KSP, you are free to continue playing until you\u0027ve exhausted all possibilities, and beyond. This \u0022end-game lull\u0022 is a frequent issue with sandbox games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I disagree that resource mining-- \u003Cem\u003Eespecially \u003C/em\u003Ethe idea for resource mining that we proposed last year-- is the best solution to improve end-game activities. There are a lot of other cool things that we could add there, that would be a lot more interesting and fun, and that wouldn\u0027t require an overly complicated and honestly, very tedious system to give you new cool things to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat those things are aren\u0027t something we want to discuss yet.

However, you may notice it\u0027s even been mentioned several times here that the key thing is that people feel that once you land on another planet, there isn\u0027t much else to do. That does not imply the solution to that is to get out the shovels and start mining. Especially if you were supposed to remember to pack the shovels in the first place and didn\u0027t realize it until after touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, that old plan we had for resources is most certainly not the right solution. It doesn\u0027t fit organically with the rest of the game, it requires you to remember to attach a bunch of single-purpose parts to a vessel (forgetting any of which would render a mission a complete failure), and really, that\u0027s just not how we want the game to play out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is the crux of the issue then.
