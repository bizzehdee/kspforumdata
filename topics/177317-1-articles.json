title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E collecting experiments...\u00A0 But what I\u0027m experiencing is so goddamned weird I dunno what to make of it, and if anyone knows what\u0027s going on under the hood with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E biomes, it\u0027s you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was playing a nice modded game in 1.2, but Steam gave me a mandatory upgrade to 1.3 sometime in the spring, and I decided to take a break while the modders caught up so I wouldn\u0027t break my save.\u00A0 The modders never caught up, but I eventually decided all of them being up to date with 1.4 was good enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made the grand drive around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in my Sci Rover much earlier in my career in the 1.2 content, using MechJeb\u0027s Surface Info window configured to display what biome I am in for the purposes of pressing an action button to run all the experiments, and then have a bored Bob get out an collect the data and clean the ones that needed cleaning.\u00A0 It used to be that touching a building meant that you were \u0022in\u0022 that building\u0027s biome for the purposes of science, and as long as Bob was standing on the parked rover to get the surface sample and EVA report, so was he.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is no longer true now that I\u0027ve loaded up my save in 1.4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI long since maxxed out my science tree and am now 100% committed with patent licensing, and I\u0027m repeating the Sci Rover drive with the intention of putting all the experimental results into a rocket at the launchpad, and shooting them up to my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E Station and its Sci Lab, where they can be processed for a few thousand funds a day for a good long time.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m seeing is as follows.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMost straightforwardly, the Mk1 Monument has been renamed, and this new name is a new biome with no completed experiments.\u00A0 The island airstrip is now a unique biome with its own experimental results, but that was easy to take care of.\u00A0 There are also some Launchpad outbuilding biomes\u00A0that I don\u0027t think were there before, but they all seem to be the same biome for the purpose of gathering science.\u00A0 (Park on the Launchpad Flagpole and take a surface sample, it just says that it\u0027s the Laucnhpad in the game interface, but it counts as science separate from that which you gathered from the real Launchpad, but do the same on the Laundpad Water Tank and it\u0027s a duplicate experiment, despite MechJeb thinking it\u0027s a new biome.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost troublingly, some new biomes for each major area have appeared: \u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022, \u0022Spaceplane Hanger\u0022, \u0022Tracking Station\u0022 and \u0022Research and Development\u0022.\u00A0 These are also completely new from the standpoint of experiments.\u00A0 At first it looked like these were replacements for the Main Building biomes for each area.\u00A0 They aren\u0027t.\u00A0 When I drive up to a building in one of these areas, the surface biome flips between the \u0022grounds\u0022 biome for the area, the new biome, and the building specific biome.\u00A0 There doesn\u0027t seem to be a readily apparent logic as to which biome the craft is in based on its position relative to the building.\u00A0 You just have to scrape against the damned thing until you find yourself in the building specific biome after you park.\u00A0 (This can have fun effects if the building is a tank.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m using several mods, obviously (not including KEI), but none of them should be screwing with the biome map.\u00A0 I can give you a list if needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, if the game has changed the behavior of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E biomes, than KEI may have to change as well, since the total amount of science seems to have changed.\u00A0 If the way the game deals with building specific biomes has changed in this incomprehensible way, then KEI may get more popular going forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope all that makes some sort of sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JH4C","CreatedById":188049,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-05T02:07:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022
