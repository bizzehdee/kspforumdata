I am planning to use it while filming the video for the project arctic(google \u0022KSP project arctic\u0022 and you should be able to find our thread) as to get the highest quality video.\n\nBasically, you install the \u0022Time Control\u0022 mod, and slow down the simulation speed. Then, in post-production, you speed the film up by the same amount that you slowed it down by.\n\nThis really helps to smooth out lag spikes associated with collisions and explosion effects, and allows the film to be much more immersive.\n\nAs far as I understand, it works well with large mods such as B9, as long as KSP still launches with the RAM limit."},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:52:44Z","Content":"Agreed, Time control is a very useful mod for making videos. If you have any large ships, lots of explosions, or any other FPS dropping phenomenon, Time Control Mod is an absolute must for making a seamless video. Not only that, but it allows you to pause time and setup things for your video (like activating engines, positioning vehicles, dropping bombs, etc.)."},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T18:23:45Z","Content":"I did a lot of this in my Duna Inquiry mission! Relatively simple technique with great results.\n\ni. Love. That. Mod. SOOO much!"},{"CreatedByName":"Kvantovy","CreatedById":142861,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T07:22:38Z","Content":"It doesn\u0027t slow down the sound effects though. It can be an issue in some projects."}]}
