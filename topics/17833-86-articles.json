The problem is exacerbated when in physics time warp, both when in the atmosphere and in space. At 4x speed, the game plays out at real time speeds due to the constant lag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis problem is reproducible on my computer and happens shortly after the launch of any spacecraft and then persists once I return to the space center or enter the VAB. I even isolated this to a CPU issue by playing the game with minimum graphical load (1/8 texture resolution, 0x anti-aliasing, etc.).

RAPIERs will draw liquid fuel according to the same rules as monoprop, drawing from all tanks in a stage equally with no fuel lines necessary. Oxidizer, however, follows the traditional rocket fuel flow rules, draining tanks sequentially with fuel lines required. I suspect if fuel lines were added from the fuselage to the engine nacelles the counter would show the dV (or if the oxidizer was transferred to the nacelles manually).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for disabled jets having their Isp used, I haven\u0027t tested for that, I\u0027ll give it a try later and report back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
