You paid the reduced costs but get the full funds back. It may not seem that much at first but if you are running bigger missions the advantage gets massive. I dislike this especially on hard mode, because it is an exploit I can only avoid by not using agressive negotiations and I kinda like the concept \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Of course I know that it still costs some rep, but if you get thousands of funds back it\u0027s not that relevant anymore.

I tested it a couple of times with different budgets and vessel costs. The effect remains the same. You simply get the funds that were saved by the \u0022agressive negotiations\u0022 strategy for free if you recover on the launchpad.

It is relative to what the rocket costs and you can push that to huge numbers while the reputaion you have to pay stays the same. The payoff increases with the vessels size. Since you dont launch the vessel anyway, you can simply slap as many science labs together as you can affort and get your 6,75% or even more if you increase comitment\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that shows what I mean\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-10T17:42:59Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2014 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by prophet_01\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
