It\u0027s a big mining station with surface to low orbit transport for fuel. completely automated no need to put kerbals in danger. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s still being built and i will post more pics as the construction goes on. Here what the station will gain in the future: more storage for ore and fuel as well as a place for some kerbals to live and start to explore minimus and the rest of the system.\n\nlet me know what you guys think of it!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

But how do you manage to assemble all these components on Minmus?\n\nRCS, on minimus is so easy to have enough trust to lift things and 8 RCS ports will do the job. also, the lv 909 is capable to put the fuel storage into orbit using very little fuel (you end up with one full orange tank and 650 units of RCS) so my next step will be to build a space station around minimus to refuel my missions.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Those fins on that rocket?
