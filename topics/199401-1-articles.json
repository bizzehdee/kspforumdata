I talked about lighting since I found it to be the most important element to me, and its what I found OG KSP suffering from the most. the fact that the shaded size is pitch black is just awful. Thankfully I heard PlanetShine has little to no impact in performance, so you could use it, it makes all the differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
