A note on the matter of Rocket vs Jet engines; I am doing Rocket engines first as the principals are more straight forward, the concepts simpler, and the common use greater. Moreover, I want to get rid of all this part bloat, and engines are the last bit to contend with for Procedural Parts.

Since we were already engaged in creating a KSP-Interstellar/RealFuels integration config, and the integration won\u0027t by any means be complete without this one last fix to the engine-mass (Stockalike fixes TWR values by altering engine mass rather than engine thrust) and ISP values of the Deinonychus to match the Raptor, I would *strongly* suggest you work it in with Raptor86. I would do it myself, but once again, I don\u0027t understand how to write ModuleManager engine patches... (so as to overwrite engine mass and ISP with new values)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, it\u0027s just a matter of breaking up and organizing the configs where possible/appropriate (I understand you re-used some wildcards, but this didn\u0027t seem to be the case for *ALL* the mods fixed in the config last I looked at it), and then sending them over to NathanKell (for the main config fixing fuel tanks) and Raptor86 (for any changes to engines, including the resources consumed- we don\u0027t need to preserve the error of fixing the Meth/LOX engine resources in the base mod any more...) as appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, I\u0027ll let you know if I spot any more problems that still need to be fixed for integration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T01:24:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Dreadicon\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t appear NathanKell has done anything with the config yet (did you send it to him?), so if you haven\u0027t sent it to him yet (or even if you have) there should still be plenty of time to institute any other fixes (like more accurate Ammonia conversion- though no idea what you meant by that before, as RealFuels already has a version of Ammonia with realistic density, and the config *should* replace the Interstellar Ammonia with the RealFuel version...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn, of course, I\u0027d still like to see somebody kick a fix for the Raptor Engine over to Raptor831 in the \u0022Stockalike\u0022 engine config. \u003Cstrong\u003ENathanKell also doesn\u0027t want code for the DT-Vista or Aluminum-Hybrid engine in the base RealFuels mod any more\u003C/strong\u003E, as far as I can tell (and I agree, it really doesn\u0027t belong there), \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eso you\u0027ll need to kick those fixes from the main config to the one you send Raptor831 as well\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E (the fixes were already implemented in the old/outdated config, they just need to be preserved/ carried over)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dreadicon","CreatedById":117295,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-25T02:26:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Dreadicon\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t appear NathanKell has done anything with the config yet (did you send it to him?), so if you haven\u0027t sent it to him yet (or even if you have) there should still be plenty of time to institute any other fixes (like more accurate Ammonia conversion- though no idea what you meant by that before, as RealFuels already has a version of Ammonia with realistic density, and the config *should* replace the Interstellar Ammonia with the RealFuel version...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn, of course, I\u0027d still like to see somebody kick a fix for the Raptor Engine over to Raptor831 in the \u0022Stockalike\u0022 engine config. \u003Cstrong\u003ENathanKell also doesn\u0027t want code for the DT-Vista or Aluminum-Hybrid engine in the base RealFuels mod any more\u003C/strong\u003E, as far as I can tell (and I agree, it really doesn\u0027t belong there), \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eso you\u0027ll need to kick those fixes from the main config to the one you send Raptor831 as well\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E (the fixes were already implemented in the old/outdated config, they just need to be preserved/ carried over)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey Northstar,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a pull request to Kell like 4 days ago which was accepted next day. He just hasn\u0027t released it yet; it\u0027s all in the main RF repo as we speak. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding Vista and Hybrid, I was wondering about those. They were already removed from the repo, but I wasn\u0027t aware they needed to not make it back in. I worked up configs for them anyhow which were accepted into the RF repo along with the general config. It did seem off, but then, so does all the NTR and ElectricPropellant config changes. So I figured they were just weird edge cases. I\u0027ll see about dealing with those sooner or later if no one picks them up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding Raptor\u0027s configs, I quite honestly find engine configs tedious and irritating. No good way to automate them, or make them elegantly with current tools. Part of why I have the procedural engines on my Kerbal Mod Building Bucket-list. I\u0027ll see about the engine configs, as I said, when I get around to it. Not like I am getting paid for any of this \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy most recent obsession has been space planes, and by proxy, the Procedural Wings mod, which I am trying to build an addon for with solar panel-covered wings and wings which carry fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, i\u0027ll be frank as to why I haven\u0027t made configs for the KSPI ISRU to have full water functionality: It\u0027s a big magic \u0027I-can-do-everything\u0027 box (maybe scientifically accurate magic box, but none the less, a magic box). KSP is about design and engineering to me, so when a mod adds a simple cylinder which does 10 jobs (many of which are relatively unrelated), I consider it a poorly implemented part. Yet another idea on my WAY too long list is to fork the code from Karbonite and make a realistic ISRU alternative. But again, really long list......\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConfigs beyond RealFuels I always considered extra, and I\u0027m not sure how much faith I have in Raptor\u0027s pack going forward anyhow; it\u0027s been lagging behind RF, and other mods even more so. It still doesn\u0027t have Methane configs for tons of parts which it logically could/should, and Raptor expressed little to no interest in electric RCS configs or in integrating the Near Future configs into the pack. Speaking of, I should really write up a config for RF for those....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have played maybe 6 hours of KSP this whole week, and havent even had time to upgrade to 0.25 yet on my personal build of the game! So, I intend to enjoy myself this weekend, and maybe squeeze in some time writing code/configs and updating my personal copy of KSP xD\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
