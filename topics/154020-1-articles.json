Now, I\u0027ve recently rewatched Pitch Black (again) and noticed the parts of the big ship had\u00A0the cross section shape of a recangle (more or less; pics below).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTdlz1yh60__3VC8wAlQjk4m19MAvDUhet_GayLZ7PONUxRPBFV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTdlz1yh60__3VC8wAlQjk4m19MAvDUhet_GayLZ7PONUxRPBFV\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222796555156_77fb529411_m.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3175/2796555156_77fb529411_m.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea what\u0027s with the top picture. Probably because mobile Opera sucks. Just google \u0027pitch black big spaceship\u0027, or sth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, why I think such parts would be great to have:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Bases. They have nice walls\u00A0instead of being cylinders. that way they can stand either horizontally or vertically and still look good, and, what\u0027s most important, have walls perfect for landing gear, antennas, parachutes and all that useful jazz.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Space stations/cargo/colony vessels. They would stack together really nicely to create a square-ish cross section (one on the top, one on the bottom). That makes them perfect for compact designs that could nicely blend into shapes of other parts (ideally, two roof-to-bottom stacked modules would have more or less the same cross section size as the huge rocket tanks).\u00A0Crewed modules would have windows on each side, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy the MK3s aren\u0027t great for this kind of thing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-They have the roof and bottom half-cylindrical bits which makes them not ideal for side attachments. Attaching gear on the bottom\u00A0makes its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E high, thus messing with (sometimes) buggy landing gear/prone to leaning to one side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Simply too big to stack them side-by-side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe truss on ISS has more or less this shape, except it\u0027s not as elongated in one axis as this Pitch Black \u0027container\u0027 part. There would probably be only 4 needed: empty truss, cargo bay (\u0026lt;- these two could actually be one part with doors sliding/opening outwards creating additional floor), command/crew module\u00A0and the lab. Since KSP is meant to be \u0027near future-ish\u0027 then having more actual near-future-ish parts would be nice to have. And we need some base modules anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-26T00:15:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/26/2016 12:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbinchaser","CreatedById":160817,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T01:49:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI completely agree with you.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-26T01:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook up LackLuster Labs - continued.
