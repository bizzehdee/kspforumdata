Neither of wich would appreciate a \u0022challenge\u0022 in running out of funds and being kicked down to doing low end contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The new player- The new player either wont know about the significance of a \u0022highpoint\u0022 in their program, as far as they know what ever they do is a high point. Remember when you first got to orbit, that\u0027s a high point. They don\u0027t need a large looming contract that will shut their program down if they fail. They do that to themselves as they learn how to play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current system also caters to how they are allowed to fail. Career mode isn\u0027t suppose to be hard anyways. You can fail a bunch of times in the current mode before you really have to worry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Veteran player- The vet would know more about what a \u0022high point\u0022 in their career mode would look like, being limited on funds, high stakes high gain situation. But unlike the new player I\u0027m sure they will figure it out without much trouble.(if there is trouble with the vet, then the new player probably can\u0027t play the game which isn\u0027t a good thing) This would lead to just limited design options, and limited play options. Veteran players wouldn\u0027t exactly appreciate being stuck with limited choices to how they want to play career. What if a Veteran wants to fly to duna BEFORE going to the Mun and get away with it? There far to many chooses to be covered in a ridged system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current setup isn\u0027t perfect, but its open enough to allow a new player plenty of wiggle room. It also gives Veteran players multiple options on how they want to play the game, none of them are ultimately challenging. That is a big part of KSP as a game though, you still set goals and choose your goals for yourself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking the game more challenging in your mind might be nice, but that doesn\u0027t mean your idea of challenging would bold well with other people. The goal should be making a game that is open to as many people as possible. All the while keeping things challenging enough you look down to check your funds every now and then. Not because your going to run out, because it still costs a lot to launch a full SLS mission to Duna and you still want to make a 50 booster rocket for the lulz.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T11:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion was to essentially keep the current system, but add a \u0022program system\u0022 alongside it, so as to try and get the best of both worlds.
