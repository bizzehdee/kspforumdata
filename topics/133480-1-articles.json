It would look 100% the same, and there would be no other mem eating texture needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-04T17:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s located in the GameData folder, it\u0027s ok to reuse in the context of a mod for KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis comes up fairly often, Kasper has responded to a few of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/106444-what-are-the-rules-for-reusing-squads-art-assets/\u0022\u003EHere\u0027s my thread asking this from a while back.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-04T17:41:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2016 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
