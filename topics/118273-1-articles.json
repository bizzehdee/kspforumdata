There are no problems with the Commercial Crew program; the program is in fact running remarkably on budget and on schedule for a government program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the program is far from making its original scheduled goal of 2015, and in fact is almost guaranteed to be slipping into 2018-2019 now. However that is not due to the contractors\u0027 inability to execute, but rather NASA\u0027s inability to fund the milestones it is contractually obliged to fund. This, in turn, is because for every single year it has existed, the program has been severely underfunded. The contractors are literally required to slow down development - there are sections in the contracts that explicitly forbid completing unfunded milestones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGovernment programs often have problems. Nearly all of them run over budget and well beyond schedule, without producing results.

NASA selected two suppliers against the violent gnashing of teeth of critics who believed such a thing wasteful. And what happened? We\u0027ve had three ISS resupply vehicles from three unrelated providers (Cygnus, Progress, Dragon) fail over the course of barely 8 months, and right after Europe discontinued its ATV, too. It\u0027s an absurd series; nothing like that has happened in spaceflight in a long time. This is Murphy\u0027s Law in its most pure form right there. And yet, the ISS continues to be just fine.

That redundancy went as far as ensuring that even now that \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E CRS contractors are grounded at the same time, there were enough flights prior to the last two incidents to ensure that operations can continue under support of international partners until operations resume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s precisely why downselecting is folly.
