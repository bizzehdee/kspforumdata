Just have the function find the furthest x y z coords for the craft(dont know about this one). Having a square bounding box defined in the launchpad model will simplify the placing of the ship as the center of the ship can be placed in the center of the box (i think this is how eva hatches work) or the center bottom coords can be placed in the center bottom of the bounding box.

Not sure how other ppl feel but i just feel it takes away from the immersion feeling when the craft clips into the launchpad/platform and explodes. Ofcource even with such a sollution you can still build a craft that will crash or get stuck into the regular part collider of the orbital dock/launchpad when you manouver it out/launch it if you dont plan your craft accordingly.

But in my mind there is a difference between gameplay challenge and being challenged by an issue that requires you to work around the plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got another similar idea that perhaps would be better and easier to impliment for just the clipping. Would it be possible to get a hacked preview of the craft before loading it? (Like loading it on rails perhaps so you can see if and where it clips. And you can then chose to \u0022build\u0022 the craft or not. ie. loading physics and removing the build resources, or deleting the on rails ship from the game and not removing resources) i would point out that this will still make it really frustrating after spending a long time designing the craft in the vab only to find out that it clips. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main reason for me that the bounding box thing would be cool is that it would effectively limit the size of craft you can build from a small launch pad but allow you to build the bigger ship if you spent the extra effort to put up a bigger launchpad/drydock. So, extra challenge/reward for the player. For example the small mobile launchpad would only be able to build a 1.25m fusulage rocket with some stuff on the side (or whatever will fit on the flat platform) but to build bigger stuff youll need the huge folding one. Making the different parts more useful\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also point out that the current way ppl are probably dealing with the exploding craft issue now is just to quickload to before the ship was built and redesign. Which does exactly the same but takes away from the gamey feel. So none of the two sollutions would make things easier or punish you less for your mistake than now.

For the stock habitable parts (pods, hitch-hiker, science lab), the best production you get is 0.5 times whatever your kerbals give. Actual workshops will have factors of at least 1, possibly quite a bit more. Thus, vessel size limits come into play as time constraints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbal qualities (stupidity, courage, bad-ass) have a large effect on an individual Kerbal\u0027s productivity. The current scheme makes negative productivity Kerbals surprisingly common. I think I will have to tweak this, but I might leave it for now to get feedback from actual play-testing by you guys.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA workshop collects productivity from each Kerbal in the workshop and scales the total by a factor indicating the quality of the workshop (automation, working conditions, etc, but the factor itself is a simple scalar, the rest is up to your imagination).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMultiple workshops in the same vessel (docking supported, of course) pool their contributions together.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe pooled work is distributed amongst any active \u0022pads\u0022 in the vessel (yes, you can have multiple pads working at once).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI haven\u0027t implemented it yet, but I plan on making it so you can pause construction on pads so other pads can be prioritized.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEach pad distributes its received work over the resources required for building (currently only RocketParts). The current rate is 5 Kh/t.

I\u0027ve tried to build two ships with the Ore/Metal/Parts containers (not the hexcans, the other cylinders) and some times the parts/ships dissapear, other times they shoot out of the solar system along with some other scary errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI try to build a manned pod that is also the start of a small colony, with the various container cylinders all around it. Some times my rocket will not launch off the pad. The TWR is 1.78, yet at full thrust my rocket just sits on the pad. I tried it with a completely different booster.. and it took off fine, but the decouplers would not do their job. Some of the decouplers would throw off the empty boosters, yet one would remain attached and mess up my CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I would restart the launch.. most of the parts were gone but a few would be jumbled up, none of the numbered displays worked (HUD) and the program would lock up. Another attempt, I just had the pod itself with no massive booster and tried to use Hyperedit just to get it into orbit. My reward was everything went haywire and my manned pod was now on a fast track out of the solar system and all the parts on the ship had exploded save for the crew compartment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried again with a new ship. An unmanned but larger factory complex meant to be the centerpiece of a new base. Things went fine, but when I was in the middle of the deceleration orbit.. I remembered the landing point was in darkness. I landed a small pathfinder pod earlier, swicthed to it in the map screen and turned on the lights so I could see the ground. Switched back to the factory lander... and MOST of the parts disappeared. It still operated fine, but I could not see most of the parts to manipulate them like the landing legs, solar panels, KAS winches... etc etc etc..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese errors have not happened on any other ship, just the ones with Red/blue/white parts containers from this mod.
