With this mechanic you can control docking fully, because you don\u0027t exactly now when and where your craft will be docked. Sometimes in my cases it spawned kraken for vehicles with many parts. I understand that it was made for beginners who doesn\u0027t yet know how to dock accurately, but this will not solve the problem of their inexperience. I think that will be better to make the docking ports attracted to each other like in KSP1, and in settings you will choose attraction distance. In this case you always know, that docking ended if port touched target, and it won\u0027t look confusing for all players\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecondly, docking port parts feel wobblier than other parts and docked big\u00A0 crafts often twitch really hard. Also had bugs when docking ports overlaps each others and were destroyed after undocking. Maybe this problem will be solved with solving of wobbly problems with rocket\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvelynThe Dragon","CreatedById":227182,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-21T21:34:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are very different. And I don\u0027t like it. The sudden \u0022hey, you are docked\u0022 nonsense bugs me, especially when it does so quite forcefully. I want something that is much more realistic. so I can dock with a gentle kiss...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the undocking is rude.
