I used Zoxygene to make it more realistic, but am having second thoughts about it. I also used the Deep space mod to get an ion engine rechargeable by solar panels. Now, for the Zoxygene mod, i dont know if i want to keep it, because even though it makes it more realistic, it\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s kind of cumbersome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I used it for the orbiter. The ion engine was quite useful however, because when orbiting the moon, the ion engine is sufficient. It is especially useful when trying to change inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i859.photobucket.com/albums/ab152/luciencd/screenshot178.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot178.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen my Kerbinauts finnaly got into a slightly inclined and circular orbit about 4 km from the surface.
