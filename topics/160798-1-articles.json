Can be land, sea or air vehicles. Must be stock only, no SRBs, you must show me the speed you achieved, and the craft must survive without breaking apart. There are no weight limits, so you CAN attach a KRL-24\u002B \u0027Rhino\u0027, a Kerbodyne tank, to a Mk1 cockpit for example, and still be eligible for the competition. Also, a Kerbal must be piloting the craft, and they must survive. All craft are to be tested on Kerbin only, so other people can use the craft aswell for the same speed or fun. Basically, go nuts! Use overpowered engines, I don\u0027t care! Just try to be the fastest vehicle out there!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T02:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: Can this topic be moved to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/25-challenges-mission-ideas/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EChallenges\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0as I just realized that I put it in the wrong topic listing! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:o\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/ZNGIcon2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matuchkin","CreatedById":135127,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T15:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t exactly the most original challenge.
