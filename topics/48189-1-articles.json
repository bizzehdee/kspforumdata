I already commented on your Youtube channel about how great they are, and how I use them as reference for my KSP playings.

When you reach apoapsis, slowly thrust prograde until you get an encounter with the target after one complete orbit.

However, I believe just about anyone should be able to manage my Miranda Lesson 01 method, as it gives you several minutes of relaxed thrusting to make your rendezvous. Yes, it requires good timing, and a precise ascent profile, but I\u0027ve found it extremely easy to get a perfect intercept and rendezvous each time, for the several dozen times I flew/refined the technique. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really all comes down to what each player is comfortable with. I believe my Miranda method is a lot easier than the Phoenix version, and even if one has to retime it for their own rocket, the technique is robust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?
