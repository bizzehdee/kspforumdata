Call up the port-a-john, EVA the Kerbal inside, then switch over to the rover, drive up the ramp and pick him up. If you need more Kerbals, use a different command pod for your port-a-john.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T17:12:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can make a rover with a pod for a Kerbal on it for transfer around KSC. You can also make it with a pod, then eject the pod with some small rockets and a decoupler (make sure it\u0027s facing the right way so that it goes off with the pod and leave the Kerbal behind.

I say SPH because if you launch a vehicle with a Kerbal stood on the launch area he gets recovered/removed, you need to walk them off the launch area. For the SPH walk off the runway onto the lower ground and back to your vehicle when you launch it. For the launchpad/VAB it\u0027s a long walk off the raised ground to get far enough away not to be considered \u0022on the launchpad\u0022.
