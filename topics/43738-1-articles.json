My plan is to get to the surface, land and then decouple the port so the rover drops a bit and then drive away. That part works great but when I bring the rover back and try to dock again so I can take it to another planet, nothing happens. Have the ports lined up, I use legs to lift the rover up and make contact with the other port but from there I cant figure out what to do. There is no option to \u0022recouple\u0022, only control from here or docking camera. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T22:14:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 10:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Talonsin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T19:47:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis may sound stupid, but does the other module also have any command part and electricity?
