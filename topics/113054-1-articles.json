From what I have read prior to this post it seems that there is some issue wth Unity when it comes to Mac and how it allocates memory for 32bit stuff and I may be a victim but the specificity of my recent crash event is confusing.\n\nWhats wrong:\n\nTwofold,(1) the game is only stable for 1-3 hours before freezing up and must \u003Cforce quit=\u0022\u0022\u003E/restart.\u003C/force\u003E\n\n(2) Specific crash to desktop with error message that it unexpectedly quit when I decouple the third stage of my latest launch vehicle.\n\nConditions:\n\n-Will provide detailed grpahics settings if you would like but I have reduced the settings to run the game on effectively \u0022Medium\u0022\n\n-Building second part of station, a rather large module, situated in a cargo bay.\n\n -Parts of which stick out but I have had very successful flights with parts ghosting through fairings before\n\n-Mods include Station Science, Mechjab, Kerbal Engineer, and FASA all up to date.\n\nLOG INCLUDED\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/relvbx6vjkjb3rg/Player%20copy.log?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/relvbx6vjkjb3rg/Player%20copy.log?dl=0)\n\nPlease help!![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)"}]}
