For one thing you can try using ATM. or, what I did was run in force-openGL mode. this reduces the RAM required by the game to roughly half, with no significant reduction in quality. or do both. and lastly, run with minimal graphics options from the pack and get it to work with the smallest textures. then slowly increase the texture sizes (yes that means quitting and reopening the game every time) until you\u0027re just under crashing. Then, to be safe, go back down one texture size. although with only open GL mode enabled, not ATM, i was able to install the largest textures and run stable at full graphics settings in 32 bit. granted i don\u0027t use FAR, but i\u0027ve still got B9, firespitter, and loads of other mods\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-12T00:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell my install went without a hitch and even with the hi-res clouds the game loaded without ATM in open-gl. Granted.. I haven\u0027t really tried many scene changes yet. The lightning is nice... but.. unfortunately there are no storm clouds to compliment it. And it looks strange seeing lightning in these fine whispy clouds. So I may remove the lightning.. But there is one major concern I have. Now something may not be right, but.. the stock horizon glow is horrendous. Now I know its gone in Proot\u0027s pack because he uses the RSS config so can I use that to do something similar? Or.. is something wrong and the glow shouldn\u0027t be there? It gets really bad at noon. Like a quarter of the sky up from the horizon is just white.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther then that..
