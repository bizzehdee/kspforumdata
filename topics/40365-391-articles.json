In the real world, the US originally produced tritium in specialized heavy-water reactors (although it also never produced more than 225 kg in total ...). Later on it switched to lithium-containing control rods in a more standard fission power plant, basically equivalent to having tritium breeding enabled on one of the already-present KSPI reactors. The specialized tritium-production reactor could also be given an exemption from the power-control code that automatically throttles down reactors to the minimum necessary for the current power requirements, to ensure it would always breed at the maximum rate. The one problem is that doing this in the real world is incredibly expensive, which can\u0027t really be represented well in-game at the moment. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTypical tritium production capacity from fission reactors specially designed for tritium production is only a few kg per year, and at the prohibitive cost of about $200 million dollars per kg.\u0022 - Yikes!

No refinery needed for either of those unless you take a crapton of time with the AIRs as they hardly burn Uranium Nitride or Antimatter, and the Deut/He3 can last a long time depending on the power usage during the coasting phases. If going with straight antimatter, it would be wise to have a few collectors and swing by Jool as needed. Using even the probe sized fission reactor should cover the energy requirements for the antimatter tanks themselves and those things even upgraded will run a long while, could also bring some additional uranium fuel with you in tanks if you\u0027re paranoid about running out of fuel. Shouldn\u0027t even need more than one refueling\u0027s worth of extra fuel, so you can tweak the amount carried in the VAB. If the station includes a science lab, there\u0027s no need for a refinery to reprocess nuclear fuel either, provided you have enough Kerbals.
