Today, and as of motive of the release of KSP 1.0 (yay! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E) I finally tried surrounding a main aircraft body with this enclosures so that the craft could get the shape I wanted and also be more aerodinamic (image below showing an early X-37 concept with the technique described). Once I placed all the fuel tanks and the engine inside of them, I proceeded to launch but once I was on the runway and toggle up the engine, the game displayed a message saying: \u0022Cannot activate while stowed!\u0022. I tried to reattach the engine into an exterior part that weren\u0027t inside the fairing and then reposition it inside again with the idea in mind if that could do the trick, but again it displayed the same message. If anybody knows how to make it work I\u0027d be pretty thankful!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.D. sorry for my english.
