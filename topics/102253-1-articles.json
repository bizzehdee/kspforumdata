I don\u0027t use any seriously game altering or part adding mods, though.\n\nI very much doubt it\u0027s all stock game problems (especially the \u0022Unknown Mystery components\u0022). A quick search shows you use [a lot](http://i.imgur.com/FhcK0vt.png) of mods... At that point it might be like mixing many different medications, not even the doctors are completely sure what happens.\n\nYour best bet is assembling a thorough investigation of the problem/s at [support forums](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/7-Development-and-Support).

Add to that that i am not alone with those bugs, it\u0027s more likely that the error isn\u0027t related to 100% on my end.
