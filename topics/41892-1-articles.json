High Altitude Low Opening and High Altitude High Opening. Both give the jumper a lot of time to think about what they\u0027ll be doing after they land. LALO gives you mere seconds to launch and deploy the chute and gear before landing, but you can get a lot of flights into a short amount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight I was dinking around assembling tiny, low flying rockets and trying to land them under a parachute. First I tried a single Oscar B with an OKTO2 on top and three of those smallest radial mount engines, all topped by a drogue chute. Even though I could deploy the chute the instant the fuel was gone, it nearly always destroys some of the vehicle on touchdown.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally got a reliable assembly with these parts. Went with the larger engines to kick up a bit more altitude, nearly 1,000 meters. I may try taking out one or two of the tanks to reduce the maximum altitude. Where do the legs go? On one side of each engine! The parachute comes \u0026gt;thisclose\u0026lt; to yanking the rocket apart when it deploys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 Mark 55\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 Oscar B\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 OKTO2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Mk16\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 LT-1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould try going back to the drogue, single tank and wee little engines and adding the smallest landing legs. Those got the above collection down but sacrificed themselves in a cloud of vaporized whatever it is they\u0027re made of. I\u0027d like to be able to bring one down intact from only 500 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see what other people come up with and how low an altitude they can safely land from.
