AR had selectable options to require LOS for probe control, fixing the power cost of antenna transmissions, and allowing for piggyback transmissions from several antennas to beam Science back to Kerbin. That\u0027s almost exactly what this feature does, aside from power cost fixing, and making the Planet Kerbin into a giant antenna itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am absolutely fine with this implementation.

It would also be nice to know how much ElectricCharge it costs to transmit 1 Mit(?) as part of the description.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there is one major nitpick, loss of probe control, but that has already been brought up. I don\u0027t like the idea of my very first probe being sent to an unexplored planet turning into space junk because I don\u0027t have any tools to calculate occlusion angles. Nor do I think those tools should be necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the simple solution is to allow the player to retain flight control of a probe, \u003Cem\u003Eso long as that probe is high enough on the tech tree\u003C/em\u003E.

This would give the players the freedom to set up probes to fit their idea of how their universe works. For example, if you envision your game set in the Space Race using WW2-vintage technology, then you obviously need more hands-on control than somebody whose game is set in more modern times or even the near future, where fully autonomous vehicles either come into existence or are by then the norm.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, even today all you need to do is give general orders, such as or \u0022drive my drunken self home from this bar\u0022 and the vehicle itself will handle all the details, such as picking the best route and negotiating all obstacles and other traffic en route. And this even in big cities with scads of moving parts to avoid and multiple paths to choose from. This seems a far more complex problem to solve, with vastly more decision points and opportunities to screw up, than anything that spacecraft do. Spacecraft just need to do a handful of maneuvers and only have traffic to contend with if they seek it out intentionally. Yet we\u0027ve had cars able to do this for several years now and they will, in short time, become generally available, the deployment time mostly being sure they\u0027re safe to other traffic. In the less-congested air, at sea, and in space, these things have been deployed longer and autonomous drones are even available to the general public.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith this type of autonomy, there is only a need for very brief, sporadic intervals of communications if the mission changes and to transmit data back. Otherwise, they\u0027re fire-and-forget. In the absence of a stock autopilot, the only way to \u0022simulate\u0022 this degree of autonomy is to allow the player full control of probes at all times, whether they\u0027re in communication or not. Furthermore, computers are far more precise than human pilots anyway, so probes should never be penalized on what they can and can\u0027t do compared to Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T13:35:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am honestly very excited for this.

The data rate and power draw wasn\u0027t much of a factor, because even if you didn\u0027t have enough power to transmit quickly, physics timewarp was enough to get the data through quickly. Not to mention, I flew a lot of missions without antennas and just brought the science straight home anyway. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of adding more considerations when choosing antennas, and adding a mission planning aspect, but without going all of the way to the level of tedium and/or complexity that some of the mods introduce. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods will still exist for those who want the complexity or realism.

Between all the different game modes and sliders, there isn\u0027t any core game. I might sound oldschool about this, but I believe a game should have a core, something to point to as the standard mode of play. That doesn\u0027t mean a lack of freedom. Look at mincraft: a core survival mode with a couple options. KSP doesn\u0027t have such a thing. Take the three game options (sandbox/science/career) then and the stock difficulties (low/medium/high) and you have 9 game modes. Then say three heat options (off/medium/hard) ... that\u0027s 27. Life support on/off? Now its 54. Radio communication on/off? Now 108. Three resource levels? 216. Crew respawn? 432. Science/funds rewards ratios? ... Starting a new career means picking from literally a thousand different paths before you even see the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s no wonder that the youtubers have backed off career mode and KSP generally. It\u0027s hard to start a let\u0027s play when you cannot really point to a common standard for starting a \u0022stock\u0022 game. Too much freedom of choice becomes a burden. It really turns off new or casual players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReply to below: I think the youtubers want to connect with their audiences. They want to play the game in a way that their fans might. So they seek some sort of common game mode. The games that do well on youtube have that default (minecraft, subnautica, stranded deep, pre-career KSP etc). That\u0027s also why they shy away from mods. Note that some of the top reviewers have stayed far away from KSP. Totalbiscuit likes KSP, but how is he to honestly review the career mode?
