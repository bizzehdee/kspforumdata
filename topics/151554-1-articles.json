I tested everything, well almost everything on Kerbin. Dropping the lander and driving it away using the built in probe body worked fine so I launched and landed on a slope just short of one of Minmus\u0027 flats.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dropped the lander, but when I tried to drive it the Kraken struck and everything exploded into bits of exploding rover, lander and terrified Kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to move the rover repeatedly but every time - Boom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only way I could get around this was to use the landers \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and hop it away from the rover. I could then drive the rover fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other issue I have with this rover is that Kerbals get fired vertically out of their seats several metres every time they try to get out of the seat. I have not played KSP for some time, but don\u2019t remember that happening in previous versions any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the plus side I was able to visit Minmus\u2019 Lesser flats, Slopes, Lowlands, Midlands and Poles all in a few hours of driving which gave well over 1000 science points\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:kiss:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:kiss:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else had these problems?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-05T14:24:17Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2016 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by LunchIn10Seconds\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpellink... sigh\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T14:50:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t see the rover clearly enough in that image; Do you have any parts clipped into or around the seats?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LunchIn10Seconds","CreatedById":67073,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-05T18:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t see anything obvious, but here\u0027s the craft file just in case I\u0027ve missed something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover is attached to its lander and is dropped with the second stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/FbMLcCri\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELander with underslung rover\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope someone can help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T13:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have your craft file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I don\u0027t see the need for 3 HECS... 1 on the rover, yes... the other 2 on the engine stacks, no. I\u0027d get rid of them unless you\u0027ve got some other motive not clear to me; The lander is controlled by the Kerbals inside the Mk2 lander can. Also, you don\u0027t need the BZ-52 radial attachments on the engine stacks, the girders can attach directly, save yourself some weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, the TR-2V decoupler holding the rover; I would reduce the ejection force (I changed the force percent to \u00221\u0022), and just let the rover drop via gravity. Also, for some reason an invisible collision is occurring between the rear rover solar panels and the lander engines when you attempt to drive the rover forward ... that could be why it was blowing up on you on Minmus. Back the rover up (reverse) from beneath the lander instead of trying to drive it forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t forget to take the rover\u0027s HECS out of hibernation; You fooled me with that one. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:lol:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_laugh.png\u0022 title=\u0022:lol:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T14:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s your craft with the BZ-52 radials removed, as well as the TT-70 decouplers.
