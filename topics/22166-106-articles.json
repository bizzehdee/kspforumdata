When 0.20 came out with the GameData feature, a lot of people switched to packaging their mods where the root of the zip goes into the GameData folder. This caused a lot of confusion because many players would try to unzip the contents of the GameData subfolder into the game root. The convention Kethane uses is the same as the old one: the root of the zip merges with the game root. It has the added benefit that it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eblindingly obvious\u003C/em\u003E what you\u0027re supposed to do; it makes no sense to have a path like KSP/GameData/GameData/Kethane.

But also I use it as a desktop front end to activate and turn off mods in the case of errors, glitches, and such. I understand and agree that having each mod as a defined separate folder in GameData is good for modding. But I am just not a fan of renaming or moving folder after folder to track down a bug or error by hand. So the MM I use just takes what I place and puts it in the directory I designate in my KSP_MODS folder it creates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA mod with the directory say Kethane/GameData/Kethane/(Files) just ends up in the GameData folder using the first folder to track the name and contents/placement directory.

They were winched out of a landers cargo hold with KAS and just vanished into the ground. I thought it might be a KAS issue, but I\u0027ve found it happens the same in stock. Obviously in most cases these tanks will have legs or be part of another structure so its not a problem, but in the case of this base I was going for a messy (redneck) design with random tanks strewn around just sitting loose on the ground and connected to the base via KAS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had the same problem with the IonCross life support mod and the large oxygen and recycler parts (which are a similar size/shape to this kethane tank). But all other parts delivered have worked as expected. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this is helpful and sorry if this is a repeat of another report, but I couldn\u0027t see any mention of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OopsThatNotWork","CreatedById":45740,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T12:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022katateochi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022katateochi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi Majiir I think I\u0027ve found a slight bug/glitch with one of the kethane tanks and I can\u0027t find mention of it by searching this thread. Thought I\u0027d post this here before adding it to your issue tracker on Github incase this isn\u0027t something relevant. \u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the small KE-TL10 tank, it doesn\u0027t seem to want to sit directly on the ground. If you place it directly on the terrain (ie without legs or any other part under it) it just sinks into the ground. I\u0027ve tried several simple tests in a pure stock install with just Kethane installed, with just a probe core on top of the tank (made in the SPH) when I load it the tank will sink into the runway. If I do the same thing but replace the kethane tank with the stock fuel tank (the X-200 8) it will sit on the runway fine. The other kethane tanks are all fine, if I do the same thing with them they will sit on the runway fine, its just the small tank that will sink. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first noticed this when delivering a several tanks to a Mun base.
