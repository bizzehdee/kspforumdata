Win 10 will actually not run KSP in DX9 properly unless you add the ( -dx9) flag in the shortcut target field. And on that note.

The FS rotor has a bug where the max rpm is not persistant. You need to tweak it in flight every time. You can try bugging Roverdude and Snjo on th FS thread about that one.\n\nThe hover button on the rotors really doesn\u0027t work very well.

Use [Quantum Struts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93818-1-0-QuantumStrutsContinued-1-3-Magical-Struts-for-Rigidifying-Outside-the-VAB) from the fuselage to the engine nacels.

That rotor I sent you also has a crazy amount of SAS force applied to it. so if you need more or less SAS assistance. just tweak the steering factor in the GUI menu.\n\nI did watch your video. Looks like you have a lot of potential for YouTubing, nice job. A couple suggestions though. Try never to use the keyboard to move the camera angles around, **[KerbCam](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22781-0235-kerbcam-v013-camera-pathing-tool-for-videos/)** is outdated but still works great. It looked like you used CameraTools quite a bit, so good job there. Make sure you are always hiding the mouse curser on the right side of the screen. And make sure you aren\u0027t filming while in windowed mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Avalon304","CreatedById":68304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T21:37:37Z","Content":"Would it be possible for you so share some of youre craft files?
