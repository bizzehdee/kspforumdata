We also know that Squad has exposed these templates to modders, so I thought it would be a good idea to have a large resource of \u0022template ideas\u0022 so that when First Contract rolls out, modders would have a resource to add more to the game. I know that\u0027s the first thing I plan on investigating after release. So please post your contract template ideas here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that it is a contract \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;template\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; which means that it should have generic locations, generic people, generic everything. Use tags to refer to locations, people, or things. [PERSON] [LOCATION] [THING]. The more variables that a template has, the more fun it will be to replay. Also keep in mind that contracts should generally be self contained. What I mean by this, is that if they need to create new things in the world, keep them temporary and to a minimum. Imagine a contract where a Kerbal has to take a sample - nothing new is created in this contract. Some of the more fun contract types will spawn objects in the world \u0022We lost Jebediah Kerman again, can you go find him? Last we heard he was in this crater somewhere on the Mun.\u0022 In this, only one object is spawned procedurally, which is manageable. You can also give \u0022items\u0022 to Kerbals by adding new entries to the right click context menus on EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will begin the suggestions by stealing templates from another game that used templates for missions - Anarchy Online. Anarchy Online had five mission templates: Assassinate, Find Item, Rescue/Repair, Find Person, Recover Item. Assassinate isn\u0027t really applicable to Kerbal Space Program, however, it was used for both killing people and destroying objects, so we can still use it. Find Item and Find Person can be condensed, as can Rescue and Recover Item. Rescuing a Kerbal and recovering an item are similar. That leaves \u0022repair\u0022. In Anarchy Online a repair mission involved you bringing a special item to another object in the world and using it on that object, so we can effectively call it an \u0022Interact\u0022 mission. Alright so that leaves our template list kind of like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Destroy - Go to [LOCATION] and destroy [OBJECT]. This can involve de-orbiting a satellite that nobody wants, or actually physically blowing it up. Kerbals have no weapons, but they have a way of making things explode, so I\u0027m sure the player could figure it out. Perhaps the object could be a Kerbal gone rogue, but I\u0027m not sure how far out of canon that goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Find Item/Kerbal: [OBJECT] spawns at [LOCATION], but is not visible on the system map. The player is tasked with finding it, once within a certain distance, the mission succeeds, retrieval is not necessary. Due to how large space is, it is not recommended to spawn the object in space, it would be preferable to have it spawn on the surface of something, more preferably in a biome that the player knows. If it does spawn in space, the discovery distance should be pretty great. Perhaps load out the player with a scanner with a wide radius of some sort.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Retrieve Item/Kerbal: [OBJECT] spawns at [LOCATION]. The player may or may not be given the location. If he is given the location it pops up on the system map, if not, the mission proceeds somewhat like a find mission until it pops up. The player then has to bring the object or Kerbal back to Kerbin and successfully land it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Interact: The Kerbonauts are temporarily given [ABILITY/ITEM] which enables a new context menu entry on pretty much everything when EVAing. The Kerbonauts are told to use this ability on [OBJECT] at [LOCATION]. Alternatively, this could be a limited use item, and the player is tasked with using it on many objects trying to find the right one, or perhaps giving it to one specific kerbal instead of all of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese ideas are vague, and that is the point. They are templates, and they look like templates. In game it worked for Anarchy Online rather well, so I\u0027d like to see your ideas. The more ideas we get, the better, as modders will have a smorgasbord of contract templates to implement, and the game will get more varied and fun the more that we add. Some templates might have to give Kerbals new abilities or new ways to interact with the world, because right now they have very limited interaction with the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGet creative.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aman608","CreatedById":100178,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T16:56:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk this sound like fun \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanyway onto my idea:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERetrieve 3 Kerbals from the Minmus slopes and return them to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ereasons for 3 Kerbals: one Kerbal is way too easy early game i want the player to think about how to get 3 of them back unharmed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReasons for necessary return: well if you just go to the slopes find the kerbals and land next to them to complete the mission it just seems lazy \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei have a few suggestions for additions to the missions, here they are. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(i think that retrieval missions with kerbals should have some sort of delivery EX: Return to,Kerbin, Space station, Low/High orbit around Kerbin just something like that it dose not feel right to leave Kerbals behind)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(maybe the retrieval mission they could be given a biome to search but nothing else just to make it a tiny bit easier than having to circumnavigate Minmus 3 times to try and fine one object, also would the object be discover able from space if so that makes this a bit easier)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(another suggested mission type something like Delivery Ex: Deliver a 4 person hab module to the mun, Deliver 20 Tons of fuel to \u0022Space station\u0022 i think this would add a bit more depth in mission idea and it sounds like tons of fun )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat\u0027s all for my recommendations and ideas have a good day fellow kerbonaut \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ola","CreatedById":82138,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T16:58:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck the Mission Controller Extended mod, they have brainstormed quite a bit on the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sky_walker","CreatedById":113214,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T17:09:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a mod for literally everything.
