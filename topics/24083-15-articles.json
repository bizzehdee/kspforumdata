All my KSPing has been KME projects and screwing around with modded jet battles since 1.0, and since you released that awesome Von Braun station, I\u0027ve been getting back into \u0022Serious Stuffs,\u0022 as I\u0027ve named that save. You said you wrote up an ascent profile for the Dart on this thread, but I can\u0027t seem to find it. If you could point me to it or just give me a rundown that would be great.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhoops I totally totally missed that! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E Sorry! Let\u0027s see, slightly rewritten from an old comment so that it applies to \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rune\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rune\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDo you use some information-providing mod? If not, it\u0027ll be harder to control vertical speed with the crappy stock indicator (it\u0027s on the top, to the right of the altimeter). Basically, you climb at 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA until 10kms (make sure to use the runway to get the RAPIERs some initial bite in the air, or spend some time at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA to build speed up to 200m/s, you\u0027ll climb faster). If you feel confortable you can go higher, but all you spend by climbing shallower is a tiny bit more liquid fuel that won\u0027t drag you down when it\u0027s time to really speed up. Then you go supersonic either manually dropping the nose slowly, or by putting the autopilot on prograde and back to standard stability assist a few times to drop the nose \u003Cem\u003Egradually\u003C/em\u003E, to zero out your vertical velocity. It\u0027s tricky to go over the Mach barrier, I usually achieve it at about 5-10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA over the horizon, and going slightly down. From then on it\u0027s much easier, you start building speed quickly and the wings bite more air, so watch your vertical velocity like a hawk and every time it goes above 50-100m/s or so, you drop the nose a bit (again, on and off the prograde autopilot is a handy trick). Give yourself time to accelerate. At about 15kms, drop all vertical speed (climb rate about zero), and lock stability assist in that heading: you will speed up \u003Cem\u003Emucho mucho mucho\u003C/em\u003E, and as the planet curves below you, your AoA will slowly creep up, building vertical speed for the climb to orbit. When you notice your speed stops increasing as fast, and the RAPIERs go under 50kN thrust you can switch them to closed cycle and just ride that heading until you time to apoapsis goes over one minute or so, at which time you should lock prograde autopilot to minimize drag during the coast to circularization.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that is enough to have you flying SSTOs in 1.04 to the best effect!

The bird itself looks great, but I think the Titan it is plagued by stability problems, hence why you have so many wings. You could save a good deal of them if you make the tanks empty \u003Cem\u003Eupwards\u003C/em\u003E with fuel lines. That way CoM moves forwards instead of backwards as the rocket gets lighter, and so the rocket gets \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E stable, not less, as it speeds up. Also, a smaller upper stage (with a corresponding larger first stage) would fire later when the air is less important, so it could have much smaller wings, or none at all with a light engine, and you would also need less wings on the first stage as a result. If you do need them, tough, putting them as a skirt would work and be much more eye-pleasing And trust me on that small engine comment: it\u0027ll give you higher dV with less fuel, move CoM forwards, and inspire you to build a nice interstage section with shrouds and stuff, where you can put aerodynamics surfaces that will perform just as fine when unshrouded. Also, consider that in the pics the Titan had much bigger wings on one axis: that is because the Dynasoar creates much more lift in that axis.

People do like the new Dart, and it\u0027s released and everything. And what I like the most, a child could fly it. BUT. Playing around always brings you to more advanced stuff and well... better see for yourselves:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Zik9eQH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Zik9eQH.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat 500m/s in the tanks means that it can lift one of the Dart mission modules to pretty much any LKO. Like the Dart, you can break it in half and replace the module in literally six clicks. Loading it up with LFO and emptying the liquid fuel tanks gives about 1.7km/s, or enough for Duna shuttling, with the heaviest payload (the crew cabin). It handles \u003Cem\u003Egreat\u003C/em\u003E regarding aerodynamics. And it has a very low 0.5TWR on takeoff, which makes it very realistic in my eyes... I just like planes that actually use the wings to increase efficiency and \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to climb like planes. So yes, this, in pretty much every aspect, makes for a better Dart than the Dart in my book, since it does everything the other one did, but with half the powerplant. BUT. The climb profile becomes one of the hardest, and longest, in any of my SSTOs as a consequence. You actually have to go \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E at 10,500m in order to break Mach at 9,500m or so, then go back up. And then only if you climb at a shallow 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA AoA so you build enough speed to reach high enough to drop. Short of like the Crys, but you don\u0027t have the nuke to give you a boost over the transonic barrier so you have to inch your way through it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here comes the question, to all you guys that short of follow my designs: in my signature bird, what should I do?
