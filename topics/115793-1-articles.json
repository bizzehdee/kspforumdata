Therefore, a formula for period does not exist. It has to be numerically evaluated for a particular trajectory. That said, once you have the trajectory, it\u0027s a trivial thing to compute. Given the DoF, if you know positions of all 3 bodies, you know their velocities from relevant conservation laws.\n\nI also wouldn\u0027t jump to conclusions about stability, unless article specifically states that they have found this configuration to be stable.\n\nP.S. Actually, if I was solving this, I\u0027d make period fixed, and let it expand/contract during optimization. So it\u0027d be a way of computing distances from masses and period instead. But the point stands, there isn\u0027t a formula. It\u0027s a numerical problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-14T02:38:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/14/2015 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by K^2**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T07:44:24Z","Content":"I\u0027ve managed to mod this using kopernicus (I have obtained the shape of the orbit).\n\nNow I can tweak distance/mass/period to suit whatever ratio I want.\n\nI don\u0027t need the numbers to be 100% accurate, I just need them to be not clearly wrong.\n\nI know the moment I release this people will go\n\n![frabz-ACTUALLY-9f1b65.jpg](http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i59/2/8/3/frabz-ACTUALLY-9f1b65.jpg)\n\n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nIs there some simulator I could use?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T11:49:37Z","Content":"A lot of sites that talk about this kind of orbits say that\n\nThey use carlos simo\u0027s data.\n\nBut noone puts a reference to which data they are talking about"},{"CreatedByName":"Weywot8","CreatedById":146603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:33:22Z","Content":"\u003E Is there some simulator I could use?\n\nThere\u0027d only be a handful of people around the forum really qualified go \u0022Actually...\u0022 that like this guy [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68502-WIP-Principia-N-Body-Gravitation-and-Better-Integrators-for-Kerbal-Space-Program](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68502-WIP-Principia-N-Body-Gravitation-and-Better-Integrators-for-Kerbal-Space-Program).

Data is locked in the file located here [http://www.maia.ub.es/dsg/3body](http://www.maia.ub.es/dsg/3body) , assumed you\u0027ve found it. However, scaling (heavier bodies, trying for longer orbital periods) would be computational as well because there isn\u0027t an underlying formula unlike Kepler\u0027s Law. The figure 8 is actually more stable than Laplace\u0027s equilateral triangle orbit. Also more robust cause m1=m2=m3 is not a strict requirement (orbit changes from ideal though). So less accurate numerical methods can be used and \u0022actually...\u0022 KSP isn\u0027t \u0022real\u0022 either.\n\nMy two pence worth of help would be directions to Section 5 of this website: [http://www.artcompsci.org/msa/web/vol_1/v1_web/node6.html](http://www.artcompsci.org/msa/web/vol_1/v1_web/node6.html) and bumping across [http://www.control.aau.dk/~jan/undervisning/MechanicsI/mechsys/chapter8](http://www.control.aau.dk/~jan/undervisning/MechanicsI/mechsys/chapter8) which is very followable.\n\nHope it helps and leave the other 350 3-body orbits alone:sticktongue:"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T15:53:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E leave the other 350 3-body orbits alone:sticktongue:\n\nSorry, I can\u0027t promise anything ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nJokes aside ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n it looks like it would be a lot of effort.
