Having played the demo on my Win10 VM on a macbook, I bought the full version from Squad. It insisted on two address lines, even though I only have one, but I got there in the end. But, ugh! The Win10 versions crashed my VM - even after I\u0027d given the VM more memory and graphics memory. Didn\u0027t matter if it was 32 bit or 64 bit. Couldn\u0027t get the Mac version working at all ... until finally I realised that I only needed to move the KSP.APP out and back again. Then, hurrah!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all Kerballed up, and my big achievement of the day, just as night was falling over the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, was to make it into space ... and back in one piece!
