More-over, most Gen 5 fighters can\u0026#39;t compete with proper Gen 4 or 4.5 aerobatic/dogfighting capabilities, to my knowledge. The fighters really don\u0026#39;t have to look like an F-16, but it is a good standard for capabilities.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo far, my best fighter\u0026#39;s basic design is based on an aerodynamics experiment to test a prior glitch in FAR, which was roughly based on the F-16. However, it only really looks like one in passing and is much more like an F-20, I guess. That makes it a poor example, really; however, my old MRF-4 is still capable of achieving the applicable goals for qualification and looks nothing like an F-16.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m happy to say that the Devil Ray is still viable with the engine swap, albeit slightly less aerodynamic with a wave drag area of about .4 now. It appears to have slightly better control capabilities, which is to be expected (still not the best dogfighter), but it is able to supercruise at roughly mach 2.01 when full. I\u0026#39;ve been letting the plane fly on its own for the past half hour while I do other things, and it\u0026#39;s range seems quite impressive. It seems to cap at about mach 2.88 with afterburners at high altitude, but have not tested its low altitude max speed.
