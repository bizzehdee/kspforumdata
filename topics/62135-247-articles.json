There is nothing to trim down within those packs, and in fact each of the phases by themselves dont actually use that many textures. And some of the phases (mainly the shuttles) share a few textures.

Everyone is well aware that mod makers do not get paid and share their mods out of the kindness of their hearts. A lot of time and effort has been spent to create this mod. That being said it is unanimous that something needs to be done about the size of these wonderful parts. I can only speak for myself but I have a Mac. I have been playing ksp for 3 years and on these forums for nearly two. Each subsequent release has reduced the breathing room in my gamedata folder everytime. Having a Mac my computer automatically runs OpenGL but the gains are immediately lost but the Mac memory leaks that squad has failed to address in each subsequent release. There are also people who standard pcs and laptops who love mods like this and just can\u0027t use them because they game freezes, fps drops, and game crashes. That\u0027s with the textures looking like crap and anti aliasing turned off and aggressive ATM making the game look grainy. To me there is an aesthetic I won\u0027t sacrifice and that might be to my own fault but I don\u0027t see the point of making beautful parts look like crap and the game look like crap just to use parts. That all being said a switch to DDS textures has proven very effective in trimming down fat mods and making them playable again. I needed to be very selective about the mods I put into my gamedata folder now that FASA has DDS textures I can start putting more mods in my gamedata folder. I think people who say \u0022it works fine for me\u0022 are being unproductive. Especially if they neglect to mention theyight have a Frankenstein gaming computer or just simply a computer that isn\u0027t a stock PC.

I am simple person who just wants to play KSP. I am knowledgable enough to put mods in the game and thats it. I am not doubting there are ways complicated or simple to make everything work. I was simply trying to say that there are quite a few players on here who are unwilling and incapable of trying the methods that you described. I have seen it far too often on these forums, a person says \u0022hey my game is crashing\u0022 or \u0022this doesn\u0027t work for me\u0022, or \u0022this mod is just too big for my memory needs\u0022, then someone undoubtedly will say, \u0022it works just fine for me I don\u0027t know why its not working for you.\u0022 So your solution might seem simple however to some people it might seem daunting and unhelpful because its a solution that might seem unrealistic. Yes I know that sounds lazy, and \u0022if you don\u0027t want to try and get it to work by using a simple......\u0022 yea I get it. Im sorry if I sound or am sounding like a indignant child.

The makers have said numerous times that ATM is a requirement. If a texture compression mod is required, why not just compress the textures and save people alot of space and memory? Again I am fully aware that they dont have to listen to me. I feel I have emphasized this plenty of times. I know they don\u0027t have to do it.
