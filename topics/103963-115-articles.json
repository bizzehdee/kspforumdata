I was using the Transparent Pod option of RPM, and it was causing that massive lag when warping. Once I turned it off, there is no difference in performance when warping vs no warping.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-24T14:08:01Z\u0022 title=\u002212/24/2015 02:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ziw**"},{"CreatedByName":"pingopete","CreatedById":74168,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T15:00:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/12/2015 at 9:37 AM, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Added variables to control the exposure and extinction for the edges of the atmosphere separately (also fixes the atmosphere \u0022barrier\u0022 effect)\n\u003E \n\nI read this.. am exited.

First one is definetely with Scatterer-related problems.\n\u003E \n\nIt seems there is a slight blurriness but I don\u0027t really see how scatterer can be causing that. Can you try scatterer without other mods?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, Winterdavid said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Made an account to post this, because I was struggling with same issue, and I can see others were too,\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I tried everything one by one, deleting the compiled oceanback shader and sphereocean shader etc, tried opengl and dx11 forcing and so on.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Setting renderqueue in scatterer gui to above 2520 fixed it, but renderqueue reset every scene change so...\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  there is a fix, but I\u0027m not sure how good of a fix it is, or what else it might break, open the EVE GUI by pressing ALT\u002B0 ( zero ) \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E edit existing config or make new one for cloud manager section\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Last option in the list scrolled to the bottom is shadowfactor default at 0.75, change it to 0.01, the shadows on the ocean disappear, save that config.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Its removed this particular bug, I havnt played any further, but it seems logical that now the clouds cast no shadows at all, which might not be what you want.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E use at your own risk??\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 24/12/2015 at 0:58 PM, Val said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The EVE Shadows work in v0.0215 as far as I can tell.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Replacing the EmptyShader.shader in v0.02182 with the version from v0.0215 did have a small effect, but did not fix it.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I do see some small artefacts with v0.0215\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - There\u0027s a thin line where the shadows aren\u0027t applied.\n\u003E - Black dots with -force-d3d11, that are not there with -force-opengl.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E All of the above is with default configs for everything.\n\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 23/12/2015 at 0:20 AM, \\*MajorTom\\* said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E water bugs in version  0.0218 (...215,216) , but I dont have any of it then I use 0.021c (version is totaly ok)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E my video mods- texture replacer (latest), EVE (105-4), windows shine, planet shine, distant object\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E (hardware-videocard Radeon r9290)\n\u003E \n\nTry going into the EmptyShader.shader file, find the two lines that say Tags, and add \u0022IgnoreProjector\u0022=\u0022True\u0022 after \u0022QUEUE\u0022=\u0022Transparent\u0022, it should look like this:\n\n Tags { \u0022QUEUE\u0022=\u0022Transparent\u0022 \u0022IgnoreProjector\u0022=\u0022True\u0022}  \n\n Pass {  \n\n  Tags { \u0022QUEUE\u0022=\u0022Transparent\u0022 \u0022IgnoreProjector\u0022=\u0022True\u0022}\n\nThis should remove the clouds on the ocean but they will still work on everything else\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 39 minutes ago, Rodger said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Well I\u0027m using KSPRC now instead of SVE, and this time I\u0027m not getting the weird black sky at the KSC, but now I\u0027m getting this weird halo thing in space/map views  \n\u003E   \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/J0esGWb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/J0esGWb.jpg)\n\u003E \n\nI actually thought I fixed this a few versions ago.
