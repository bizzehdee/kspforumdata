So I was wondering if anyone out there could explain all the values and parameters that can be in a part file (I know that\u0027s a heavy request.) For instance, what is ignitionThreshold? and why is it that some parts list breakingForce, but others do not? Are they unbreakable?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T11:46:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EConfig files are setting the variables of objects in game, the variables in the main section set those of the module = XXXX object (typically Part these days) and any in MODULE{ } blocks set those of the object whose class is named in the name = XXXX field of that block.
