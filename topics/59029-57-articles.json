We spent a lot of money on it and the development is pretty much finished, but it\u0027s purpose is to put very heavy things into very low orbits...

Also I really like the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn Chaka, the J2-X is used for MTV construction but also the EMLV II vehicle to bridge the performance gap between Ares I and a delta IV single core. By adding 8 GEMs and using the J2-X in place if the RL-10 on the delta 5 meter cryogenic upper, you get proper low orbit performance for the Orion system without the overkill of 3 cores or the danger and money waste of Ares I.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESEP presents certain gameplay challenges.
