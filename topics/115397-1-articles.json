I have a \u0022game\u0022 copy of KSP with like 30 mods, including Real Solar System, Realism Overhaul and the mod version of Real Progression 0, which is supposed to add carrer-friendliness to RSS\u002BRo\n3. I have a \u0022work\u0022 copy of KSP with all the same mods except for the version of RP-0, which is the version i got from github  \n\n    - When i launch the game, RP-0 is not loaded. So if i modify something in the mod files it will not appear in the game. What should I do ?\n\nThen i installed \u0022 git \u0022 but i dont know how to use it. What is a \u0022repository\u0022 ? What means \u0022commit\u0022 ? How do i tell git to look into my RP-0 work folder to track the changes ?\n\nSo yeah, generaly speaking, where do i start ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif)\n\nIf anyone could share his modding knowledge with me, that would be much appreciated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kermunist","CreatedById":63745,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T16:15:34Z","Content":"RP-0 is a complex mod, and it builds upon and requires several other mods to work. It may not be the best place to start.\n\nMods consist of several different bits. Generally:\n\n1) *Parts*. You can create a new engine or fuel tank without any real programming, you just draw it in special software, write a config file for it and drop it into the appropriate folder.\n\n2) *Plugins*. These are changes or additions to the KSP program itself, and are written in a programming language. Since SQUAD use a language called c# to write KSP, most plugins are also written in c#.\n\nRP-0 contains both parts and plugins.\n\nWhen writing a plugin (or indeed any program) you start with *source code*, which is desired to make sense to a human then a special program called a *compiler* translates your source code to a *binary*, which makes sense to a computer. When writing a mod or any not-tiny project, you end up making many changes to the source code. When you have many people working on the project, they all make changes. To keep track of all the changes, many people use a tool called *source control*. *Git* is an example of source control. A *repository* contains all the source code for a particular project. A *commit* is when you add your changes to the source code in a particular repository.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-08T16:19:55Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2015 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kermunist**\n  \ntypos"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T16:18:50Z","Content":"Don\u0027t even think of attempting to repair or resurrect an existing mod without considerable experience in programming.

[Have a look at the RP-0 to-do list](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/issues/154). I feel there are several things i can do there, like \u0022 *Move parts as appropriate for the new tree*. \u0022 or \u0022 *Add some basic ContractConfigurator contracts* \u0022 and *\u0022* *Update our tree changes for the new CTT \u0022**.* As I understand it, this is basicaly move things around and find a good balance.\n\nTo test my changes i think i\u0027ll need to compile the mod. How do you recommend i do that ?"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T16:54:29Z","Content":"For what you are talking about you don\u0027t need to compile the mod, you will use the existing mod and leave the programming to the programmers. What it sounds like you want to be is a scripter, which is slightly easier because you don\u0027t need to know all the programming constructs (programmers are usually capable of both). You need [Notepad\u002B\u002B](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and you need to gain an understanding of the scripts used to define a part and possibly ModuleManager depending on the mod.\n\nParts have a \\*.cfg file which is basically a text file formatted in a special way. Consider the following part (which is stock):\n\n    PART{    name = noseCone    module = Part    author = C. Jenkins    mesh = model.mu    scale = 1.0    rescaleFactor = 1    node_stack_bottom01 = 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0    TechRequired = stability    entryCost = 2000    cost = 240    category = Aero    subcategory = 0    title = Aerodynamic Nose Cone    manufacturer = Goliath National Products    description = Aerodynamic, lightweight and mostly non-explosive. As a reminder to all personnel operating nearby, this part is really sharp and it\u0027d probably hurt if you fell on it.    attachRules = 1,0,1,1,0    stackSymmetry = 2    mass = 0.03    dragModelType = default    maximum_drag = 0.1    minimum_drag = 0.1    angularDrag = 0.5    crashTolerance = 10    maxTemp = 2400 // = 3400    emissiveConstant = 0.7    thermalMassModifier = 6.0    fuelCrossFeed = False    bulkheadProfiles = size1}\n\nYou can see this is a very specific formatting. A part is defined by the PART keyword and it\u0027s attributes are listed between the brackets. Most of these are fairly self explanatory, for example TechRequired defines the tech tree node. I chose this particular part because of maxTemp. Notice the \u0022//\u0022 That is a comment, everything after that is ignored. You can leave messages to yourself or in this case the author wanted to remember what the value was before he changed it. Start poking around in the GameData\\Squad\\Parts folder and you will quickly start to figure out the majority of the stuff here. You can always ask more specific question in the mod forums.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nOh and as for Github, well that is a beast and a half starting from scratch but basically what you will do is create a \u0022fork\u0022 of the repository. This is your local copy of the project. You can then make changes to the files (for scripting, you can really just copy your changes out of Notepad\u002B\u002B and use the web interface edit the file directly, you can use Git to push it without a web interface but it\u0027s almost a language all of it\u0027s own and may prove difficult to learn right away). Once you are satisfied with the changes you need to create a \u0022Pull Request\u0022 which tells the person in charge of the project you want to merge your changes into his/hers. He can then evaluate your changes and decide to accept or reject them and leave comments for you if changes need to be made."},{"CreatedByName":"xiombargdei","CreatedById":125757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T17:07:27Z","Content":"thanks ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) i\u0027ll get into scripting and hopefuly \u0022put my brick on the wall\u0022 !"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T03:22:42Z","Content":"The [Mod Development Links Compilation](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/94638-Mod-Development-Links-Compilation-START-HERE) thread contains a good list of references and resources to help get you started.\n\nI strongly suggest that, rather than jump into the deep end of the pool and getting involved in contributing to an add-on as complex as RP-0, you should probably familarize yourself with the part modelling process by learning to make a simple fuel tank - it might not sound like much, but in the process of making it you\u0027ll learn how to make models, collision meshes, UV unwrapping, texturing, configuration/exporting through Unity and KSP PartTools and CFG writing."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhyunix","CreatedById":59383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T19:43:48Z","Content":"After glancing over what\u0027s been said, I still couldn\u0027t gather whether you we\u0027re making plugins or mods or other, so I tell you what I know: If you want to start somewhere, start by making a part work in the game- start small, a fuel tank, structure, non-animated radar dish.
