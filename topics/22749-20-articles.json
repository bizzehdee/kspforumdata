It actually had the same mass, with 4 crew members inside, a toilet and an airlock. It would have been even more cramped and simply not practical. The reason for the size of the descent stage was mainly because it used cryogenic propellants instead of hypergolics, and because the Altair had to do the LOI burn due to the Orion being already overweight for Ares I (In Apollo, the SM did the LOI burn, which allowed for a smaller LM descent stage). The whole thing was 10 meters tall and would have required that the astronauts climb up and down a 6 meter ladder for each EVA, which is the height of a 2-storey house. This made transporting equipment and cargo problematic and the risk of slipping and falling was non-negligeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a bad compromise, which was kind of the hallmark of Constellation program, so it\u0027s probably best that it was cancelled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ACES lander (in my 3rd pic) was based on a proposal from ULA to scrap the Ares/Constellation rockets and to go to the Moon on EELVs. The plan involved multiple launches, an orbital fuel depot infrastructure, and reusable landers. It was based on the ACES upperstage for Delta IVH and Atlas V, which would have variants to make it a DTAL lander, an Orion service module, or a fuel depot. Landing horizontally allowed them to put the crew cabin (or a possible cargo module) near the ground, and the ascent module used side-mounted engines, so it wouldn\u0027t damage the ACES tank which could be recycled. It landed on wheels, so they could have hauled them around and docked several of them together to build a base and even retrofitted empty tanks into a hab modules.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-29T09:26:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/29/2013 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frandsen","CreatedById":66291,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T09:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve build Mir in space 4 or 5 times, but lost them in the patching process. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time arround ive tryed a preasembled version with some test stuff attached...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6347372/2013-05-28_00010s.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222013-05-28_00010s.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETho i gotta admit its way more fun to launch every part up and attach them manualy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T10:18:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere did you get the DC from?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"b0bby","CreatedById":57886,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T11:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei have an issue with the Mir docking ports from the bobcat\u0027s soviet pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eme and one other player reported it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30591-20-Compatible-and-Incompatible-incomplete-mods-list-fixes-%285-27-2013%29?p=402819\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post402819\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30591-20-Compatible-and-Incompatible-incomplete-mods-list-fixes-%285-27-2013%29?p=402819\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post402819\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoes anyone know about it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HGGundamReviews","CreatedById":57099,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T11:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022b0bby\u0022 data-cite=\u0022b0bby\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ei have an issue with the Mir docking ports from the bobcat\u0027s soviet pack.\u003Cp\u003Eme and one other player reported it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30591-20-Compatible-and-Incompatible-incomplete-mods-list-fixes-%285-27-2013%29?p=402819\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post402819\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30591-20-Compatible-and-Incompatible-incomplete-mods-list-fixes-%285-27-2013%29?p=402819\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post402819\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edoes anyone know about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I noticed was in the preassembled craft files for each part of Mir, the Mir probes were on the outside of the docking ports making them inoperable.
