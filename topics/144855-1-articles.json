When I install the mods in the KSP/GameData/Squad the mods won\u0027t work. I think its do to the mod developer\u0027s having the programs to look for the files in the\u00A0KSP/GameData not in KSP/GameData/Squad. I have tried to move the game files from the Squad\u00A0folder to the GameData folder then delete the empty squad folder. So make clear all the game files are in KSP/GameData When I try to run the game parts are lock or\u00A0missing, Kebals in the bottom right corner, and a lot more problems. I really hope someone could help me out on this I have been getting off working coming home trying to get this working for the past two days and would like to play KSP\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
