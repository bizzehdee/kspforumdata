The KSP I know is about stacking a bunch of parts onto a long tube, maybe radially adding some more tubes, and finally putting things on the tubes.

Maximum control complexity arises when i right klick on some part to make it do stuff or activate an action group.\n\nCome on, you need to have an utter lack of imagination/experience if you can\u0027t think about ways to realize that with a controller.

Especially using a cursor isn\u0027t something fitting for controlers. In KSPs case, i\u0027d imagine construction could be better done by directly moving a piece centered in the middle of the screen after selecting a part.
