Or just go phhhhht. Whatever. The point is, I just built me a Delta-V calculator thingy so, whilst sitting at work and thinking about KSP, I can instead actually do something constructive like test out different rocket configurations to see if they would escape Kerbin and achieve orbit, then get to and return from Pol, etc etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought that others may want to have this capability too, so I share with you my webpage. It is not entirely complete, the one remaining detail is to calculate the possible destinations you can reach with the rocket you describe, but it is close to that point.
