An infinite universe does not conflict with the concept of the big bang, however, as an infinite universe that was infinitely shrunk down to infinite density, could still be infinitely sized, simply less infinitely. Infinite universe does not mean things like infinite resources, as it has been pointed out that as you travel through time, the universe will expand and there is a finite limit thusly set on how much can be encountered, even travelling at c.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn infinite universe also does not mean every single possibility has to exist. Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy uses such a concept to claim that the existence of a planet of living mattresses is reasonable, and rather than manufacturing they\u0027re simply grown in farms and culled. This, however, ignores that at most, an infinite universe can only contain possible things - a living mattress is not one of them. Similarly, while some identical clone of earth infinitely far away in this infinite universe would be possible, spontaneously becoming a whale would not be. While particles can tunnel to arbitrary configurations, they use their energy to do so, and the particles in your body and around you would not contain enough energy to reach that configuration. A whale might occasionally form inside a star for a few very bizarre instants, but an infinite universe with infinite possibilities, does not mean ALL things are possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo describe similar numerically, consider the infinite decimal 0.101100111000..., that continually increases the number of digits in each section. This number is infinite, and contains infinite variations on data, yet it never contains a 2, and it contains \u0022101\u0022 only once. Infinity does not necessitate encompassing all - that concept falls to numbers being transcendental, which we have yet to prove any number is, but we believe pi may be such. Pi is one of very few infinite decimals truly believed to contain all possible combinations - including, theoretically, its own digit sequence within itself. But because it\u0027s infinite, it can be an infinite length before beginning that, and so even though that suggests pi is a repeating decimal, it is not a decimal that can be repeated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfinities are weird, and based on that small sample of pi\u0027s weirdness, it\u0027s very unlikely that anything that physically exists, including an infinite universe, or even an infinite multiverse of infinite universes, could be transcendental on any level.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T20:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022andrewas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022andrewas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo. Whether or not the universe is infinite in space, we know its finite in time, so there\u0027s a finite volume of spacetime within our past light cone and only events within that cone can affect us.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how I observe it to be so too.
