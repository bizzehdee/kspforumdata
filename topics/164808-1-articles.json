majority of people here - the advice of a doctor, who has no criminal or bad intent should be listened to, and therefore, does not have too much power. His/her advice is valuable and sometimes necessary in certain occupations, especially high risk ones like a pilot or astronaut. It would seriously suck if every one in a tin can became sick enough to not fulfill their roles, which are kinda important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
