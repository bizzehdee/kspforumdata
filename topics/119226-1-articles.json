Yes, plugins and parts usually no longer can be used in the new version. However, plugins can be modified or simply be used as an example how to achieve something. Most parts which don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t use plugins can be made functional again by modifying the cfg files. The same applies to some parts which do use a plugin. A good example is the WEKA shuttle created by Lunniy Korabl. I\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ve been using it ever since it was created.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI therefor plea to create some sort of a repository for old mods. It\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s certain some mods stored there won\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t be usable ever again but some will. Every mod put there might inspire users to create another mod and the sources certainly will be helpfull in the development of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T09:14:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC there were some people who ripped and saved the whole spaceport prior to its death, but that was frowned upon for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T10:07:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022 data-cite=\u0022r4pt0r\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...but that was frowned upon for some reason.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat reason being the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecopyright infringement\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E of all the modders work that was, \u003Cem\u003Eand still is\u003C/em\u003E, all rights reserved or otherwise non-redistributable, which is why Squad didn\u0027t close the unmaintainable mess that was just a skin to wordpress commonly known as \u0022Spaceport\u0022 straight away, allowing players to continue to access addons while the modders who had an interest in preserving and supporting their work could upload it elsewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully the other addon repositories \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E respect the modders and their choices, and do not intentionally host the works of others without consent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso as many modders have shown there is a path to keep old addons alive, if the creator can be contacted and permission given, a new modder can take up the work and continue it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T19:26:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat reason being the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecopyright infringement\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E of all the modders work that was, \u003Cem\u003Eand still is\u003C/em\u003E, all rights reserved or otherwise non-redistributable, which is why Squad didn\u0027t close the unmaintainable mess that was just a skin to wordpress commonly known as \u0022Spaceport\u0022 straight away, allowing players to continue to access addons while the modders who had an interest in preserving and supporting their work could upload it elsewhere.\u003Cp\u003EThankfully the other addon repositories \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E respect the modders and their choices, and do not intentionally host the works of others without consent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso as many modders have shown there is a path to keep old addons alive, if the creator can be contacted and permission given, a new modder can take up the work and continue it\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E I second this.\n"}]}
