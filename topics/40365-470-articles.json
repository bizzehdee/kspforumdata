With the increasing T/ vs Isp options, the ability to carry both sets around without duplicating parts would be sweet.

In any case, whether Fractal thinks that is a good idea or not, can someone direct me in modding some open-source part to work for that purpose for personal use?

For now it seems like Fractal is working on new parts/fixing and developing resources and menus. My recommendation is to play on Sandbox for now, if you want to build anything too far outside of stock.
