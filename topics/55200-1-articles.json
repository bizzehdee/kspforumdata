The OP doesn\u0027t describe their full flight profile, so we don\u0027t know where they were before starting descent (apoapsis, in particular). Unless you\u0027ve got an extremely robust craft with massive provision of parachutes, it\u0027s essential to start the descent from a low orbit (that\u0027s BOTH periapsis and apoapsis low). If your apoapsis is high, or you\u0027re trying to descend directly from the aerocapture inbound from Kerbol orbit (i.e. before you have actually established a circular orbit), you are carrying LOTS of velocity into the descent and parachutes. It doesn\u0027t matter that the planet has aerobraking, that velocity is a problem on a planet like Duna with a low, thin atmosphere. So, use the aerobraking to first reduce your apoapsis down to a nice low level (50-100km, lower is better if your ship is marginal on parachutes or power), before starting the actual descent to the surface. The higher your apoapsis before descent, the greater your velocity during the descent, and the more difficult it becomes to successfully land by any method.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, trigger all chutes right at the start of your descent, before you even enter the atmosphere. They will deploy from triggered as soon as the pressure rises to a minimum level, then the partially deployed or streaming state provides additional drag (i.e. extra braking). Of course, doing it like that does make a precision landing extremely hard. For precision on chutes, you either need a massive over provision of chutes, allowing very late deployment, or very careful timing of the start of your descent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-05T07:39:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2013 07:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Murph\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Etypo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-05T09:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you want it to be as vertical as possible then you mean steep, not shallow.
