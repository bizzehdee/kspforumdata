So instead of giving us just an SAS nosecone to counter the bad SAS of QBE and Stayputnik, as well as other probe cores without all the SAS node focusing, give us an inline one so we dont have to end our craft right there! Another good use for this is to give SAS to command pods without pilots in, instead of us having to use a probe core, and I\u0027m pretty sure almost everybody would find this useful. Because ATM the only way to get full SAS on the .650m probe cores is to place the nose cone on and then clip a part over it, or offset it into the part. So, Squad, please, somewhen, add an inline SAS module. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nothingSpecial","CreatedById":118683,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T12:11:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut there are already three inline SAS units.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T15:34:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022nothingSpecial\u0022 data-cite=\u0022nothingSpecial\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut there are already three inline SAS units.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three reaction wheels, yes, but reaction wheels do not provide SAS, they are used by SAS that is provided by something else.
