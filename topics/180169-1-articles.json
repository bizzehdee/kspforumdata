All the wings in stock and even B9 procedural ones are heavy, this picture below is my example. The ubiquitous Mk1 command pod for scale, this wing is a mere 5 square meters (7.5ft x 7.5ft), but weighs 100kg (220lbs)! I\u0027d like to use something you\u0027d find on a crop duster. These would be nice for just screwing around. I can see why the other wings are so heavy, but I don\u0027t need these to *re-enter from orbit*. I\u0027d expect them to break down at about 150\u00A0m/s or when stresses became too great (pulling a hard turn in a heavy plane, or maybe even just trying to take off in something very heavy), and not be usable as actual structural elements (like not be able to attach stuff to them, like a lot of science experiments). The wings below are basically 20kg/m^2, or 40 pounds a square yard, the wings I\u0027m thinking of would be about 5kg/m^2, maybe less if that would be realistic.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/a1z4Mgw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/a1z4Mgw\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-29T17:23:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost of these adjustments can be done with a ModuleManager patch, for example:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n$PART[wingConnector]\n{\n\t@name = wingConnectorLight\n\t@mass = 0.02\n\t@title = Wing Connector Type A (Light)\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are not familiar with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E syntax, let\u0027s go through these lines:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n$PART[wingConnector]\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will \u003Cspan\u003Ecopy ($\u003C/span\u003E) the PART with the internal name \u0027wingConnector\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n@name = wingConnectorLight\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will EDIT (@) the internal \u0027name\u0027 of your part to \u0027wingConnectorLight\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n@mass = 0.02\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will EDIT (@) the \u0027mass\u0027 of the part to \u00270.02\u0027 (tons]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n@title = Wing Connector Type A (Light)\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will EDIT (@) the ingame displayed name of your part to \u0027Wing Connector A (Light)\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can go through the stock config files (located in \u0027KSP_install_directory/GameData/Squad/Parts/...\u0027) and look for values you want to edit.
