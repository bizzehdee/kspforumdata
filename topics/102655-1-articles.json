I\u0027ve recently entered the [Elcano Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/113778-The-Elcano-Challenge-Ground-based-circumnavigation), which involves circumnavigating a body by land and sea (if applicable) only. I chose to enter this challenge on **Kerbin** and will be using a vehicle I designed for the race.\n\nMy plan is to head westward from KSC, and stick as close as possible to the equator. While this vehicle is amphibious, it uses significantly more fuel on water than land, so I will be choosing routes with the least amount of water as possible.\n\nIt runs off of Liquid Fuel, and when it runs out, I send a jet to re-fuel it.\n\nI\u0027ve decided that my quicksave/quickload rules are thus:\n\n- Come to a full stop and quicksave every 20 minutes, or\n\n- Quicksave after repairing a tire.\n\n- If the vehicle is too damaged to continue, revert to last quicksave.\n\nI\u0027ll be updating this thread as I go along.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E TAC Life Support\n\u003E \n\u003E USI Kolonization\n\u003E \n\u003E Extraplanetary Launchpads (EL)\n\u003E \n\u003E Infernal Robotics\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Engineer\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Alarm Clock\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal Attachment System\n\u003E \n\u003E TweakScale (used heavily in design of vehicle)\n\u003E \n\u003E Hullcam VDS (for selfies and on-board views)\n\u003E \n\u003E *-and possibly a few others I\u0027ve forgotten-*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n**Total Stats (start to finish)**\n\n- Broken Tires: 34\n\n- Quickloads: 30\n\n- Refuels: 22\n\n- Naps: 9\n\n--------\n\n**Prelude**\n\n\u003E [**Javascript is disabled.

From there, you should see some buttons. The one you want is at the bottom (I believe) and says something like \u0022Make a new window/box/something\u0022. You click on that and it brings up a dialog box where you choose which stats will be shown, and you can choose to have it in a box (like the regular KER window) or in HUD-style, like you\u0027ve seen on my sceenies.\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Why not build a seaplane?\n\nBecause the intent it to travel it by land and sea. By air is too simple... much easier to attain and maintain higher speeds, less issue with water, etc. etc.\n\nIf you mean why didn\u0027t I build one for Jeb to refuel Landin with, well, Jeb REALLY wanted to try landing that VTOL in the water, and now that he\u0027s done it successfully, I don\u0027t think I can get him into a different vehicle!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Because the challenge is to circumnavigate a planet or moon by land or sea.
