PM/IRC me, as I would like to hear more on that.\u003Cp\u003EI would like to suggest separate polar and equatorial maps.

Inclination actually depends on the size body. For Kerbin right now I have 87.52deg inclination and a orbit @186km for real time mapping and 340ish (still nailing this one down) for time warp scanning. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere as the Muns ideal inclination is around 84deg inclination. These are based on the current build kethane scanners. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind these numbers are still a bit off...I did the best I could...Im a metal worker, not an aerospace engineer lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to figuring the best inclination for any given body it all comes down to how many unique places the ground path of said satellite passes over the equator, as the planet rotates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all stuff I started learning (and still learning) after I first found kethane, and asked my uncle about it...he has been working for Shell for over 20 years doing just this thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirkut","CreatedById":57229,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T16:44:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomeone did all the hard work already on what orbits are best for mapping the planets.
