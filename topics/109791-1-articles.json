Well, actually I know how the system itself works. I am rather interested in how do you setup a mining factory. How do you interconnect the parts?

BE SURE that when using the Claw, the Claw is on the vehicle you\u0027re controlling. DO NOT drive a vehicle into a Claw on the other vehicle as this might destroy the universe. Seriously. Also, you might find this process a bit inelegant. A cool alternative is to use KAS to connect the 2 vehicles together with pipes installed by Kerbals on EVA. However, this can also be a bit glitchy at times so there\u0027s really no perfect solution (not even docking ports).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn interesting feature of all resource gathering/using systems (stock or mod) is that the vehicle with the drills and/or refinery parts doens\u0027t need much tankage of its own, provided it\u0027s connected to the ultimate recipient ship (which does have lots of tankage) while the drills and/or refinery are operating. All the drill/reefer unit needs is minimal tankage of each type involved. So say you have a combined drill/reefer rover. It just needs the smallest tanks. You start the drill and ore starts filling the small ore tank. Once you get a little in there, start the reefer and product will start filling the small tanks for that. Once you get a little product available, start pumping it into the final recipient ship which is already docked/clawed/KAS\u0027d to the drill/reefer. The whole process then runs on the \u0022Just In Time\u0022 principle (assuming you have adequate power), so no need for large tanks of product inventory at the base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can be quite useful for minimizing part count at the base, and as well as minimizing what you need to launch out there to make the base. If you have a good deposit on reasonably flat ground that can be used as a landing area, then your entire refueling base can be reduced to a single rover with the drills, reefer, small tanks, and power. Just land your ship somewhere in that area, drive the rover up next to it and connect, then start drilling and refining and pumping. If the deposit is in hilly terrain, your base can be just drills, reefer, and minimal tankage, and you then need a big fuel tank rover to move from the base to the landed ship in the closest flat area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise, a few general points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u0027s really not worth the time, trouble, or money to set up a refueling mining system in the Kerbin system, unless you just want the practice. It\u0027s always easier and cheaper to just send up fuel from Kerbin as needed. The whole idea of refueling only becomes worth it at other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. It\u0027s more efficient to move product than it is to move Ore, due to the empty weight of the Ore tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When planning a refueling system, think about what you\u0027ll be using it for. Often, you\u0027ll need 2 separate fuel systems. For example, at Duna, you\u0027ll need a mine on Ike to refuel the space-going stuff that never touches the ground. And if you plan on using a lot of fuel on Duna itself, you\u0027ll need a separate system there. Same at Laythe. Mine Vall to keep your spaceships full and Laythe itself for flying around there and also for getting your crews back into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bogeyman","CreatedById":136919,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGeschosskopf, (and the rest before you), great explanations, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome numbers: with a three-star engineer, and on the best deposit I could find (11% on Minmus) five drills cannot quite provide enough ore to keep the converter running at 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink big. The ISRU stuff works in timewarp (as long as you watch the vessel), so you whatever effort you put in, you get as much fuel out as you can carry.
