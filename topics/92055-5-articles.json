SAS is not being removed, they\u0027re simply adding functionality on top of it. Having a Pilot Class Kerbal will give you access to controls like Mechjeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S. -- you click a button and the pilot rotates the craft to prograde and hold there, for example. High level probes will also be able to do this. Lower level probes and Pilots will still be able to hold a heading, like the current SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I see it, this finally makes the 3 kerbal pod useful.

It used to be that you had reaction wheels (SAS) and heading hold (ASAS) as separate parts. So if you wanted to have control, you needed to add an ASAS, otherwise it was manual flying (read: spin stabilization). The ASAS was pretty heavy, 800 kg, so you\u0027d typically have it on launchers and maybe landers, but not on the ascent stage, for both dV reasons and size. ASAS functionality was added to the pods in .21 when the SAS was rewritten, so not even that long ago.

SAS is not being removed, they\u0027re simply adding functionality on top of it. Having a Pilot Class Kerbal will give you access to controls like Mechjeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S. -- you click a button and the pilot rotates the craft to prograde and hold there, for example. High level probes will also be able to do this. Lower level probes and Pilots will still be able to hold a heading, like the current SAS.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYup, I\u0027ve been reading devnotes as well. At first it sounded like this, but in the discussed stream Maxmaps states there will be no SAS without a pilot or some \u0022high-tier\u0022 unmanned core.
