But what will it cost (including shipping)?\n\nFor example; I love the maker shop T-shirt ([http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117780-Coming-Soon-Kerbal-Plushies](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117780-Coming-Soon-Kerbal-Plushies)) and $25.00 is an acceptable price. Until you see what they will charge you for shipping one to The Netherlands: $36.25. That shirt will cost me a total of $61.25. NO WAY I am going to pay that kind of money for ANY T-shirt!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T18:18:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 06:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tex\\_NL**\n  \nTypo"},{"CreatedByName":"Tay_T","CreatedById":67173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:15:39Z","Content":"Third... ed? You know what I mean. I\u0027m not super-into merchandise for anything but who could deny a Jebediah lanyard? I mean, it\u0027s Jeb. I don\u0027t think you have to know about KSP to enjoy a smiling face like that."},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T17:52:21Z","Content":"I was thinking exactly the same thing earlier today. Though for me to want to wear it at work instead of the \u0027standard issue\u0027 I would want something fairly subtle with more emphasis on the logo than a big smiley Jeb every few centimetres.
