A ton of updates meant that my old designs didn\u0027t work any more and all the new parts and features felt a bit overwhelming. It suddenly felt the game was much harder, and my new designs would break or fail to get into orbit. I stopped playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently I started to mess about it it again and thought I\u0027d put some stuff into orbit. Then realised I\u0027d never docked anything before, even though that feature had been in for a while. So a new design was built, and managed to rendezvous for only the second time (the first being the picture above I posted way back in Apr 2012) and docked for the very first time. That lead to me wanting to put some sort of space station up there. New design, rendezvous and second docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I present my very simple (and probably laughably unimpressive) SKYLAB!
