When someone is \u003Cem\u003Eaccused\u003C/em\u003E of a crime, he may be taken in, but that is not any proof of guilt. Even if the \u003Cem\u003Eevidence\u003C/em\u003E is against him, as long as there is no \u003Cem\u003Eproof\u003C/em\u003E, the accused is to be seen as innocent. Various political groups are constantly trying to undermine these principles (no, I\\\u0027m no conspiracy theorist, but I see with concern how stating things like \u0027these forums are not a democracy, you have no rights here\u0027 has a subversive effect in line with that process).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E view that basic rights, such as the principle of innocence, or freedom of speech for that matter, must be valid here, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone thinks of that as off-topic, I think this is exactly the right place and time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you have doubts about something, either confront the person openly XOR in private mail, XOR report it to the mods, but then stick to the way you have chosen; unless of course there is no progression. Keep it in the open, XOR keep it in private mail, XOR let the moderators deal with it. But don\\\u0027t go around announcing your deeds as if you had rescued the world. Especially if nothing has been proven, and all your evidence are a comment and a debatable representation of a number, and all your proof is that the thread has been hidden from view. I myself have (hand-)written comments \u003Cem\u003Estrikingly similar\u003C/em\u003E to this when I started the first iteration of my plugin, simply to remind me where to look for the stuff I\\\u0027d need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:24px;\u0022\u003EEDIT: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etaken out uncalled-for accusation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf he\\\u0027s also a U.S. citizen, then yes, he has those rights in court. (That said, I think you misinterpret the burden of proof. It seems the only proof you would accept is footage of him actively performing decompilation. In practice, courts are much more accepting of evidence, because the court is said to do the proving.)

I have serious doubts that you\\\u0027d choose to represent 0.7 as 0.699999988079071 knowing full well that the computer will use the same value for both anyway.
