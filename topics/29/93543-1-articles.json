And for them to make minor changes to the the cfg files of the parts which persist after mods are updated. Tweaks like changing the fuel type of an engine. Or adding mechjeb/science containers to command pods. Again for their own personal use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, since people mostly recognize parts visually I\u0027d like to be able to produce icons for each part to make it easy for them to recognize what they\u0027re looking at. I understand that the .mu file that squad uses is their own proprietary format and they asked us not to decompile it, so I don\u0027t want to take that route.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut is there another way?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xEvilReeperx","CreatedById":75857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T18:08:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf a plugin is an option, you could create a snapshot of the part icons and use those\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T21:48:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etaniwha wrote a blender plugin to import/export mu.
