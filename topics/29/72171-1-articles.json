The difference to the HUD from Steam Gauges is that it shows you where you are actually going in your current field of view.

Anybody have an idea how to do that? At the very least i need the vector from the center of the SOI to the camera position in the SOI frame. No idea how to get that either. (The KSP stuff intermixed with the Unity stuff is such a horrible jungle. Very hard to get though).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T11:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENevermind i think i figured it out.
