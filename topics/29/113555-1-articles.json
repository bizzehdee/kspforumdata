E.g. If their API functions aren\u0027t documented. Or if the call they use in the KSP API isn\u0027t documented.\n\n- The mod\u0027s dev thread? Nobody can say RTFM if there is no manual or if the question is to clarify the manual. (Because even good documenters are only human.) But then you\u0027re spamming their thread with your noobishness.\n- Your own mod\u0027s dev thread? Do you like to pretend that you know everything in your dev thread? But how do you get people who know the answer to actually read it?\n- Private message? But then nobody else can see the answer. And if there are 2\u002B devs, they can\u0027t see each others\u0027 replies.\n- A new thread in the Plugin Dev Help and Support forum?"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T01:05:16Z","Content":"As someone who has a mod with an external interface, if you were trying to use it and had questions I would be okay with either a post in my mods thread as the question is about my mod\u0027s interface, or a PM would work also.\n\nThe other options run the risk of me missing your question and so not answering as I don\u0027t see it.\n\nIf it\u0027s a quirk about KSP itself, that is worth a new thread in the Plug In dev forum in my opinion. You can also use the Help a Fellow Developer thread, but if you do go to advanced options and give your post a title so people can use the search function to find it later. (I have several conversations at this point buried dozens of pages back in the Help a Fellow Developer thread that I wish I had saved that I now can\u0027t find....)\n\nHope that helps out,\n\nD."}]}
