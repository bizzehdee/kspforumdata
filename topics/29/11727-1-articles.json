The things I need to know are, how do I call up the sun\\\u0027s position and distance relative to say, the command pod, the orientation of the command pod in relation to the sun, and how do I make a part thrust?"},{"CreatedByName":"Twinky827","CreatedById":17455,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T23:18:16Z","Content":"I have an idea!

Among developments foreseen in PowerTech, IIRC there is the possibility to orient your spacecraft towards the sun (Kerbol).\n\nMaraz"},{"CreatedByName":"cdrakep","CreatedById":26780,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T15:33:06Z","Content":"Thanks, I\\\u0027ve been reading the power tech code and some engine plugin code to get an idea of how it should be done.
