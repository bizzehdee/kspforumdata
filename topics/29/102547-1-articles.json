But as it looks completely stupid, if the docked spacecraft is attached in the air\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E (or vacuum)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E, docking mustn\u0027t be possible when the parachute isn\u0027t packed. Is there an easy way to accomplish this?\n\nAnd I want a passive counter docking port, so they aren\u0027t androgynous.\n\nIs this possible and, if yes, how?\n\nPlease be patient, I\u0027ve never really modded before (apart from a small [SRB](http://imgur.com/AbKsnZw))."},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T04:43:57Z","Content":"You\u0027ll need to code. Its about as hard as making a partmodule that deactivates the docking module if the parachute isnt stowed."}]}
