How do I find the transform of a given part. Is it part.partTransform.position, part.partTransform.localPosition, part.transform.position, part.transform.localPosition, or what?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How do I convert that into screen space? Does the function above work, or do I have to do additional operations?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
