There\u0027s a lot of discussions about balance one way or the other so I wanted to find some interesting data points to balance around for my own game. One interesting point, to me at least, was that some players feel there is little motivation to go interplanetary; that\u0027s where the idea of this data point came from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m wondering, has this been done? Is there a map of sbv values out there somewhere?
