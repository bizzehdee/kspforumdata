Originaly it returned the fraction of 1 atmosphere, now after KSP 1.0,\n\nFlightGlobals.getStaticPressure(vessel.transform.position) return the presure in KPascal / m2. that means it is a factor of 100 higher!! I used this getStaticPressure on several places, they they though though I was in an atmosphere of 100000 KiloNewton, causing all kind of extreme effects.\n\nAnyway, you have been warned.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T05:47:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 05:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:35:25Z","Content":"Slight correction, pressure is measured in Kilo-Pascal or Kilo-Newton / m^2 (pressure is force per unit area) not Kilo-Newtons\n\n1atm == 101.3kPa\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T22:02:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 10:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:52:28Z","Content":"There is an inbuilt converter also in case this changes in the future.\n\nFlightGlobals.getStaticPressure \\* PhysicsGlobals.kPaToAtmosphere will return the current pressure in Atm instead of kPa.
