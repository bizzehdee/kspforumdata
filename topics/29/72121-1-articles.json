For example, say I wanted to make the ship\u0027s pitch to change by -1 degree for every 10 m/s of velocity it had, how would I go about doing that? I have no modding experience, or even coding that much for that matter, but where would be a good point to start in trying to do something like this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-05T14:14:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, it is possible to change pitch on a formula like this. However, it is also rather complex to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest hurdle is going to be how to move the vessel.
