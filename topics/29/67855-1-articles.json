I honestly don\u0027t think so because KSP has a huge modding community and protecting certain aspects of the game will be like putting restrictions to the community. But I think this could be a possibility among others that how a basic modification cannot be made as before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, I now think this thread belogns here, because probably it will be another way to modify the text on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T15:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect this is something awkward like the order in which things are being called. E.g. if 0.23 drew the navball text first and then called the mod but 0.23.5 calls the mod first and then draws the navball, then this would explain the issue you are having.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying this is what is happening but it sounds likely to me. If so, then perhaps there is another method you could put your drawing code in that still gets called after the navball has been drawn...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lttito","CreatedById":49289,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T23:02:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyeah, could be the cause.
