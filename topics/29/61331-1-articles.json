Your mod has to be \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECLI .dll\u003C/a\u003E.

There might be limitations, for example i don\u0027t think MonoDevelop\u002BUnityScript allows adding \u003Ca href=\u0022http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288454%28v=vs.71%29.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eattributes\u003C/a\u003E, that are kinda-required for lots of stuff in KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note does CLI also allow \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mono-project.com/Interop_with_Native_Libraries\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInterop with native libraries\u003C/a\u003E. In other words could you write most of your Mod in good old unmanaged c/c\u002B\u002B as long as you provide a managed wrapper and while sacrificing the cross-platform advantage of the CLI. Especially interesting for messing around with stuff d3d9, but most likely reasonable for anything else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC# is most likely the preferred way to go, since it is heavily influenced by both C\u002B\u002B \u0026amp; Java, is widely used (especially for KSP mods) and you cannot fully avoid getting familiar with that managed environment to some degree anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
