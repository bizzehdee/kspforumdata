Here is the config part causing issues:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003ENODE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = topNode \n \t\ttransform = topNode \n \t\tsize = 1 \n \t\tmethod = FIXED_JOINT \n \t} \nNODE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = bottomNode \n \t\ttransform = bottomNode \n \t\tsize = 1 \n \t\tmethod = FIXED_JOINT \n \t} \nNODE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ExpansionNode1 \n \t\ttransform = ExpansionNode1 \n \t\tsize = 0 \n \t\tmethod = FIXED_JOINT \n \t} \nNODE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ExpansionNode2 \n \t\ttransform = ExpansionNode2 \n \t\tsize = 0 \n \t\tmethod = FIXED_JOINT \n \t} \nNODE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ExpansionNode3 \n \t\ttransform = ExpansionNode3 \n \t\tsize = 0 \n \t\tmethod = FIXED_JOINT \n \t}\t \nNODE \n \t{ \n \t\tname = ExpansionNode4 \n \t\ttransform = ExpansionNode4 \n \t\tsize = 0 \n \t\tmethod = FIXED_JOINT \n \t} \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow topNode and bottomNode appear as expected, however if the Expansion Nodes aren\u0027t commented out then the part will not compile (I have repeated this over and over reading the Output log so many times!). I have\u00A0re-imported the model from blender several times, changed the parents of the\u00A0offending transforms in both blender and Unity a few times also.\u00A0None of these rectify the issue\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe confusing bit is that this external part is almost a duplicate of another I have already made (carbon copy of the NODOE config file above, except there are only 3 expansion nodes) and the ExpansionNodes on that part work properly and don\u0027t throw compilation errors.
