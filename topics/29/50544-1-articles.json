I\u0027m adding Cameras and objects, and don\u0027t want to accidentally render the GUI in the middle of my scene. Is there a nice list of all the layers that KSP is using for various objects? Right now I\u0027m using 28 and 31, but one of them seems to be used for trajectory paths.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
