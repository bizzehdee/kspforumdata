These include cryogenic boiloff before launch. Once you get used to seeing it, all other parts look quite boring. Now the question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made some particle effects and exported them with the Parttools script. Now I would like to somehow instantiate or spawn these particle effects from a partmodule plugin. The partmodule plugin would be loaded into the configs of the stock parts with modulemanager.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is that I can\u0027t find a way to load the particle effect from the partmodule code.
