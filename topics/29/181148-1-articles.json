For example, tabulating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s of engines or maybe masses of fuel tanks, or science values of experiments, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow does everyone collect this information? I do so by manually searching through config files or inspecting tooltips in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. Is there a better way to do this? For example by typing some commands in the in game debug window or maybe some helper method that I can run in ModuleManager.dll? Can I maybe run a tiny executable to run ModuleManager.dll in the game folder and then write out a csv containing the values that I need?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Actually what I am looking for is probably a way to parse the module manager cache. All the information that I want is probably in there but I would need it to be more easily queryable via linq in memory or csv/excel or something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-05T10:28:26Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2019 10:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by canisin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
