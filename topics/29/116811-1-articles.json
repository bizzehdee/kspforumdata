Most likely, however, is that they have their own stuff in a resource of some sort, possibly a string database... or whatever they\u0027re called. It\u0027s been a while since I\u0027ve messed with resource files.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T15:53:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 03:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas**"}]}
