It seems that gameObject has a particleSystem property of type ParticleSystem \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 sounds good and there are \u003Ca href=\u0022http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/graphs/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUnity tutorials on how to make it work with that\u003C/a\u003E. However, this property is null. So AddComponent won\u0027t work because it already exists and instantiating it doesn\u0027t work because it\u0027s read-only.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course this might not be the best approach altogether, maybe there is a better solution to tackle this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[KSPAddon( KSPAddon.Startup.Flight, false )]\u003Cbr\u003Epublic class CanIHazParticles : MonoBehaviour {\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E    // Step 1: create mod dummy\u003Cbr\u003E    // Step 2: ???\u003Cbr\u003E    // Step 3: sup3r fLy p4rt!cleZ\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis question may come from my lack of knowledge of the Unity engine so please forgive me if the answer is rather easy.

The effects seem to come from the (binary) file KSP_Data/ressources.assets, so I\u0027m assuming this is where I\u0027ll have to actually use Unity. Before I get started with that, is it really the case that I can just create the effect in there and export a custom assets file or are there limitations with KSP?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-16T04:26:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could just make your own particle system directly via Unity (I know it\u0027s possible since Majiir does it--check out the recently released particle mod of his).
