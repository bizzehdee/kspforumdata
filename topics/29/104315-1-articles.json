I emailed the support group for this feature, in reality, for them, it should be much easier than what people think, after all, for nodes they are keeping them in sort of list and then check each of them for seeing if the nodes should magnet to eachother. with little change in the way we define the nodes in config files now, it should be fairly simple for them to select what nodes to show and check and add toggle buttons, i was hoping that there was an easy way right now, but if it needs coding, well, i would do it if there was enough info on the ksp api ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nHere is what i sent them : if we change the config file\u0027s structure like this :\n\nNODE \n\n{\n\n DEFAULT\n\n {\n\n stack\\_1 = x,y,z,upX,upY,upX,size\n\n stack\\_2 = x,y,z,upX,upY,upX,size\n\n }\n\n blah\n\n {\n\n stack\\_3 = x,y,z,upX,upY,upX,size\n\n stack\\_4 = x,y,z,upX,upY,upX,size\n\n .\n\n .\n\n .\n\n }\n\n blah2\n\n {\n\n stack\\_a\\* = x,y,z,upX,upY,upX,size\n\n stack\\_b\\* = x,y,z,upX,upY,upX,size\n\n .\n\n .\n\n .\n\n }\n\n}\n\nThe DEFAULT group would be those nodes that will always be active, other than that the parser would create toggle buttons for each name we gave to the groups (here they are blah and blah2). after that, when they are checking the nodes in the back end, they can see if the flag for the group is true or not and only show and activate the nodes when the flag is true. As i said, for devs on the back end it should be fairly simple, but for mod community it should be as close as hacking the code for it ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n\\* : a and b are the numbers being continued from above list, or each group could have it\u0027s own index from scratch (0 base)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-17T16:32:05Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2015 04:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jiraiyah**"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-17T16:29:42Z","Content":"There\u0027s community made docs [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30401-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30401-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API)"}]}
