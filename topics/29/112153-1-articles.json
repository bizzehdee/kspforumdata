Been spending the last few days developing a mod that use Naquadah technology ( Stargate ) to increase the efficiency of liquid fuel engines. In order to keep the addon from being OP though I need to limit the number of Naquadah generators you can have on each vessel to one, or at least make sure no more than one generator will function at the same time.\n\nMy Naquadah generators are mostly the stock Fuel Cells modified to convert my own custom resource Naquadah into refined Naquadah used in conjunction with Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer within the engine to provide thrust. Thing is, the generators produce as much refined Naquadah as the engine consume, but I want to limit the number of engines able to operate to 1 ( by limiting the amount of refined naquadah that can be produced )\n\nIs something like this even possible? Could anyone point me in the right direction for how to approach this if so? Would be much appreciated."},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T11:12:01Z","Content":"Use the singleton pattern to limit usage to 1"},{"CreatedByName":"Detectable","CreatedById":145767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T11:21:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Use the singleton pattern to limit usage to 1\n\nThat does not mean anything to me unfortunately."},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T13:23:55Z","Content":"Singleton pattern will not work, that method would result in one generator working across all loaded vessels within physics range.\n\nRather, in your \u0022Generator Start\u0022 method, add code to turn off all other generators on the vessel so that only the generator last told to start by the player runs.\n\n    //inside your Generator Start codeforeach(Part p in this.vessel.Parts) //cycle through all parts on the vessel{if(p != this.part) //only stop the generator if it is not the generator currently being started{foreach(NaquadahPartModule nPM in p.Modules.OfType()) //find the Naquadah generator part module{//insert code to stop the generator here}}}\n\nHope that helps,\n\nD."},{"CreatedByName":"Detectable","CreatedById":145767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T15:27:06Z","Content":"That is in fact very helpful.
