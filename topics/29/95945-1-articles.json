A Cloning Vessel Mod, it came to me on the mid of a Sat deployment mission to Eeloo that coincidentally went through a Jool flyby and I wondered how much delta-v would I save if I do a gravity assist on Jool vs continuing my trip to Eeloo, and how longer would the gravity assist one take to reach its destination. For this mission I had to take a new vessel and rendezvous with the other one with hyperedit (i only use it for this kind of testing purposes) i also had to adjust how much fuel the original so vessels are identical. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDescription:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindow with options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClone at {time input} lead time...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Optional) New Vessel Name: {input}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003E[Clone vessel Button] \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EUses:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003ETry different routes and compare.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EPossible to launch only one vessel that you would have to send to different destinations (saving time in the launching repetition) like RemoteTech Sats or ScanSats. some may find this cheating but it is left up to you how to use it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EMisc:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003ECloning a vessel on career mode should charge in money the cost of the vessel at launch obviously. or maybe even decide if enable or disable in career mode.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003EHope theres anyone interested.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003ESorry if in the wrong section\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-07T19:49:24Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2015 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by frango9000\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eformat/spellcheck\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xty","CreatedById":94977,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T21:00:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI highly doubt anyone will make this.
