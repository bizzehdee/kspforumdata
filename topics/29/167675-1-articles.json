I have already designed the part but it currently does nothing. I just need the code to make it control other ships. The procedure should be something like this: i lanch a plane next to the runway. I get a kerbal to go on EVA near the plane. The kerbal gets the remote control and using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E. I press shift while still with the kerbal. I have control of the plane while on EVA. So thats how kt should go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
