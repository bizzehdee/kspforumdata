A common way to specify a coordinate is using latitude and longitude. Vessel exposes both of those values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a bunch of ways to work with those values. CelestialBody has a number of methods that take lat, long \u0026amp; altitude as input, e.g. to surface positions relative to the planet or relative to KSPs current reference frame (thats what GetWorldPos3D should give your). You could even do stuff manually... if you don\u0027t mind \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_distance#Spherical-surface_formulae\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe math involved\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Trueborn","CreatedById":65830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T16:46:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKind of curious why you would want easting and northing instead of lat/lon. But as Faark said, you can easily get Lat/Lon from a vessel, and then determine the distance to that point from whatever reference you\u0027re using. As easting/northing is a relative coordinate system instead of an absolute one, you would need to define reference points to base those measurements on. I suppose you could just use N0 E0, but that would get you to some really big values. Otherwise, you would have to define your own grid like the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EUTM grid\u003C/a\u003E. Then you can find the distances using a couple of methods. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is my favorite page covering a lot of lat/lon distances. You could either find the great circle distance between your reference and given location, and then use the heading and do some simple trig to get the base and height of the triangle, or you could just run that formula twice using the corner points (ref lat, ref lon) to (point lat, ref lon) and (ref lat, ref lon) to (ref lat, point lon) to get the eastings and northings directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
