For tanks this is possible which have both a top and bottom node, but for parts that only have one mode, it become impossible. \n\nDoes anyone have a clue how to fix the Part note problems?\n\nEdit: I notice that all squad parts now use .dds files, could this have something to do with it? When I tried the Old Squad Mods, I had the exact same problem!!!\n\nEdit: Something has fundamentally changed in the graphics, something which not that obvious\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T05:24:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 05:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:54:11Z","Content":"In the few minutes I\u0027ve spent messing with 1.0 so far, I realised they seem to have tightened up the stack orientation rules.
