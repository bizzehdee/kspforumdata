It does not impact NODE nodes. This is problematic because MODEL.scale does not impact anything which does not use a transform such as node_ definitions and old style FX definitions, creating a dynamic where if you use MODEL you need to be very careful with rescaleFactor, and if you use NODE, rescaleFactor Must be 1. Additionally, as of 0.25, NODE definitions Could Not define a part\u0027s SrfAttach node, suffice to say that the stock game was simply negligent in this regard. I\u0027ve not inspected the more recent releases but I see no reason to believe this has been fixed. I have previously made a plugin which corrects this situation, you can find it on KerbalStuff as SrFix, but I am not currently in a situation to update it. I do find it doubtful that it needs to be fixed, a recompile is likely all that is required at worst, and it has a very open license.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falco1010","CreatedById":133508,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T12:19:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the answers !\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
