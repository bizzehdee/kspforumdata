The plugin-making documentation is still nowhere to be found, but I\\\u0027m seeing so much stuff being done that I\\\u0027ll probably cave and try to start coding something without it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to ask you some questions to get started; right now, I don\\\u0027t really know how hard some of my ideas are, even with better documentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENumber 1:\u003C/strong\u003E Is there a way to completely hijack the flight controls? I want to make some \u0027filters\u0027 for the commands, that would really need to take player input and transform it instead of adding their contribution in parallel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETwo:\u003C/strong\u003E The .cfg reader understands arrays? If it doesn\\\u0027t, is there something that prohibits reading in another file (where I\\\u0027d store the array)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThree:\u003C/strong\u003E The LineRenderer example code in the wiki is very interesting, might be just what I need for one of my ideas. Do you know where I might look for learning how to substitute a simple 3d object for the line there?

I have a couple ideas for new ball modes, that would need a new texture and, obviously, a way to spin it the way I want. (Though who knows when I\\\u0027d manage to do that, just making the new texture won\\\u0027t be easy at all for me)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, there would be also lots of much more basic questions like, \u0027how do I setup Monodevelop?\u0027, but I\\\u0027m sure there are already threads for that. Time to browse the archive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy general objective is to write devices that make manual flight easier, not full autopilots.
