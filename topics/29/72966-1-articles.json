It offset all normals on a flat surface. I am using the NVIDIA NormalMapFilter tool for PhotoShop and had used the Average RGB for Height Source. Having only a few lines in my bump map the average RGB would cause a tilted normal. I changed to Colorspace, turning my normal map much more blue, and fixing the problem in the game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
