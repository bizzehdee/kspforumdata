I found out, that they have a \u0022disengaged\u0022 state. As far as I see it\u0027s the mode the shielded Clamp-o-Tron goes into when the shield is closed ... that\u0027s why I think that I know that it\u0027s possible to disengage a port. But... I didn\u0027t find a way to do this. Nothing works... any tipps what I can do? I do have the ModuleDockingNode object... can I trigger an fsm even? how? I tried fsm.RunEvent(on_disable) ... doesn\u0027t work... do I have to do more?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRudolf\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-01T22:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had written up up a \u0027proof of concept\u0027 patch (\u002B dummy model file) that added a \u0027toggle\u0027 option to docking ports.\u00A0 Perhaps some of it might be of use to you....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(the basic theory is that you add an \u0027animated\u0027 empty transform to the docking port, and specify that as the animation module; which then adds an \u0027on/off\u0027 state for the docking port)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/shadowmage45/DockingPortToggle/tree/master/GameData/DockingPortToggle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/shadowmage45/DockingPortToggle/tree/master/GameData/DockingPortToggle\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rudolf Meier","CreatedById":176740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-04T21:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the information... at the moment I think, my best option is to disassemble ksp and dig into the code to figure out, what\u0027s happening.
