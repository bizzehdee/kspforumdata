Those right click menu stuff is handled by UIPartAction... classes. There is a UIPartActionController that holds a bunch of prefabs you probably can mess around with to resize \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E right click menus. The derived types of UIPartActionItem seem to expose their UI elements as well, UIPartActionToggle for example has SpriteText fieldName, SpriteText fieldStatus \u0026amp; UIStateToggleBtn toggle. It definitively doesn\u0027t look easy and might be even worth to make this a separate mod. Though changing a specific instance of the right click menu seems not worth the effort imo, so far...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"6.forty","CreatedById":97939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-07T18:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that doesn\u0027t sound worth the effort for what I\u0027m doing but it is good to know as a just-in-case thing, thanks. I\u0027ll just rethink how I\u0027m using the context menu instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut say I were to extend from UIPartActionController (I assume this handles the menu itself?) for a custom menu, how would I set a part to use my class? I didn\u0027t see any properies in Part or PartModule that looked relevant, would I have to catch the right click and handle the menu instance myself then? That definitely would get hacky, and sort of reinventing the wheel just to change the tire.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
