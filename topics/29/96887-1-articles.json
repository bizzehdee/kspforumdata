If I change the order they are defined in the config file to have connect01 and bottom01 defined first, it switches which 2 work. If I have more nodes defined matching the working orientation, those also work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock \u0022Rockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector\u0022 has this issue as well. in this case, it doesn\u0027t matter since it is symmetrical. You can just rotate and find a node that works. After it is placed, you can connect to the other nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttempted work-arounds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI tried the clipping option in the debug menu in VAB. Doesn\u0027t change the problem.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPlace the object using the a working node, change root to it, disconnect the rest of the vessel and connect it to the node you want to use. Change root back to where you want it. This works until you have 2 parts with broken nodes that you want to attach to each other.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake all nodes have the same orientation in config, then rotate them after the are connected in VAB.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last hack works for me, but when \u0022Joe Kerman\u0022 in the wild tries the mod, he will most likely not find this answer, because Joe has a rather high stupidity rating. Sorry Joe...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know how to fix this issue?
