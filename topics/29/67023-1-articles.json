The premise of this mod is to make a new solar system far away from the home system of Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I am looking for at the moment to help myself create this mod are the base files for the main planets/solar system for the stock game. I honestly don\u0027t know what I\u0027m looking for, so any help with being pointed in the right direction would be most appreciated. Also, what programs should I use to make mods? I have not been able to find any tutorials that fit my needs. Once again, any help would be most appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFly far and fly safe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.
