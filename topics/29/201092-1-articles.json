(Links at end)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had the same issue with both when it came to building the AssestBundle using PartTools. I\u0027m using Unity 2019.2.2f1 and I think\u00A0I followed the installation and setup for PartTools correctly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst I created my new project, then went to Window-\u0026gt;Package Manager. Clicked on TextMeshPro 2.0.1 and then clicked the Remove button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen\u00A0 I followed the link to TextMesh Pro Release 1.0.56-Unity 2017.3 which is a google drive with a long list of seemingly random folder names. I clicked the download button and\u00A0this downloaded a file called \u0022TextMesh Pro - Release 1.0.56.2017.3.0b2 (dll only).unitypackage\u0022 which I double clicked to import/install. I clicked on the All and then Import buttons in the dialog box that popped up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext I downloaded and unzipped the latest PartTools using the link from PartTools forum topic, and again imported by double clicking on the \u0022PartTools_AssetBundles.unitypackage\u0022 file and again clicking on the All then the Import buttons on the new dialog box.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, I clicked on the Assets/Plugins/KSPAssetCompiler.dll (Couldn\u0027t find KSPAssedCompiler.dll so I\u0027m assuming its a typo in the instructions) and made sure Validate References in the inspector panel was unchecked (Which it was for me).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, I did the same for Assets/Plugins/KSPAssets.dll which was originally had Validate References checked, so I uncecked it and then clicked on the Apply button at the bottom of the Inspector panel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis ended what I thought was the setup for PartTools, but everytime I tired to use KSPAssets-\u0026gt;Asset Compiler-\u0026gt;Build I would get the following 3\u00A0 errors\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003EAssets\\Plugins\\KSPAssets\\TextMeshProResolver.cs(12,6): error CS0246: the type or namespace name \u0027InitializeOnLoadAttribute\u0027 could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\n\nAssets\\Plugins\\KSPAssets\\TextMeshProResolver.cs(12,6): error CS0246: the type or namespace name \u0027InitializeOnLoad\u0027 could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)\n\nError building Player because scripts had compile errors\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand my AssetBundle would not be created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I double click on the error to open the TextMeshResolver.cs file in Visual Studio though it all looks fine, the reference works and the file compiles, so its just a unity compiler issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTLDR;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo fix it I just commented out line 12 [InitializeOnLoad] of TextMeshResolver.cs\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure if this is gonna bite me in the cheeks later but at least I\u0027ve got my assestbundle now and can continue with the tutorials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea what this line does so if I\u0027ve just done a dumb thing please someone tell me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if anyone can point me (and others) to more up-to-date GUI creation tutorials, from what I\u0027ve read so far there are now four methods of GUI creation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnGUI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEzGUI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSSUI\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnity 5 Canvas-based (Which I think is the one used in the two tutorials I mentioned, at least they both use a Canvas Object)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0It\u0027s hard to distinguish which is newer or better or easier or what the advantages or disadvantages of each are.

First being the legacy IMGUI system, which is a fully code approach for creating UIs. It\u2019s pretty easy to get into, but the performance is really bad compared to other approaches. (As it\u2019s redrawn every frame)\u00A0Don\u2019t use it for really large complex UIs with a lot of objects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u2019s the uGUI system (unity prefabs). This means creating the UI in unity, exporting it as a AssetBundle and hooking it up via code. Has much better performance and is really customizable. Tho, It\u2019s harder to get into.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s also ways to do uGUIs but with full code approach, which is damn hard to get right and would require a lot of code.
