In some cases, however, especially the areas around KSC, it gives odd values. For example, on the runway, it gives me \u0022Ksc\\_runway\\_09\u0022.\n\nThere must be a way to get the proper names of all these places, because the experiments use them. For example, you can have \u0022Temperature scan while landed on the Runway\u0022 or \u0022Surface sample from the Launchpad\u0022.\n\nDoes anyone know how to get the proper title of these landing sites?"},{"CreatedByName":"xEvilReeperx","CreatedById":75857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T06:08:35Z","Content":"Use Vessel.GetLandedAtString with vessel.landedAt if it\u0027s not null or empty"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeenobit","CreatedById":125578,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T03:33:02Z","Content":"That worked!
