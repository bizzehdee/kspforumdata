Seems like that the interior is rendered using the same transform so all the gauges and monitors appear in front of a view regardless it is turned away from the vessels front. So what\u0027s the proper way to turn the \u0022eye\u0022 view only as if it was moved with RMB? Should I manipulate a kerbal\u0027s head instead?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T13:41:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ser**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ser","CreatedById":104207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T11:55:49Z","Content":"Seems to be too hard task... does anyone know the answer?"},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T12:48:25Z","Content":"I\u0027m trying to do something...
