But warning, it doesn\u0027t work well in 1.1.3. \u00A0But it\u0027ll show you the basics of how to apply forces to emulate buoyancy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you don\u0027t need a part on the ship if you can put a partmodule on your locks. \u00A0As long as a partmodule is in range (2.5km) you can find it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-31T06:51:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2016 06:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
