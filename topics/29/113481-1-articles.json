I can mouseover parts like normal but can\u0027t click on any of the parts that do exist to place them. I can open existing craft and get the highlight from mouseover, but also can\u0027t click on those parts and grab them. The place, offset, rotate, and root tools don\u0027t work, but you can set action groups and pick crew. There are buttons for parts I deleted, and things that aren\u0027t normally parts - a flag, a potato-like rock easter egg, even kerbals! (And instead of spinning in place, flag and kerbals zoom in, getting bigger than the buttons.)\n\nI\u0027m guessing it has something to do with all the amazingly awesome new ways to sort parts introduced with 1.0. What do you have to do in this brave new world to add (or remove) parts correctly?"},{"CreatedByName":"JonDahm","CreatedById":145757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T04:32:06Z","Content":"What, exactly, did you do to your install?\n\nBy the way, if you\u0027re going to delete parts, you\u0027ll want to delete the stock crafts, too, as they\u0027ll be referencing parts you no longer have."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T04:48:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What, exactly, did you do to your install?\n\nThats what happens when the part selection tabs don\u0027t get initialised properly. You can (or atleast could in 0.90) see it briefly when entering the editor (eva kerbal, flag, and the asteroid are just parts that are normally not visible)\n\n@beabop\n\nI no longer see the need to strip down an install anymore. Loading times are less than half what they were (used to be 60-90\u002B seconds just for stock...) and missing parts can be annoying when testing things. If you do still want to remove parts, try deleting the partDatabase file next to KSP.exe"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMcMuffin","CreatedById":145231,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T15:05:42Z","Content":"Try deleting things until u have only one of each type of part"},{"CreatedByName":"beabop","CreatedById":128715,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T00:16:41Z","Content":"Ah, thanks everyone!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E @beabop\n\u003E I no longer see the need to strip down an install anymore.
