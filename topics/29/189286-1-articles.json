In that way, I\u0027d be able to plot things like altitude, velocity, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, delta-v burn and the like. Being able to do that in real-time or at least at constant intervals to create plots and stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs something like this possible? If so, where would I begin to learn how to extract the relevant information and have it displayed inside of my module?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for any help you may be able to provide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-25T15:43:52Z\u0022 title=\u002210/25/2019 03:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 25, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Kerlix\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarified information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-26T00:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately the best documentation for KSP is the source code for mods.
