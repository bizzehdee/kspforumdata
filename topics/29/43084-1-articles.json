I want to store some extra parameters on each vessel for something I\u0027m working on. This really needs to be on the vessel. But I cannot find a proper way to do it. Right now I\u0027m keeping a hashmap of the vessel.id with the information, but this won\u0027t work properly when quicksaving/loading. It also gives a minor issue when undocking/decoupling. For docking there is no issue, as I can just use the \u0022primary\u0022 vessel information in case of docking and discard the other info. That\u0027s no problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea where I should start looking? Can I add a custom hidden part to a vessel at runtime which keeps my info?

I guess the easiest way would be to add an module to one of the vessels parts (primary ones?). But that might break compatibility. Part.customPartData property. Fuel lines and struts use it to save some info, they update it on \u0022onBackup\u0022. But its a pure string, so multiple modules trying to write stuff into it will likely break stuff as well.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T20:18:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, thanks, adding a PartModule like TacLifeSupport does to a vessel might be the best step forward. My addon is quite invasive already, so that\u0027s no big issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m tricking the of whole KSP to support multiple solar systems, requiring me to keep track of the system a vessel is in, and if it\u0027s not in the current system I need to \u0022fake\u0022 the orbit of this vessel away and store the old orbit so I can restore it when you switch to the vessel. I actually have the random solar system generation parts working already, and the solar system switching. However, right now the vessels are not moved out of the way when you switch systems. Which will cause mayhem as I\u0027m changing SoI and planet/moon orbits. It won\u0027t be perfect (a lined up SoI switch won\u0027t happen due to the faked orbit) but it will make inter stellar travel possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
