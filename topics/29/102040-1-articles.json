I don\u0027t know where the collection of parts to be sorted is kept. It used to be the order in PartLoader.Instance.Parts IIRC, but that isn\u0027t being changed by the stock sorting methods. Category/subCategory.available parts is a null List.\n\nAny ideas as to where the sorted parts are being read from?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-16T00:28:23Z\u0022 title=\u002203/16/2015 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T03:58:53Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think it keeps a sorted list, I\u0027m fairly sure it applies the sorting predicate on the PartLoader list and drops that in the editor."},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T05:13:20Z","Content":"I stumbled onto that a few hours back when I found the EditorPartsList.Refresh method was overloaded with an IComparer\u003Cavailablepart\u003E which is, I am assuming for lack of an alternative, how the sorting is being done.\u003C/availablepart\u003E\n\nStill haven\u0027t got it working but I can\u0027t see any other way in\n\nE:\n\n[Any ideas why this isn\u0027t working](https://github.com/Crzyrndm/FilterExtension/blob/master/FilterExtension/Sorting.cs) (other than that I\u0027m totally barking up the wrong tree).
