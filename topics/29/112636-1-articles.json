I wanted to test it out but it seems that there are many things it throws build errors with that Visual studio does not care about. \n\nFor instance doing this:\n\n    Public void somemethod(float input = 1.0f){}\n\nbuilds fine in Visual studio but in monodevelop it throws a build error on account of the default variable (input).\n\nThere was another case too. But dont remember what it was\n\nA strange thing is that if i close the project, open the project in visual studio, save it \n\nand then open it in mono again. It compiles fine... any idea why this is happening? Is there some assembly settings that are changed? The target language is always set to 3.5 / mono\n\nOne thing that is suggested as a fix is to to disable compiling in mono (inside the main options/debugger tab) but this disables the ide requiring you to compile with unity. Which does not appear to be a valid option for ksp plugins.\n\nIm a noob at programming so im sorry if this is a stupid question.\n\nIm using Monodevelop 4.01(the one that ships with unity)"}]}
