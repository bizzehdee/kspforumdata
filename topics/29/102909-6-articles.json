So either a 201x Pro\u002B or [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) (it is free and Unity most likely already installed it). You also have to install the [Tools for Unity](https://www.visualstudio.com/features/unitytools-vs) extension (also free). Get the one for your VS version and install it.\n\u003E \n\nI think this is now wrong.  I\u0027m sure it was probably right once, but not now.  The \u0022Tools for  Unity\u0022 doesn\u0027t offer anything to download except Visual Studio, which you don\u0027t need to re-download.  I believe that if you started the process with nothing, then you\u0027d get Visual Studio with Unity enabled by downloading Unity.  If you already had Visual Studio 2017 at the start of the process (like me), you should be installing it with the \u0022Visual Studio Installer\u0022 -- start up the installer, go to \u0022Modify\u0022 and poke around until you see the Unity box.\n\nThanks for maintaining this!  This thread is a really valuable resource.  Hey, I\u0027m moaning and all, but I plugged my way through it and it didn\u0027t require *that* much creativity and it\u0027s sure not like the Unity guys made this process simple..."}]}
