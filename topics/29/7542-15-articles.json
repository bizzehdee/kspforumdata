I\u0027m not new to development; I\u0027ve got three years of open-source development experience and another four years of professional programming experience with a multitude of languages (that doesn\u0027t mean I remember them all!), but I know next to nothing about game/mod development aside from some Tetris I wrote a few years back (and I apparently forgot that I wrote a Minecraft mod.

I can then get the position on the orbit and convert it to whatever measurement I need. The easiest way would be to get this from the most current maneuver node, but is there any way to get it from current input? The game puts a small \u0022bulb\u0022 over the orbit where I\u0027m hovering, is there any way to access that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-17T15:32:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2013 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gary_P","CreatedById":67878,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T12:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a debug screen that I can write to in KSP, like the one in Unity?
