However, while setting up a small base using Kerbal Attachment System I encounter a massive amount of throws, and I suspect it\u0027s related to attaching objects to the planet\u0027s surface and the module trying to check its connected part, which in this case would be the planets surface (or whatever is in between, depending on how KAS works).\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI tried looking through the KAS source, but (since I only have limited knowledge with all this), I couldn\u0027t find anything useful. Therefore I\u0027m wondering is there any convenient way figuring out whether or not a part is connected to the planet surface (and/or other static objects) using KAS? That way I can just have it being put in an exclusion list.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-02T02:49:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2016 02:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by kimiko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
