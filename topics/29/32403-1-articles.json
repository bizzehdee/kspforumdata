All the other easter eggs are clearly there, monoliths, face, ufos even the smiley face. So either A. I am missing it or B. it was removed between 0.18 and 0.19. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr C. Could it be a Vessel spawned by some event, like entering Ikes SOI. But I know of no other object in the game like that. Did anyone ever look into this?
