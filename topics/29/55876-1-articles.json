I really wished they would offer a dev build, so we could attach unities mono-develop to it. Maybe KerbalKon is a good opportunity to ask for it! Anyway, you could dump lot of its variables and check for null values... but that requires a lot of effort. In what way is your plugin manipulating this KSP module? Maybe checking out those related objects and comparing them to well working ones does the job?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T14:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs it\u0027s the PatchedConicRenderer\u0027s OnGUI method that\u0027s having issues, I\u0027m guessing that you have an OnGUI method that has left things in an invalid state somehow, and PatchedConicRenderer is the first thing to hit it. I would start looking there. Try adding a second KSPAddon class that also calls OnGUI so that the failure happens in code you control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-12T15:48:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only have a tiny bit of code that executes outside of OnGUI() and I just fixed a layout issue I was having when this popped up.
