The problem is that as soon as something hits 25km, it gets deleted.

But you can selectively change the physics range distance for a given vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou need to change a vessel\u0027s VesselRanges field to something further away. There are different settings for each flight situation (landed, flying, suborbital, orbit...) and each situation has multiple values (load, unload, pack, unpack). You should be able to just take the Vessel.vesselRanges field and either change it or replace it with a new with different values.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would probably require some tinkering to figure out what the best values are for something like you are describing, I\u0027m guessing you would need to change the values for the flying and suborbital situations so that the vessel doesn\u0027t get unloaded too soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darinth","CreatedById":186781,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-16T13:25:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOhh wow. I had no clue that KSP allowed for the changing of physics ranges on individual vessels. That changes a lot on what I can do and now that I\u0027ve looked up the specific vessel ranges and physics configuration defaults some of the odd issues I was having make a lot more sense! Thank you. That should be just the tidbit I was needing to fix the rest of these issues. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
