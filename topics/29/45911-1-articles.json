So far I\u0027ve only created some tweaked regular parts(like a multi-size docking port made of the stock ones or a modified KAS parts that can be plugged to a wall, etc), so what I\u0027m asking for is probably easily done somehow, but I simply haven\u0027t found a way to do it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question here: what should I do if I were to add more actions to EVA right-click menu on a part? Like \u0022repack chute\u0022, but for example applied to \u0022activate engine\u0022 or \u0022toggle gear\u0022? Is there a way to do this to stock parts, or would it require digging into some plugin/module files? Could someone post a short guide here for me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T14:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaven\u0027t tried it myself, but KSPEvent offers a bunch of parameters, including some that appear to be EVA related.
