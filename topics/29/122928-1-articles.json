Just to clarify, roll thrust shouldn\u0027t be dependent on the distance from CoM along roll axis, should it? In other words no matter where along roll axis you put thrusters (other coordinates being const) they should always produce same amount of thrust to roll the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-14T10:24:11Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2015 10:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
