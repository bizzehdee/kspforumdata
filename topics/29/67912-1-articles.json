Like little hatches in engine fairings that can be opened once the fairings themselves have been spawned? My current tests seem to imply as soon as you use a Module_Jettison config, the animation in a ModuleAnimateGeneric config is overridden and doesnt work. Remove the module jettison, and the animation works fine again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
