Time for what I\u0027m hoping is an easy question.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking to call the force value of lift from atmospheric forces during flight as a number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr more simply, how much lift force are my wings giving me? Returned as a number so I can plug it into my thrust calculation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been looking around trying to find out how to calculate this and I\u0027ve made exactly zero progress. I\u0027ve checked several other mods and was not able to find if they are calculating lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only real lead I had was that the Object Browser in Visual Studio told me there was a CenterOfLiftQuery.lift value available, but from a Developer\u0027s post back in 2012 that query is available only in the editor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m currently stuck at square one and don\u0027t even know how to start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not trying to edit wings or generate lift or anything, I simply want to know at this instant, how much lift force is being generated from the atmosphere?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, quoting myself since I\u0027ve figured an answer out and figure it\u0027s worth sharing as the lift forces are not exposed anywhere in the KSP API that I could find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem I faced was that I have an automated engine throttle that works great as long as no lift from wings is present. I needed to calculate how much lift the wings are generating and throttle back that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I was only concerned with vertical acceleration (straight up and down) for my mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo find the lift required taking advantage of the fact that OnFixedUpdate() runs a specific number of times a second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, using a timer, calculate how many times OnFixedUpdate() runs per second in this game instance. I believe both the Delta-Time Physics in the Game Settings and the lag from high part count ships affect it so it\u0027s done on the fly in code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen get the difference between Vessel.verticalvelocity on this FixedUpdate frame and the last, then multiply it by the number of FixedUpdate frames per second to get my \u0027instantaneous\u0027 acceleration. On my test machine, FixedUpdate was running 50 times a second, so if the velocity difference was 0.01, my current acceleration was 0.5m/s^2. This turned out to be accurate, but very \u0027bouncy\u0027 as it could vary as much as 30m/s^2 from one FixedUpdate frame to the next, so I average the acceleration over the last 5 FixedUpdate frames to get a smooth number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I do my actual thrust calculation in Newtons, I then multipy the ActualAcceleration, from the last FixedUpdate frame I have just calculated, by the Vessel.mass to get how much force was actually exerted on my Vessel. I then subtract what my mod applied the previous frame with just the engines and that difference is how much lift is being applied by the wings on the Vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKludgy, but it works. I could not find any sort of way to get the actual force numbers for lift in the flight scene so I had to calculate it out manually. As I care about only straight up and down I did not have to mess with Vectors that the forces are being applied so just using Vessel.verticalvelocity works for my purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-23T05:33:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou were perhaps tkaing it hard on yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, no need for a timer, Time.fixedDeltaTime is the time taken by one physics frame, no need for a timer to get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, the lift generated by wings is a compiled with a force.

I know I could use the new FX module, but I want multiple sounds at a time (layered). I wanted to mimic the curves for pitch and volume, but I\u0027m a bit confused on how to get them from the config to the code.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in the .cfg is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EvolumeCurve\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003Ekey = 0.0 0.3\u003Cbr\u003Ekey = 1.0 1.0\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, 30% volume at 0 throttle, and 100% volume at 100% throttle.

I can set the effectPower to 0 but if I don\u0027t define a curve with the 0.0 key, then it runs indefinitely.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-28T04:06:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2014 04:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Raptor831\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T20:33:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know how to read whether the staging lock (Alt\u002BL) is on or off?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xEvilReeperx","CreatedById":75857,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T20:42:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trigger Au\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trigger Au\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyone know how to read whether the staging lock (Alt\u002BL) is on or off?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInputLockManager.IsLocked(ControlTypes.STAGING)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TriggerAu","CreatedById":57838,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T21:13:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, just couldnt see it for some reason\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T22:50:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow do you check if RCS is on?
