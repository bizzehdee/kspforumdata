I found the fancy text version that the VAB displays - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eforeach (Part part in this.vessel.parts){\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E foreach (PartModule pm in part.Modules)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ScreenMessages.PostScreenMessage(pm.GetInfo().ToString());\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that shows you all of the VAB info lines, and they\u0027re formatted as descriptive text... something like \u0022-Electric Charge - 27.0/minute.\u0022 You could certainly work backwards from here, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a way to get at the actual use rate.
