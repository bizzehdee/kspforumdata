I have managed to import a mesh of my marker and add it to the game and draw it both the VAB and in flight. I want it to be drawn \u0022always on top\u0022 of everthing else, so you can see where it is even if it behind or inside a part. I managed to do this by luck in the VAB by changing the GameObject\u0027s layer to match the same layer that the stock CoM etc use. However this does not work for in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have not clue what is going on here. I assume that something is set up in the VAB so that gameobjects in a certain layer are rendered that way, but what? What do I need to do be able to render my mesh the same way on flight? I am a complete noob with unity, and while reading the documentation over and over again is fascinating, I am not getting anywhere!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T00:20:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo start an answer to my own question, this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/10003-Object-always-on-top-shader\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread \u003C/a\u003E suggest that it is done using an extra camera.

It turns out that there is an extra camera in the VAB called markerCam that is used to render the markers. Hpwever this does not exist in flight. I have managed to render a marker in flight by adding an extra camera and setting up the layers appropriately.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I need to hook to set a new camera up in a flght scene?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
