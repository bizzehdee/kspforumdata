Is there a GUI I can use? Moving around nodes by using the coordinate system in notepad and then checking by booting up the game would be really time-consuming, and I wouldn\u0027t know how to move the parts."},{"CreatedByName":"atomicfury","CreatedById":120037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:03:46Z","Content":"With the latest ModuleManager you can just define a .cfg.

One of the most frustrating things would be using the coordinate system to lay out the nodes as opposed to a visual editor. Wouldn\u0027t I have to stick a node at (-1519,1355) for example in the cfg and then boot the game to check where it is? Doing that with 50-100 nodes would be a huge pain. And that\u0027s before you get to moving around the 500\u002B stock and mod parts.\n\nIs there another option? Has someone developed a visual editor that works with 1.0?"}]}
