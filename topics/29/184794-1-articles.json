That is, execute a function when the \u0022Launch\u0022 button is pressed in either the editor or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E screens, preventing the loading until the function returns and/or is resolved in another way. For example, the recovery warning when trying to launch with a vessel on pad does this. I merely ask for two things: Is it possible, and if, how. And of course I have the alternative of using onVesselRollout or something, but I really want to do it before the loading screen. Before attacking me for this, I have spent the last hour trying to figure it out. Sorry for the possibly stupid question, just looking for help, and thanks in advance! For context I\u0027m using a ScenarioModule with the [KSPScenario] attribute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-27T19:39:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at Kerbal Construction Time, also KRASH,mthey both intercept the launch key\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JuhaJGamer","CreatedById":146029,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-27T19:41:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223606051\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184794\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221558985953\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at Kerbal Construction Time, also KRASH,mthey both intercept the launch key\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, will look into it.
