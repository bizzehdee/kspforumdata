However, after I loaded them in KSP, one works and the two others don\u0027t.\n\nAfter checking each shader with isSupported I get the following \n\n    Atmo/Sky (UnityEngine.Shader)FalseAtmo/SkyMap (UnityEngine.Shader)FalseEncodeFloat/DecodeToFloat (UnityEngine.Shader)True\n\nWhat could be the reason for this? All three shaders were made for dx9, all three of them use rendertextures but don\u0027t use compute shaders. And I used the snippet of code to load all three, i\u0027m at a loss here...\n\nEdit: As it turns out, my shaders will run by forcing d3d11 or opengl but not d3d9 or d3d10 for some reason.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-10T09:42:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/10/2015 09:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T09:53:28Z","Content":"Shader model 4.0 require DX11 on Unity.\n\n[http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-ShaderPrograms.html](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-ShaderPrograms.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T11:35:05Z","Content":"I have modified my shaders, they now compile correctly for directx 9 and unity reports shader model 3.0, however, ingame it still says they are unsupported andf won\u0027t load.
