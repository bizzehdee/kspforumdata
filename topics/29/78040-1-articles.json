The runtime should take care of that for you. Thus you should target \u0022Any CPU\u0022, unless you\u0027re doing stuff that requires a specific one. I doubt there will be a mentionable difference, but you can check that yourself... just create both version dlls versions of your own mod and compare their IL byte code with something like for example \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ilspy.net/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EILSpy\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
