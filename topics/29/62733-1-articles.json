The reasoning for my question is that there is a huge difference if all you want to do is work on any Windows machine (which is practically guaranteed to have at least .Net 2.0 installed nowadays) and being able to work with any OS. AFAIK, there isn\u0027t a portable cross-platform .Net runtime, so if you want to work on a Linux machine one day and then a Mac machine the next, without any guarantee of the necessary dependencies being installed, a VM is the only solution. If all you care about is unzipping your projects on Windows machines, it\u0027s a simple matter of learning how to call the c# compiler via the commandline and then automating it via makefiles. I did something similar with the latter back in Uni, as some of the Uni computers only had VS 6.0 and DevC\u002B\u002B installed and I had some little personal projects I wanted to be able to work on between lectures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T20:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP actually uses Mono for the plugins so they work across all three platforms, well it\u0027s Unity that uses it really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you could try looking at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://monodevelop.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMonoDevelop\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echo 8 \u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u00B0R\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u201A\u00AC","CreatedById":37973,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T00:14:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP actually uses Mono for the plugins so they work across all three platforms, well it\u0027s Unity that uses it really.\u003Cp\u003ESo you could try looking at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://monodevelop.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMonoDevelop\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMonoDevelop requires that they install dependencies (Mono on non-Windows machines, .Net on Windows), which they don\u0027t want to do.
