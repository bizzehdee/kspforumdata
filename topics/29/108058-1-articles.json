This is often done by trial-and-error:\n\n1) Edit attachment nodes in part.cfg file.\n\n2) Load KSP\n\n3) goto VAB\n\n4) Create vessel\n\n5) Attach part. Discover position is incorrect.\n\n6) Exit KSP\n\n7) goto step 1 and repeat.\n\nIs there a mod/tool that allows me to adjust the attachment in the editor and display the results. I would then take those results and edit the part.cfg file with them."},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T16:32:28Z","Content":"You can use NODE based attach nodes to precisely position and orient your attach points. Create empty transforms in your model, positioned and rotated properly, and reference that transform name in your config. Problem solved; all of your attach nodes are exactly where they should be, and pointed exactly the direction you specify ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFor more info:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96100](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/96100)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36455?p=460394\u0026viewfull=1#post460394](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36455?p=460394\u0026viewfull=1#post460394)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95336-Workaround-How-to-convert-angle-to-unit-vector-%28angled-stack-nodes%29/page3](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95336-Workaround-How-to-convert-angle-to-unit-vector-%28angled-stack-nodes%29/page3) \n\nAlternatively, you can use a slightly modified method of the above to use the traditional node\\_stack\\_top type node declarations. Create the empty transforms in your model positioned where they should be, and note their location coordinates; copy these coordinates into your node definition, and manually calculate the axis (works best for axis-aligned nodes... calculating off-axis node angles can be a PITA) (might need to swap and or invert Y/Z coordinates, depending upon your modeling program and rotations). It is not in-game; but in-model-editor... which I generally find to be more precise and easier to work with.\n\nAs far as in-game tools, I am unfortunately not aware of any..."},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo13","CreatedById":74572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:24:50Z","Content":"Thanks for the info.
