I\u0027ve got the basics of it working (thanks to HyperEdit for showing me how to drop a vessel into an orbit), but there are a few things that I\u0027ve not been able to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically: I need to take one vessel and position it adjacent to another vessel, and then orient it so that the docking ports on the two vessels can be safely coupled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the HyperEdit method, I can drop a vessel into the same orbit as another vessel. But even though their positions are identical (vessel.GetWorldPos3D() reports identical coordinates for both ships) they are not overlapping as I would expect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Obviously, I don\u0027t want them to overlap, but I\u0027d like to understand why they don\u0027t, even with identical coordinates.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, I then need to figure out how to determine the relative coordinates of two parts on two different ships, orient the two vessels appropriately, and then move them together. I think I\u0027ve got the orientation bit figured out (reverse the direction of the orientation of the part\u0027s topNode, and then use Quaternion.LookRotation to find a transform to apply to the vessel), but the positioning bit is baffling me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny tips?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrivateFlip","CreatedById":68273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T17:03:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you just want the teleported ship docked to the ship already in orbit?
