When I drag the DLL over to the plugin folder (even if I change the name) the rover wheel sounds go away completely.\n\nI\u0027m using Xamarin Studio.

When adding references in Visual Studio, you have to change the copy local field to false to get rid of the majority of the rubbish. I assume there\u0027s something similar in Xamarin.\n\nYou should also be moving it to overwrite the .dll shipped by the mod in question, which will be in GameData/\u003Cinsertmodfolder\u003E or one of it\u0027s subdirectories. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EDO NOT\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E put it in the \u003Ckspinstall\u003E/Plugins folder and \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDO NOT\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E have the old and new .dll both inside GameData.\u003C/kspinstall\u003E\u003C/insertmodfolder\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T05:38:49Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 05:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Crzyrndm**"},{"CreatedByName":"jtn191","CreatedById":144371,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T06:29:01Z","Content":"Still not working...my DLL\u0027s are 4 kb while the released one is 7kb, don\u0027t know if that explains anything.
