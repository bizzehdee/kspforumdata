I build some large structures and if I have a lot of repeating parts it is difficult to know which parts have broken from the F3 event list, (for example dropping submarine crafts onto the water surface can be an exercise in frustration).\n\nPerhaps if you can\u0027t display which parts are getting stressed maybe an add on could be created that pauses the game when one joint breaks and highlights the affected parts in colour?
