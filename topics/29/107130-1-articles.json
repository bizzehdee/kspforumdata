(I\u0027m trying to figure this out since I am only interested in that specific bit of realism overhaul, not the entire pack of mods).\n\nMy investigations so far have focused on the dll module, which seems to focus only on some engine control stuff, and the GameData/RealismOverhaul directories in the source package, but neither have given away the secret so far. Does someone know where this is done/have a suggestion as to what I might have overlooked?"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:21:02Z","Content":"No seed to look at plugin source.
