I\u0027ve tried searching around and KoS autopilot leads me to believe its possible but I am really looking to make a simplified version where Lat, Longitude and target altitude are set for each drone, no plans for them to land as of yet. I plan to have the drone launcher part with a selectable payload attribute in the VAB and a limited range as well (will be using firespitter as the drones are basically a single prop surrounded by a small aerodynamic fuselage containing fuel and w/e sci loadout is needed), not trying to make it hyper edit easy or anything just trying to make it a little less tedious. So my main question is if it is even possible within atmosphere? and secondly if so any pointers toward the right direction would be super appreciated. I know its probably ridiculously ambitious but I\u0027m a quick learner and love a challenge (as long as I know it is possible lol) \n\nIf it is possible and within my ability I would like to implement a karbondrum scanner loadout to work with rover dudes stuff for resource hunting as well as an orbital version for multiple location missions where the is no atmosphere.\n\nalso, and i\u0027m pretty sure this is askin too much , but a camera feed from each drone would be freekin sweet as well but feeds from 4 separate vessels is something i think would surely kill a 32 bit ksp lol\n\nedit: roughed in a quick mockup of the part, real rough lol \n\n![p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: BTW, I]() its got a few VFX demoreels and a couple modeling minireels but they havent been updated since early 2011-ish and its mostly Final stuff from College that I had to whip up in less than a month due to a major computer meltdown but most of the stuff there is still decent imo anyway, got a resume with imdb cred there as well\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T00:53:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lucerro**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T04:19:44Z","Content":"Making a single drone fly to a preset point: Relatively easy\n\nMaking multiple drones fly to multiple preset points: Difficult\n\nYour problem is going to be the physics zone.
