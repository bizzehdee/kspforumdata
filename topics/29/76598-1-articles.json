I got this far, and my shrouds are working perfectly, except for one little issue: the shrouds are showing on the part thumbnail in the parts selection area of the VAB! (They aren\u0027t showing once I add the part, though.) I\u0027m looking for something in Unity I have to toggle for this to not happen...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
