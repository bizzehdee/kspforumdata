KSP creates an instance of the KSPAddon when the scene starts, but I don\u0027t know what this instance would be called or how I would access it. Any ideas how I would do this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJim\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T22:08:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can have a public static MyClass instance member and set it instance = this on Start(). This is what those \u0022instance\u0022 and \u0022fetch\u0022 members are used for. Then you can do (in your PartModule) MyClass currentInstance = MyClass.instance; and go from there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T22:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf its your own KSPAddon, a static instance as recommended is probably the best way to go. KSPAddons are MonoBehaviors, so for foreign stuff it should also be possible to use Unity to retrieve the instance, e.g. with \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Object.FindObjectsOfType.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EObject.FindObjectsOfType\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
