I had a couple old .DAE -based parts like that, and had to rescale the collider in Blender (and reset the scale of the model for good measure to keep it nice and consistent). Though, while I was able to select the part after that fix, I found I didn\u0027t get the default select glow either. Got the glow after loading it into Unity to create a .MU with an auto-generated collider instead of the native collider mesh from the .DAE. No idea why there would be a difference, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
