However while I understand the syntax of things, I have never modded KSP before so am not quite sure what I should be doing to \u0022update\u0022 the mod. On which note I also have no idea what makes a mod \u0022Outdated\u0022? I mean I know that certain code in a mod won\u0027t work in a new version because the classes that the mod accesses from the game may have been changed in the update, but I\u0027m not quite sure how I would go about determining what makes the mod not function properly in a new version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be honest here, I am not asking for somebody to update it for me or tell me exactly how to do it -- I am simply asking for guidance in updating a mod that I enjoy playing with.

So I opened it up to check for any highlighted variables as you mentioned, and well -- There weren\u0027t any. So on that note I just realized that I sort of made a mistake in assuming the mod didn\u0027t work because it was outdated without actually testing it first.
