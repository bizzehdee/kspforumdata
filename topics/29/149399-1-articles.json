If you don\u0027t know c# it\u0027s not something you can just hop into unless you have some coding/programming background. Even then there is a lot to learn. It\u0027s not as easy as say, \u00A0editing a cfg file. There isn\u0027t really anything anyone can post on here to help you learn it immediately. It\u0027s a long process. I\u0027m a web developer and it took me almost 2 years to figure out how to use html, Javascript, Ruby, \u00A0etc. \u00A0I am currently trying to learn c# and I have been trying for about 2 months now. I still couldn\u0027t even throw together the simplest mod if I wanted to. \u00A0Compiling mods to work with the current version is fairly easy but it\u0027s not always guaranteed to work. Hope this shines some light on the subject for you\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbol101","CreatedById":169774,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-06T20:35:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry, I was wondering if anyone wondering if anyone experiencedin this domain would take a look at it.

I am learning how to edit and 3d model diffrent things but coding and computer progarming is not my strength.
