Before I modified the files the game opened just fine, they all seemed to work well enough too. Then I changed the resource values to the current TACLS standards (again, many thanks to Frenzi for the calculator) and now the game won\u0027t open with the parts installed.\u00A0 Am I missing something? Was I right in thinking that all I had to do was change the resource amounts, or is there something else I goofed up by not doing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T08:15:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile it seems unlikely that changing resource amounts is causing your issue, no one can give you any assistance with the information you\u0027ve provided.
