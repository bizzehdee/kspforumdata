I\u0027m currently breaking it up, texturing it, and coding the .cfgs. The simple animations are currently being controlled with moduleAnimateGeneric, but I need a more complex plugin for the legs. Just a couple questions for people with more c# experience then me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is where I am currently \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dZyYFjy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dZyYFjy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hip joint is pretty much just an IR disk washer. My guess is that IR part rotates 360 degrees and is looped, and somehow the IR plugin controls the motion and limits. So I made my joint in that fashion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also a rotation in the knee, that has limits, but that probably has to be designed like the joint above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy real question is if there is a way to get the IR plugin to run my parts. I figured I could just name my animations the same thing as the IR animation names, and trick IR into running it. But I looked through the IR plugin code and it\u0027s way beyond me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe also have code to make it walk that needs to be converted to c#.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just looking for any advice you guys might be able to give.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the development \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73364-Walking-Flying-Custom-Replica-Mech-Mod\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Epost\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-15T21:15:16Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2014 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by clown_baby\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
