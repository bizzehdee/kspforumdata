\u00A0For example, would it need any custom .dll files?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other arm of the project was that the structures\u00A0should be initially deployed (using MKS Ground Construction, i.e. you establish a small workshop, ship out a DIY kit and build the structure in situ) as a part-built\u00A0superstructure (i.e., all the metal bits), and in order to \u0022finish\u0022 the structure, you import a large amount of local raw materials(e.g. ore, silicates, gypsum) and hit deploy.\u00A0\u00A0Basically, you\u0027re making the large amount of\u00A0concrete needed to build the structure on site rather than abstracting it as \u0022material kits\u0022 or the special parts int the DIY kit). \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really envision this being extremely complicated, but I might be missing something subtle. \u00A0The idea would be to have two meshes for the part; when you\u0027re designing your base in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E you see the \u0022complete\u0022 model (with, I expect, a button to preview the \u0022incomplete\u0022 model), but when it is \u0022launched\u0022 (either via Ground Construction or if for some bizarre reason you rolled it out of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E on Kerbin) it defaults to the \u0022incomplete\u0022 model. \u00A0Then, when you\u0027ve accumulated the materials and hit \u0022deploy\u0022, you get a puff of smoke and the model switches to the \u0022complete\u0022 model (preferably without any way of toggling back to the incomplete version).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my core question is, what\u0027s the best way to implement that kind of behaviour? \u00A0Does any of that get baked into the .mu file, or should I be building a .dll that gets tied to the part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts, comments and suggestions appreciated (including \u0022this idea sucks\u0022 :P)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T06:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is not \u0022deployed\u0022 until you gather even more resources in addition to the initial cost to build onsite?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, you need a small plugin that references and requires GroundConstruction or similar mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not, config trickery should do the trick(ery)! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"anopheles","CreatedById":145247,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-08T07:07:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223143039\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022164194\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221502173158\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172792\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Benjamin Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n39 minutes ago, Benjamin Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo this is not \u0022deployed\u0022 until you gather even more resources in addition to the initial cost to build onsite?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf so, you need a small plugin that references and requires GroundConstruction or similar mod.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf not, config trickery should do the trick(ery)! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the procedure for deploying on a planet would be:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.
