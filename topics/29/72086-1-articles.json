And i also want to pick up modding. So i was thinking of a way to add new goals via. modding..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering if its possible to add a new stat, or if modding does not allow for this. Its a real noob question, i dont know wether modding can only change specific things or its possible to add completely new gameplay elements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i want to add a new stat as part of a larger idea i have to add new goals. Basically i want to add a stat that is called Prestige, and you get it by successfully launching things to orbit, landing on moons and planets and returning, launching space stations and satelites and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn some way its a form of achivement points. But thats not what i was intending it for. But it is a way for players to boast about their KSP skills. By boasing about how much prestige they have. For example accomplishing more difficult tasks gives more prestige compared to more trivial ones. Anyway, what wanted the prestige to be used for, and i dont know if this would be possible even, or wether it would require changing on a deeper level than a plugin or mod. I wanted the prestige the attract better crew. Eventually when the prestige system has been setup i wanted new crew with different bonuses to show up at the astronaut complex. For example crew with \u002B5% science gain. Or \u002B5% torque, -5% fuel consumption so on so forth. But maybe its not possible, because it would require changes on a deeper level in the game. Neverthe less i think it would be a cool idea, that could work well with for example Contracts, the more prestige you have, the more lucrative and difficult contracts will be available. If done correctly, having a space station in orbit could also grant prestige, which gives another reason to have them other than refueling stations..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first and fore most do anyone know where to start, if i wanted to add a new stat, and reward it based on different circumstances in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
