I haven\u0027t been able to find any information on the subject, except that BreakingForce is (maybe) measured in Newtons and BreakinTorque is (maybe) measured in Torque, and represents the maximum level of force that a part can withstand (and presumably its joints). I\u0027ve been stumbling on a lot of references, but it doesn\u0027t explain anything in detail, and with my limited Unity and programming understanding, I can\u0027t really make any sense of it. The forum seems empty on the subject too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically I want to end up with something like this (if possible).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html\u0022\u003E\n//pre-calculations if necessary\n\nif (currentforce-applied-to-this-part\u0027s-joint-connected-to-the-parent \u0026gt; (breakingTorque / 2))\n{\n\t//makesomethinghappen\n}\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help would be wonderful! : D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T23:16:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can\u0027t.
