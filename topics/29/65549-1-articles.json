BUT, if I was faced with this problem, what I would do is make a detector module (I think the Kethane API has interfaces/abstract classes for the detectors \u0026amp; extractors that you\u0027re supposed to implement/extend) and make it so the start detector event was only enabled if the vessel was landed (vessel.Landed). That way you at the very least have to be on the surface to scan, while technically you could be on a rover moving around that\u0027s probably not too big of a deal considering how big the land masses are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also have a bit on either the OnUpdate or OnFixedUpdate method that turns off the scanner if the vessel.Landed ever turns false (turn off the scanner if the ship takes off again)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, re-reading what you\u0027re asking... you could make use of the Science Experiment system to unlock the extractor, or possibly your own custom MonoBehavior to store global state if one of your detectors have successfully done some action on the planet\u0027s surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-12T22:48:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2014 10:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by notfirestorm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
