I had some luck with this in realtime, but under physical warp the parachute and pod just pop straight off the fuel tank. There\u0027s no spectacular sideways component present, just the link between the pod and the main body of the vessel breaks immediately on entering physical warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve since tried splitting the force among all the parts of the vessel (less desirable because it doesn\u0027t rotate the vessel like drag on the \u0027chute would), and applying it to the rigidbody of the vessel rather than a part, but in both cases the link between the pod and the rest of the ship still breaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t understand why the linkage is fine in realtime but fails immediately under physical warp. Is there any way I can investigate why the linkage fails? All I get is \u0022structural failure\u0022 - no indication of how much stress the linkage is under before and after I enter physics warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
