I thought this should be easy. When the Flight scene starts, record the currentStage value, which when you start up the Flight scene is set to the highest stage \u002B 1 if you have not launched yet. And then if currentStage drops, then I know they have activated the first stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP Reality seems to be different. When you start the Flight scene, currentStage is indeed set to highest stage \u002B 1. However if you re-arrange your stages, this value *does not update* to reflect the current setup. So for example if you have 3 stages, 0, 1 and 2, when you start the Flight scene, currentStage will be 3. Now you suddenly realize that what is in stage 2 should be split into 2 stages, so you add a new stage, Stage 3, and drag one of the items from 2 into it. Now you have stages 0, 1, 2, and 3. What is currentStage? Still 3. Just like it was before. If you were to activate stage 3 at this point, the currentStage value would *not* change until you activated the *next* stage after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven worse if you were to add say 2 or 3 new stages, so that your total number of stages was say 5, currentStage *would still be 3*!! until such time as you worked through the first few stages and got back in sync!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have any idea how I can tell when the player activates the very first stage at launch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk turns out that I was making it way more complicated than it had to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of the above is true, and that\u0027s a pretty nasty bug in KSP as far as I can see, but it isn\u0027t necessary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a GameEvent for when a stage is activated so I can just use that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T09:36:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never looked into it in details but in MJ we use Staging.CurrentStage so I guess this one better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
