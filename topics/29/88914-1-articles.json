Modelling and animation aside, how could I got about doing this? I would like to have a mouse controlled dial prop that is linked to a specific variable. My first thought was something similar to the mouse-controlled throttle prop but have it rotate on a different axis. How would I be able to make it rotate discretely like a selection knob? Any thoughts would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
