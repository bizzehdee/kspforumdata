Just a direct, clean change of orientation. Any coordinate system will do as long as I know which one it is. I found a Translate() method in the Vessel class, but I didn\u0027t find any corresponding Orient() method or whatever, the SetRotation() method seems to affect angular velocity rather than angular position, and hacking into the vessel.transform and vessel.rigidbody stuff did not yield any results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T14:59:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this is possible when a craft is loaded and being controlled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for this is that there is no \u0022vessel\u0022 transform to rotate, rather the vessel is made up of the individual parts and the root part (or control from here part) is the orientation used for anything \u0022vessel\u0022. That\u0027s why the navball orientation changes when you use the \u0022control from here\u0022 option, all you are doing is changing the master part on the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you \u0022teleport\u0022 rotate a part, KSP is going to treat that as a force on the part and rip your craft to shreads as all the other parts did not move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, probably, maybe it will go kraken instead or something, but not what you intend I don\u0027t think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khatharr","CreatedById":102687,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T05:20:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to generate a set of part coords and use that to re-orient everything at the same time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean like use the root as the origin and get trans/rot data for the other parts, then run a rotation matrix like.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daid","CreatedById":32171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T08:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the easiest solution would be to put the vessel on rails, rotate it (as then you have a single transform that defines the position and rotation) and then put it off rails again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
