If you just have a C# project and some NUnit tests, it is actually pretty straightforward to get travis set up and running. The only issue is making the DLLs from KSP_Data/Managed available to Travis. I do it by having it download an encrypted archive from AWS (encrypted so that I\u0027m not distributing copyright material...) containing the DLLs. You can then put the encryption key as an environment variable in the Travis settings, where it\u0027s hidden from all but the project owner (as long as you\u0027re careful not to echo it in the log files!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, running any integration tests on a CI server that require KSP to be running is out of the question. Instead, I have a bunch of python scripts to test the mod with KSP running on my local machine: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/krpc/krpc/tree/master/service/SpaceCenter/test\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/krpc/krpc/tree/master/service/SpaceCenter/test\u003C/a\u003E Very useful to spot when Squad change the APIs!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
