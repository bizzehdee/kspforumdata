With ModuleAnimateGeneric, the animation plays till the end then reverses. I can\u0027t get this behaviour, I only get it to play to the end then it jumps back to the beginning and plays from there. How can I do this in my own module?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso parts like landing gears and legs: while in the editor, how can I get parts to jump directly to the end and beginning without playing the whole animation?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T15:09:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have not done significant work with ModuleAnimateGeneric, but one of the Play() methods should accept a float between 0 and 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a percent on the animation so if you can set the module to 1, it should jump to the animation fully complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should also be able to use a -1 somewhere to play the animation in reverse, but I can\u0027t remember the method name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully someone who knows more will chime in shortly, but hopefully that at least narrows down where you need to look.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"royals","CreatedById":148935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T19:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooked at firespitter\u0027s source and if I use AnimationState\u0027s time and speed variables, I can set time to 1 and speed to -1 to reverse it.
