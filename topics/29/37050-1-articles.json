This object should at least consist of two independently moving meshes. One mesh would remain static and is attached to the rocket while the other mesh would be the actual control surface and would move according to steering input. I saw that has already been realised with the AV8 winglet. So i took the part.cfg from the AV8 winglet and just replaced the model file. But i really have no idea how to set up the animation for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a model consisting of multiple parts and put some animation to it. The animation is obviously imported correctly imported into ksp (it is played at the beginning of the rocket start) but there is not any steering related movement on my part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp is much appreciated \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
