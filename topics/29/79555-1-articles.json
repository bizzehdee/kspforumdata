While it\u0027s not directly related to KSP, the Unity Answers forum can be a great resource. Just make sure what you\u0027re looking at is in C#. You might want to have a look at this link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/\u003C/a\u003E It has a load of information on C# that you can pick and choose from, though there are some differences between KSP scripting and straight C#, such as the need to use KSP fields, KSP events, etc. There\u0027s also this link on the KSP wiki that is somewhat limited and some bits are a little out of date but some of the stuff can give you an idea: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Community_API_Documentation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Community_API_Documentation\u003C/a\u003E And if you\u0027re stuck on something, this KSP forum page can be very helpful too: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/7544-The-official-unoffical-help-a-fellow-plugin-developer-thread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/7544-The-official-unoffical-help-a-fellow-plugin-developer-thread\u003C/a\u003E.
