The animations have all been uploaded fine to unity as far as I can tell but I need a way for them to be recognized by KSP. The default animation module ModuleAnimateGeneric follows the event sequence of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E state1-\u0026gt;animation1-\u0026gt;state2-\u0026gt;animation2-\u0026gt;state1 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe animation event sequence that I need is more like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E state1-\u0026gt;animation1-\u0026gt;state2-\u0026gt;animation2-\u0026gt;state3-\u0026gt;animation3-\u0026gt;state4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Is this possible using the default modules, chaining ModuleAnimateGeneric somehow? If not is there someone else\u0027s module which addresses this? I checked the stock drill for how it works as it appears to have 3 states and 3 animations but the second animation seems tied to the ModuleResourceHarvester, which is not what I want (maybe i can utilize this though, collecting 0 resources?).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T22:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could look into the firespitter dll. I\u0027ve never used it but a lot of mods use it for animation. If it\u0027s a science part you may be able to use DMagicScienceAnimateGeneric, which allows you to take multiple samples for your experiments, with a slightly different animation each time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FinalHazard","CreatedById":152403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T08:44:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tested out firespitter and its not quite what I need.
