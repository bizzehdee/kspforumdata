I was wondering if there was a way to disable a KSPAction if the user doesn\u0027t enable a specific feature on the part. As it stands right now, I just have the KSPAction not do anything if the feature wasn\u0027t enabled, but I\u0027d much rather hide it so that a user won\u0027t be confused on why the Action doesn\u0027t work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T04:33:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need to find the BaseAction that the KSPAction generates in your PartModule.Actions list and set that BaseAction.active = false.
