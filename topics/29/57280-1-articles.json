I am taking my first foray into modding KSP! I am integrating the water resource from TAC Life Support into Interstellar so they both use the same water resource. To do such a thing, I need to edit two of Interstellar\u0027s part configs and four of Interstellar\u0027s general plugin configs. I am not writing any compiled code right now nor am I changing or including any art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI first made edits to all the Interstellar configs. Once I got everything working, I took a look at Module Manager. I learned how to make a MM config file and wrote all my changes into one file. I tested out the MM config and it works! So now I\u0027m ready to open up testing to other people. Before I do that, I have a few questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, what do I classify what I created? Is it a plugin? A mod? Basically, when I post this to project board, what am I describing this as? Is it still a plugin if it\u0027s a simple change to another plugin? A plugin of a plugin? Heh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I\u0027m assuming a I need a licence if I post this for other people to use, but what licence should I use? Do I need to consider just the MM, TACLS, and Interstellar licenses since my work is dependent on having all three of these plugins installed? Who am I officially required to give credit to (I want to make sure everyone gets their just due!)? Do I need to include a copy of the license in my download?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, are there any requirements as far as where the download needs to be hosted? Like could I host the .zip from my public dropbox folder?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, since I am not distributing any TACLS, Module Manager, or Interstellar assets, am I required to get permission from any of these plugins\u0027 authors prior to distributing my file? (MM is included in Interstellar\u0027s download, so I don\u0027t need to include anything except my config file.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease note that while some of my questions might sound like I\u0027m trying to get away from having to credit people, but that is the opposite of my intentions! I am simply wanting to feel out the minimum requirements so there are no issues in any similar future work I am doing! I have some ideas for better integration of TACLS and Interstellar and some similar ideas for other mods, such as Kethane. A lot of plugin devs are opening their plugin to other people with hooks and API\u0027s for other people to use. I think this is a great way for me to get into KSP modding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you in advance to everyone that helps me understand this stuff better! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-22T08:02:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2013 08:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eadrom\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-22T09:35:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow, I never considered that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you created is a \u0022Addon\u0022.
