But I can\u0027t seem to get/find the current PotatoRoid texture! It\u0027s not in the directory (the only thing there is squareButton.dds, which is some weird squarish button-things). I\u0027ve opened the model up in blender, and didn\u0027t seem like there was any textures that were embedded in the .mu file.\n\nAnyone have any idea where the asteroid texture is located?"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T04:29:19Z","Content":"If you can track down StarStrider he might know. My guess is that there is some kind of texture hidden away in the asset files and that it is applied in some procedural way."}]}
