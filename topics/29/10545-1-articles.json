Wrong.\n\u003E \n\u003E  The code to actually find and store the vessels, fuel types, and tanks was untouched since I first compiled this monstrosity yesterday.

Many hours later, the GUI is still being a moody unresponsive teenage punk, and the scene transition and part message handler are still baffling arcane nightmares.\n\u003E \n\u003E  Rant over, here\\\u0027s what I\\\u0027ve got now:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![screenshot1sg.jpg](http://img804.imageshack.us/img804/8741/screenshot1sg.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\n For those of you who do not have bionic image enhancing eyes, there are actually two ships in the inky void there.\n\n I think I finally have the ESC menu fail bypassed with a ductape, caramel, and sprinkle combination, but it\\\u0027s so unwieldy I feel like a script kiddie. This is unacceptable as I do many foolish things, but I do not do script kiddie.\n\n I was really hoping to get a basic version out this morning, but that\\\u0027s just not going to happen. I apparently ended one ship\\\u0027s flight by accident, and am very very tired, so I\\\u0027m going to admit defeat for now, and try again tomorrow.\n\nUpdated a bit.\n\n Edit: Just in case anyone wants to see me code in it\\\u0027s current snarled state:\n\n[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/74137297/KISFuelTransferDock.cs](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/74137297/KISFuelTransferDock.cs)\n\nStill doesn\\\u0027t do useful stuff, but the only true bug I could find with this version was that the vessel matrix doesn\\\u0027t clear it\\\u0027s contents when ending/switchinging flights.
