Simply using \u0022Staging.ActivateNextStage()\u0022 isn\u0027t an option unfortunately, since it always stages the active vessel, and there seemingly isn\u0027t any way to feed it a vessel variable. I had high hopes for \u0022vessel.ActionGroups.ToggleGroup(KSPActionGroup.Stage), but it apparently does nothing useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked into a few other, less elegant options, such as iterating through each part in a stage and manually activating it, and while this does work it doesn\u0027t clear out the stage, since KSP thinks that stage is still valid. Deleting the stage after that and redrawing the staging icons also seemingly didn\u0027t work. So far, every alternate method I\u0027ve found of staging a remote vessel comes with it\u0027s own set of serious downsides.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Firov","CreatedById":57445,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T17:06:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill no progress and I\u0027ve tried just about everything I can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, an idea just occurred to me. I\u0027m at work at the moment, and so can\u0027t really investigate, but can\u0027t KOS stage non-active vessels? I seem to recall watching a video of a dual launch that involved simultaneous staging of the active vessel and it\u0027s KOS controlled counterpart, which was flying around 500 meters away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know if it\u0027s remote staging system also leaves empty stages, or if not, how it works?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I get home I\u0027ll investigate this some more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T17:26:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also couldn\u0027t find any helpful code in KSP, since it looks like it was created with only the active vessel in mind.

Well, I guess we can close the case on this one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t find a good way to do this, so I\u0027m just going to stick with manually activating each part in a stage, moving that part to the vessel\u0027s current stage, which removes the visible empty stage, and then using Stage.ActivateNextStage() on the active vessel to remove the invisible empty stage. Not pretty, but it does seem to work. Thanks for the input Faark.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
