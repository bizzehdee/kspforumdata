In theory it could be unlimited, but practically an engine wouldn\u0027t probably have more than 3 or 4. I created a 5 nozzled engine in my mod \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108277-WIP-90-QuizTech-v1-0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EQuizTech\u003C/a\u003E that allows 5 nozzles active or 1 nozzle active modes, but I\u0027d like to add a third option which would toggle a 4 nozzle mode. If there is already a plugin that does this then I\u0027d be just as happy to implement that, but if not, I think it would be worth the exercise in plugin development to try and figure out how to make it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-27T22:51:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2015 10:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greys","CreatedById":57109,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T22:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, there\u0027s a handful of things you\u0027ll need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to consume resources: part.RequestResource(), you can see it in use in a lot of mods, if the mod uses a custom partmodule to consume or generate fuel, this is how they do it, unless they don\u0027t because RequestResource() is really annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to work with transforms: as I expect you\u0027re familiar with, the thrustTransform of each engine bell is responsible for orienting the particle system and representing the thrust\u0027s position, and another transform is used for gimballing the thrust transform, you\u0027re going to need to replicate all of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to apply a force: Best thing I can point you to for that is ModuleRCSFX \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/NathanKell/ModuleRCSFX/blob/master/Source/ModuleRCSFX.cs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/NathanKell/ModuleRCSFX/blob/master/Source/ModuleRCSFX.cs\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know it\u0027s code myself, but it\u0027s relatively small and simple, and it\u0027s made by some of the best modders in KSP so it should be really good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELearn how to take values from cfg files, I don\u0027t have a good example for this but it shouldn\u0027t be too hard to find\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once you know all that you\u0027ll be able to replicate the old ModuleEngine, not sure how the mode thing works but others can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a faster conversation you could come to IRC://IRC.Esper.net/KSPModders and chat with a lot of knowledgable people more directly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T23:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info!
