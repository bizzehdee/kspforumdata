I think I found a nice approach to that but was not able to make it work. Maybe someone here knows how to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a new Unity Project with a new C# file in the Asset Folder. I decorated the class in there with the [ExecuteInEditMode] flag and created the OnGUI method. With this approach I can now see the UI in Unity when I click the play button in the scene Screen. The problem I have is, that I did not found a way to import the HighLogic class from KSP to this empty project, to do the usual GUI.skin = HighLogic.Skin in the beginning of the OnGUI method. I tried to copy the Assembly-CSharp from KSP_Data to the Assets/Plugin/X86 folder, but this did not work. When I now hit the play button I can see Errors in the console, that tell me, that no compiler was found for the assembly. Does someone know, how I can tell Unity, that this assembly should not be compiled, but only be loaded?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen this works I could create the basic layout including colors, margins, borders, padding from Unity with hard coded placeholder texts. After that I would simply copy all the code to my plugin and replace the placeholder with live data from my PartModule.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T01:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to use the same version of unity as KSP 1.0.2 uses, which I think you can find out by looking at the properties of the UnityEngine.dll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think you have to put it in Assets/Plugin\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Es\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E/x86/Assembly-CSharp.dll.
