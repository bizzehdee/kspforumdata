Now, the first joint is massively bended and unstable, while the second one is strong like hell (but both use the same force/spring/whatever values).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFine... this can be explained with the \u0022lower mass == weaker\u0022. But: is it just the relation of those masses or is it the absolute mass as well that\u0027s influencing\u00A0the strength??\u00A0... and what I don\u0027t understand: why is the rigidBody.mass 1 for both parts? and... which mass is now the relevant one? how can I find it? (I need it, if I want to set the new \u0022massScale\u0022 correctly)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd... massScale... does it help, to set massScale and connectedMassScale to let\u0027s say 10 ? or is just the relation between those masses interesting?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n... do further child/parent objects of the 2 connected object also have an influence on the joint?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be nice if we could answer some questions about joints, now that we got a new Unity version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rudolf Meier","CreatedById":176740,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-22T19:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\noh... now I see why all masses are 1 ... they seem to initialize only after a while...
