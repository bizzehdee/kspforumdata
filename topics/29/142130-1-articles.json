First time modder here. I\u0027ve been writing a mod that will track the details of all your launches, times, costs, weights, stages, telemetry, recovery, destruction, etc. I want to allocate Science, Reputation and Funds earned to a given flight. Costs is easy, and I log the costs to the flight at launch. I can calculate recovery values as well, and Contract Completion values. What\u0027s blocking me is Progression contracts. You know the ones, \u0022You have set a new record...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can hook up to OnFundsChanged and look for \u0022Progression\u0022 types, and calculate against the previous funds and work it out from there, but that feels...bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried hooking up to OnProgressReached, and using Speed as an example, I know that the award if 80,000 funds, and split into 5 payments. That gives me 16,000 funds per record. BUT I get 9,600 funds per record. So what\u0027s the formula to go from the 80,000 to the 9,600?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
