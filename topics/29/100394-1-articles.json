I\u0027m a UI designer and frontend web developer, but completely new to modding games. I spend so much time in KSP though, I can\u0027t help but notice some UI tweaks I\u0027d like to try out.\n\nI have some development experience, though mostly with web languages. Are there any tips or tutorials on doing a mod that touches the UI of the game itself? Even just the ability to replace underlying image assets would be perfect, but I wasn\u0027t able to find anything obvious by hunting through the directories of the game folder and couldn\u0027t find any mods I could base my work off. Alternatively, are there any developers who\u0027d like to team up with a designer to try a GUI mod out?"},{"CreatedByName":"Orum","CreatedById":97814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T14:45:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Are there any tips or tutorials on doing a mod that touches the UI of the game itself?

If you want to go above and beyond what TextureReplacer can do, it still might be a good place to start code-wise."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T15:48:28Z","Content":"I did not really look into it before but I doubt you can do it easily. The stock UI is done with ezgui and as far as I know you can\u0027t insert, move or edit stuff easily.\n\nI am not even sure there are many mods that uses ezGUI for their UI. Maybe Lazor System, I can\u0027t look at its code right now so I can\u0027t check. KSPAPIExtensions play a bit with ezgui for its [tweakable](https://github.com/Swamp-Ig/KSPAPIExtensions/blob/master/Source/Tweakables/UIPartActionFloatEdit.cs) but you ll need to understand how it works.\n\nTLDR version : it is a pain to do.\n\nBut I\u0027d be pleased it someone proved me wrong ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
