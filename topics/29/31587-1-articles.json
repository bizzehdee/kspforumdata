I\u0027ve downloaded the latest Unity and PartTools .20 I\u0027ve followed the readme and the YouTube tutorial C7 made for .15 along with reading a more recent .18 tutorial. I believe I have everything setup - including setting the GameData directory through the new usage of the Tools menu in Unity. My model is a simple cylinder with a texture applied and exported as a FBX file. It shows up fine in Unity. I set the material shader to KSP Diffuse and made sure the texture is assigned. I created a new empty game object and assigned the PartTools component to it. I set the model name and path as well as choosing MBM for the material. But upon clicking \u0022Write\u0022 the only thing exported is the model.mu file. The MBM material file isn\u0027t being created. I\u0027m not sure what I\u0027ve missed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to be thorough I went ahead and created a simple part.cfg file. Actually, I just copied the Squad file for the basic fuel tank and just changed the name to match my part - just to see if I can get it to show up in the VAB. It shows up in the list of parts on the Propulsion tab as expected. But it\u0027s \u0022invisible.\u0022 If the model loaded I have no idea as there\u0027s no texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHelp?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fiddlestyx","CreatedById":57329,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T01:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you changing \u0022Texture Format\u0022 to MBM \u003Cstrong\u003EAND\u003C/strong\u003E checking \u0022Convert Texture\u0022?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfjohnny5","CreatedById":64610,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T01:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, as that\u0027s no longer an option with the new .20 Part Tools:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22466/Unity1.PNG\u0022 alt=\u0022Unity1.PNG\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfjohnny5","CreatedById":64610,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T14:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just tested it on a fresh install on a completely different machine.
