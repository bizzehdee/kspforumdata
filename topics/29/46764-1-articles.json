In order to do this, I need to disable the game\u0027s built in physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know I could save part positions every frame, then on the next one, revert them and calculate my own physics, but clearly this wouldn\u0027t allow for any performance enhancements! What I need is a way to disable it altogether, so that the calculations are not performed at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to do this? Would simply setting PhysicsSignificance=0 to every part do the job, albeit hackishly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
