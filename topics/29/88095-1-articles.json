If you are in the same 1,000km (at 100m/s) orbit from our first example above the equator of a body that is spinning at a speed that the ground at the equator is traveling at 25m/s due to spin, your GetSrfVelocity will either be 75m/s if the orbit is in the same direction as the body\u0027s spin, or 125m/s if the orbit is traveling against the spin of the body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVessel.transform.rotation: This is the rotation of your vessel as compared to the virtual box that the Kerbol system exists within, it does not have any relation to either of the Get Velocities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pixartist","CreatedById":67922,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-21T14:20:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I realized that now.
