I have a listener KSPField for whoever\u0027s occupying the pod, and it\u0027ll register the Kerbal as in the pod, so I know that the Kerbal has made it into the part.protoModuleCrew[0] slot, for what it\u0027s worth. I know that *something* must be happening when the vessel switches back and forth that causes the KerbalPortraitGallery to repopulate, but for the life of me I can\u0027t seem to figure out what it is, or how to activate/call it after a teleportation.\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0Does anyone with a better knowledge of how the KerbalPortraitGallery operates, or what all occurs on switching to a vessel,\u00A0be willing to explain to me where I need to do what and how to make this \u0022do\u0022?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
