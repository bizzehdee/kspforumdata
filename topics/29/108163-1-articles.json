But simply when you do experiments instead of getting straight science you just get the data and need to processes it into science. So to make that mechanic work I would need to make the RnD Centre into a big Science Lab or make a new building that was a science lab that you can put scientist in just like the Stock Lab. The same mechanic of if you processes the data in a lab in the same situation/planet in a stock lab you will get more bang for your buck. But this makes it so you would have to put it into a lab. A little more realistic for those of us who like that."}]}
