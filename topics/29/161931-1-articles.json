I\u0027m part of CEBULA Translations - small group that is currently translating KSP to polish (90% of the game is done at the moment) and we have problem with inflection of words. ( \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInflection\u003C/a\u003E .\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENouns in polish \u003C/a\u003E) I can explain that in (more than) few words. In english there is only one word for Kerbin - Kerbin. But in polish there is Kerbin, Kerbinu, Kerbinem. Russians have similar grammar to polish, and since russian language is one of the official languages of KSP, we as team are wondering is there any chance that Squad added some strings for inflection of russian words (for example \u041A\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0438\u043D, \u041A\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0438[\u043D\u0443]). And if they did, is there any chance Squad could help small team for Poland trying to make KSP available for everyone that isn\u0027t fluent enough in english to comfortable play this amazing game. Or maybe someone who had been working on russian version can tell us who they solved this problem. Sorry for mistakes, and cheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-12T12:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you have a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://lingoona.com/cgi-bin/grammar#l=en\u0026amp;oh=1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Elingoona help\u003C/a\u003E ?
