I created a simple 3m nosecone in Lightwave 9 with a texture (LW doesn\u0027t export .DAE so I had to find a workaround involving exporting as .OBJ, importing that into Poser9, and then exporting out of that as .DAE). I downloaded and installed the free version of Unity 2019, and successfully loaded my .DAE file. Then I had to find and download the KSP PartTools package. Everything seems to work as expected...except for the fact that once the KSP PartTools are installed there is no \u0022write\u0022 option. Nor does it ask for me to choose a KSP installation directory. Under \u0022Part Tools (script)\u0022 all I have are \u0022Model name\u0022, \u0022File Path\u0022, \u0022Production\u0022, \u0022Texture format\u0022. No \u0022write\u0022 option, no file format options, either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically I am stuck at working out how the heck I manage to get this model out of Unity\u00A0 - without that \u0022write\u0022 function I can\u0027t do anything. I\u0027ve been sitting here for 2 hours wondering where I went wrong following a YouTube tutorial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas where I went wrong?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-29T21:43:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShot in the dark here - KSP (1.7) uses Unity 2107.1.3p - you might try this version instead. I don\u0027t think it matters but check that you have the 170 version of part tools - I think all that happens if you have a earlier version is you miss out on some of the newer shaders - but could be wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
