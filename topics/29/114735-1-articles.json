Unlike other textures in the game which scale, .SetIcon picks out a set number of pixels. (I can\u0027t remember the number, I\u0027ll use 20 pixels big in this post.)\n\nSo if your texture you load with string is 40 pixels by 40 pixels, you have 4 different staging icons at pixel location 0,0 0,20 20,0 and 20,20\n\nI didn\u0027t get much beyond that though, so good luck with your work.\n\nD."},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T20:44:05Z","Content":"**[MOD - Moved to Plugin Development Help and Support subforums]**"},{"CreatedByName":"Antares_Insomnious","CreatedById":147253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T19:40:02Z","Content":"Ok, that makes a lot more sense, Thank you.\n\nI haven\u0027t had a chance to mess around with this since I posted, but am looking into it today.\n\nI was wondering if I should use Modular Manager because I\u0027m not adding any parts, I am actually just making it where I can do certain things in game with the staging area.\n\nI am completely new to making game plugins and I\u0027ve gone through a few tutorials, but couldn\u0027t find anything in depth like what I am trying to do, which probably means there isn\u0027t a plugin out there like this which is a good thing because I don\u0027t want to reinvent the wheel if you know what I mean.\n\nAnyhow, I\u0027ll look into playing around with the things you mentioned.\n\nthanks again."}]}
