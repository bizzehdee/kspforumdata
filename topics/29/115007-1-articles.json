See more details [on the wiki](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Module#ModuleAnimateGeneric). I don\u0027t think you need C# experience for that since everything you can change is in the config of the part. I think you\u0027ll have more informations in the \u0027Modelling anTexturing\u0027 section than here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T07:25:39Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 07:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by simon56modder**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T07:44:18Z","Content":"You don\u0027t need C#, you can animate in unity.
