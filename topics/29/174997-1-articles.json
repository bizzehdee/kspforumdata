Whenever I unlocked a new engine, I added lines to my spreadsheet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou see, this is a lot of work.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd anytime a new KSP version is released, I have to check if some values changed.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI did this also for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS parts, which is even more work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I started to look into the part files.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSure I can parse these files, using python or something. But, there is ModuleManager which can patch parts during loadtime. And I don\u0027t want to reinvent the wheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, which is the best way to get a database of all installed parts (stock and addons) and even consider ModuleManager?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs there an library/API which would get me the needed information?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf so, I guess this cannot be achieved \u0022offline\u0022 but must be triggered from within KSP as an addon, due to ModuleManager.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peteletroll","CreatedById":144573,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-17T06:18:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModuleManager generates a ModuleManager.ConfigCache file that contains all the info you need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-17T06:19:46Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2018 06:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by peteletroll\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-17T09:59:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E has a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager/blob/master/ModuleManager/MMPatchLoader.cs#L127\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecallback\u003C/a\u003E for code to be executed after the patching so you could have your code generate whatever you need (csv, json, xml,...) or your could write an addon that runs on the main menu, or insert itself late in the loading process\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
