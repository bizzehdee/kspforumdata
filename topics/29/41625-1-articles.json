In addition this parts should also have a game object in its model which changes the directional navigation when the ship is controlled from this part. The preferred solution would be to make a command module but I do not no what unity game object needs to be added for this. Instead I have been using docking port partmodule in combination with the \u0027dockingNode\u0027 game object. Unfortunately this makes all types of undesired options be displayed when using this part, which is somewhat inelegant.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T17:41:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave a look at your part.cfg and compare them to other command pods.

Thanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually tried that before, but somehow it didn\u0027t changed the orientation of the navball to the part. This is why I started using the docking port in the first place and which is why I asked this question, but trying it again i have no issues. Must have messed up something the first time around.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
