The numbers I saw for other worlds with atmospheres looked about right, too, so that\u0027s the one I\u0027m using until someone who has more time digs through all of the new atmosphere values."},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:56:43Z","Content":"CelestialBody.atmosphereScaleHeight is gone.
