I landed on Duna, but every time I try to reload my game it will crash to desktop. I\u0027ve tried Hyperediting another vessel to the same place and I can land it and mess around just fine, but the game will crash if I attempt to reload again. Since my version is modded, I thought I would post it here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help with this problem would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByfeqZn-sKzUM2haWWFJcmNkUWc/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eerror log\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByfeqZn-sKzUM2haWWFJcmNkUWc/edit?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoutput log\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
