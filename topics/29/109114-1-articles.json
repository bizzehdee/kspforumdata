I believe I know about 80% of the things you can do with a .cfg file, so that is the perfect amount of knowledge for starting the 100 times more difficult process of creating a plugin.\n\nFirst project:\n\n-I know that the stock game, and FAR, *can recognize whether a part is inside a cargobay/fairing and is shielded from the airflow. Is it possible to add another property to those parts?: Physics significance 0*\n\n*I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m using the correct vocabulary, but I want shielded parts to be ignored for physics calculations. No more oscillating fuel tanks inside cargobays, but a rigid physicsless part.* \n\nSecond project: \n\n-For a career mod, I want to restrict the amount of LiquidFuel (or any other resource for that matter) that you can \u0027buy\u0027 from the KSC. \n\nMy first idea *was to create a resource pool for the Kerbal Space Center that the player draws from with each launch. When it hits zero, the player simply cannot launch a rocket with that resource onboard.*\n\nMy second, *was to force all rockets to start on the launchpad with zero resources. The player would then have to transfer resources through a launch clamp. The clamp has a persistent resource pool that it can draw from, much like Science or Reputation points.*\n\nMy third idea *would be convert Resources into something from the Scenario {Funding} in Save files, so you\u0027d have to basically \u0027buy\u0027 LiquidFuel by spending 300 \u0027LiquidFuel\u0027 points. Dropping extraplanetary resources on the KSC for recovery could replenish these points.*\n\nMy final, and most cherished idea, *is to create a \u0027Resource\u0027 cost for all resources. This could be a very simple step of converting the \u0027cost = x\u0027 line in the resources.cfg file into \u0027cost = x resource points\u0027.*\n\nSo, my dear experienced C# wizards, how do I go about writing plugins for these mods? \n\nPlease do not simply direct me to the various outdated tutorials lying around. I currently have zero C# knowledge, have yet to install Visual Basic and learning an entire language just for a small project somehow doesn\u0027t sound right."},{"CreatedByName":"MatterBeam","CreatedById":133334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T17:19:16Z","Content":"It doesn\u0027t sound right because it\u0027s the only way to do it, it seems."},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T21:49:31Z","Content":"For your first idea, this is not how physicsless part work. They won\u0027t behave as a rigid object. They\u0027re just skipped when it comes down to coriolis, gravitational, etc forces to be applied.

I was supposed to search for something that ***unloads*** the vessels contained, making the vessels essentially dissapear from the physics calculations.\n\nI found one mod which does this: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-3-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/88933-0-90-0-Hangar-v2-3-1)\n\nHowever, it hasn\u0027t been updated for 1.0.2, won\u0027t do so for a long time, and contains lots of \u0027peripheral\u0027 accessories in addition to the code that allows the Hangars to unload vessels.\n\nIt might be possible to apply that code to regular cargo bays."},{"CreatedByName":"Vormav","CreatedById":146091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T17:25:53Z","Content":"I\u0027ve been thinking about starting a project similar to your #1.
