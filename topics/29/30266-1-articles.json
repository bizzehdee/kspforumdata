I\u0027ve been looking through the source for Actions On The Fly, but it\u0027s quite cryptic to me at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, the only basic examples I can find for plugin creation focus more on actual part modeling and cfg editing, and a single elementary example of how to inject a line into the log. These examples all assume that the reader is already completely fluent in C#, and seem to be centered around giving a basis for understanding the simplest interaction with the game\u0027s methods, but I need a little more than that to go on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, the functions I\u0027m trying to create use a simple window with a few buttons to offer up the contents of a text file, and to display the current assigned action groups. There\u0027s a lot more expansion I have planned, but for now I want to keep the goals simple. I learn best when I have a goal in mind, and I don\u0027t want to discourage myself by biting off more than I can chew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I need is some kind of basic template that uses less cryptic names so I can gain some understanding of what does what, at which point I will begin to understand how the syntax works. I already have some JS and VB.net experience, so some of what I\u0027m seeing makes sense already; I\u0027m just too inexperienced to understand this well enough to see how it works in context with the game engine. If there isn\u0027t some kind of teaching template out there, does anybody at least know of a simple plugin that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDoes a simple display of information in a custom window in-game\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOffers the source in the download, and\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHas decent commenting to help the reader understand what\u0027s going on\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI appreciate very much any help to get me fired off in the right direction (so to speak)! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T18:24:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBoth Mechjeb and Kerbal Engineer link to their source code in the first post of their thread.
