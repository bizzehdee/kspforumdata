I have had the problem before due to a spelling mistake but everything seems to check out this time. \n\nThere is one line in the code for each node that I don\u0027t really understand which may be a factor - Nodename\n\nFor example you might get \u0022nodeName = node0\\_start\u0022 or \u0022nodeName = node1\\_basicRockets\u0022.... what does the number mean? I have tried changing various names to node2, node3 etc but I have no idea what it does.\n\nAny help gratefully received!"},{"CreatedByName":"cvod","CreatedById":110540,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T23:51:46Z","Content":"This is a problem with the parent module.
