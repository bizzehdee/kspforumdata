I placed all the parts in the correct folder, and put the .dll in the plugins, when i try to use some of the main mechjeb parts, such as the actual mechjeb part and capsule, it says 0 in stock, and that they are not available in this version of KSP. I am certain I have the correct mechjeb version( 1.9.2 ), and oddly enough some of the other mechjeb parts work fine, such as the mechjeb fuel tank and fuel engine. I am running KSP on parallels on a mac, and it works perfectly fine. Any ideas as to whats going on with mechjeb?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"crushedtealc","CreatedById":22699,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T09:04:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei do not seem to have any probs with mechjeb and ive got it running on the new 0.17 (this ones cool its got other planets) version, it might be because before i downloaded the new ksp (0.17) version i had mechjeb on the computer already and instead of downloading a new mechjeb file i instead just copied the file over from the old ksp directory to the new one and works just fine all the parts are good the only this is it seem to find it difficult to transfer from kerbin to other planets but other then that ive got now probs. This probably did not help but i just wanted to say that\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T10:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhich parts, specifically, are greyed-out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, and this should be moved to Addon Requests and Support.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
