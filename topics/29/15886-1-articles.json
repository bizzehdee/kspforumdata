This could be based on the heat values of the ram intake which I\\\u0027m using for testing, but once I go on timewarp, the heat rises over that value and the part explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I doing something wrong? Is heat not modeled on-rails? Both?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Duck","CreatedById":1156,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T23:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen the ship is off-rails, the parts radiate away heat to the atmosphere or space and also conduct heat to cooler neighboring parts. Presumably the heat radiated (conducted) is proportional to the difference between the part temperature and the ambient temperature (neighboring part temperature). So when the part gets hot enough it is radiating/conducting away as much heat as you are adding each time step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you engage time warp, physics, including heat transfer, is no longer simulated, and so the part is no longer cooling off. So your code increases the temperature until the part explodes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
