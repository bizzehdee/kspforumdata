My current methods seem fine until the vessel is in motion on the ground. When moving the position appears to drift backward in relation to the vessel orientation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried using thrust queries, and averaging the ThrustTransform positions. Both methods have the drift. I\u0027ve looked at FloatingOrigin, but the offsets I get from it don\u0027t make sense to correct the drift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat am I missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
