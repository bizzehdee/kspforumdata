My Unity-specific expertise is minimal, and I\u0027m not entirely sure what I specifically need to look for.\n\n-MOARdV"},{"CreatedByName":"xEvilReeperx","CreatedById":75857,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T14:27:31Z","Content":"Why not use two animation clips?

They are on for every frame, so when I set normalizedTime and normalizedSpeed to 0 (which I already do), the animation is visible, because the lights are on in every frame of the animation.

Probably not applicable in this instance"}]}
