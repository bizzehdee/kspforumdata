The window is handled using a Mechjeb DisplayModule. I got this working well and can change the number of control points dynamically just fine. The window resizes itself larger to accommodate more points, but does not shrink itself when the number of points is decreased (see image). This is persistent across closing and restarting KSP. Looking at the code for custom info windows in Mechjeb there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything special to make them shrink, so I\u0027m confused why mine only grow.
