However, I do not know how to add a resource to the game, and a search through the game folders has been fruitless, as none of my other mods provide any insight to how resources are added. Does anyone know a quick way to add resources?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wasml","CreatedById":120438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T01:31:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts as simple as adding a config file for the resource. Take a look at the Community Resource Pack (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83007\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83007\u003C/a\u003E) for examples. In fact you might check for water in those files - it may already be there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketSquid","CreatedById":152665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T22:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay. I assumed as much, but I saw several other mods that added resources but did not have any configs other than part configs. I realize now that this is probably due to some sort of dependency\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: On further inspection, it actually has water as well as several other resources my mod will probably use.
