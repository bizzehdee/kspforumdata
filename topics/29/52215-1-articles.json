(The one shown by Scott Manly as being, \u0022not OP\u0022.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you could disable the time acceleration feature and add in different kinds of warp drive, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou could, in theory, make it so that you never actually \u0027need\u0027 time acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have an inter system warp drive. This could be good enough to get you to say....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emenmas in five minutes? Also, have it use normal fuel, but at a massive rate, so you have to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esort of feather your use of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have an inter planetary warp drive. This should be able to get you to the near planets\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein 5 or so minutes, and out to the farthest in like....20 minutes. I could see this using nuclear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epower to run.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could then have an inter stellar warp drive. This could have the capability to get you to the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efar planets in 5-7 minutes. This would, of course, need to be run off anti-matter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, IMHO, would be do-able, and playable. Not exactly the fastest time from planet to planet, but\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea 20 minute round trip would be reasonable. Sure, that is alot of flying around, but add in a chat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efunction, and you have a decently functional multiplayer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you did this, it might be a good idea to create a sort of....anti matter storage container part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne that allows a player to transfer their stored anti matter to it, and to take anti matter from it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be put on a space station that orbits kerbin or other planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be player locked, or a server bank, of sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could see older players offering a sort of \u0027towing\u0027 service to newer players. Have the newer players\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edock up onto their ship, and then have the older players warp drive them out to the farther planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would allow newer players to still get out to the farther planets, while giving older players\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esomething to shoot for. (That is, a ship that can get a docked ship to another planet. (and back, if \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe player is feeling kind...and doesnt want to strand noobs out in space....but...who would want to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edo that? -shifty eyes- \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust my thoughts on how I would try for multiplayer....if i was a coder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T09:51:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E- KSP is about orbital mechanics. Its pretty much the only challenge and yes, that also means waiting for the correct time to burn. =\u0026gt; You need timewarp, or you could play some other generic space \u0022simulation\u0022 (action like \u0022press w to play forward\u0022) game. Ofc its fine for a mod to do sth like that, but i doubt there would be a high share of players playing it... since it just isn\u0027t ksp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You should you try to get rid of time warp? We have a bunch of solutions for it, and while i haven\u0027t found the time to play KMP yet, afaik they did handle it as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ljdp","CreatedById":92019,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T17:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImo, multiplayer in ksp should be more of a co-op experience, I wouldn\u0027t want to play multiplayer with more than one other person anyway, at max 3. Rather than the other player flying multiple ships you cooperatively work on the same ship (occasionally controlling two ships for docking etc), then you just sync time warp with the other player. I\u0027d also like to see multiplayer in the VAB, it would be cool if your friend builds the lower stage while you\u0027re building the upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKMP does have an interesting solution to time warp, but it does seem a little convoluted. I can\u0027t imagine squad going that route if they ever did implement multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T17:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55835-Kmp-0-22-wip-alpha\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55835-Kmp-0-22-wip-alpha\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
