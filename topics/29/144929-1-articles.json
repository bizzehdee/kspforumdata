But I can\u0027t seem to find anything that tells me how well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, nevermind. I found a useful number, the part\u0027s Rad Flux. \u00A0It basically tells how much energy is being radiated off the part. \u00A0If you have ModuleActiveRadiator on the part, once you activate it, that part becomes like a heat sponge and the rad flux will drastically increase based on how much heat it\u0027s getting rid of. \u00A0It\u0027s a negative number but, this is a pretty good indication of just how much work the radiator is performing. \u00A0If you deactivate it, the rad flux goes closer to 0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust in case anyone else needs this info.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-31T19:39:54Z\u0022 title=\u002207/31/2016 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
