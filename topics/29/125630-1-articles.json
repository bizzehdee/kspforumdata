It has a config property called EVAOnly or simiar... When I tried setting it to false on the Mk1 command pod, I didn\u0026#39;t notice any change in-game. Can anyone tell me what this does?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SixHourDays","CreatedById":140711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T01:51:45Z","Content":"\nI don\u0026#39;t know what evaOnlyStorage affects.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I can tell you that what you\u0026#39;re irritated with (pointless EVA\u0026#39;s to move science data around) is something I\u0026#39;ll be solving in my upcoming mod, [B]WhichData[/B]!
