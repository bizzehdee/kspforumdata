It works perfectly fine for the Inflight Navball (The one you see on the map, EVA and flight) however the one in the IVA doesn\u0027t seem to be the navball gameobject I am interfering with for that. After some search on how other plugins manipulate IVA Screens they all refere to the InternalModules so I went ahaed and tried the same thing as I did for the normal Navball and talked to the\u00A0 InternalNavBall gameobject however that\u0027s not what I want (for testing purposes I just simply tried to change the prograde marker color.. however it is not changing) so I guess the GameObject I am looking for is neither the NavBall nor\u00A0 InternalNavBall.. Any Ideas which one the NavBall is that is rendered in IVA?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
