For example, I know that \u0022Effects/fx\\_smokeTrail\\_light\u0022 is accessible, but I\u0027d quite like to know what else is available and would quite like to be able to use the water splash particle. Anyone have any ideas on how to get the names, or have a list? I had a look, but didn\u0027t find much that was of any help. Engine smoke, flameout etc. are obviously easy enough as they\u0027re named in configs. Others not so much.\n\nMany thanks!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T22:00:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 10:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by lo-fi**"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T21:54:21Z","Content":"List as follows:\n\n    Dust PuffemitengineOnArmexhaustFlame_blueFire TrailsFireballfx_exhaustFlame_blue(Clone)fx_exhaustFlame_blue_small(Clone)fx_exhaustFlame_white_tiny(Clone)fx_exhaustFlame_yellow(Clone)fx_exhaustFlame_yellow_tiny(Clone)fx_exhaustSparks_flameout(Clone)fx_exhaustSparks_yellow(Clone)fx_gasBurst_white(Clone)fx_gasJet_b_x-fx_gasJet_b_x\u002Bfx_gasJet_bl_z-fx_gasJet_bl_z\u002Bfx_gasJet_br_z-fx_gasJet_br_z\u002Bfx_gasJet_l_y-fx_gasJet_l_y\u002Bfx_gasJet_r_y-fx_gasJet_r_y\u002Bfx_gasJet_t_x-fx_gasJet_t_x\u002Bfx_gasJet_tl_z-fx_gasJet_tl_z\u002Bfx_gasJet_tr_z-fx_gasJet_tr_z\u002Bfx_smokeTrail_light(Clone)fx_smokeTrail_medium(Clone)fx_waterSurfaceJetEngineks1_emitks25_emitksX_emitLES_emitliquidEngineMiniMassiveBoosterMetal BitsorbitalNukeCoreorbitalNukeLFOorbitalNukeMONOParticlesRAPIERshockExhaust_blueshockExhaust_blue_smallshockExhaust_red_smallShockwaveSize2LFBSize3AdvancedEngineSize3EngineClustersmallRadialEngineSmokeSolid Fuel ChunksSRB_large_emitSRB_large_emit2turboFanEngineWater Surface SplashwaterColummwaterSpray\n\nCode for getting, courtesy of xEvilReeperx:\n\n        [KSPAddon(KSPAddon.Startup.Flight, true)]    class DumpShaderList : MonoBehaviour    {        void Start()        {            //particles            HashSet PA = new HashSet();            FindObjectsOfType().ToList().ForEach(sh =\u003E PE.Add(sh.name));            Resources.FindObjectsOfTypeAll().ToList().ForEach(sh =\u003E PE.Add(sh.name));            Debug.Log(\u0022{0} loaded shaders \u0022 \u002B PE.Count);            List PAsorted = new List(PE); PAsorted.Sort();            using (System.IO.StreamWriter file = new System.IO.StreamWriter(KSPUtil.ApplicationRootPath \u002B \u0022/PA.txt\u0022))                foreach (var sh in PAsorted)                    file.WriteLine(sh);        }    }\n\nBased on an unrelated answer [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93079-list-of-loaded-shaders?highlight=particles)\n\nAlthough that still doesn\u0027t give me everything.
