Once added, it gets loaded into the persistence data structure and will remain in your sfs file even as it gets resaved and rewritten.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenarioModules have one main difference from PartModules though. Because they are made to run on any scene, you must specify a target scene in which your module will run. Currently, modules can only run on one scene at a time. When a scene starts, the scenario module runner attaches all ScenarioModules that target that scene as a MonoBehaviour on an empty game object in the scene. You can use all MonoBehaviour events (except Awake), and code it in very much the same way you code part modules... Of course, there is no reference to vessel or part, since the module isn\u0027t attached to one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T15:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould these modules be used to generate things like random part break downs and add the ability to repair them in an EVA to all missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr problems caused by random solar flares.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HarvesteR","CreatedById":4,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-05T16:21:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tommygun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tommygun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECould these modules be used to generate things like random part break downs and add the ability to repair them in an EVA to all missions?\u003Cp\u003EOr problems caused by random solar flares.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, there is very little you can\u0027t do with modules.
