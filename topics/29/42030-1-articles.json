You\u0027ve peaked my interest into researching what happens on real life rocket liquid fuel tanks. At first thought, I\u0027m thinking they are designed to empty somewhat in a balanced fashion? I\u0027m picturing small tanks.. Some oxygen, some whatever else, all packed neatly inside the larger rocket part. If that is the case, would real life rockets use something that has a balancing mechanism to it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDang it I hate thinking about stuff like this, now I\u0027m gonna be up all night learning new crap!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
