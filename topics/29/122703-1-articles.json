All attempts to learn what\u0027s new with the Unity5 GUI system always refer to using the Unity editor to spec out the GUI, rather than building one from scratch with your own C# code opening a window, drawing widgets into it, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp until now I\u0027ve been able to write mod code by just linking to the UnityEngine dll to get the API methods, and never even using Unity\u0027s own dev tool - just using only a normal C# development suite. Is that gone now in Unity5? To use their new GUI system do we *have* to use Unity\u0027s editor? I can find no documentation whatsoever on the actual underlying GU API calls to build the GUI from scratch anymore, other than those that are labeled as being \u0022legacy Unity 4\u0022 calls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is currently possible for people to build all the kOS mod\u0027s code from the Github source without any Unity dev environment installed at all - just Visual Studio, SharpDevelop, or whatever C# compiler you like.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T03:20:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 03:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T03:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re talking about doing something like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E                GUILayout.BeginHorizontal(GUILayout.Width(500));\u003Cbr\u003E                GUILayout.Label(\u0022Wind \u0022 \u002B MPFunctions.MStoKTS(MPSailRoutines.windForce)\u002B\u0022 kts.\u0022);\u003Cbr\u003E                GUILayout.Label(\u0022Lat  \u0022 \u002B MPFunctions.GetLat(FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel,1));\u003Cbr\u003E                GUILayout.Label(\u0022Long \u0022 \u002B MPFunctions.GetLong(FlightGlobals.ActiveVessel,1));\u003Cbr\u003E                GUILayout.Label(\u0022Heading \u0022 \u002B MPFunctions.GetHeading(MPSailRoutines.TWR1Vessel));\u003Cbr\u003E                GUILayout.Label(\u0022Body \u0022 \u002B MPFunctions.GetBody());\u003Cbr\u003E                GUILayout.EndHorizontal();\u003Cbr\u003E                GUI.DragWindow();\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDunno if this really answers your question but I\u0027m using Unity 5.1 dll\u0027s in my install of C# and the above works fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T03:33:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Legacy\u0022 UI stuff is still supported, and updated, in 5.x unity versions.

If you start from their pages about the new UI and try to find links from THERE to the scripting API, they only provided links to the legacy version. But if you just go right to the scripting UI and start browsing the classes you do eventually find them. They just failed to link to the relevant part from their page on what changed about the GUI between 4 and 5.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-10T10:43:39Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2015 10:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T11:17:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere was a few post about coding for the new UI on the KSP forum but I can\u0027t search for those from my phone...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
