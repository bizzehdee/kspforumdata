It does work as a charm, except that of course the file does not work, and I don\u0027t know how to check if it already exist and/or create it? also is there a way to have the plugin folder from a variable? I don\u0027t really like hardcoding the plugin forlder in it.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFixed using System.IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E- So the part.cfg file will include the model with the node MODEL{ }, where can I find the path of the path of the mesh to use?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDone with a nice use of regex and the database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I can add the nodes when I weld two parts together, however I haven\u0027t found a way to get the position of the new node. or the position of the second part. I have looked at all the position and original position value without success. I will also need to know that position/rotation value for the MODEL{} stated above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny point toward the class I have to look for or a plugin that already does it would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have looked at the subassembly manager to know how to setup the project so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if there is actually a way to save a Part class to a file directly, it would be even better (if I can choose the save directory)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-05T07:56:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2013 07:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by UbioZur\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UbioZur","CreatedById":72946,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T14:43:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eapparently I am not the only one not knowing how to do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have fixed the writing of the .cfg using the System.IO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have still not found a way to access the GameDatabase for the MODEL and so any link from the part name and the url stored by the database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso not found a way to access the relative transform of the part from it\u0027s parent part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kellven","CreatedById":16971,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-04T06:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, I thought Nexis banned assemblies referencing System.IO way back in .18 from loading.
