I\u0027m too new to really see what\u0027s wrong.\n\nMost tutorials on the web seem out of date, which I suspect might be my problem.\n\nI\u0027ve tried looking at active plugins source code for enlightenment...but many of those projects are so well developed - so complicated - that they can\u0027t really help me.\n\n    using System;using System.Collections.Generic;using System.Linq;using System.Text;using UnityEngine;using KSP.IO;namespace KSP_Konsole{\tpublic class Konsole : MonoBehaviour{\t\tpublic Konsole(){\t\t\tDebug.Log(\u0022KSP_Konsole [\u0022 \u002B this.GetInstanceID().ToString(\u0022X\u0022) \u002B \u0022][\u0022 \u002B Time.time.ToString(\u00220.0000\u0022) \u002B \u0022]: Constructor\u0022);\t\t}\t\t void Awake(){\t\t\tDebug.Log(\u0022KSP_Konsole [\u0022 \u002B this.GetInstanceID().ToString(\u0022X\u0022) \u002B \u0022][\u0022 \u002B Time.time.ToString(\u00220.0000\u0022) \u002B \u0022]: Awake\u0022);\t\t}      }}\n\nI have the same code for \u0022void Start()\u0022, \u0022void OnDestroy()\u0022, and \u0022void Update()\u0022\n\nBut I don\u0027t see the output in the Debug Console (Alt\u002BF12), nor in the Player.log file (I\u0027m on Ubuntu, so output.log doesn\u0027t exist).\n\nThe Player.log shows the game loading my .dll, but that\u0027s the only sign of it. None of these debug messages above are found.\n\nI can post more code if wanted, but seriously it all looks like that above.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T03:09:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ydoow**"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T02:25:29Z","Content":"The issue is that you are not telling KSP when to load your code so KSP never loads that code.\n\nYou need to make your code into a partModule at attach it to a part with ModuleManager or tag it as a KSPAddon so KSP loads it in a scene.\n\nPartModule:\n\nChange\n\n    public class Konsole : MonoBehaviour\n\n to \n\n    public class Konsole : PartModule\n\n and make a moduleManger patch assigned the Konsole partModule to the parts you want.\n\nKSPAddon:\n\nAdd the KSPAddon attribute like so:\n\n    [KSPAddon(KSPAddon.Startup.Flight, false)]public class Konsole : MonoBehaviour\n\n and with the Start.Flight as noted, this class will be loaded at the start of every flight scene.\n\nHope that gets you going,\n\nD."},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T02:35:16Z","Content":"Thanks! Few questions though.\n\nMy desire is to use this plugin without any parts. From what I remember (years ago), extending the class as PartModule meant you had to have a specific part loaded for the plugin to work too. \n\nTo explain a bit, my goal is to have a GUI Window loaded that doesn\u0027t require a part on any vessel (similar to Kerbal Alarm Clock). Do your corrections force me to use a part, or can it be partless?\n\nAttributes are a completely new feature to me. I can research what they are myself, but could someone briefly explain their significance within the context of KSP?\n\nEdit: Rereading your post several times, I think I understand.\n\nI have the option to attach it to a part by Extending it as PartModule OR if I use the attribute AddOn it will load the code without any parts at the next scene. Is that a correct interpretation?\n\nEdit #2: It would appear so. I added the AddOn Attribute to my code as you suggested and things are working now. Thank you very much for the assist.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T03:09:07Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 03:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ydoow**"}]}
