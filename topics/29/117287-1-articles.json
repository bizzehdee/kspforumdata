Each section is a set of parts. One thing I\u0027m having trouble with is checking if a crew member is crewed in one of the parts in the section. Is there a way (that works in the VAB/SPH) to get the specific part a ProtoCrewMember is assigned to (as compared to the AvailablePart or the part prefab)?"}]}
