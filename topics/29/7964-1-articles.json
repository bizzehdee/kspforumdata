The core is the fuel tank, and the coolant...cools the core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to configure them so the core is unusable alone because it overheats too quickly, you would need the coolant. But must i make the coolant a simple strut with high heat dissipation or must I code a new part for it ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe objective is that the core and coolant would not overheat, but if parts like SRB and LFE/LFT are placed on it, boom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you got any ideas ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warringer","CreatedById":328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-11T13:58:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm...
