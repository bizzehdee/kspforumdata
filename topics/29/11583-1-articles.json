The buttons also draw, and are animated, but will not toggle. After 30 seconds, it will crash completely and sometimes take the game with it. \n\nFunny enough, when the part is destroyed, full functionality is restored. \n\nThe console error being thrown is here: [http://pastebin.com/urn2zYix](http://pastebin.com/urn2zYix)\n\nThe latest source code is here: [http://pastebin.com/gTZU77Uh](http://pastebin.com/gTZU77Uh)\n\nIf you want the whole plugin as is, I\\\u0027ve attached it to the thread. (latest source is above)\n\nPic of panel: \n\n\u003E ![VtTRA.png](http://i.imgur.com/VtTRA.png)\n\nThe error led me to audio2 (distress\\_loop) - and I thought it was the underscore in the wav filename. I changed it, but it had no effect. \n\nI was able to clear the error by moving the buttons to the bottom of BeginVertical, but it re-emerged. I can also wrap them Horizontal, and it will \u0027work\u0027 by playing sounds, but having no interactive properties until the part is destroyed. It seems that this occurs after a random time, and the position of the button code appears immaterial, but I am unsure. \n\nRandomly, when MET hit 2:00m, I could drag the window; soon as I hit one of the buttons, the plugin and game crashed. \n\nAppreciate any help or direction. I\\\u0027ve been hitting this with a hammer for two days to no avail. \u003E![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\nMeat"},{"CreatedByName":"Meatsauce","CreatedById":4499,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T22:01:56Z","Content":"bumpity"},{"CreatedByName":"Romfarer","CreatedById":20387,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T08:41:25Z","Content":"urModAudio4 is set to \\\u0027null\\\u0027 when this happens.
