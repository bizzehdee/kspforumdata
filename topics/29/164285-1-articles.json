I cannot change it or set it for other elements. Why? ... I guess it\u0027s called \u0022Asset Labels\u0022 ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) ... (and that\u0027s probably the main question): The tutorial says, that after compiling I will get a \u0022.ksp\u0022 file (at least that\u0027s how I understand it) ... but, I don\u0027t have a .ksp file. Only xml files. And when I try to load it, I get some sort of \u0022format error\u0022 ...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) the function \u0022Awake\u0022 (private) is called on my KSPAddon object... why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRudolf\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rudolf Meier","CreatedById":176740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-10T22:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*hmm* ... ok, I have to drag my \u0022thing\u0022\u00A0(in my case I dragged the \u0022panel\u0022) from the \u0022Hierarchy\u0022 into the \u0022Assets\u0022-Part of the \u0022Project\u0022-window... and then I selected it could set the bundle name... but, it did not export.

For selecting the prefabs that you actually want to export you just drag the object from the hierarchy into a folder in your projects tab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002208ZD6eA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022682\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/08ZD6eA.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere the \u0022Template.Panel\u0022 object has been dragged into the KSPedia Tutorial folder, it\u0027s basically just an image. You do the same for each prefab in your project. But you don\u0027t drag the Canvas object down (KSP has its own Canvases), and you don\u0027t drag anything else down, like the EventSystem, or anything within a prefab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t have to wait until you\u0027re finished with the project to do this. You can drag the prefab down into the folder at any time. When you want to make changes, you select the object from the \u0022Hierarchy\u0022 tab, make whatever changes, then, from the \u0022Inspector\u0022 tab on the right, click the \u0022Apply\u0022 button, this will update the prefab (which is a separate file saved on disk). This button (and the \u0022Select\u0022 and \u0022Revert\u0022 buttons are only available if you have already dragged the object into the assets folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make an asset bundle for export you have to select all of the prefabs you want\u00A0and assign them to an asset bundle or create a new one from the little button in the very bottom right:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022O49yk98.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/O49yk98.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBe sure to only select what you want to export, not things like the Unity Scene file (you can also export asset bundles with other things like sprites, or audio files, but that\u0027s another story).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor question 3, about the Awake method, any class that you start using KSPAddon has to be a Unity MonoBehaviour, which has several methods that are called by name (Awake, Start, Update, etc...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rudolf Meier","CreatedById":176740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-11T17:40:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for the explanations...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok... that\u0027s working now...
