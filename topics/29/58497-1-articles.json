That shouldn\u0027t be very hard since protovessel is mostly similar to the saved text file format and you can compare your vessel with and without the spawning part. Ofc you can also try to only do the necessary loading for a single part, but that means you would have to figure out a lot of stuff by yourself if there isn\u0027t any other mod doing sth similar you can learn from. KAS might be worth a look. Its the only mod i use that adds parts to a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TwistedMexi","CreatedById":95468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T18:55:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo there\u0027s no way to simply call a spawn part(vector), vector being coordinates?
