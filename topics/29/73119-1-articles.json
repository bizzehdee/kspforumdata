What is the solution? Why to I have this click through behavior? I have seen it on other mods too, and then not on others, but I can not get to the bottom of what the differences are? Can someone just tell me - what am I doing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-23T16:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill no one? Afaik / To my little knowledge: There are a bunch of different system like EZ GUI (seems to be used for KSP\u0027s interface), UnityGUI (or however Unitys easy built-in UI system is called; used by most mods) or KSPs other input handling and it would be surprising if they would work together nicely by default. I once came across \u003Cem\u003EUIManager.instance.DidPointerHitUI\u003C/em\u003E, what kinda does the opposite, but neither tried it nor can i remember where. And this ofc wouldn\u0027t work with UnityUI. Maybe using EZGUI in mods would be the best approach. Anyone done this? Any examples for using this from script only? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat mods for example are you talking about?
