Im thinking of making a mock up of the gui using NGUI in a unity project then converting that ngui gui into a c# script (i.e. create empty game objects and then add ngui componets) to create to GUI. I would then include the NGUI Distribution version dll as part of the plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this sound like a viable approach or will doing it this way mean having to fight the way KSP works, which I believe uses the Unity GUI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T03:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent idea the MFD\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
