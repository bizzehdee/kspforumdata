You don\u0027t have to be in timewarp for the timewarp class to return correct values (but I can\u0027t comment on the reverse). I use the Timewarp versions exclusively reasoning that the KSP specific version is more likely to be correct in any given situation"},{"CreatedByName":"AaronLS","CreatedById":142846,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T01:45:12Z","Content":"That sounds like a good best practice.\n\nI did some test and it appears with physics warp, both values are identical, I.e. 1x .02, 4x .08\n\nWith regualr warp though, x5 has Time.fixedDelta .02, and TimeWarp.fixedDelta .10\n\nSo you are right about using TimeWarp."}]}
