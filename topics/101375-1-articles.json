The franchise itself has actually been around for quite a while, since the 80s, even. But I\u0027m a bit more interested in the science behind the sequels, Frontier, First Encounters and Dangerous. They had, and havem fairly realistic procedural generation of entire star systems, not just the one star and planet like the first game. They\u0027ve been improving the way it\u0027s done with every game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I would like to know is the science behind it. How do accretion disks become solar systems? What are the determining factors? How could I go about making a procedural solar system? Not the terrain, but the planets and moons, with Keplerian Orbits, and the star, with its own data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want more than just randomly generating those things in the solar system, I would like to do it realistically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, guys. You\u0027re the best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T15:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bill Phil\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do accretion disks become solar systems?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Accrete project has used some scientific papers to simulate the formation of a solar system.
