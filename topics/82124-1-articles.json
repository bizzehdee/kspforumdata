Even though the ship I was trying to use to send them on the way was not very big, the part count turned the launch event into uncontrollable slideshow. And on top of it, these probes were not directly involved in anything, I just needed to transfer them to the Jool system.

When opening it, it would release its \u0022contents\u0022 right into space, i.e. not attached to anything.
