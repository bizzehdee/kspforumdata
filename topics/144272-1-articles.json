With polluted skies you will need a larger telescope to be able to see what a small one sees in a less polluted area.

They\u0027re dead easy to use and there\u0027s a good range of stuff to see with them, whether it\u0027s studying the mountains and craters of the Moon, hunting out faint fuzzy galaxies, or wondering at bright open clusters and the starfields of the Milky Way. Especially in an urban location the binoculars will help \u0022punch through\u0022 the light pollution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10x50 are the most popular spec. Any more magnification or aperture and they get too big and heavy and sensitive to shaking to hold by hand. But anywhere from 7-10x mag and 40-50mm aperture is fine for astronomy. When choosing a pair, look for reviews in reputable astronomy or birding magazines and websites, don\u0027t just judge by \u0027box ticking\u0027 features because that says nothing about quality. $100, even $50, will get you a pair of binoculars that you won\u0027t need to upgrade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: If you already have a decent pair of binoculars, or you just really really want a telescope, then:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my view the most important thing is ease of use, and that comes from having a stable mounting. You want the telescope to move when and where you want, then stay still while you\u0027re looking through it. Remember that at for example 100x magnification, every little shake is also magnified a hundred times. You also want the focuser - the bit the eyepiece goes into - to be made decently too, for the same reason. All that makes the difference between an enjoyable time and a frustrating one. On a $100 budget the most usable and stable telescopes are the tabletop \u0022Mini-Dobsonians\u0022 such as the Orion Funscope 76 or Skyscanner 100.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI own a similar scope to the Funscope and can say it ticks the ease-of-use box. As far as views go, it\u0027s OK. It\u0027s a cheap small telescope and can\u0027t be expected to match bigger and/or more expensive stuff. Its strong point is widefield views and open star clusters, similar to what you get from binoculars actually, but gaining the ability to up the magnification to bring slightly smaller clusters to life, especially if you get an eyepiece giving around 50x. It\u0027s also good for hunting \u0022faint fuzzies\u0022 - galaxies, globular clusters, even comets. They don\u0027t look like much in a small scope but the fun is in trying to see them at all. The weak point of these mini-Dobs is that they aren\u0027t good on planets, because they use a cheap mirror that isn\u0027t the ideal shape so they don\u0027t give crisp view at high (above about 75x) magnification. But then no small cheap scope is \u003Cem\u003Egreat\u003C/em\u003E on planets because to resolve fine details requires big aperture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-23T22:07:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/23/2016 10:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by cantab\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-23T22:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMO a good first move would be to find a local astronomy club and go out with them some night to get some hands on experience with different telescope types and pick the brains of experienced stargazers while actually using the gear.
