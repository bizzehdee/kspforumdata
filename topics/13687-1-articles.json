It has some brilliant high definition pictures in it, articles about future rockets and missions etc, astronomy guides and so forth. My mum got it for me yesterday. Seems like a good read for anyone interested in anything space related. Just thought I\\\u0027d post about it here to spread the word. It\\\u0027s the first issue also, so I\\\u0027m glad I didnt miss it. If your\\\u0027e interested, look it up, or if you have it maybe you could share your thoughts about it. Basically anything about this magazine, you can post here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso here\\\u0027s a link to an online article about the new magazine: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.howitworksdaily.com/news/all-about-space-on-sale-today/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.howitworksdaily.com/news/all-about-space-on-sale-today/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
