It works perfectly except for one problem: neither action groups nor the KAL-1000 controller can make the ports undock. The only way to do so is through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E.

I have no idea if any of that would work but it\u0027s worth a shot I suppose. I can think of at least 2 things that could go wrong. Staging may only work for actually \u003Cstrong\u003Estaging\u003C/strong\u003E, and won\u0027t undock docked ports later. Also, staging may not show up as a thing to add to an action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
