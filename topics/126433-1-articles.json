I am wondering does everybody is waiting for proper allingment of planets or make the travel cuz sometimes it takes a lot of time to planets get proper allingment( its just boring) or is there mod which allows you to warp time really fast ?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T14:11:41Z","Content":"\nWelcome to the forums.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe reason why most people do alignments is to save fuel and get to locations faster. If I lined up with Duna I could get there in less than a year. If I don\u0026#39;t align and fly into Sol orbit before I fly there I waste fuel and get there in 2 years.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jlcarneiro","CreatedById":79196,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T14:14:07Z","Content":"\nHello and welcome to the forums!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou\u0026#39;ll certainly receive advices from more experienced players, but I suggest you check [URL=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24786-1-0-x-Kerbal-Alarm-Clock-v3-4-0-0-(June-27)\u0022]Kerbal Alarm Clock (KAC)[/URL] it not only indicates when the next alignment (launch window) will be, but also allows you to set an alarm and warp directly to it (hence the name).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: Ops!
