But am I legally allowed to do this? I will obviously credit them, but are there any other things I\u0027d have to do, to make sure I don\u0027t get in any legal trouble. I know people have been doing this before, but I do not know when the developer is inactive and the mod is out dated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-20T08:47:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt all depends on the license. Some mods have licenses that do not allow continuations, so regardless of how long a dev has been away, the mod cannot be touched.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
