Not only numbers (like Delta-V, distances, atmosphere levels) are completely different, but also things like antennas with mods for realism (RemoteTech2 or more forgiving Antenna Range) have completely different meaning to the gameplay. Be prepared for a real challenge. For complete realism, install CKAN and get RO and all of its dependencies, for best experience get custom tech tree (RP-0 is great one) for RO and point that rocket with correct end to the space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is also a middle way you can take, like resize mods (64K), which enlarge the system considerably, comparable to our own, while retaining original feeling and art style of the game. I highly recommend, in this case, putting into shopping cart also brilliant Near Future pack (Propulsion, Electrical, Solar, Construction) for cool looking, but very realistic ships with great capabilities, but they will cost you a lot of money and research. Also adding Life-Support mod is in my opinion a must for realism or Role-Play lovers, most used are TACLS, USI-LS or Snacks, each with own plus and cons. Add some fancy tech tree (CT) with one of many possible configs (I personally use SETI Balance mod) and you\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4re good to go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModability is one of the best thing in this game, and with incredible community like this, its a blessing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
