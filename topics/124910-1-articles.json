If what you want is just a wider selection of tanks and engines I suggest getting KW rocketry and/or procedural tanks. KSP interstellar gives you rather largeselection of future technologies with the added benefit of them being rather well balanced for example you can use thermal rockets but you will need to supply huge amounts of power for them to be actually useful they will hell ever let you switch fuel types and provides potentially amazing specific impulses. same thing goes for atmospheric turbo jets which can actually run off atmosphere not even using any fuel which can of course be very helpful for single stage to orbit vehicles built for example for Eve. however for them to provide any kind of decent trust you will need vast amounts of power and as you can probably imagine nuclear reactors that provide enough power for these methods to be feasible are very very heavy being in excess of 40 tons.

There are some very high ISP engines in the propulsion pack, but their thrusts are mostly low and they typically require huge amounts of electricity, necessitating one or more reactors, which all leads to additional design challenges. When the masses of these engines, their specialist fuel and their accompanying reactors \u0026amp; radiators is considered, they\u0027re far from a win button. In fact, the NF pack always used to nerf the stock ion drive (unsure if this is still the case) to bring it into line with the NF ion options. But they are a very nice option to have, and something completely different from stock, which is less the case with mods like KW Rocketry (which is brilliant, but more stockalike as it\u0027s mostly LFO engines etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENertea, who authors the NF mods, make excellent models - the whole pack looks fantastic, as you\u0027ve already found with the solar panels. And as you mentioned bugs, you have little to be worried about with the NF pack, it\u0027s all very stable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, as these are parts mods, I guess I could have a save without them, but I know I would miss them almost every time I went to the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same is not true for KAS/KIS. I couldn\u0027t play without the functionality they offer. If I couldn\u0027t add parts to ships out in space then I would have to remember absolutely everything before launch, and there\u0027s very little likelihood of that ever happening! And when you come to do anything meaningful on the surface of another planet, KAS/KIS are an essential requirement; base building is an extremely clumsy affair without them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, NF addresses gaps in what you can do with stock parts, while KAS/KIS addresses gaps in what you can do with the game itself. I wouldn\u0027t want to play without either, but I more or less \u003Cem\u003Ecouldn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E play - in the style that I do - without KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T14:14:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Clear Air Turbulence\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Clear Air Turbulence\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi there \u003Cp\u003Erelatively new player (still doing mun landings) playing sandbox here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am wondering about the pros and cons of the Near Future series of mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI help out with Near Future.

The engines have a performance progression, and the high end ones are quite good - enough to outclass the \u0027Nerv\u0027 nuclear engine in every way, even when factoring in the weight of power production. However, the stock solar system is so small that these engines can rarely stretch their legs fully; when you can effortlessly fly all missions with 350s Isp engines no problem, then ten to fifty times that specific impulse isn\u0027t really required. But if you add things like Outer Planets Mod or solar system rescale mods, the NFP engines \u0027grow with the challenge\u0027 so to speak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Electrical is an extension beyond stock; most parts come beyond the \u0027Nerv\u0027 nuclear engine. Those that come earlier are just additional form factors of batteries with stock stats, and a different form of power storage that weighs less but works in a different way. If you run Propulsion, you probably want this pack too. Solar can power some electric engines as well, if you stay around Kerbin or closer to the sun, but for the biggest ones (or when going to outer planets) you do need reactors. These reactors are a lot better at generating power than anything stock or solar, but they are also very expensive and take a lot of research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Construction integrates into the second half of the stock tree. It contains lots of different structural elements, most of which are cosmetic. There is however a greater selection of size adapters and single-to-multipart adapters than stock offers, potentially allowing you to build designs that would not work in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Spacecraft integrates into the second half of the stock tree. It\u0027s probably the least invasive of all the packs, because it has the fewest parts and those parts are the closest to stock, technology and operation wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Solar partly integrates into the second half of the stock tree, and partly goes beyond. A lot of the solar panels are much larger than stock options, and though they also weigh more, ultimately the top choices do outperform stock options noticably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should realize that when I say that a pack \u0022goes beyond\u0022 stock, what I really mean is that you should install a different tech tree. There is no room in the stock tech tree for most of what Near Future adds. The parts will still be crammed in there, but they will be unlocked too early for too little science cost, and there will be no meaningful progression.
