Even if you have 24 launches per year, with a fleet of 6 vehicles you can take 3 months to refurbish/restack them, which is more than enough. If you need a higher flight rate, it\u0027s easier to simply grow your fleet than to redesign the system for faster turnaround.\n\u003E Fast turnaround is only important if you reach insanely high launch rates and each vehicle is super expensive.\n\nThe amount of launches per year is proportional to your launch cost, and your launch cost is directly proportional to how much time (work hours) take you to build and test each rocket. \n\nTime = Money\n\nThat is a lesson that your nasa friends needs to learn, or keep labeling all their designs and projects as \u0022unique and mindblowing tech\u0022 (which are not, is just the same old \\*\\*\\*\\* than always) to just find an excuse to the decades of development.\n\nAnd you always forget about the test times, that is included in the manufacture and is about the 1/3 or half of the total cost.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E May I remind you that none of those other techs have yet been proven technically or economically. Sure, this is a stop-gap preventive study from ULA just in case they do need to start reusing hardware, but until the launch market sees a serious mutation in terms of payloads and launch rates, they are playing it safe, which is what their stockholders want them to do.\n\nIf after all the evidence and new plans you still think that the launch market will not increase, then... not sure why there is so many companies trying to reuse parts and so many new players in the space business."},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T20:53:54Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If after all the evidence and new plans you still think that the launch market will not increase, then... not sure why there is ***(1)*** so many companies trying to reuse parts and ***(2)*** so many new players in the space business.\n\n***(1)***\n\nBecause re-using parts saves money which helps improve profit margins and/or allows those companies to remain competitive, even if there is no change in launch rates.\n\n***(2)***\n\nBecause the space business is glamorous...
