I\u0027d say that we could get an ISS successor up and running, at least. And we could make it fancy. Artificial gravity-fancy. A mighty ferris wheel in orbit, with laboratories working on long-term life support. Floating greenhouses for zero-G or low-G agronomy. I\u0027d say we could build an orbital colony of sorts, like an ISS on steroids. Probably employing dozens or even a couple hundred people full-time, on multi-week shifts with regular rotation not unlike terrestrial oil platforms. The stuff learnt from the station(s) would propel us to the stars in the longer term, or at least to the Moon and eventually Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, we could address space debris quite simply and effectively. Infinite money, remember? Just send up a separate mission to retrieve or redirect every known and tracked piece of debris. It would probably be a good idea to perfect, or at least significantly improve, first- and second-stage recovery and reuse, though, since you\u0027d need a lot of launches.

Maintaining a vessel and its crew in space for long periods of time needs to become a routine thing before we go somewhere we can\u0027t quickly return from. It also wouldn\u0027t hurt to spend some time building and testing new propulsion technology with the infinite money we\u0027ve got, before we order a zillion old-fashioned chemical rockets and make a habit of doing stuff inefficiently because money doesn\u0027t matter (otherwise, eventually \u003Cem\u003Eresources\u003C/em\u003E would - on a world with only eight kilograms of unobtainium on it, no amount of money could buy you ten kilograms).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"insert_name","CreatedById":150339,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-17T22:01:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ninfinite money? not sure how physics would react to something of infinite mass. my gut says everything would turn into a singularity fast, but I don\u0027t have the skills to figure out what would happen. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-17T22:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223059620\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022160721\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221495050551\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150330\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cubinator\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, cubinator said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Elon Musk put it, it turns out \u0022moar boosters\u0022 actually has lots of engineering problems that come up, so this wouldn\u0027t be as easy as bolting a bunch of rockets together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, that is an problem who can only partial been solved by trowing money on it.
