I\u0027d say by 2017 KSP will have official multiplayer, probably earlier. Prior to 1.0, Squad\u0027s main goals were the implementation of resources, Unity 5 and multiplayer. One of these objectives has been filled, and the U5 update is coming out in a month or two. After U5, Squad will hopefully realize a patch of bugfixes, assuming most bugs haven\u0027t been patched in 1.1, and then what else would they do? The game is pretty fleshed out, and though it could use some polish, Squad generally prefers to realize new features before finishing old ones. Multiplayer will probably be added in version 1.3 or 1.4.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-21T00:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t care if the ever do.
