So, if you\u0027re orbiting Minmus and you see you\u0027re over the Greater Flats, you can tell the Great Flats are to the west, there are some highlands to the east, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T06:22:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t find highlands anywhere on Minmus, but it\u0027s usually pretty easy to find lowlands, midlands, and slopes all bunched together on any old cliffside. The flats biomes are easy to pick out, but the upper biomes are all churned up and senseless, unless they relate to regolith from varying eras being revealed after a major resurfacing event. Lastly, the poles are easy.
