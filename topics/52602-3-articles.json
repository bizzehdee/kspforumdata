For anybody who watches Scott Manley, he recently played Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Space Program Manager, or something like that, and it would take several turns to develop the technology and even build the rockets to launch. It worked pretty well, and it makes sense that a rocket will take time to build. They don\u0027t have to be built one at a time, they can be queued up and be built several at a time, or even kept on standby for emergency launches. When costs are implemented, having several rockets waiting to be built at once would really eat into your funds as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would certainly need a lot of balancing to work right as well as be fair to the player, but I feel like it\u0027s really needed for the sake of being a space program game. What\u0027s the point in time if it\u0027s only waiting on transfer windows? Why not add more depth to it? It certainly wouldn\u0027t be hard for a beginner to follow, since they\u0027d be too focused on one rocket at a time to even notice the build time. For the more experienced and/or managerial types, having multiple launches lined up while also dealing with other mission could be incredibly fun. It would be hard without something like the \u003Cstrong\u003EAlarm Clock mod\u003C/strong\u003E, since time warping past a scheduled burn or missing a transfer window is obviously terrible. I would take great joy out of running multiple mission simultaneously, with believable passage of time, in a smooth manner.
