I\u2019m guessing these folks don\u2019t care enough to fix it despite tossing the game up to GamePass for that many other people to get ultimately frustrated \u00A0enough to give up on it. I know KSP2 is coming which may explain the Gamepass decision as they want some free exposure to sell the new game off of but if no one can even get through your tutorials, I doubt you\u2019re going to sell many KSP2 licenses with that approach. I was going to bite on it but sure as hell won\u2019t of this is the level of commitment (or lack therof) they have for console players.
