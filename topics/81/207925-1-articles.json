Some questions for you, as I\u0027ve been trying to piece it together on my own experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsole? Ps4? Which type? I.e newer model or original? Can usually tell by the HDD size I believe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen did you install the game?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this during career? Did this career start prior to the previous ksp update? Save games over versions are a no go for this game, the support team essentially admitted this to me when I contacted followimg a blue screen crash and loss of save. I had reset my whole ps4 and reinstalled the game now to no real affect. Although it seemed more performant.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen did you notice increase in errors? I.e can you recall if this started when you visited eve or Duna for the first time, or hit the tier 4/5 level?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EMy current view is that the introduction of the asteroid tracking when I upgraded the tracking station might be the problem area, in that ps4 memory having to work overtime to map out the tracking of the objects... So causes memory spikes.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere do you tend to get the errors? For me, look on the bug tracker and you will see I\u0027ve been spamming them with my various types, Typically when returning to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E or tracking station from flight, but also during craft build in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is the error code you see? Mines always CE-34878-0.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsually it is able to recover the save but one time it was completely courrupted for me and I lost a whole career.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo avoid this, if you are a ps\u002B then save your game files using the cloud storage. If not, like me, get a decent usb drive and use the ps4 s in built \u0027application save data management\u0027 to save your career to the usb once or twice a month as a fall back.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
