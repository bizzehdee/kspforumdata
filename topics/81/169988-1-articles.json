When I revert the flight back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, I return to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E but the ship and crew don\u0027t.

But when revertin to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, many times the vehicle remains on the launch pad. So the pilots are not available for you. But if you try to start another rocket you will get a message that there is different rocket on the launch pad and if you want to recover and clear it. This gives you your parts (=money) and crew back. Basically after you revert you still have to recover. So this bug is not gamebreaking, just annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
