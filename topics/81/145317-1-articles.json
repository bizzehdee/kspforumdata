The whole corrupted save issue is pretty game breaking. The actual game is great, but I am holding off on playing anymore because every time I have done anything major recently, it doesn\u0027t save. Kind of makes me feel that any hope I had for mod support for consoles is squashed too. Doesn\u0027t seem like they care too much.

When we want to patch the consoles we merge PC commits and work on the custom code and assets that are needed to make it run on the consoles. The console builds then have to go through certification with the console manufacturer (Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo) before we can make them available. As a result the consoles are likely to run a little bit behind compared to the PC releases, but we will keep updating all platforms as we move forward.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately it\u0027s true that patching the consoles requires a lot more work than it does on PC, where an updated version can simply be deployed to the Squad store, Steam and to GoG.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn console there\u0027s many loops to jump through and lots of paperwork just to get any update considered for release, this is understandable as neither Microsoft nor Sony want any publishers to push updates that have not been scrutinized, as there\u0027s always the potential that any new update can break the consoles in some way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also deeply insulting to claim that Squad are being arrogant here, they are doing everything they can to bring the updates to the consoles, and all I can do is ask that you are patient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
