Now I got used to the game crashing alot because the game would backup and usually fix the problem. but not this time. when the game crashed I was like\u00A0Oh okay that sucks welp reload. so I went on to doing that but when I pressed resume save and pressed the load it didn\u0027t load. all I heard was the music which\u00A0\u00A0at first I thought this was a little problem but later I realized I couldn\u0027t even load it even after closing the application I got very worried\u00A0and looked up how to fix it and I tried everything they had and every \u00A0forum I could use\u00A0here\u0027s the list that I used\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUninstall the game. Didn\u0027t work (for me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndo some clear cache things. Didn\u0027t work (for me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReboot the PS4. Didn\u0027t work\u00A0 (for me)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack up save. Now this is what I did with the ps4 plus and got the save back Yay but I got cocky and just played the game without doing any more research . the game crashed,\u00A0the ps4 plus has a auto upload that I didn\u0027t catch and uploaded the save which doesn\u0027t load anymore So this is kind my fault as well. (actually pretty much its my fault)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think i tried everything at this point and nothing will work. I had lost 7 months\u00A0of\u00A0work\u00A0December 2019 to July 2020. there is pretty much no solution to fix this problem unless you back up your save every time. i had 236.500.200 funds\u00A0360 science 134 reputation (is reputation useless?) 36 flights or 2 ksp space stations 1 mun\u00A0 base 1 minmus\u00A0\u00A0base 1 mun station 1 didn\u0027t station a few relays and a bunch of space craft. i even termination debris but that did nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncould there even be a bug fix to this problem? i know it it might be hard for the devs because the game crashes randomly and \u00A0this bug\u00A0 is random but would there ever be a solution. anyone because if not even a single one I\u0027m going to be heartbroken about my lost save. like does anyone have anything else that may work?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh yea I reported this bug on the bug tracker and it has been 5 months and no response and other people seem to have this problem as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this gets fixed one day but it seems it hadn\u0027t got fixed yet so ill wait another 5 years\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
