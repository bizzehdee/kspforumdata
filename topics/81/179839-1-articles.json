On ps4 there is\u00A0a common data file wich contains game settings i belive and one file per savegame. Upload them or put them on a usbdevice if u want to keep them but maybe they are somewhat corrupted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm on ps4 and never ran\u00A0into this but maybe a xbox fella will come along and have just the right answer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck mate\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
