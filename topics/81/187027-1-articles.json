Then After re Release from the new Edition (enhanced edition) i Play on xbox one x.\u00A0\u00A0I Love this Game. But the biggest Problem in my oppinion what this Game has on Console is the Performance Problem. The Game runs fine if you do Small Things. But its Running with realy 3 - 5 Frames in Second if you want do a real Space Mission. Building a big rocket is Not the Problem. I Understand, why we Need rockets with 500 parts\u002B... (Framerate is there\u00A0around 8-15)\u00A0But we Need multiple vessels. If you want to land a Medium size (60-100 Parts)\u00A0Second vessel in the same area near to another then is the framerate Going extrem down (5-10). The next issue Whats going along with it is that we can\u2018t use the tools on the vessel because of the low perfomance, the game don\u2018t recognizes the imput from your buttons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe Game is Going down When you want to Land a third\u00A0vessel...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsame in space. Its not possible to Build a solid Space Station with three Moduls or more. I made one with three and it is Not realy big.. the Performance is at 3 fps. And you can\u2018t use Any Tools on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can Show me via Stream how you Build the Space Station in the background\u00A0on your \u201Egame Start\u00A0picture\u201C in the store on xbox ^^\u00A0You Show use something what we can\u2019t Build...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthis Game has no difference in Performance\u00A0from the normal Xbox one to Xbox one X (that Show\u2018s the Problem) there is a\u00A0Performance fix needed in my eyes on\u00A0console. And a buff for ps4 pro and xbox one x compared to the normal one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut, i know this is hard work. So every fine. But in my eyes are\u00A0Performance Problems and bugs\u00A0the biggest Problems what Games can have\u00A0and why many Players Leave. (In this case just Performance there are no game breaking\u00A0bugs). Iam realy intereseted on your DLC\u2018s / Expansion.. But Not so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni would be glad to See a Performance buff (a big one).
