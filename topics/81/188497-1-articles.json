(X oxone)However whenever I try to use manuver nodes to match the inclination of other objects all I can do is adjust the ecliptic I am currently in. In essence I can not cant my orbit on the Y axis.

I think LB switches the function of the node (move along orbit, directions of maneuver, delete node) and RB cycles through directions when on that function. I get them mixed up while playing so it\u0027s no surprise I can\u0027t remember which is which 5 minutes after playing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-27T09:30:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2019 09:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by drpunk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-12T14:02:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/200451-kickasserson/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022200451\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/200451-kickasserson/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kickasserson\u003C/a\u003E, there is a tutorial mission that helps you learn the Manouver Node and get used to it.
