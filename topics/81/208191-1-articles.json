just probably hard to make a 3 dimensional rocketry sim game\u0027s controls fit on the limited space a controller has, take it from me as I\u0027ve played both pc and ps4 versions, and have 1500 hours in the pc version, pc is just better for the user in every aspect. its good for accessibility for non pc users but its not gonna compare to the experience with modability and a keyboard.\u00A0 but to answer your question, when your save doesn\u0027t load do you mean it crashes, or does it endlessly spin the solar system wheel thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset
