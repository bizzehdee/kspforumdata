My problem is that although the option to EVA is present, all I can do once my Kerbal EVA\u0027s is to re-board whatever craft they were on (using circle). The screen says let go (using cross), but nothing happens if I press x. The same seems to be true for climbing (using square) and happens everywhere (from launchpad to Mun) and for any Kerbal (so I can\u0027t rescue any of them from orbit yet. Any thoughts of things to try or check would be really appreciated. Thanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
