The cursor is shown and indicating that the object you are querying is active, yet no reaction when you press B. Sometimes reloading the save will fix it, others you have to quit the game completely and come back in for it to \u0027self correct\u0027. This also happens when trying to select an orbit and usually at the worst time possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erikinthebakery","CreatedById":166663,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-16T23:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to me like it has to do with the objects, not the button, because sometimes they should be respond to (A) and I get the same results. The pointer changes color indicating that the game recognizes the button press but nothing happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also noticed when selecting orbits that it seems like the game is waiting for the button to be released, not pressed. At least it likes to select points on orbits I \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t \u003C/em\u003Ewant when I release the button and then position the pointer there again and reselect it when you finally get it unselected...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Homedawgian","CreatedById":166608,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-18T13:15:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had the same issue, especially right after docking. It almost always becomes completely unresponsive after docking large craft together. The only way I\u0027ve been able to manage is to either mash the B button repeatedly until I get a response to whatever part I\u0027m trying to access, or to go to the tracking station and then return to the vessel. It is particularly debilitating when constructing a large vessel in orbit because I am unable to deactivate different engines after docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
