It gives me improper readings when I have multiple fuel types, engines\u00A0pointed in different directions, engines toggled on or off, and all kinds of other\u00A0reasons.

You might be able to get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E reading back by moving certain engines or other parts around in the staging interface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HvP","CreatedById":146104,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-28T16:54:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure this works on console, but on PC you can go over to the staging column and click the plus sign \u0022\u002B\u0022 next to the icons to add an empty new stage to the column.
