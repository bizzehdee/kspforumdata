I don\u0027t play on console but maybe I can help a little.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, what kind of mode are you playing in: sandbox, science mode, or career? I know you asked about starting another career, but I just want to make sure there\u0027s no misunderstanding. The ground deployed science units won\u0027t really do anything in sandbox mode, but you\u0027ll see them working in both a science and career mode save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should also know that getting good data out of them is a little more complicated than your regular science instruments. They don\u0027t give immediate results like the other instruments. Once you deploy them they will gradually start building up science points and then will slowly transmit them in small chunks over several days in the game. You should be able to right click on them and see if they are listed as active and how much science per day they are generating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour experiments at the site will also need power. Depending on how many experiments you have set up you will need at least one, or possibly a few, OX-Stat-PD Photovoltaic Panels or Mini-NUK-PD \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTGs\u003C/abbr\u003E. Every site needs a Probodobodyne Experiment Control Station, too. It\u0027s basically a probe core to control the experiments while you\u0027re away from them. Just set them down close by on the surface within a few meters of each other. All of these parts are the dedicated Breaking Ground parts that fit in the SEQ cargo storage containers (none of the other basic solar panels or probe cores will work.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich Kerbals deploy the instruments and how experienced they are will also have a big effect on how efficient and productive the experiments are. An engineer with three or four stars of experience that deploys the photovoltaic panels will cause them to provide more power for more experiments than a one star engineer or any other class of Kerbal. Similarly, five star scientists will get the most science per day out of the experiments if they are the ones to deploy the science instruments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, the station needs to have a communication link back to Kerbin to transmit their results. If you are on the far side of the Mun, or are on a planet out of range of Kerbin, then you won\u0027t be getting your science results until you can launch a relay network to facilitate transmission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new surface features that the scanning arm interacts with will NOT appear in an old save, however. This is to guarantee that they don\u0027t spawn below a preexisting base or rover. When you start a new game they should appear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are just a few basic things that maybe you are already aware of, I don\u0027t know.
