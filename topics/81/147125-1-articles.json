Putting two craft together will always cause more lag than two close but undocked. The game favors multiple craft as it can spread the load across more CPU cores. What was the total part count of the two craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Also be aware that future console patches should improve the performance a little too.
