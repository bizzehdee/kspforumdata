I was in\u00A0career mode.. only had four parts on my ship. so as I sit there for about 15 minutes wondering why it\u0027s not loading anything and everything is Frozen. \u00A0I literally had to physically remove the power cord from the console. \u00A0restart button wasn\u0027t responsive either on my console. \u00A0I downloaded this game yesterday morning. \u00A0and every time I played it it crashed. \u00A0which I tried about 9x because this game is awesome. but I am seriously upset about how you would let the consumers find these bug problems out first. \u00A0until you guys fix the problem you sold us a broken game. \u00A0I deleted this game off my PlayStation already. \u00A0I literally feel ripped off! \u00A0I understand there\u0027s going to be glitches and bugs on release date. \u00A0But the glitches and bugs that are on your release date is\u00A0unplayable.. \u00A0people might as well go back and \u00A0download the demo for free.. because at least that doesn\u0027t bug out or freeze.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsincerely an aggravated consumer that purchased your broken game. \u00A0I am for one completely sick of gaming companies doing this to the consumer.. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-17T16:05:37Z\u0022 title=\u002207/17/2016 04:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Bradallen\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
