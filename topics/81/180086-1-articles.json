This can be done by pressing the button to bring up the information for that building (I\u0027m on Xbox so I don\u0027t know what button it is for PS4). Make sure you have enough funds too, otherwise you won\u0027t be able to upgrade it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrvDancer85","CreatedById":180954,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-26T11:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPress the squarebutton when focused on that building or the cursor hovers over the building you want to upgrade\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-26T11:15:27Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2018 11:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PrvDancer85\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
