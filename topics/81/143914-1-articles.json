I was amped to pay for and get going on this today... but man.

A substantial amount of work needs to go into optimizing the control scheme, placement, etc... and it has not been done. Windows, when made big enough to read on a TV that isn\u0027t huge blocks everything. By default, every tutorial text window is in the absolute worst place possible, blocking whatever the most important thing is (whatever the subject of the tutorial is, is invariably blocked). Again, this is not a PC, so \u0022dragging windows\u0022 is COMPLETELY unintuitive, but that was ported wholesale. Fine. So we have huge windows, rather than readable large fonts and clever placement. So you drag the stupid window... and the next screen of dialogue reverts BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PLACE, BLOCKING EVERYTHING. EVERY TIME. So you have the disadvantage of movable windows, which console games don\u0027t use, instead of correctly placing large dialogue boxes in a console friendly GUI, and THEN force-reverting back to the original, awful location, every screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen the mouse pointer acceleration. Oh man. There is no option to set this. So you zoom past everything, and selecting anything is a complete chore, instead of using console conventions, like snapping to functions one-at-a-time, or at least having adjustable acceleration, or snapping when near a selectable control, etc...

Screens zip by before you have a chance to read them in many of them. The pause screen blocks the aforementioned terribly placed dialogue window, so you can\u0027t even pause and read for a minute. The tutorial dialogue was just cut and pasted, and aren\u0027t even correct a lot of the time. It\u0027s so badly done, there will be dialogue like \u0022PRESS THE [Press the X Button] Key\u0022 ... it\u0027s so shoddy and slapdash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, a lot of stuff is just not anti-aliased or properly gone over for TV. Like the flags you choose at the beginning look like atari 2600 graphics on TVs, with the words, completely unreadable on a TV under around 40 inches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could go on, but it\u0027s a terrible, awful, miserable port of a fantastic game that I\u0027m dying to play. Maybe when I can afford a gaming PC I\u0027ll finally get my money\u0027s worth.

I don\u0027t want a radial menu to do things or only as an alternation to the existing buttons. This is a much to complicated for a fast work flow. Ok it needs some time to learn all the button combos, but if we have learned it, the work flow is much faster than with a radial menu system. There are some small things they should change, as the use of A/B in popup dialogs to say OK or Cancel, instead to move with the cursor on this buttons.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter I have now learned the most of the button combos, I\u0027m very happy with the controller mapping as it is, with some small exceptions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat makes me most disappointed is the fact, we got an outdated verison of the game, which contains some show stopper bugs, like not working Navball mission navigation points, Warp X issue or the inability to set maneuver points in teh map view at some time.
