However I think i know what i\u0027m doing wrong (kind of) to activate the \u0022run test\u0022 you have to press A which on Xbox fires your next stage and for me this fires the flea engine and when you click\u0022run test\u0022 it says its not complete when you look at the contract no matter how many times you click \u0022run test\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how to complete these test booster,parachute,engine at certain altitudes and speed it seems not to work if anyone on xbox knows a way to make these contracts work or know what I am doing wrong let me know.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
