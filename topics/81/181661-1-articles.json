Basically you CAN use keyboard and mouse like one guy said but half the keyboard doesn\u2019t work and only one mouse button. I\u2019ve got used to using controller but I use mouse and keyboard once I get to orbit. So I\u2019ve docked in orbit on pc and failed 1000 times on console due to lack of control (eg switching between linier and rotating control) on controller it\u2019s such a excrements show tbh. So hard to switch from target to target. It is not lost on me that we\u2019re lucky that they have dumbed down the game enough for our crappy consoles to handle it.
