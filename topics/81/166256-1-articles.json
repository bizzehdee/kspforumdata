In fact, depending on who you ask, it might be more difficult than even rocket science. And, especially in the video game industry, you don\u0027t want to rush out code, because of all the possible bugs that could occur. The last time that KSP for consoles was rushed, we got the broken mess of bugs we have now. Because of that rush, and the decision to hire Flying Tiger to port the game, KSP for consoles now has to be completely redone from the ground up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-09T14:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello, and welcome to the forums!\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s worth noting that Squad never announces release dates in advance, so you\u0027re not going to be able to get that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one place where you can get any development news is the \u0022KSP Weekly\u0022 post in \u0022The Daily Kerbal\u0022 forum.\u00A0 It comes out every Friday, and that\u0027s where Squad shares any news they\u0027re willing to share.\u00A0 Often it mentions how the console work is coming along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll go ahead and close this thread now, because 1. it\u0027s not a technical support question, and 2. there\u0027s really nothing more to be said.\u00A0 \u0022KSP Weekly\u0022 is the one and only place you can get information about this.\u00A0 Any information that\u0027s there, is yours for the taking every week.\u00A0 Any information that\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Enot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E there is simply unavailable and there\u0027s no point in asking.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
