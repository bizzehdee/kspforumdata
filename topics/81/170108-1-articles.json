During both a Minmus and Duna mission I was unable to save the game, or return to the space center. I can always continue to play but all is for not because I will never capture my progess.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother related save issue is sometimes the game seems to get bogged down when saving. Any auto save or game save stalled the game significantly, to the point I thought it had crashed. But after 30 seconds the game resumed and I could interact until the next auto save. After restarting the game the problem went away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-31T14:46:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/31/2018 02:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 31, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Space Station 4 Crash\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xanisselis","CreatedById":150242,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-26T22:12:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m having the same issue with longer missions to save or go to space center.
