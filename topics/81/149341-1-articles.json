I swear, I\u0027m starting to anticipates the bugs now. \u00A0Anyway. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gears have different pictures and different specs - one looks like a small version of the LY-35 and the other one looks like a little white nub that\u0027s even smaller than what I THINK is the LY-10. \u00A0Anyway, specs on them seem mixed up as well but the kicker is that only the little white ones end up in the editor, the LY-10 (Or little brother of the LY-35 looking from Advanced Landing Tech Tree) don\u0027t show up in the editor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo add insult to injury, every time I open the Tech Tree it says I own 5-6 of the LY-10, repeated over and over. \u00A0I thought this was strange, but then went back in a few more times and now I own a dozen. \u00A0Makes me wonder what other kinds of bugs there are that aren\u0027t blatantly showing their redundancy. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen does Squad wanna start paying me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously, this is work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill love the game though, and yes, still playing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T20:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222789128\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149341\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475697133\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022169531\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cheesemass\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 10/5/2016 at 3:52 PM, Cheesemass said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen does Squad wanna start paying me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeriously, this is work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill love the game though, and\u003Cstrong\u003E yes, still playing...\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmaybe if\u00A0people would call them out on this crap and get refunds they\u0027d pay people to do bug testing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnot as long as you\u0027ll test it for free and only mildly complain while still playing something broken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheesemass","CreatedById":169531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-08T03:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nComplaints are needed so they know what is and isn\u0027t working -
