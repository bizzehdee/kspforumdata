What you need to do is allow time for the game to save before hitting launch. I usually hit\u00A0save vehicle, wait ten seconds, then launch. This way it will always load the correct vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2 Some lag is unavoidable. My oldest campaign is the one that lags the most, but I was able to clear it up somewhat by eliminating old probes and stations and things I no longer needed. I think asteroid scanners also slow things down since they constantly generate new asteroids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3 Yes, burn time and d-v calculations are not perfect. You may have a weird stage structure, or engines facing in a weird direction, or thrust limiter set down low. Lots of things can affect it. Also burn time doesn\u0027t account for lag - it counts down according to the game clock, which isn\u0027t always in real time, as seen in the upper left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#4 There have been some updates to the physics, but I don\u0027t know much beyond that. Atmospheric flight\u00A0is hard in the current version, that\u0027s for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
