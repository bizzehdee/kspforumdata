(Ps4)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing i can think of is that maybe because my other 2 kerbals are in an mk1 crew cabin and therefore my ship has no control while the pilot is EVA from mk1 command pod. Im able to swap between the two pods if there is space so its not an issue with the transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould i be able to at least focus on the ship even if it has no control?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIll try putting an automated command pod on as well to see if anything changes when i get the chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-20T08:52:42Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2016 08:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Mobius2134\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Palaceviking","CreatedById":166883,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-24T09:19:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBug\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowrunner","CreatedById":168194,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-29T15:52:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to take control over the empty Vessel via space center tracking building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI you can even \u0022fly\u0022 or terminate debris from decoupled rocket parts there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDont know if it will work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mobius2134","CreatedById":167890,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-31T04:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222734542\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146219\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472485934\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022168194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Shadowrunner\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 30/08/2016 at 1:52 AM, Shadowrunner said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to take control over the empty Vessel via space center tracking building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI you can even \u0022fly\u0022 or terminate debris from decoupled rocket parts there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDont know if it will work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t played in awhile now, but I\u0027m pretty sure you revert to an earlier save if you try to get to the tracking building whilst EVA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWorth a shot though.
