I\u0027m glad to see the KSP community and Dev\u0027s are still actively pursuing the Kerbal Space Program for Console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m thrilled that the EE 1.01 patch fixed so many of the problems that were plaguing the console version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have now for my first time, completed the science tree in Career mode, Year 2 and 50-ish days. Was really expecting some sort of party, but research is never really finished.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first interplanetary sortie to Duna was a partial success.\u00A0 I was able to get there with two space probes, deploy some comm satellites, and attempt landings on both Duna, and Ike. Unfortunately I didn\u0027t install proper relay (\u003Cu\u003Eany \u003C/u\u003Erelay comms ) so, yeah. Partial success. Duna has a new crater with some litter around it, Ike has a lander that only occasionally wants to talk with Kerbal Space Command. My Probes currently enroute to Jool will no doubt have the same success rate... if I\u0027m lucky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now my Kerbals and I are learning to spell the words efficient launch profile, and I have discovered a couple of different ways of how not to do interplanetary transfers. Also found out how to level Kerbals skills up, way, way, way late in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Space Tourism market seems to be a reliable source of Income , so hopefully I\u0027ll eventually be able to land a fuel rover on Mun and Minmus for less cost than the Kerbal Space Hotel I\u0027m currently assembling in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love this Game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrent gameplay concerns;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Physical Time warp, sounds like the nuke and Ion engine crowd want this. I\u0027ve only been using chemical rockets so it haven\u2019t bothered me... yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Since I started playing early on in the console release phase, I do not like the new throttle arrangement, because it\u0027s backwards to how I learned. Console controller is very busy and could use some work eliminating overlapping command button combinations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Something needs to be sorted out with the trim setting being so easy to accidentally turn on, HAL keeps trying to crash my spacecraft. I suppose somebody might want to set the trim while making a burn in space, But I sure haven\u0027t wanted to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Kerb-net remains a complete mystery to me. I haven\u0027t even accidentally landed on an anomaly yet. If I turn it on, I need to escape back to the space centre to get it off the UI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Kerbal skills and abilities, I have landed bases on Mun and Minmus, I have Space Stations orbiting Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus, and I\u0027m building a 40 room space hotel, I have docked , clamped, landed, recovered, rendezvoused, transferred, rescued, space walked, Mun walked,\u00A0 drilled and refined... while the pilots have gained useful skills, and the scientists have gotten faster, the engineers have only learned how to pack a chute or to fix a flat tire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Seriously, the contracts need a proof reader. Please. For real.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The Admin building... just... why? I guess it might add something to the game, I just don\u0027t know what it is. Haven\u0027t used it at all, until recently I didn\u0027t bother opening the screen. I\u0027m done the tech tree now so I guess I\u0027ll sell some science...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Interplanetary travel, Console Career players need some sort of alarm clock. and some sort of rough transfer planner.\u00A0 Unless I\u0027m suppose to attempt all my interplanetary stuff in sandbox mode, the game needs some sort of alarm clock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Haven\u0027t touched an asteroid and I don\u0027t want to.... yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E I haven\u0027t made any use of the advanced tabs, subassembly seems to be a mysterious method of telling me I can\u0027t attach things I might want to save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-I hear that console players can use a keyboard and mouse, haven\u0027t tried. If this is true, great, if it\u0027s not the game should have this option.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Flight controls for planes, I\u0027ve read that there is an option for using a\u00A0 joystick, this is a must have for flying aircraft. I haven\u0027t tried yet. I like the idea of building and flying my own planes, and I have built and flown a few planes in KSP, but I mostly avoid it because I personally don\u0027t enjoy atmospheric flight with a controller and I abhor flying with a mouse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestions for the console version,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Kerbal Alarm clock, add this function to the admin building ( even as a paid level unlock )...\u0022Admin wants a mission to Duna, the transfer window is in three weeks.\u0022 this will give console players an in game transfer planning resource that is sorely needed. Same for an interplanetary course correction Alarm clock, \u0022 Admin wants you to know your TPS reports are out of date, and Duna 1 is due for a course correction..\u0022. Or alarm reminder \u0022That Duna 1 probe should be hitting the atmosphere by now, did you turn it on yesterday like we planned?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Kerb-net, turn on this power hungry application and anomalies will show up if and when they do, also acts as a science reminder, \u0022we\u0027re over Mun pole, should probably take a picture or something..\u0022, \u0022Admin wants to know what this anomaly is on the front page of the newspaper\u0022, have Kerb-net show console players the Biomes and the places they haven\u0027t explored.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Kerbal skills, seriously. Engineers need to be able to scavenge parts from one craft to another, that\u0027s kinda how engineers become engineers in the first place. Science guys should be able to find/identify biomes and anomalies in the game. Pilots should be able to make a guess as to where they will land on a given trajectory, I\u0027m talking about trying to land a pod at KSP. By level 3 these skills should be completely possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Contracts. Really really need to more clear. I can\u0027t stress this enough, they need some proof reading. If I\u0027m continually missing a specific biome or science objective, you could offer a contract and show me what it is I\u0027m missing. Same with Historical records and milestones. Also,\u00A0 If I have a Space Hotel, don\u0027t ask me to build another, ask me to fill it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I suggested, Flight Joystick is something I\u0027m missing in this game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI offer these suggested changes to the console game, mainly because it\u0027s a console game, not a computer game that has a readily accessible google tab I can refer to. I can and do play this console game without Kerb-net, um, without internet connection.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s all I have for now, I\u0027m sure most of the problems I\u0027m having are mostly because of me. I just wanted to add my input thus far as a console gamer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m looking forwards to any expansion or DLC for this Fantastic game!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers all!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrvDancer85","CreatedById":180954,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-21T21:06:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI,ve switched to cursor preset to get rid of the accidental trimmig, it also has better Options for Building but the Camera from radial preset is better imo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf u want to Save a subassembly the Root Part has to have an free Attachment Point (these green/back spheres) reroot the Root Part to something that has an free Attachment Point and then try to save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOlex\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for Interplanetar Planing together with with a maneuvernode from a spacestation orbiting kerbin equatorial.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome kind of Alarm Clock would be nice, with multiple crafts somewhere i find my self spending to much Time in the Tracking Station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nU can close kerbnet by Pressing r1\u002BTriangle Button then the Circle Button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-23T08:26:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2018 08:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PrvDancer85\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
