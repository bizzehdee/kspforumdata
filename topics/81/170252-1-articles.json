It turns out that this is caused by a \u003Cstrong\u003Econtract bug\u003C/strong\u003E. If you have a contract open to capture a specific class of asteroid and you fulfill that requirement, the save glitch will occur 100% of the time. However, if you cancel the contract (or simply don\u0027t take one at all), you can now save the game and progress after capturing an asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve learned that;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-This bug only occurs if you have an active contract to capture an asteroid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-The asteroid you capture MUST fulfill the contract classification requirement for the bug to trigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, if you have a contract to capture a \u0027B\u0027 class asteroid, but you capture an \u0027A\u0027 class instead, then the save bug will not trigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, don\u0027t bother accepting asteroid contracts, because they\u0027ll break your game the moment you fulfill them. (At least for the Xbox version. I would like someone to test this out for the PS4).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squelch","CreatedById":115992,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-30T17:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for the insightful report.
