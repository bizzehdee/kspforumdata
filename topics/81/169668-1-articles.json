When looking at the settings from the pause menu, I can see that many UI elements can be scaled up to be very large, in fact I scaled them back a bit as I don\u0027t need to have them so large even though my TV isn\u0027t the biggest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the most important information on the screen; the information that I actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eneed\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eto see, is too small for me to see. I\u0027m talking about the Apoapsis and Periapsis when hovering over those indicators on the map view. By default these are the only data on the map view that are too small to see, but they are also the only things on the map view that I can\u0027t work out how to scale! I know that on the PC version there is an total UI scale that does make these numbers larger, but sitting next to a monitor I don\u0027t need that as I can see them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan someone let me know how I can change the scale here please. I just can\u0027t see unless I stand and walk across the room to get close enough. I\u0027m hoping that as other UI elements can be scaled to be so fantastically huge, there is indeed an option to scale the most vital\u00A0information when using the map.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
