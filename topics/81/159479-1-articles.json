Now, the game won\u0027t launch anymore. I click on it to launch and in turn it starts, gets to the cinematic of the rocket launching and after that, the game crashes entirely. I\u0027ve deleted and reinstslled the game to see if it helped. Which of course it took even less time to crash after launching. Plus, on my saved games I\u0027m on a restart from crash 68 and I\u0027m really tired of starting over. But until the game gets an update. I know for a fact I\u0027m not the only PS4 player who is tired of the issues that haven\u0027t been fixed, nor the promises that are held up. (They promised an update early this year, we are getting close to halfway through the year). But I digress. My point is I\u0027m complaining and elaborating on the issues I\u0027ve been having with the PS4 edition of KSP and that the game doesn\u0027t work whatsoever for me now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal-Willie","CreatedById":176699,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-20T20:04:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried rebuilding your PS4 database?\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.gadgethelpline.com/rebuild-sony-ps4-database/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELook here for steps to do so\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I would check your storage space to see how much is free.

Rebuilding the database solved the issue. But for KSP being the first game to have ever done this to me (across over 58 PS3 games and over 80 Xbox 360 games as well, then 15 other PS4 games). So, it could not have been the ps4. But its fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
