Ive tried them with three types of booster and one i created myself. The only booster they work on is the hammer well for me anyway. It becomes a problem because i then have the extra weight to try and get an orbit and at a much lesser speed and using more fuel which in turn prevents me from getting to mun for example. Is this a bug or should i be using a bigger decoupler if one exists that is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T14:15:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadial decouplers can be a bit tricky to use when first learning the game, the thing that made it \u0022click\u0022 for me was realizing that in the editor the cursor must be pointed at the decoupler when placing the booster, otherwise it just attaches radially to the core of the rocket and the decoupler does nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Homedawgian","CreatedById":166608,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T14:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had the same issue, just check to make sure it\u0027s attached properly. It helps if you try to look straight down on the decoupler and making sure you can see it after attaching the boosters. If you don\u0027t see them then it\u0027s attached the the actual vessel and not the decoupler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
