When going though the atmosphere there is no lag. But in space there is a whole bunch of lag. The ship had clipped parts such as four vector engines, ion engines, and some struts. The part count was between 20 to 30 parts. So after trying to fix the issue in game by deleting save files and quoting the file I turned of my PS4. It\u2019s not sleeping or resting. But can anyone please help me?
