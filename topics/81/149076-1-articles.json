I started a new save that I am quite proud of but I\u0027ve come across a bug I have no answer to fixing. My contracts get wiped (archives, actives, and available.) It seems this problem only happens when I open up the tracker station and the map in general when I\u0027m flying as well. I have no way to fix this currently and I\u0027ve tried everything I can to find a way including googling this problem that happened on the PC. No luck so far, just need some help with this so I can go back to enjoying the game bug-free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-01T16:59:18Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2016 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DoubleRMoney\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
