I can\u0027t imagine how frustrating it must be to lose saves and have that prospect looming over you at all times while running the game. Console players deserve a fully working product for their full price payment.\u00A0As others have said, PC releases have also shipped with severe bugs, though not as severe as what apparently afflicts consoles at the moment, so we both know and don\u0027t quite know what it\u0027s like. But the core game is so unique and amazing when it does work that\u00A0we\u0027re all in this weird love/hate relationship, wanting the game to get out of its own way so we can enjoy it properly. It\u0027s like if you could buy the Hope Diamond for $40, but it occasionally and unpredictably emits the worst odor you\u0027ve ever smelled and\u00A0paralyzes you so you can\u0027t run away.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for how it got to this point, I speculate (based on no evidence, to be clear)\u00A0that SQUAD simply trusted Flying Tiger too much. FT was hired to do a job, and SQUAD\u0027s technical staff was focused on features and fixes for\u00A0the core game (which is sometimes treated as \u0022the PC release\u0022 but in reality will eventually reach all platforms), so when it came down to it they probably erred on the side of taking FT\u0027s word for it that the port was working. No one wants to think that their business partner is deceptive or incompetent.\u00A0I\u0027m not saying SQUAD did \u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0console QA the last time around, but there\u0027s always a balance between spending more time testing versus getting the product to market, and when those trade-offs come up, it\u0027s easy to shrug and say, \u0022It probably works, it\u0027s mostly the same code as on PC.\u0022 It may well be that their test plan did not include \u0022play for two hours with at least one high part count craft\u00A0and then save and load the game.\u0022\u00A0Then they paid for that at release by finding themselves in the untenable situation of being responsible for a defective product with no simple fixes in sight. My guess is SQUAD will need to fire FTE and take ownership of the console ports in-house for this to get this resolved as it should be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt does seem that as a team, SQUAD lack\u00A0in their\u00A0ability to recognize and cope with truly severe\u00A0problems in general. Sometimes you have to raise a red flag and\u00A0say, \u0022This is simply\u00A0too bad to be acceptable; we need to make a big announcement / we\u00A0can\u0027t release it like this / we have to issue refunds / this shouldn\u0027t be on the store in this state / etc.\u0022\u00A0That\u0027s one commonality I see between the 1.1 release and this console debacle.

I have been patient and I haven\u0027t ripped into them too much because well, excrements happens and we all move on with or lives in the end. but if they have \u0022fixed\u0022 the problem but just dropping the max part count and essentially creating a KSP Jr game. I will move on and forget about this game. the thing that has made me patient is that I figured I would eventually be able to make the big stuff and for now just play with the small stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah that would suck but, I\u0027d say there\u0027s little to no chance that that would happen. Plus, that wouldn\u0027t fix anything, it would just delay the save files from crashing by 66%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Invaderdave","CreatedById":167495,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-23T02:23:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222709879\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022146200\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470687617\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Saidg23\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 8/8/2016 at 3:20 PM, Saidg23 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust back your save up into the cloud or a USB stick. There isn\u0027t much you can do about it others than backing up your save every so often.
