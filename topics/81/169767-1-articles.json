However, there seems to be a simple workaround to avoid the state of the game reverting. Simply accept the contract and wait for a few seconds (20-30 seconds) and then go back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. The contracts should be there. If the contracts are there and the tourists disappear, could you try the same workaround?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrganizedChaos","CreatedById":179666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-18T23:32:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOk, \u00A0thanks for the reply. \u00A0 Just trying to let you know what was going on. \u00A0 I\u0027ll to try for both the tourists and when I warp to the next morning, as well as the tech tree. \u00A0 Just and FYI, it doesn\u0027t revert every time, it happens sporadically so it may take some time to see if the work around is doing anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
