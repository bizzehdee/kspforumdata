For the mun it\u0027s pretty simple if you are in a equatorial orbit, just pull prograde\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:prograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/prograde3.png\u0022 title=\u0022:prograde:\u0022\u003E\u00A0until your apoapsis is about the height of the mun then drag the maneuver node around kerbin until you get an encouter. For minmus it\u0027s a bit harder because it has an inclient orbit to kerbin\u0027s equator. The easiest thing would be is to put your manveuver at the an or dn marks on your orbit (to see the an/dn marks you have to set minus as traget by clicking on it) set your apoapsis to the height of minmus and press the little plus at your maneuver node (the plus is where you\u00A0also can delete your node, if you press it will show the maneuver in the next orbit instead of the current one, you can notice that by the increasing time until you have to burn) until you get the encounter or the closest approch marker are closest to each other, drag the maneuver a bit or play with prograde\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:prograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/prograde3.png\u0022 title=\u0022:prograde:\u0022\u003E\u00A0or retrograde\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/retrograde2.png\u0022 title=\u0022:retrograde:\u0022\u003E\u00A0until you get the encounter. You dont have to wait you could also do a midcourse correction. To get to minmus your ship has to be roughly 90\u00B0 behind minmus if u place your maneuver there pull apoapsis to minmus height the ap/dn marks will be somewhere between your ship and minmus. You have to correct your inclienation by burn normal\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:normal:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/Normal20px.png\u0022 title=\u0022:normal:\u0022\u003E\u00A0or antinormal\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:antinormal:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/Antinormal20px.png\u0022 title=\u0022:antinormal:\u0022\u003E\u00A0at the an/dn marks. You are doing it right when degrees at the an/dn marks are going against zero. You could also shoot yourself to right inclienation right from launch. To do that you have to wait until the launchside is crossing minmis orbit and launch not to west (90) but 7 degrees more north or south depending at you launch at an or dn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor going interplanetar i use\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOlex\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0its a site which will tell you when and how to burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is tutorial section under gameplay questions which may help with a few things when you just getting into ksp, check it out\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-23T14:35:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2018 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by PrvDancer85\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aidan0","CreatedById":193438,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-23T21:19:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank You for the help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrouchyDevotee","CreatedById":175115,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-15T07:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScott Manley has a pile of great tutorials on youtube.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
