While playing on Xbox on the radial preset, my ring station was wiggled apart by the kraken. In response, I built the \u201Ckrakens jaw\u201D and attempted to sacrifice 40, then 20, then 10 kerbals. It was just 8 or 9 Saturn V first stages strutted together with external command seats over the center engines.\u00A0I continued to fail. So now when i want to launch a rocket, i need to recover the kerbals. Then i can\u2019t do anything, cant close the recovery screen, cant get my cursor, its like the screen is frozen, but i can still see trucks moving up the elevators.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-01-01T17:53:41Z\u0022 title=\u002201/01/2021 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 1, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by The wizard of me\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EOrdering\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfernoSD","CreatedById":208873,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-01T21:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not familiar with this bug in particular. Have you tried recovering them from outside the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E? You should be able to see and click them from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E main screen. Otherwise go to the tracking station and recover from there. Hopefully you didn\u0027t somehow ruin that save. If it came down to it, maybe you could fire all astronauts in the astronaut center and hire some new ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor cursor problems, try going into the settings and changing the control preset. Back out so it saves the setting. Then you can go in and change it to radial again immediately. This is what I normally do to regain cursor control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wizard Kerbal","CreatedById":209063,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-03T18:23:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223902358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022199253\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221609537047\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022208873\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022InfernoSD\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/1/2021 at 2:37 PM, InfernoSD said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou should be able to see and click them from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E main screen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0But there\u2019s 41 of them.
