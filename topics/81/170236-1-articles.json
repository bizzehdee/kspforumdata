When leaving the tracking station, mission control, or the R\u0026amp;D building the game would not load the incoming interface. \u00A0Instead it would continue to show me the building I was in, while (I think) it thought I was back at the space center. (I thought this because a few of the UI buttons showed). \u00A0Also one time it gave me a ghosted view of R\u0026amp;D and another UI I don\u0027t recognize. (screen shot below)\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. After going to the Mun or other place that took some time to reach I could no longer save or switch back to the space center or tracking station. \u00A0The times I could get to the tracking station I could not select to fly a vessel and when I would try to quit, nothing would happen. \u00A0I had no choice but to force-close the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThen I got hit by what seems to be the big bug.\u003C/strong\u003E \u00A0After saving and quitting one time, after my manual save had finished, I turned off the xbox (via the xbox menu) before the title screen loaded. \u00A0This seems to have \u00A0caused severe corruption for all saves including the ships. \u00A0This caused me to lose all my progress, while the game seemed to have loaded my save I could not launch a new ship and I had to delete my profile data both local and online before I could do anything else.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WPSXF1b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WPSXF1b.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
