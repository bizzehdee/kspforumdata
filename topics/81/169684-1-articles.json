The disappearance of contracts happens frequently. If I immediately go back to mission control after the contract disappears in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and re-select the contract(s) and return to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E the contract(s) stick. It\u0027s irritating. I have also had contracts repeat themselves immediately after they were completed and, if selected again, disappear from the list of accepted contracts. The R\u0026amp;D tech regression has happened only once so far. All this has happened while playing career and using the cursor setup. Not that using the cursor setup seems to matter to the game as it always reverts to radial. I\u0027m really glad TakeTwo offered up the \u0022enhanced\u0022 version of the game for free, but it\u0027s a bit like being given a \u002771 Chevy Vega that has been \u0022enhanced\u0022 with stickers. It doesn\u0027t look different, really, and it still a smoky, clanky\u00A0lemon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leopard","CreatedById":167666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-21T23:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhad this on Eggbox EE as well, accept a contract and by the time you launch its gone, going back to the mission control centre indicates not only has that contract gone, but apparently I\u0027ve never accepted, completed or declined any contracts either, and the missing uncompleted one isn\u0027t on the available list either\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darbiz56","CreatedById":208596,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-12-08T05:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2020 and I still cannot find a solution to this problem.
