It worked for about 8 - 10 hours until I inadvertently backed\u00A0up\u00A0a corrupted game which also got auto uploaded and over-wrote the earlier, working save in the cloud. It would seem that there is no way to determine whether any given instance of the game is corrupted or not before backing it up. I was hopeful that this would be an acceptable work around, but it is just adding more frustration and making me hate a game that I truly love.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my experience, corruption tends to happen shortly after I complete a flight and return to the space center.\u00A0 The game seems to save when returning to the space center, so my theory is that it\u0027s at that point the system identifies the save as corrupted and you get that dreaded \u0027corrupt data\u0027 error.\u00A0 So what I tend to do when I\u0027m done playing is return from a flight, then go and clean up ship debri.\u00A0 I give the game a couple of minutes to see if I\u0027ll get the error.\u00A0 I then close the game, and I update my save on the thumb drive before I boot\u00A0the game\u00A0up the next time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI remember one instance where I saved a corrupted save - I had just returned from my first trip to and from Minmus, so I hurried and overwrote the old save as soon as I recovered my ship.\u00A0 Big mistake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-20T19:34:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had this problem!
