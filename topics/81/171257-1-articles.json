Probably being covered or talked about elsewhere, whatever. I signed up to this forum to report this bug that literally breaks the game for me until fixed. While navigating the space center and it\u0027s building menus, I noticed on several occasions when I back out of the mission control building my screen locks up. Now mind you I can still select other building menus in the background but the mission control menu with all the missions stays stuck on the screen. Can\u0027t leave, can\u0027t back out can\u0027t go to main menu, have to hard reset the game every time. Happens a lot. My other issue (whether related or not) happens during a long mission. Example: Recently had to land on mun again, halfway through the mission I my menu doesn\u0027t work. The only options I have are to revert to launch/assembly or hard reset the game. Can\u0027t load a previous save, can\u0027t do anything. This is especially frustrating after completing an entire moon landing mission in one sitting. In one attempt I got back home and wasn\u0027t able to recover my vessel. Not via the menu or even the cursor option at the top of the screen. I couldn\u0027t even load a quick save I had made just in case. Real buzzkill. Real nervous to attempt really intense, long term missions without being able to do things like save or be able to transition from flying a ship to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I wish I had a sequence for events for you guys but I honestly don\u0027t do anything major. I use the default control settings btw. My only instinct says it has to do with me constantly using the cursor instead of scrolling the menu. But I really need to be able to use the cursor, it\u0027s really important to the game. Anyway thanks for hopefully reading this and knowing what is going on.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuick edit: Mission control bug doesn\u0027t happen unless I decline multiple missions in one sitting. I tried declining one at a time and pressing b after each individual one and had no issues. If I decline multiple contracts it causes the mission menu to lock up. Can\u0027t back out with b.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-23T12:55:46Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2018 12:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by iGodly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EExperimented with the issue\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
