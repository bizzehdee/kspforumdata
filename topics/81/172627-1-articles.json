Get the intercept marker to give you the closest approach by putting the cursor on it and hitting the Circle button on PS4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will probably have to increase or decrease each of the following: move the node forward/backward, radial in/radial out, normal/anti-normal, and of course the pro-grade/retro-grade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo each thing one at a time, watching the intercept marker for its closest value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you have an Sphere of influence intercept, do the burn and wait. Good time to level up some Kerbins and get that science from your labs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout 1/3 of the way there you may have to do another manoeuvre, due to... (Solar wind or kerbal calculation errors)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheck again by 2/3 of the way there to insure you still hit your target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few great beginner/intermediate videos on you-tube.
