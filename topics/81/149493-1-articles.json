Save corrupt data, losing awesome ships and game progress. I\u00A0backed up my saves every time I quit playing for the evening but it is starting to become more of a hassle than fun. I quit playing the game once my PS4 froze up 2\u00A0times and i had to unplug it just to get it turn off and get back to normal. When it happened the second time I knew that KSP could potentially mess up my PS4 so I\u0027m done until the devs can fix this and assure me that this will not happen again. At this point I kind of want a refund for the game but I love the idea of it and when it is working the game is so awesome but I\u0027m not taking the chance with the system. Sorry you are having the same problem \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-GT\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nascarlaser1","CreatedById":166190,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-09T22:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222793237\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149493\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475935957\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022169558\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jamillikan\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn \u200E10\u200E/\u200E8\u200E/\u200E2016 at 10:12 AM, Jamillikan said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello I am very frustrated right now.
