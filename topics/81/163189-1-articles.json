The game was made for PC, and the controls were made for keyboard, and the experience would be significantly worse using a controller.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: you might be able to. Plug in your controller, go into settings \u0026gt; inputs, then try and bind keys to controller buttons.

Your controller needs to be connected before launching KSP and remain connected the entire play session (it cannot be re-connected), otherwise it will not work!\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve been using my controller plugged in via USB mainly to avoid the bluetooth connection issues.
