Either time happened differently but with common characteristics.. The first one happened in the tracking station and I had just chose a vehicle to control...\u00A0 I restarted the game with no apparent issues but that Jeb lost his experience some how.. Attempted to do same steps prior to crash but everything worked.\u00A0 The second time happened shortly there after but while in map mode and again attempting to switch to another vehicle...\u00A0 Just before the first crash I\u0027d created a reusable lander and had docked it to a station around the Mun..\u00A0 There were two other vehicles docked as well to the station and after the lander docked the system got really slow... \u00A0The lander is on the mun right now and things seem to be working ok but with me saving every time i do something now...\u00A0 Play the game for a bit today and it seemed like it was normal....\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I wondering if the console version creates a log file or something?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-22T14:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203477-dew169/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022203477\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/203477-dew169/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Dew169\u003C/a\u003E. No I don\u0027t think it does. Xbox version for me can be buggy, and can crash. How big was the vessel you swapped to the second time part count wise, 20 parts, 10, 100??\u00A0Sometimes the game lags itself out because of part count or the amount of vessels in physics distance. If you have\u00A0 around 100ish parts, the game could lag itself out. Sometimes the game will lag out with the amount of docked together vessels screwing up some how. Ive seen them jump (On a docked together base on Kerbin) up to 100m in the air, screwing up my base badly, breaking half of my station. It could be any of these things. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196142-mikenike/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022196142\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196142-mikenike/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Mikenike\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0when you get back with an answer so I can help you the best I can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dew169","CreatedById":203477,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-22T23:26:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196142-mikenike/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022196142\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/196142-mikenike/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Mikenike\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Both times I was switching back to small utility vehicle that I was using to deorbit old boosters from early in the game.. \u00A0that vehicle is about 20 parts.
