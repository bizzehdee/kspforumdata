Exactly the same situation as what others have written about in this message area. I am using a Xbox One X. This is such a great game, at a perfect time in aerospace history - but it continues to struggle with the most basic of function on game consoles. To whomever is responsible for development of the console version (Xbox \u0026amp; PS), please take a look at this issue. Thank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
