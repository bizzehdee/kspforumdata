If you have an active contract to capture a certain class of asteroid, then the game will glitch the moment you fulfill that requirement. However, if you cancel the contract (or don\u0027t take one at all), then the save bug will not trigger.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, if you have a contract to capture a certain asteroid class, but capture a different class instead, then the bug will not trigger.
