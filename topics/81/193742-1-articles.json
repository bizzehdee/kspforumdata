That\u2019s what the purple makers represent. I think it gets set when you press in on the thumb stick while maneuvering. Since you also press in on the thumb stick to change cameras this can result in inadvertently setting the trim. I\u2019d recommend going in to settings and turning trim off entirely. I did that a long time ago because I was having the same problem which I why I don\u2019t remember exactly how it gets set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikey117","CreatedById":169509,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-10T11:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure about other controls.
