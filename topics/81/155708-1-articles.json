I\u0027ve heard that someone in Squad talked to a Ps4 user and said that the update won\u0027t come until many months, like June. I also know that you guys said that it would come out in early 2017. Is this still true or are you bumping up the release window? Would like to hear back soon from you guys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, bye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbals Love Space","CreatedById":174214,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-31T05:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI said the same thing.
