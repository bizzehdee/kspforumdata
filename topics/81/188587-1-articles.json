I\u0027m here because i have had at least 5 contracts flat out break for no apparent reason and ive only had the game for about two days. Current one, after restarting 3 times, several hard resets, redownloads, etc., is the flea booster test. Several times ive had all conditions green, ive tested, ive hit through sequence, i have done everything i can think or find\u00A0to get this to work, to no avail. Im going crazy here, litterally losing sleep over it. I love this game so much its depressing how bad career mode is breaking. The saddest part is, i know there\u0027s nothing that can be done other than a patch, and there are posts just like mine dating months and months back, so what the hell is going on? I\u0027d be satisfied with at least a reason to why the game is broken, and has remained broken for so long. I paid good money to be able to play career mode,\u00A0so i want it to work properly and it just doesnt seem like anythings being done about it. If i would\u0027ve known career mode was unplayable, i absolutely would have thought twice about my purchase.\u00A0Any replies, good or bad, are appreciated. I think its time the developers get with the program and at least explain to the people paying their bills, why our games arent working.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Imagine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrvDancer85","CreatedById":180954,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-02T12:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah you\u0027re right that some contracts just wont work, wich is ultra annoying.
