So, without heat shields or wings but with a lot of spinning in every direction I somehow was able to get to the point where I was able to deploy parachutes on the half of the probe tat was left and start slowly falling toward the sea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt about 4500m I\u00A0realized it\u0027d take me a while to get down at my current rate of 3 m/s so I decided to cut some parachutes. Now, not wanting to be reckless, I did a quicksave first and after cutting I decided I was going a bit faster than I liked and loaded my quicksave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOpon it loading I heard a small puff, no longer see my ship, and my speed reading says \u0022Surface 414413930.6 m/s\u0022. The flight results log showed I had splashed down hard and was destroyed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bit surprising, because as I said before I had been at 4500m and falling 3 m/s when I saved. Reloading the save a couple times yielded effectively the same result each time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Justin_Kerbal","CreatedById":168262,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T20:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m unsure how the quick saves even work in general. When I try to \u0022quick load\u0022, I see the same 10 or so game saves. I can\u0027t tell which save is from which flight. When I try to quick load I usually get switched to a different flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erikinthebakery","CreatedById":166663,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T21:12:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I\u0027ve observed it to work is that you have one persistent (automatic) save, one quick save (mid flight), and how ever many regular saves (named, saved from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E) you\u0027d like. Confusingly, the regular save names are auto populated as \u0022quicksave #1\u0022,\u0022quicksave #2\u0022, ect. Due to the console save bug I\u0027ve been keeping it down to only one regular save so I know I loaded the correct flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(If you want to know which save is which flight, sometimes it can help to go to the space center and load the save from there. That way at least you have things like the in-game date/time, funds, and number of flights to help you)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
