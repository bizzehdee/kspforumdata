Once I get to the Mun and especially Minmus when I plot a return to Kerbin Maneuvre Node the controls for the space craft stop responding i.e. I have no control of directional controls (Roll, Pitch and Yaw). Radial menus work and I can use Right thumb stick to look around. Staging also stops functioning. The game crashed last night while making the Maneuver Node to return to Kerbin.\u00A0Currently lost in space around Minmus please help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMursaro \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrvDancer85","CreatedById":180954,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-23T12:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre u running out of ec?
