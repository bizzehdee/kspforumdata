I just started playing this game on Xbox 1 (I don\u0027t have a computer capable of running the game) and I\u0027m hooked! It makes me want to join the Airforce, Nasa, or SpaceX.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said that, those 3 goals\u00A0seem just as arduous as dealing with these bugs. Here\u0027s my list:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Not able to select parts- sometimes it just takes more clicks than 1. Sometimes nothing is clickable except start menu and flight controls. Often happens when transferring fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Saves loaded from quick load do not give right save. I workaround by always loading from space center. (This is not that bad, really).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Rovers bounce uncontrollably on warps 2, 3, and 4. This often results in destruction of the vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E does not hold prograde \u00A0or retrograde or anything other than stability assist while cursor mode is active. Annoying, not the worst.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Vehicles explode on load. In orbit, on the ground, and always previously stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVehicles sometimes randomly explode. On a mission to Eve I successfully managed to fall with chutes (maybe not necessary) and during the descent the ship started to shake and rotate, then pull itself apart, resulting in an achievement for escaping eve\u0027s orbit... \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Maybe someone can help me navigate to a reporting page or give me a previously solved post. I hope the devs have fixes for this issue. Enjoy the game still, but don\u0027t fault folks for wanting money back. It\u0027s terribly frustrating to dedicate an hour or two to unfixable catastrophic failures that aren\u0027t a fault of user error.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galileo","CreatedById":150430,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-22T00:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is currently being worked on for consoles with a release in a few months. This will come with a lot of fixes, many of which you are experiencing. There are quite a few threads detailing the development of console versions. Currently, there aren\u0027t any fixes for your issues unfortunately.
