Caught it, orbited it and game wouldnt save. Oh well, no biggie right? Restart game, load up save and go to bring it back in. As soon as i go to switch to my craft, game froze. Restart my game and low and behold.... my freaking save file is gone. Poof, GONE. Just freaking deleted. I thought this was fixed? Is this MAJOR bug ever going to be fixed? I adore this game but this is beyond unacceptable especially since this was supposed to be fixed. This isnt my first wipe but this is the most heart breaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SnowxSakura","CreatedById":171647,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-04T16:25:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVersion 1.2 is going to be updated sometime early this year with no specified date given yet.
