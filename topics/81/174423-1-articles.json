I am running KSP on my PS4 Pro. I am playing the game for about a week now on my console, the list of saved quick saves is pretty long.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOfcourse I can delete them one by one, but it takes about 5-20 seconds to remove each. Can this process be speeded up in the next update?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome kind of \u2018select\u2019\u00A0or \u2018remove all\u2019 option would be awesome. Is there a release date available for the next update?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep up the good work guys \u003Cspan\u003E:)!\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrganizedChaos","CreatedById":179666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-30T12:06:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere isn\u2019t a quick way to delete the saves, but you can keep them from building up. \u00A0When ever you save just rename the save, and then every\u00A0save just use the same save name and it will save over your previous one. \u00A0This\u00A0way you can control the amount of save files you have without having to delete so many.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrouchyDevotee","CreatedById":175115,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-01T16:14:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI frequently use the \u0027quicksave\u0027 slot when I\u0027m about to land or perform other risky manoeuvres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I\u0027m Saving my game before shutting it off ( or between missions ) I just rename the first \u0027quicksave #1\u0027 slot to \u0027quicksave 1\u0027.
