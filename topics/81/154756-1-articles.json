I had just finished launching my \u0022Euclid\u0022 rocket boosted suborbital space plane. I had landed the capsule and was about to recover it when I noticed I couldn\u0027t scroll between options in the option menu, I turned on cursor, and it fixed that problem, but I couldn\u0027t select any. And so I said \u0022Hmmm, That\u0027s strange..\u0022 and so I tried going out of the Esc menu, and I couldn\u0027t select any there either. And so I said \u0022I just have to close it. And I did, and it fixed. But also I heard this guy say (I forget who this was) \u0022The 100% PS4 save fix is to when you get the crash report, close it before it gets to the error message.\u0022 And so guess what? It didn\u0027t work! (Sorry I\u0027m speaking like this Squad, I had a very bad day at school missed a field trip etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
