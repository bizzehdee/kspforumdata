I wasn\u0027t sure what those were at the time but after Google searching it seems to be this feature called trim. However when I went through the in\u00A0game controls and again went to google they all told me the same thing, on Cursor controls use LB\u002BA and on Radial use LB\u002BLeft Stick button. I tried switching between both control schemes and inputting the controls to reset trim but they won\u0027t dissapear. I was so close to getting to\u00A0Gilly and now I have to go back to the planning board and either wait for Eve to make a full orbit or modify the\u00A0rocket because of this.\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-05-25T18:02:26Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2018 06:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Capnalex019\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
