It\u0027s been some time since Making History was released.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve found out that there is a hiccup/stutter at around 2km altitude or maybe a 2km sphere around the kerbal space center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you go too fast(260-300m/s\u002B) at this point, the game will consistently crash. Throttling down a few seconds prevent the crash from happening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis kinda limits us to slow and heavy rockets for the time being.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn reentry, less consistently though, the game might crash if you generate too much heat vs your speed and angle of entry. But I can skim the atmosphere without crashing, diving a shuttle lower through the atmosphere ( an unstable orbit with an altitude of 30km in the atmosphere on one side and 100km on the other side) usually ends up crashing before the shuttle\u0027s nose blows up due to heat. But not always.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you approach the kerbal space center\u0027s landing strip, where the beach is, that is where the same hiccup occurs as when you take off. I haven\u0027t managed to crash the game at that stage but I\u0027m pretty sure if you go fast enough, it will crash too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI once passed over\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with a velocity of around 1500m/s at 5km alt and the game did not crash, so it\u0027s really related to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E i think.( unpowered shuttle landing test where I overshot).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope the devs find this information of some use if their own investigations haven\u0027t led them in that direction already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave a good day \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
