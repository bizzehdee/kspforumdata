The trailer and the devnotes certainly didn\u0027t say PC only.\u00A0There has been all this talk about how KSP on consoles is actually \u003Cem\u003Enot\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ea different game, which is why there is no KSP console subforum except for this one, which is regarding technical support. Well, I tried to ask about 1.2 on consoles in the \u0022official 1.2 release\u0022 thread and then saw the official teaser, and the mods there didn\u0027t seem to think my question about 1.2 on console was worthy of any respect or consideration. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002227914\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/27914-vanamonde/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Vanamonde\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0is acting as if this has already been answered, which it hasn\u0027t, or that it is just beneath his and others\u00A0regard.

It took them a year to port that broken version to consoles, so we should expect to see a broken release of 1.2 on consoles in about a year I guess.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-10T00:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167737-uomocapra/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022167737\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167737-uomocapra/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@UomoCapra\u003C/a\u003E, would you like to give an official statement about this issue?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"morpheus2n2","CreatedById":41497,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-10T07:35:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI too would love to know what the stat of game is in the console space \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NuclearMikenetic","CreatedById":169823,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T02:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould there be a separate forum for us console people?

This is horrendous. And a ps4 patch is nowhere to be seen.\u00A0 I really don\u0027t think we\u0027ll ever see 1.2 in console,\u00A0 EVER. Two weeks to a month? You\u0027ve got to be kidding me.\u00A0 Maybe they\u0027re too busy trying to unleash this mess onto another platform (wii u). I mean they wouldn\u0027t even respond to a moderator on their forum.\u00A0 We need to petition to get this game off the market and a general refund offer made,\u00A0 is there precedent for this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there is precedent for this. I guess you could compare it to the release of Payday 2 on console, but that release\u00A0had tons of bad press, and has really tainted the development company Overkill and their reputation. There has been absolutely\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eno\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0bad press for KSP on console, and the only backlash has been here in these forums, which just gets ignored.

That\u0027s the only reason they plan to release on the Wii U.\u00A0That\u0027s the reason that they hired Flying Tiger instead of hiring a competent company or actually porting it themselves.\u00A0They wanted to do the least amount of work possible,\u00A0spend as little as possible, and\u00A0get the highest profits in return. The real cost of course falls back onto us customers, and we are left stuck with a broken game with no possibility of a refund.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA petition sound great, but I also think that this game needs to start getting some of the bad press it deserves so much.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T22:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222798291\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149572\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476225914\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166802\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RW1984\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, RW1984 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you\u0027re telling me squad and flying Tiger have been dragging their heels on the patch and releasing a broken patch because people are complaining?
