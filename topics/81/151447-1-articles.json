So I still can\u0027t build basic aircrafts\u00A0with those basic static landing gears, as it will just clip into the ground and explode or do any other bizarre thing than work properly. It\u0027s simple frustating that after quite a few months from buying a game that IS NOT on PREVIEW or Alpha Version I still can\u0027t play it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, can anyone else confirm this bug is still here?
