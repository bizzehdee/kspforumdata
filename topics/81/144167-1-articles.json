If this turns out to be useless I\u0027ll delete. I\u0027ll be erasing the already fixed bugs from the list (Feel free to add more).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I\u0027ve only found about about the Bug Reporter now, didn\u0027t know I do anything there but to see which bugs have already been addressed. So I\u0027ll be reporting these bugs from the list there as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Unable to target a survey/observation mission marker from the Map View mode. When I click over the marker a small blank window pops up (also dropping my frames down to somewhat close to 5FPS until I close the window). This same window should have a button called \u0022Activate Navigation\u0022 so I could see the survey place from the NavBall\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Cannot change Damper and Spring values of landing gears like in the PC version - It doesn\u0027t show up when I open the landing gear settings\u00A0window in the editor\u00A0(Bug?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-When I build crafts with the landing gears connected to an aerodynamic part or a girder strut and try launching it, as soon as the game loads on the runway the landing gear wheels are kind of stuck into the ground and start jumping in place (the wheel stress bar also keeps jumping as if it was hitting the ground constantly). The same thing happens when these same wheel get in contact with the terrain (I tried dropping the craft from a small height with the Launch Stability Enhancer, but as soon as the wheels touch the ground this glitch happens)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Cannot see the \u0022Gear blocked Yes/No\u0022 indicator when opening the context menu on the landing gears.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Sometimes I cannot close a opened context menu nor can open others, forcing me to reload the game. This happened yesterday, I opened the context menu from the air intake from my craft and couldn\u0027t close it by pressing B, nor could I open other\u0027s parts context menus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-FPS drop with\u00A0Dynawing Final Approach Scenario and Dynawing Reentry Scenario (Seriously needs a fix on these FPS drops - I\u0027ve bought KSP on console because my PC wouldn\u0027t run it very well. And then I have FPS drops (Noticeable Drops!) on the Xbox as well...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Tutorial mission popup\u0027s always take me off the craft controls. This is a problem in tutorials which involves orbiting maneuvers. As I\u0027m trying to cut throttle to stop a\u00A0burn the\u00A0bloody menu pops up, forcing me to have to switch back to ship controls first so I can then cut the burn (it normally makes my burns go past the line, forcing me to burn retrograde (or the opposite) to fix it).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Crafts falling into the ground and exploding when loading a quicksave on the runway\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Unable to switch steerable landing gear control to trigger button. I wish you could set the steer axis to the trigger as you can do with Yaw controls when activating Advanced Flight Mode (\u0026lt;Modifier\u0026gt; \u002B \u0026lt;Y\u0026gt;)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-19T21:55:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2016 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arch3rAc3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding Information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Homedawgian","CreatedById":166608,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-19T22:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRemoved, wrong thread sry\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-19T23:37:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/19/2016 11:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Homedawgian\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemoved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crabman","CreatedById":162304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-23T01:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve bought for Xbox One because my computer can\u0027t handle very nicely, but when I play on my Xbox I have HUGE fps drops.

When we want to patch the consoles we merge PC commits and work on the custom code and assets that are needed to make it run on the consoles. The console builds then have to go through certification with the console manufacturer (Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo) before we can make them available. As a result the consoles are likely to run a little bit behind compared to the PC releases, but we will keep updating all platforms as we move forward.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
