It is not game breaking but adding longer loading screen to hide this may look better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Sometimes windows (at least the notification about new achievements) can not be closed. Once you open it, and switch off the cursor mode (L3) the \u0022continue\u0022 and \u0022exit\u0022 buttons does not appear and window can not be closed. It is drawing the focus, so the game becomes unplayable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) I still have a problem that from time to time my ship is not responding to any commands (rotations, staging). This happens both in ships and EVA (can not move the Kerbal). Switching to tracking station and back helps. Here are some potentional problems I alraedy excluded:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- I have electricity (so the rotation is not stopped because of this)\u003Cbr\u003E\n- I dont have locked staging mode\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Im not in the time warp mode\u003Cbr\u003E\n- I dont have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs far as I know all these can also \u0022lock you our from controls\u0022 (and as noob it took me while to fiure them out when I had these problems by mistake). But when the problem occurs it has to be even something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Sometimes progress is not saved when switching between buildings or recovering vessels. For example you accept the mission, go back to the space center and the mission is not accepted and you have to do it again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSimilar problem leads to loose of mission progress. I have mission to test chute. I completed the mission (all green in the mission log, I got the notifications about obejctives and contract completed. I could see the money on my account). But as soon as I recovered the vessel, the mission was again active and no money on my account. Recovery behaved like loading the state before mission. I tried this several times with same result. What helped is to save the game during the mission (when objectives are completed). Then they remained completed even after ship recovery.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApart from this, the game is running fine for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agarwel","CreatedById":174538,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T12:35:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Also when reverting flight back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, the ship and crew remains on the launch pad.

When you switch to radial (L3) two prompts should apper at the bottom of the window (close and erase? X and O?) This happens most of the times. But sometimes when switching between modes, these promts does not appeat and X/O buttons dont work. So there is no way to close the windows. You can only scroll the text by the right stick. But that is all. But you can not delete the notification not matter how many times you witch between cursor/radils menu by L3, no matter what where you click on the screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrganizedChaos","CreatedById":179666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T13:25:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGotcha, \u00A0using that screen shot, see the little blue planet marker in top right corner. \u00A0Try putting the curser on that and hitting the square button. \u00A0I know you can normally delete those from there, that\u0027s how I usually delete them. \u00A0It\u0027s probably a bug that you can\u0027t delete it the way you normally do, might you \u00A0still be able to delete it the way I do. \u00A0Again, I believe it\u0027s the square button, but I\u0027m not %100 on that part, \u00A0it\u0027s one\u00A0of the buttons though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-23T13:28:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/23/2018 01:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 23, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by OrganizedChaos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agarwel","CreatedById":174538,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T13:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tryied that.
