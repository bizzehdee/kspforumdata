Spent hours sending up a probe, outfitted with drills, converters , 4 nuclear engines, refueled 4 times so I\u0027d have enough fuel to get to it to intercept it, finally get to the asteroid, lined up to its orbit retrograde so I can start to capture it into Kerbins orbit, as I get the giddy feeling that all my hard work has paid off, game freezes as soon as I dock.Tried 4 times to be sure game locks up everytime. VERY FRUSTRATING. To my surprise I\u0027ve never encountered the game breaking save corrupt glitch after spending several days on the game...didn\u0027t even knew it existed until I began searching for others having issues docking to the asteroids. Really up to this point the\u00A0worst thing I\u0027ve noticed is severe fps drop whenever rendezvousing with a space station/other craft\u00A0or launching ships above 100 part count\u00A0\u00A0(which is a bummer considering I bought this game for console because my laptop did just that, but my laptop doesn\u0027t have the cores,\u00A0memory, and graphics card the xbox one has;\u00A0which apparently doesn\u0027t help at all... my laptop runs it better in that regard) But really all the issues I\u0027m reading here on the forums really disappoints me that squad\u00A0and or FT QA is so lax. Game really should\u0027ve been in the game preview program if not held off for release completely!. As others have repeatedly stated, looks a lot like another studio trying to milk it\u0027s fanbase. I\u0027m sure that A LOT of people who did buy it for console, did solely in hopes that their expensive 8th gen console would run it better than their 5\u002B year old laptops and desktops which is surely not the case. Really hope you guys at Squad and or FT get your stuff together and make this right ksp is a GREAT game, but you are really gonna put off a lot of people with this terrible effort at a port....Disappointed is the best way I can describe it currently.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RogerCoyote","CreatedById":120613,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-21T00:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis game is great an it looks that was made with love.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease SQUAD don\u0027t let that Flying Tiger kills this game on consoles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
