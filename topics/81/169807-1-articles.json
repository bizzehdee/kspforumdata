But today the game had extreme lags, maybe 5fps ( I didn\u0027t count). When the engines are running or parachutes are open it\u0027s all fine and smooth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nControls are radial on Xbox One X. I have deleted the Savegame, but after one start it happens again. Power off the Console with no effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you can help and sorry for the bad English.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
