While playing around trying to launch a big orbital scanner satellite, I went to switch to map mode, only to see... my craft flying on Kerbin, with a white circle in the background. The text said \u0022Focus: Kerbin\u0022, and I was able to scroll through all the planets, but my orbit path was not displayed. It\u0027s irreversible, and the pause menu is also \u0022frozen\u0022 in that none of the buttons do anything except \u0022Revert flight\u0022- that one causes the game to freeze entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears to be linked to the use of larger fairing sizes... I think. So far, both of my largest rockets do this, and they both have the 3.75m fairing piece installed. Oddly enough, it doesn\u0027t happen with any other of my crafts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any fix to this? I have yet to try launching my rockets with the fairings removed to see if that\u0027s the issue...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheGoldenPickaxe","CreatedById":176703,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T23:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish i could help, but i use xbox one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"James M","CreatedById":167171,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T11:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI couldn\u0027t give you a definitive answer as both consoles have their fair share of bugs and crashes. My best advice to you however is to continue testing your theory with the fairings and if it proves correct most of the time, then report it to squad on their bug tracker. Hopefully they can fix it before the 1.2 release sometime this year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elwood","CreatedById":177003,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-29T20:40:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen many PS4 bugs, but not this one. \u00A0I have launched with the XL fairing and it worked fine for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
