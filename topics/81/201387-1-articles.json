It seems to load the auto-saved craft when this happens. Deleting the auto-save craft will subvert the issue but trying to launch after doing this will sometimes send you to the space center screen, and not the launch pad or runway. It\u0027s not a game-breaking bug, but it does get annoying when trying to make modifications to a craft, only to then launch the version with no modifications.\u00A0 Also first post!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfernoSD","CreatedById":208873,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-02T08:58:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou probably manually save your craft before clicking the launch button, like I do. Give it ten seconds or so to finish saving before clicking launch and this bug won\u0027t occur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt has been around\u00A0for a couple years, so I don\u0027t expect it to ever be fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-02T17:22:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh. I play\u00A0KSP on the PS4\u00A0and the PC. On this PS4 this is a common issue I found. Usually I save the rocket I just biult and put another part oni it.
