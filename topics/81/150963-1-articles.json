I have been playing off-and-on on PC for a long time. I cannot place maneuver nodes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn preparation for the inevitable responses, let me clarify: I have upgraded everything several times as my inability to place maneuver nodes started in-game. So, that\u0027s not the problem. I have reloaded and still can\u0027t do it. I started a new game completely and that also didn\u0027t work. I can\u0027t even place maneuver nodes in Sandbox mode or the training levels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope someone can help me out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks, Jon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunnfore","CreatedById":167649,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-27T20:53:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums jon! To place a manuver node, you need to first be in map mode, then depress the left gamepad stick to enable/disable the mouse cursor. When you see the mouse cursor, place it over the spacecraft\u0027s orbit and hit the A button. A choice dialogue box should come up that allows you to warp ahead or place a manuver node. The interface a little glitchy, and it takes some practice to get used to. The key point to remember is how to enable/disable the mouse cursor. (this function works anywhere in the game) I hope this helps, if you have any more questions feel free to ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jonfortunately","CreatedById":170889,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-28T11:10:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222826507\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022150963\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221477601586\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167649\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dunnfore\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, Dunnfore said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forums jon!

I travelled to other planets in my system. I played multiple tutorials to learn the game mechanics. I could create maneuver nodes before, but can no longer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
