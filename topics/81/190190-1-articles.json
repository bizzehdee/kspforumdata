I started on Hard difficulty with enabled revert and quickload. Also enabled part preasure and g-force for parts and kerbals with plasma blackout and require signal options. When I unlock the tech with FL-100 Fuel Tank it keeps duplicating and have to purchase the entry fee for that part over and over again whenever I enter tha \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or the Tech tree, also this tank part is dupIicating every time I repurchase it, so by now I have 3 of this sane FL-100 at the tech tree. I already tried to delete and reinstall the game with the dlcs and also deleted every save file, but without any success of solving this tiny but anoying bug.
