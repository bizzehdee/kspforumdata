Do this by making a connector part (decoupler/docking port etc) the root part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can then open subassembly menu then\u00A0drag and drop it into the Gray box at the bottom to save.

Say you wanted a dedicated lifter. But you want to be able to change or swap out the payload etc. You can have your main craft saved as lifter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen start a new craft build for satellite or payload.Once you are happy with the payload(lander or Sat etc) you change the root part to the point you want to attach to lifter. Docking port /decoupled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow when you click that piece it picks up the whole craft. You then open subbassembly window , drag and drop craft/payload into the grey box at the bottom and save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now you can use this method to build multiple different satellites , landers etc all saved into subbassembly page.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0You can then just load\u00A0your seperately saved lifter/vessel. Open the subbassembly window then just pick payload you want and pop it straight on to the pre built rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo for example I have a 15 ton capable lifter with a docking port and fairing. So I know i can then build a new vessel under 15tons test it etc then once I\u0027m happy I can just pop it on the lifter and save as\u00A0 station module 2 etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo you don\u0027t have to build a new rocket for every new module or lander etc to be sent up. When ready for a new module or payload you\u00A0just open previous craft remove payload add new payload from subbassembly rename and off you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
