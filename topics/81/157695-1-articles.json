My main problem is that when I go out to the launch pad and runway, my stage light is always stuck on purple (locked) so I\u0027m unable to launch anything. I\u0027ve tried to toggle it by holding X\u00A0and then pressing L1 which is what it says to do in the controls, but that never works. I\u0027ve also noticed that this seems to only occur when I don\u0027t have control of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chimpbone","CreatedById":167310,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T17:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntry pressing down the left analog stick to take control of the ship when on the launch pad. it sounds like you are in cursor mode. if you can see a mouse cursor, press down the left analog. hope that helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Myrrhman","CreatedById":184482,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-23T16:56:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor PS4, press\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nL1 And X\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nat the same time.

The issue for me was not knowing that\u00A0there even was a way to lock/unlock staging and\u00A0that it would persist after reverting, recovering/relaunching, switching ships, saving/reloading, the later of which would make sense for it to persist even though it doesn\u0027t do so after restarting the game.\u00A0So I hope this\u00A0helps anyone\u00A0searching for a solution to the purple staging light.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Awesomebow","CreatedById":195300,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-06T21:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I\u2019m on Xbox and the same thing happens to me, along with a few other game breaking bugs\u00A0at other times, I just reset it and no matter what the bug it always ended up fine\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-02-06T21:55:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/06/2019 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 6, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Awesomebow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gene the Science Machine","CreatedById":199680,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-08-22T22:00:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPress the light while in cursor mode\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSP Kermit","CreatedById":222526,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-08-15T21:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is old but i clicked the greem staging button twice and it worcked\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
