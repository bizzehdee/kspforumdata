I am playing on xb1. Love this game on pc and now console and have much patience for it....but how is Jeb going to complete the more tricky maneuvers?....hope it\u0027s me or is it a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakau","CreatedById":166647,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T12:29:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the same issue. It seems the position of the white circle won\u0027t move unless the cursor is directly on the orbital path. So you have to trace a circle over your orbit with your thumbstick to get it to move smoothly, which is a bit of a pain. It would be nice if the game just looked at side-side movement as clockwise or anti-clockwise in this circumstance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moofyfish","CreatedById":167126,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T21:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks Drakau, I will give that a go in Jebs mission tomorrow. When you need to do transfers, fine adjustmusts are pretty much essential. Hopefully this stuff will be sorted in an update.....I noticed tonight that when my rocket has three stages and asparagus stages, i am unable to see all my stages in the right of tge screen in construction mode....still love the game though\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
