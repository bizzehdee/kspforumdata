I see it as an option to upload or download to/from storage, but to outright delete it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecifically, I am trying to fix a crash with error CE-34878-0 whenever I try to reload a certain saved game. \u00A0It has happened before but I downloaded a saved copy that I had uploaded a week before. \u00A0Now it\u0027s happened again and I assume something more fundamental is wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this the result of a corrupted save? \u00A0Is that what CE-34878-0 means?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, a general question on \u0022common data\u0022 - if it\u0027s not deleted will it ruin my other saved KSP games? \u00A0I seem to be able to load other saved games and start new ones. \u00A0Is deleting it a routine maintenance practice\u00A0I just be doing often? \u00A0Is there downside to deleting it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunning PS4 Enhanced Edition with latest updates, in English and\u00A0with Making History DLC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
