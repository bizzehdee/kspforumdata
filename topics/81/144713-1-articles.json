Found out when you go to place the second fuel line part, hold L1. This will still make you pick up the fuel tank, but you\u0027ll duplicate it and the fuel line will attach.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"harderjw","CreatedById":167133,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T02:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe L1 thing\u00A0worked like a charm. \u00A0Brilliant! \u00A0Thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
