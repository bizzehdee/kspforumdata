When you do that, a blue dot will appear on your craft\u0027s orbit line. Then you click A/Cross to activate. This will bring up a small\u00A0dialog that says \u0022Add Maneuver/Warp Here\u0022. Click the Add Maneuver button. The actual controls for creating maneuver nodes are fairly complex, because you can do a lot of things with maneuver nodes. Basically, there are 3 modes and the bumpers will let you cycle through the modes. They allow you to 1) move the node around on the orbit, 2) adjust the amount of \u0022burn\u0022 you want to do in each dimension, 3) select whether the node is supposed to be on the current orbit or a future orbit (or delete the node). Since the controls do so much, it takes practice to use them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tutorials also give\u00A0instructions and help on creating/using maneuver nodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-18T19:16:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsole question moved to the console subforum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
