Note how the icon looks before you drop it into the kerbal\u2019s inventory. \u00A0After it\u2019s in the Kerbal\u2019s inventory, there\u2019s a little symbol added to the bottom (right?) of the icon. \u00A0You press that symbol with the cursor and that lets you placed the unit on the ground where you want it. \u00A0Now it\u2019s best to deploy the science units with a scientist and the power units with an engineer as it enhances the units output by doing so. \u00A0 I don\u2019t think it matters with the control unit or antenna who deploys it \u2026.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
