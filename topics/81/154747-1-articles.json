I was wondering if the community new something that I didn\u0027t or some control that I wasn\u0027t using to pan the camera faster? Maybe its just on a slow setting? I can\u0027t seem to figure it out and it really bothers me sometimes when it takes\u00A030 seconds to 1 min just to rotate the camera 180 degrees or raise from the bottom of the rocket to the top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
