A\u00A0lot of what you\u0027re describing are\u00A0actually features of the final game,\u00A0not\u00A0shortcomings. Most of your complaints can be solved with a little practice and perhaps a look in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/forum/50-tutorials/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ETutorials\u003C/a\u003E section of the forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, there is. Go to map view, click on the place you want to observe, and click on Activate Navigation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough you don\u0027t actually need the navigation if you have Map View anyways. Just head in the general direction of the survey area, and when you arrive, you\u0027ll see green text that says \u0022You are now entering area RPHW72 Alpha\u0022 or something along those lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRidiculous, yes.\u00A0Unachievable, no. All contracts are achievable with enough patience and a properly designed ship. It\u0027s part of the challenge.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI took a look at your other thread, and I think Red Iron Crown has solved the problem for you. It doesn\u0027t seem like you are attaching the boosters to the decouples, but rather to the rocket itself?\u00A0You need to put the cursor over the decoupler if you want to attach anything to it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eactually\u003C/em\u003E need to have pinpoint accuracy with the burn indicator. If you miss the maneuver node by a few seconds, it doesn\u0027t really matter, so long as you still burn for the designated amount of time. You\u0027ll still get to where you need to go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough that control scheme does seem unnecessarily convoluted; I can see why you got frustrated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeh. We all had that feeling when we first started the game. Again, I\u0027d like to recommend you to the Tutorials sub-forum, particularly\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/143906-ksp-113-basic-tutorial-on-planes-v11-wip-pictures/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0for plane design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they deactivated after every use, then you\u0027d have to re-click them constantly, whereas the current system allows you to only click once to get to a new mode.

When you enter map mode and click on target a box appears and only the target name the box below where it supposed to say target nav is blank. I am not the only poster who has stated this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRandomised missions ok so how do you test a 45 engine during splashdown when it does not fire under water ther are numourus others just like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nboosters that dont seperate. I spend alot of time making sure that they are in the right position. Mainly due to the curser jump being to sensitive. one click to the left and move three anothe click right and it moves two. My point is i spend alot of time making sure they are bang on centre and should they not seperate i return to hanger and ajust hight. not jus to booster but the decoupler as well and still they stay stuck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe only plane i got to fly was a self made plane i got from youtube a guy on there cant remember his name. Daft really because he says his name in all 33 vids. But he got a weasly engine early in his tech tree which we dont get so i had to advance my tech tree to find similar. There is another early on that i recently discovered i will try out. Yet all the stock planes for me crash and burn regardless of how delicate iam with throttle or lift. And again i am not the only poster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll give you tool buttons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still claim \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E on eva is problem the strengh of it needs lowering a notch or two and the ship touch window needs widening anotch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fps on a game as small as this should not drop to 5 fps.

For themost part i have found it most enjoyable and have clocked up easily 80 to 100 hours since purchase. And a word from the devs wouldnt go amiss either.

All engines \u003Cstrong\u003Edo\u003C/strong\u003E work under water. KSP does not have anything realistic on the front of water being an issue. You can even run aircraft engines with both the engines themselves and the intakes feeding them many meters underwater with no ill effects.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoosters failing to separate... hmm... double check the decouplers/seperators are in\u00A0the right direction and try to place the part twice to make sure your not clipping into another node.

It\u0027s the first of it\u0027s kind, and definitely of it\u0027s scale. Where KSP may not have in graphical beauty, it has in sheer complexity due to constant physics calculations amongst lego block parts which are producing their own thrust which must also be calculated and so on and so on. Simply to say, don\u0027t underestimate this game; it isn\u0027t like a game of solitaire.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell why don\u0027t you stop \u0022griping\u0022 and start producing productive commentary. Explain your issue, what led you to it, and if it\u0027s a bug, what you did to encounter it.\u00A0Griping does nothing for the developers. They need information from the participants in order to produce a fix for your problems. If you go in and complain that your car\u0027s steering and AC is bad, sure it tells them what\u0027s wrong but you don\u0027t explain what about the steering is bad, or anything else. A mechanic can\u0027t work with that little detail and neither can Squad. It would be unfair and unrealistic to assume they can spend that much time on one issue that the user base could help assist with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t own a console version however I have been keeping a constant eye on the issues mentioned. It should be noted that I\u0027ve been playing KSP for 4 years now. I\u0027ve been here since .19. I\u0027m in no way the \u0022oldest\u0022 KSP player, but I do remember when things were worse. You may say \u0022yeah but the game isn\u0027t finished like it is now\u0022 and I simply have to say that even Minecraft or Grand Theft Auto 5 with their \u0022release\u0022 version was very buggy and even potentially broken for some. Point is, there will be problems. If there\u0027s one thing from my 4 years of participation I\u0027ve learned it\u0027s that you have to preserve with the game. This isn\u0027t some AAA title with several million poured into the development (like GTA V), this is a game developed by a small group of people who moderate funding thanks to a very helpful community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP won\u0027t grow from people saying \u0022this game sucks\u0022. It will grow from those who say \u0022Here\u0027s my problem... it\u0027s [fill in the blank here], can you [Squad] please fix it?\u0022. Since those took the time to provide them with the information to make the game better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t have the patience to work with the developers in this first version on brand new platforms, then I\u0027m sorry KSP isn\u0027t for you. KSP is a fantastic game that I feel $40 is too cheap a price. It\u0027s worth beyond $1,000 price tag simply because it has provided more long term entertainment than anything else. It\u0027s an amazing game, but you do have to work with the game to help make it better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could type another 32 paragraphs, but I\u0027ll end this here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RexusNL","CreatedById":167398,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-11T07:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222712721\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144118\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221470876609\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103726\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZooNamedGames\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, ZooNamedGames said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[...]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could type another 32 paragraphs, but I\u0027ll end this here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah it\u0027s an amazing game, have been playing it since 0.17 on the PC but after two carreers ending in a save corruption I\u0027m not even going to bother to start over again until there\u0027s a fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would have been fine with things like wheels not working pre-1.0 release or mysterious RUDs at that point but if you do release on a new platform your QA should be more then just release\u00A0the game and see how it goes.

No single game made me want to love it more, but just kept making me hate it. I just lost my *entire* save. I know, I should have backed up yada yada yada.... but there has never been a release version of a game on Xbox that fails as completely and fully as ksp. I didn\u0027t want to complain, but this is an example. See the above. This person is speaking as an expert but has not ever played on Xbox. If they had, they\u00A0would realize you *can\u0027t do that*. You can not select a target from a contract to activate navigation. (Source: hours of frustration, all of Google, etc)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wanted to like this game. It just killed my save file\u00A0after finally building up career mode, playing around all the console bugs so I only had one save file and one ship file saved, *after* the latest release. I\u0027ve never wanted a refund on a game, but this is stupid. I\u0027m beta testing a game that I bought as final, and all of the feedback I get is like this... person. \u0022It works like this on the pc. Peasant. You are doing it wrong.\u0022 Seriously. No it doesnt. It brings up a blank box. Try it on the actual platform. Then make an informed response.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRant over, I\u0027m done, I don\u0027t even want to bother with the refund anymore. I\u0027m just going to find every review place I can to give this bs a terrible review. Great for pc, bs for everyone else.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
