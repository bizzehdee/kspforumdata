Today I load the save, landed it on Minimus, and realized that all of the landing gear on the craft, and it\u0027s cargo, had been indiscriminately (seemingly so) twisted off of its axis. Like, 15 degrees for each piece, all different axis, and It wasn\u0027t like that when it took off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can upload more data if anyone else has experienced this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Just launched a second vessel to remedy the first. Same craft. Landed within 2km, switched vessels, alignment returned on first vessel. Still wondering if anyone else has encountered this.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-04-26T18:54:00Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2019 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Joessep Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
