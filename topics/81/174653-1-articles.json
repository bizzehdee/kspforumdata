I\u0027d gone EVA to plant the flag.\u00A0 The menu let me report and take a sample, but theflag button was gone. Then the shipnado hit.\u00A0 Switching back to Minmus, I was indeed the sole occupant of Minmus. No ship... not even debris.\u00A0 If it helps, this was after a quicksave reload.\u00A0 My first landing attempt resulted in Megumi Kermin on EVA started sliding down a slope out of control erupted into a glitch of kaliedascopic lines and shapes and disintegrated into a small puff of Minmus dust.\u00A0 I can still reload again, but so far I haven\u0027t.\u00A0 I\u0027more fascinated and amused than annoyed, and thought reporting the phenomenon was more constructive, and more in the spirit of exploration and scientific inquiry that\u0027s so much a part of \u0027The BEST Space Simulator EVER\u0027!

I\u0027d love to include the screen and vid caps, but I don\u0027t know how from an Xbox to the internet yet, or indeed if it\u0027s possible.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrouchyDevotee","CreatedById":175115,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-07T07:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS4\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI saw something similar.
