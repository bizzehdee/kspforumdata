Trim is so easy to set, even a brand new player could set it by accident! Then to make matters worse, resetting it takes some complicated combination of buttons all at once that you have to look up how to do in the controller presets and more often than not trying to fix it screws you up just as bad as the trim did\u00A0during flight. I literally can\u2019t even take off from Kerbin half the time without this messing me up. I know all I\u2019m doing is rambling but do we really need trim? Is it really necessary? Is there any way to get rid of it? Can we find some way to get this information to the devs? What do I have to do???\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leopard","CreatedById":167666,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-19T08:19:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed on this, have ended up with rapidly spinning capsules etc on the few launches I\u0027ve tried.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of the trim system, however:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. setting it needs to be different - i.e. an incremental move in a given direction or \u0022Match current controller setting\u0022, currently the adjustment is way to rapid to be actually usable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. resetting needs to be easier - both the neutral and \u0022current controller settings\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. it needs to be decoupled from the controller buttons related to the throttle, almost something like a single button that is \u0022match current settings\u0022, with the same button \u0022press \u0026amp; hold\u0022 being \u0022clear\u0022, not a system shower you can \u0022fine tune\u0022 all three axis, way too rapidly to be useful while trying to do something else\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. have a control allowing \u0022trim\u0022 to be locked so it can be disabled (with on screen indication LED or something) so when you really don\u0027t want it you can lock out the controls - note this to lock the controls, not the function (so you can set trim, then lock it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
