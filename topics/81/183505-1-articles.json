This is how I play: I start a new game in career mode, choose a new flag and save the game as KSP which overwrites the previous game. I do not change the control presets. The controller preset is automatically set to \u0027cursor\u0027 but I\u00A0have to use L3 to activate the cursor. When saving the game after a playing session, I again overwrite and save the game as KSP. I\u00A0attempt to fulfill contracts. When successful and at the mission synopsis screen I activate the cursor (L3) and select the notification tab that lists contract completions and records, press the O button to deactivate the cursor in order to select the \u0027discard\u0027 option (otherwise it is unavailable) and clear the tab of notifications. I had no problems playing the game before the 1.05 update. I posted yesterday about booster contract fails. It turns out it was a coincidence that they were both booster contracts. I have had new contracts fail when conditions were met, the simplest being testing a heat shield landed at Kerbin. Can\u0027t do it at the launch site or after a flight and landing on Kerba-firma. Only the \u0027jettison\u0027 option is listed at both locations and the \u0027test\u0027 option is not available.\u00A0The contracts fail randomly. I also today had my accepted contracts vanish from my contracts log. I accepted a new contract, built a craft specific for the contract, launched and at the launch pad all of my contracts were gone.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cruss","CreatedById":194533,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-26T14:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi! This has been around ever since I got this game. I usually ignore those kinda missions and stick to the ones that make you visit other planets but in the past sometimes even those bug out and won\u0027t complete.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a save where it kept giving me the mun landing mission, even after forcing it to complete with the cheat menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI personally can\u0027t be asked to deal with that sorta bugs so I do not play career anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
