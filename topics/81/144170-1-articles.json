Now I\u0027ve gotten to the point where I can\u0027t save my game without it corrupting my save. Not even if I manually save, then exit the game normally.

They are aware of the issue, and are informing their CSRs to be prepared for people to contact them. Further I have asked them to investigate the issue on their side, asking how the game make it through certification in its current state and follow up on the status of a patch. I\u0027m hoping that Flying Tiger will respond quickly and the matter is resolved, but I don\u0027t feel comfortable waiting for that to happen in good faith.

I own it on Steam already, and I fully intend to re-purchase it if/when the issue is resolved, but this port should have never made it through certification. The corruption issue was the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back, but there were other bugs too like frequent crashing, the lack of optimization, or occasional inability to edit maneuver nodes. I\u0027m hoping that questions will be asked, and issues addressed. If I were in your position, I wouldn\u0027t want these issues reflecting on me as the original developer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Maim","CreatedById":38222,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-22T02:45:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo months later and still waiting for patches.
