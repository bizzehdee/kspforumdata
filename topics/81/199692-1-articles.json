Something about those first few frames of accelerating to a high time warp speed causes the glitch. Note that it\u0027s not the manuever itself changing, but the position and heading of your vessel, which can be proven by monitoring things like apoapsis and periapsis before and after engaging auto time warp. The manuever only changes because it was repositioned, although you may be able to fix the manuever by adjusting it again by any amount.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll find this problem goes away if you manually enter time warp instead. Go at least to 5x time warp. Then it doesn\u0027t matter if you manually warp forward or auto time warp ahead from there. You may still see a tiny jump in the orbit of your vessel, but it will be much less than with auto time warp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
