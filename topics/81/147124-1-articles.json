I\u0027ve read a lot about keeping your file clean by deleting your own builds that aren\u0027t being used, and terminating debris in the tracking station, but they also mention deleting/disabling the stock crafts in both assembly buildings.... And I don\u0027t see how that\u0027s possible. It won\u0027t let you delete them straight up in the game; I\u0027ve selected the file, and deleting it straight up isn\u0027t an option. I\u0027ve tried loading a craft, deleting all of the parts, and saving to overwrite\u00A0it, but it simply creates a second file next to the stock file. I\u0027ve been all through the PS4 system files, and nothing lets you get to the actual stock .file. \u00A0If space is the big issue with this game, why not have the option to erase the 12\u002B ships with 300\u002B parts that are pre-loaded and not being used??\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHey Flying Tiger!!...how about a spot in the settings menu that lets us opt out of having these pre-built crafts that take up so much space????\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunnfore","CreatedById":167649,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-05T19:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you start a new Science or Career game, you\u0027ll see under the difficulty button the option to allow stock vessels.
