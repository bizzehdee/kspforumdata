My happiness quickly turned to frustration the straight anger as my game crashed FOUR times within a two hour period. These were not due to power loss, surge, or any other reason that my console could\u0027ve caused this, it\u0027s the game..... I also noticed that while playing in one save file ALL and I mean all stars and many textures were just simply gone. Game crashes and I restart the same save and is all there in full display however this time my button commands don\u0027t work... game crashes again. I know I\u0027m not the only one encountering issues and I REALLY hoe both Squad and Flying Tiger step up for everyone who bought this very disappointing release. I can only hope the patch they refer to is coming soon, this is just getting ridiculous now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChillingCammy","CreatedById":167776,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T05:19:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s been a while since SQUAD decided we were worth keeping in the loop.

When we want to patch the consoles we merge PC commits and work on the custom code and assets that are needed to make it run on the consoles. The console builds then have to go through certification with the console manufacturer (Sony, Microsoft or Nintendo) before we can make them available. As a result the consoles are likely to run a little bit behind compared to the PC releases, but we will keep updating all platforms as we move forward.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaCana","CreatedById":166743,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-30T12:00:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy gawd...\u00A0\u00A0 i\u0027ve heard enough of the \u0022Its really Sony \u0026amp; M$ that is too blame here\u0022 cwap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSoo theres something soo special With KSP, that it takes M$ 3-4 weeks too test it and get it out?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means those QA tests from M$ probably failed then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo other game on the Xbox1 system would take a month too get thru.
