After deleting a few botched nodes I managed to set one that could work, with some adjustments. I clicked out of the node, and\u00A0it disappeared. I tried setting another one, and found that I couldn\u0027t select any portion of my orbit, nor could I select the Mun to unset it as my target. I was able to select parts of my ship in staging mode (for example, I could run experiments, extend comm\u00A0devices, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt first happened last night. Of course,\u00A0I assumed it was a RAM issue so\u00A0I closed out, cleared the cache, and went to bed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis morning, nothing changed until I fully upgraded mission control, assuming\u00A0my node-setting capabilities were limited. I was able to set nodes again, for a while. Then the same thing happened.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEmbracing uncertainty, I went ahead with my fly-by and collected science, and completed the contract. However, I found that after escaping the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, I can\u0027t even select any part of my ship! A true nightmare scenario when on a science binge. Luckily, this was fixed by exiting to the main menu and reloading, but the maneuver problem persists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not exactly a game-breaking thing, but a degree of certainty is always nice in a game with such a small margin for error. Plus, it\u0027s time-consuming enough without learning the math and doing your own calculations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SleepyInsomniac","CreatedById":174215,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-31T00:42:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRestarting usually works to clear some of the bugs for me but I\u0027m on the PS4.
