This should even happen since im in science mode. The only real way I found to fix the bug is to save, quit to main menu and then close the game. Which sucks having to do that 2 to 3 times before even launching my creation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a huge deal, but annoying\u2026 \u00A0 Love the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm i the only one with this bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-03-12T06:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to console tech support\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
