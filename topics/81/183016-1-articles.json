I dont have money for a decent PC and dont make the money to upgrade a PC all the time. I do have a ps4 that works perfectly and doesnt need hardware upgrades ever 2 years though and KSP exists on this platform, so why not just have the game work properly?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikenike","CreatedById":196142,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-26T14:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice to know they were gonna have a update out soon what\u2019s it gonna have?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
