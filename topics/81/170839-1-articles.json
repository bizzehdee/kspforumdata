Do you have to make up a new login? The bug I would dearly like an answer to is pretty straight forward but so far no one has been able to give a solid answer.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce I reach space (above 75,000 meters) I am unable to start, restart, or throttle up my liquid engines if I use time warp. I am on a xboxone, using cursor presets (although from what I can determine the issue exists with the other presets as well) and if I use time warp below 75,000 meters I am fine, once I get above 75,000 meters if I throttle down my engines or shut them off, or even if I haven\u0027t reached that stage yet, once I engage time warp, I am unable to start a liquid engine, restart an engine or throttle back up. Is this a known bug, anyone else having this problem, and is this going to be fixed in a (hopefully) upcoming patch? I have included solar panels and batteries in my design, so lack of power is not the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-12T17:35:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2018 05:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by EventHorizion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GrouchyDevotee","CreatedById":175115,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-13T17:41:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour mission;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCollect this data and report back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.)
