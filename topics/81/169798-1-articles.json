Thanks!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I\u0027ve been doing a science play through to help get me more familiar with the parts and new controls before going into a career mode, but early on I was playing with space planes and when putting on one of the wings, they started bugging out and disappearing briefly, flickering in and out of existence. I tried to move it to alleviate the error, but instead it just left a ghost of itself in the original place, still flickering. I couldn\u0027t move or delete the ghost, but I could delete the actual part.\u00A0I don\u0027t remember what wing it was, but it was one of the bigger ones you get from the first science unlock for wings.. The reason I mention this is because its the only reasonable thing I can think of that caused what I\u0027m\u00A0about to explain next.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter going back to the space center and reloading into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, it worked fine... until I tried to launch my plane. The camera spawns in pretty randomly, sometimes under the runway, in the sky, or just pitch black. I can\u0027t pause, bring up the cursor, move the camera, or anything. Also, the time in the top left always says 999 for the years and days and what not.This continued to happen no matter how many times I reloaded. To get out of it, I have to close application and not do it again.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny help is appreciated \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. Wow, okay. I just tested it again to confirm some of my info, and it loaded in fine... This had been happening my entire playthrough from the start and it suddenly works. I will leave this here though, because its still a pretty serious bug to have happen, and hopefully it can be recreated so it can be fixed. To clarify, this bug had been happening for a long awhile, I have no idea what fixed it suddenly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-19T16:59:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2018 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by winterfox5\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
