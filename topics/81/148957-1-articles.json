I am on the ps4 and I\u00A0have a contract to put a class b astroid into orbit around mun. Well all is good before I grab the astroid, I can quick save, go to the space center and\u00A0even land and\u00A0recover my ship. But the second I grab the astroid I can no longer quick save go to the space center or recover my ship. Also I can no longer switch to other vessels. I have even sent a different ship and same thing. When I do a eva and choose space center it says it will revert seconds back but it will go all the way back to the autosave\u00A0before I grabbed the astroid. Anybody have any tips that could get my game saved?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-29T19:23:11Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2016 07:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Jamillikan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded I was on PS4\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaManiac","CreatedById":176003,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-20T19:30:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know, try not to grab the asteroid in the first place!
