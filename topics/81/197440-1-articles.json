I would like part counts to this craft, as well as a picture. Is the rocket a single stack, or does it have boosters on the sides, if it has boosters on the side, then you probably need to strut the boosters to the craft. What was the error code? There is a list of all major Krakens that have been documented here.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Deep_Space_Kraken#Main_Krakens\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Deep_Space_Kraken#Main_Krakens\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
