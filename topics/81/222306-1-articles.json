The game is for my nephew, who obviously doesn\u0027t speak English. I would like to know if there is any interest from the developers in releasing a translation for the console version, even if it\u0027s a fan-developed translation, or if there\u0027s anything I can do. Can someone help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
