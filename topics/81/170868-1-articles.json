Anyway, this is a bug collectively known as \u0022The time warp bug\u0022 it can only be fixed by restarting the game. It will reload you to your last save. So quick save a lot!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Haye","CreatedById":184471,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-14T11:11:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may have found a way around this bug.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile in time warp quick save every 5 seconds or so. For some reason unknown to me, the games saves your progres and doesnt crash after the time warp is complete. This method isn\u2019t 100% effective all the time, but it got me to Duna and Ike.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
