There are several issues with the new update (3/28/19), my main complaint being that sun glare is gone and atmospheric heating on re-entry does not show unless you are zoomed in quite close. Is there any timeline for a fix on these? Are the devs aware of the problems and working on them? I\u0027ve heard quite a bit of conflicting information around and I figured you folks would know one way or the other if there is a fix in the works. I don\u0027t mind a bit of a\u00A0wait as the game still\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eworks\u003C/em\u003E but I would really love to see these things fixed!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
