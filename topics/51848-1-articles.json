Struts really have zero mass? I feel like adding struts changed my dV... Have to check again. If struts are free, then I\u0027m going big on them. Also good that the mass goes with the decoupled piece. But for probe (stack?) decouplers, I think the body of the decoupler (at least graphic) stays with the part that is at the base of the arrow - I point the arrow towards the probe/engine, and that part detaches cleanly, seaming to leave the rest of the decoupler with the parent.

If you want to get rid of the nubs just save and reload, they should all disappear. The only exception is when you keep the start point for a strut. This is why you should also start your struts on the part that gets removed (put them on the lower or radial stages and connect the second point to the upper or inner section).
