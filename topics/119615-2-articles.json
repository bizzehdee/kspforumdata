The primary arguments for why the ports will be successful seem to be: 1. Squad knows what\u0027s happening and we don\u0027t. 2. Squad has their standards of quality and won\u0027t let Flying Tiger release unless they have a release that is up to their standards (side note: I agree that it\u0027s kind of silly to blindly trust a pretty much unknown company to port a game to three platforms which they haven\u0027t worked with ever/in a long time, plus based on what I\u0027ve read here even their games for the platforms that they are familiar with aren\u0027t exactly ones to brag about). 3. Squad thinks they\u0027re doing a good job. 4. The marketing people at Squad know much more than a huge community of people who want to see success of the game, and who also have many many different perspectives and ideas that might not occur to the relatively small Squad. 5. \u0022Trust us. We know what we\u0027re doing\u0022 (this should really be #1, it\u0027s been their go-to argument for the last two or three announcements/releases). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking back on 0.90 and 1.0 with the advantage of hindsight, what do we see? First 0.90. We see a huge amount of skepticism from the community who cite many many reasons why it is going to beta too early and will be a buggy mess upon release. Squad reassures the community that they will make the final release (when it is released, \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eafter several beta releases\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E) up to their standards, the people at Squad think that it will be a success, and we should trust them. 0.90 is released, there\u0027s some bugs, but whatever, beta is for bug-fixing so hopefully there will be a couple of beta releases to- oh, wait, they just announced 1.0. Within the span of about 4 months the entire beta plan went out the window, for the vague reason of \u0022it\u0027s ready\u0022. The community is extremely skeptical, and again, they cite many many reasons why it\u0027s a bad idea. Squad basically shoots down everything with \u0022We think it\u0027s ready, we think that it is progressing well, it\u0027ll be up to our standards, trust us. Oh and we\u0027ll also fix a ton of bugs even though we\u0027re also introducing massive new systems and features with not one beta to test them all out, but yeah, they\u0027ll all work fine and it will be mostly bug free.\u0022 It\u0027s been a while since that announcement so my memory might be a little off, but my recollection is that they really didn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Elisten \u003C/em\u003Eto what was being said (a lot of it was good advice!). 1.0 comes... and as far as I can tell the general consensus is that it was a good release, several bugs were fixed, and the new features are nice, but there were a lot of somewhat obvious bugs that could have been very easily caught and fixed by a 0.99 release (and instead were via 4 post release patches) and don\u0027t belong in a finished game. So, as far as the community can tell, this is the quality standard of Squad. This could clearly be very wrong, but that\u0027s the baseline that we all have to work with. And in the end, I think that the community was at least somewhat right, and at minimum a lot more right than Squad thought. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I think that the community has a right to be skeptical, and I think that Squad should provide some kind of concrete evidence of the potential for a successful release rather than the vague \u0022trust us\u0022 that they have been using for the last 6\u002B months. And I think that at least the consideration of some of the ideas on this forum would be beneficial. Personally, I care none about the console releases, but like others I would hate to see Squad\u0027s name soured by sub-standard releases for the consoles, and furthermore, I\u0027m a little irritated to see the same arguments being used again and again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
