As you hinted, I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s another mod (AVP)--following some instructions in the AVP thread fixed the \u0022whited out\u0022 planet, but I\u0027m still missing clouds. I suspect AVP isn\u0027t compatible with this version of Scatterer, despite having it as a dependency (to be clear, I\u0027m not blaming you Blackrack--AVP doesn\u0027t do the best job explaining how to install it). I\u0027ll probably just switch over to something else, AVP is turning out to be a lot more hassle than it\u0027s worth. \n\nEDIT: Nevermind, I\u0027m just doing something wrong...even with AVP completely removed, I can bring up the configuration tool, toggle wireframes, and nothing else works--so something else is broken with my installation (not that there are that many steps involved).
