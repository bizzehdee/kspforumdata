For those who weren\u0027t around back then the goal was pretty simple. Race from the mainland by KSC, around the island with the runway on it, and return to KSC as fast as possible. I haven\u0027t seen a reincarnation of it pop up yet, so I thought it was about time to make on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo without further ado, I present to you, the Kerbal Regatta Version Two!:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K4INqvYl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022K4INqvYl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBIG -\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/K4INqvY.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/K4INqvY.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see I\u0027ve moved entierty of the course out to the islands off the coast, and tweaked it to add some more active driving. Also, this one allows for a running start/finish [see verification rules for running start] if you wish to attempt them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m simplifying the scoring on this one. Gone are all the time discounts for getting it into the water and so forth. This one is just about speed \u0026amp; driving efficiency pure and simple. (And turning, boats that can\u0027t turn at speed won\u0027t fare well on the far end of the course!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rules are simple:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGet the boat to the starting line however you like.

(This also means no using a drop tank to get a running start and dropping it just before the starting line)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you want to use infinite fuel/hyperedit/etc to get to the starting line then go for it, but the race itself must run mod \u0026amp; debug menu free. (If you use fuel hacks to reach the starting line you must reach a dead stop after disabling them before starting the race)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you draw a line between the start and finish point, it must be farther back than the tip of the island (see pic). You can place buoys if you wish to make it easier to determine, but they aren\u0027t required.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYour start and finish points may be no more than 5k apart along the start/finish line. (basically you can\u0027t avoid having to drive around the start/finish island by starting/finishing way out to sea from it)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOn all the other islands stick as close or as far from them as you need to make your turns as long as you pass around/through them in the proper places.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScreenshots required (Time/fuel visible in all):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EClose up of boat stationary in water (You can PM me this with a note in your submission saying you are doing so if you want to keep the details of your design hidden for the time being)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EBoat on starting line showing that it\u0027s behind line\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EShot of boat rounding each island zoomed out sufficiently to tell where it is.
