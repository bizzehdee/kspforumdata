All rocket parts are cheap compared to contract rewards and buildings. I never care about money when building rockets in the career mode, because the savings from being cost-effective are negligible.\n\nThe actual rocket prices in the game are not measured in funds, but in tonnes and parts. Before you can upgrade the launchpad to tier 3, launch mass is the main limit on rocket construction. Because SRBs are so inefficient, you can only use them for launching small payloads. Those payloads are so cheap to launch anyway, that the price advantage of SRBs matters even less than usual.\n\nAfter the final launchpad upgrade, part count becomes the main limit. Prices still don\u0027t matter, unless you\u0027re building huge rockets. But if you\u0027re building huge rockets, you\u0027ll probably try to keep the part count under control, because high part count causes annoying lag during the launch. You can\u0027t really use SRBs, because they\u0027re so tiny that you\u0027d need a large number of them."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T10:44:36Z","Content":"SRBs are dangerous for manned launches because if, say, the main engine overheated and took the center tank with it, then the srbs could come loose and smash into the command pod, whilst bipropellant engines can be shut down with the abort button."},{"CreatedByName":"Pax Kerbana","CreatedById":129558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T15:25:44Z","Content":"Thrust, weight, burn time, and part count become considerable constraints when payload to orbit mass starts increasing. For almost all career contracts SRBs can used pretty effectively.\n\nYou have a much larger TWR and burn time options available by using liquid fueled boosters. I would say off the top of my head that everything under 100 tons to orbit can make effective use of SRBs so long as part count is reasonable. If your talking 250 tons, forget it... The simplicity of having a 4 boosters is a huge advantage (esp. for part counts) than having SRB bundles strapped to the side of your rocket.\n\nIt takes 2 KD25s to get close to a Mainsail\u0027s thrust at the pad. But this is with the SRBs at full thrust which means the will need to be discarded quickly while still deep in the atmosphere; the Mainsail can take you much further.\n\nI think an ideal way is to use boosters that consist of SRBs strapped to a core fuel tank without a liquid fueled engine. Trying to get the burn times to line up with fuel consumption is very difficult which makes this an impractical method.\n\nWhat is really nice is using only SRBs for boosters and dialing back the SRB thrust to 3/4 to 1/2 and riding it out to upper atmosphere. That way you can achieve orbit with a \u0022middle\u0022 stage with much lower TWR.... Which if you did it correctly will be the first stage engine.\n\nPlus the rapid acceleration gain at the last part of an SRBs burn is unreal... My Kebals seem to love it, they keep riding these things into orbit! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nIn 0.90 I would send up Mk1-2 orbiter pods that\u0027s could change orbit from LKO to HKO and back to transfer crew between stations and interplanetary ships and then de-orbit. Those pods would be sent up with nothing but SRBs... total of about 15k funds as non recoverable.

Use radial symmetry and put between 3 and 8 of \u0027em around your rocket. Use the control-surface winglets (not the fixed kind) for control authority. Slap a nose cone on \u0027em, and use sepratrons to make sure they don\u0027t smack your rocket when they decouple. These parts are in the game for a reason!\n\nI like my SRBs to provide a TWR of between 1.3 and 2.0 (including atmosphere) during operation. A little excess is OK. If you\u0027re getting too much thrust, you can tone it down in the VAB with the tweakables.\n\nThe other day I tried building a rocket with them and without them. It was much cheaper with them."}]}
