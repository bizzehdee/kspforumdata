Before you can upgrade the launchpad to tier 3, launch mass is the main limit on rocket construction. Because SRBs are so inefficient, you can only use them for launching small payloads.

For almost all career contracts SRBs can used pretty effectively.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have a much larger TWR and burn time options available by using liquid fueled boosters. I would say off the top of my head that everything under 100 tons to orbit can make effective use of SRBs so long as part count is reasonable. If your talking 250 tons, forget it... The simplicity of having a 4 boosters is a huge advantage (esp. for part counts) than having SRB bundles strapped to the side of your rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt takes 2 KD25s to get close to a Mainsail\u0027s thrust at the pad.
