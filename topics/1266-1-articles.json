(Unfortunately for me, on my first attempt, I managed a 50.0x52.5 km orbit and discovered that, firing from apokee there, the landing point is on nightside, hence the \u0027catastrophic failure.\u0027 Still, I made velocities that the calculators say were right for the orbit I listed, and easily managed to slow enough for aerobraking to bring them back to Kearth!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt does require some piloting, particularly before the boosters burn out, and careful throttle control up until then, too, to keep it from tumbling at low altitude, but once you get it going, it\u0027s a stable, smooth ride to LKO (low Kearth orbit). SAS is used in preference to fins to save weight (because with the number of fins it\u0027d need, we\u0027d *never* get off the ground!). I recommend liftoff at default thrust, then up to 50% power after tower clear, and full throttle after booster separation. Pitchover to 45 degrees can start at 10km, 30 degrees at 25km, 15 degrees at 30km, and about 5 degrees once clear of the atmosphere, for a roughly 60km orbit. Launch uses the first four booster stages (up through KSP stage 07) completely. Stage 05 is an injection module, fired at apogee to circularize the orbit. Be sure to save some fuel for deorbit! (Note that I included the heat shield on the capsule; it needs to be jettisoned before parachute deployment.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cWTEl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cWTEl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn impressive sight on the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yRVxC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yRVxC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not exactly snorting along at first stage burnout, even with booster jettison... but it *will* keep climbing until burnout.
