Right now it is awkward to use if you have fairings on the payload because if you want to use the graphs on the last stage you need to put the part inside the fairing, which makes it so you can\u0027t activate it at the start of the launch.\n\u003E - An \u0022Advanced Data Sources\u0022 section that contains all meaningful data sources.\n\u003E - The ability to minimize all Graphotron windows, maybe by having a button on the top-right for Graphotron similar to what Kerbal Engineer has.\n\u003E - Have the time data be based off the actual time in the game. Right now if you do a time warp while plotting data it will get compressed and make the graphs look bad.\n\u003E \n\nMy pleasure, and thanks for the report.\n\nAs for making Graphotron partless, it\u0027s been discussed and we decided to leave it as is.  You can make it partless by using Module Manager, I believe.  But I will add a hot-key or App Button to activate it, so one doesn\u0027t need to click on the part to see the interface.\n\nAs for the Advanced Data Sources, I\u0027ve already added all the sources I could find related to the vessel object, but there may be others - if someone knows of some, please let me know.\n\n[@delta wee](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162060-delta-wee/), thanks for all the input!  ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nEDIT:  I\u0027ve added issues to our repo here:  [https://github.com/Ezriilc/KSP-Graphotron/issues](https://github.com/Ezriilc/KSP-Graphotron/issues)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-25T17:44:24Z\u0022 title=\u002211/25/2016 05:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Ezriilc**"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T05:28:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 11 hours ago, Ezriilc said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A scrollable plot window, so data isn\u0027t lost once it reaches the left side.\n\u003E \n\nI think a simple solution to this would just be to have the graphotron export the image when the graph reaches the end, and then do it again as necessary"},{"CreatedByName":"Ezriilc","CreatedById":34556,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-26T17:52:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Drew Kerman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I think a simple solution to this would just be to have the graphotron export the image when the graph reaches the end, and then do it again as necessary\n\u003E \n\nThat\u0027s a great idea.

I would guess that it has something to do with when terrain detail game setting you might have and when the game does/doesn\u0027t load apprriopriate terrain details due to the various scales of terrain he game uses.
