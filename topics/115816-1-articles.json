I am not advanced enough in the tech tree to have solar panels, but have two batteries. The batteries, plus the onboard charge of the crew capsules have been enough for previous missions if I am careful an gentle in maneuvering. Without maneuvering, the current drain is normally 0, and the charge state does not change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, after completing a midcourse correction, the electrical usage eventually settled at .01, instead of 0, and now the charge continually decreases. All engines are off. Turning the SAS off does not help. Toggling the torque Off does not help. I tried minor maneuvers, but the current still settles to .01 instead of 0. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I recalled an earlier save of the same mission, the passive current was 0, as expected, but became .01 again after ejecting from Mun orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat has changed to cause the continual slight discharge? On a long mission, it has a troublesome impact, and prevents things like transmitting science.
