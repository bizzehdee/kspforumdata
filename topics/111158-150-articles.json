Advertising mods/add-ons there should be forbidden.\n\u003E \n\nThank you for the suggestion!\n\nIn general, we try to have as few rules as possible, since we like people to feel fairly free to post what they want.  *\u003Cu\u003EAny\u003C/u\u003E* rule is a restriction on our users, which in general we\u0027d prefer not to do unless necessary.  Also, bear in mind that any time there\u0027s an additional rule, that\u0027s one more thing that we moderators need to *\u003Cu\u003Eenforce\u003C/u\u003E*, which takes our time.  And there are only a few of us, and we\u0027re doing this in our spare time-- we can\u0027t afford to be a \u0022police state\u0022.  So for both of these reasons, we try to be as parsimonious with rules as we can.\n\nWhen we *\u003Cu\u003Edo\u003C/u\u003E* consider adding a rule, therefore, we take a hard and skeptical look at it-- i.e., is it *\u003Cu\u003Ereally\u003C/u\u003E* necessary?  Is there a significant and common problem that it would address?  Is the benefit to the community worth the extra restrictions placed on the users, and the extra time and effort the moderator team would need to enforce it?\n\nIn this particular case, I\u0027m having trouble seeing the justification for such a rule.  The Suggestions forum seems to do pretty well, people make suggestions all the time, most of the discussion there seems to be around those suggestions.  And naturally, people often suggest things that there exists a mod to address, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with people pointing that out.  \u0022There\u0027s a mod for that\u0022 isn\u0027t a *\u003Cu\u003Esolution\u003C/u\u003E* to a suggestion-- since the suggestion is about the *\u003Cu\u003Estock game\u003C/u\u003E*, after all-- but there\u0027s nothing wrong with *\u003Cu\u003Ementioning\u003C/u\u003E* a mod, as a way of potentially helping the suggester around a problem, at least until such time as the stock game hopefully incorporates the suggestion.\n\nSo overall, I\u0027d be inclined not to add such a rule-- it seems to me to be trying to \u0022solve\u0022 a problem that doesn\u0027t actually exist, as far as I can tell.\n\nOf course, I could be wrong.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  It\u0027s not as though I read every single post that ever gets posted there.
