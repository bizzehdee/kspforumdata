Situation: I tracked a mission to my big orbital station. Didn\u0027t understand the return mission concept exactly and wanted just to delete the tug which carried up the exchangeable fuel tank module. So I undocked it and smashed it into Kerbin (with the mission docking port staying on the station, because I didn\u0027t understand what I\u0027m supposed to do).

If you do things incorrectly is should just not work and not blow up your station. That said, I replayed the mission as you described, but wasn\u0027t able to reproduce the outcome you had. The mod does not allow me to only return a part of the vehicle and attempting to do so does kind of mess up the tracking logic. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(made a fix for the next version which should prevent tracking to engage if only a part of the vehicle is undocked)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the kraken event; opposed to the logic which brings the vessel to the station after ordering a mission, the tracking logic does not \u0022do\u0022 anything to the game itself, so for now i find it hard to place this bug.
