That issue was fixed back in Fanno and has never reappeared. Both pods are stable, with and without heatshields, when oriented blunt-end down into the flow. It is possible that the Mk1 is \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E stable nose-first, but that would be correct since that\u0027s the same exact situation as with Mercury, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@steve_v: \u003C/strong\u003EYeah, I know.

Thanks a lot for all your work on the last update, it was a pleasure to discover how you used the new aero model for this version of FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been using the old version since 0.23 to this day, and I seem to be having a harder time launching my rockets now. I\u0027ve tried to launch a big one recently and it seems to be quite hard to steer properly : I think I\u0027m reaching terminal velocity too early in the lower atmosphere, going transonic a little bit before 10km because of some powerful boosters. I will try to see if less powerful ones will do the trick, but I was just wondering whether the ascent profile I was using before needed some change with the new FAR : I used to be steering the rocket very early at liftoff about 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 West and then simply proceed with my gravity turn as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, thanks for your work\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Autochton","CreatedById":70134,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:01:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve thought a little on but which does not seem obvious to me: How does engine exhaust affect wave drag? IRL, I mean, though I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if FAR deals well with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my thought process: Wave drag is caused by air being displaced by the passage of the hull, and the more radically the air displacement takes place, the more drag it produces. Jet and rocket engines emit significant amounts of high-temperature expanding gas in the area behind them - and while that seems like it might not affect a vehicle when the exhaust is at the very rear of the hull, I would expect it to have at least some effect when e.g. engines are mid-hull mounted as you might see in the SKYLON design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to like mounting engines on the sides(/tops/bottoms) of planes, as that brings them in closer to the center of mass, so it sparked a bit of curiosity, but I don\u0027t quite know where I\u0027d begin to look for a relative layman\u0027s explanation.
