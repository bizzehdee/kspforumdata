Some results they are just posting now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eagleworks team took one of their q-thrusters and hooked it up to the micro warp field interferometer, replacing the capacitor ring with the thruster, and ran 5 tests, each acquiring 27,000 data points, where they turned the thruster on and off. The point of this test was to see if the q-thruster itself might be warping space to some degree. At 30 watts of power into the thruster, they measured an effect that, while small, was about 40 times the noise floor of their equipment for a signal through open air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther planned tests in this regard are to change the atmospheric composition to prove it is not atmospheric refraction at work, followed later (they are building the system) by a vacuum test of the thruster-interferometer system.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T20:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes that mean q-thruster is in fact a low-power, sub-luminal warp drive? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003ETotally awesome \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jfull","CreatedById":61722,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T20:54:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s true, I really have to wonder how much the design can be improved, considering the drive wasn\u0027t even supposed to generate thrust by warping space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might be a while before we know \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E it works, but things will probably get a lot more interesting at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T20:57:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jfull\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-20T20:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends on how you define \u0022warp drive\u0022.

They pumped an amount of energy into a simple copper frustrum that you can build at home, and some of that energy made their detectors respond. It still remains to be seen why those detectors responded - or rather, to what. Furthermore, this can also be seen as a control group test for the \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E results their interferometer has produced. Basically, if it reacts to this thing, then it calls into question that it\u0027s measuring right in the first place. Maybe it reacts to almost any powered device presented to it?

To our advantage, he has a fairly straightforward path planned out for this. As some of you know, they are working on that Q-thruster with \u0026gt;1 kilowatt of power input into it. Once that is complete, they will do their usual testing for sure. But then they will almost certainly set up another combo thruster-interferometer test.
