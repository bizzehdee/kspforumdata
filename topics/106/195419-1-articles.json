So I I guess that crashing a discarded rocket stage into them will also break the deployed science parts. (Assuming that happens within the physics bubble.)\u00A0 On the other hand: if my aim was that good, then I wouldn\u0027t mind to deploy another (set of) part(s).\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
