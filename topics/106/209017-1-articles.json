operated within a very narrow RPM range. \u00A0Usually 97-100%, regardless of the output required. \u00A0Torque is controlled by the amount of fuel fed into the engine, engine speed is controlled by a governor which adjusts the propeller blade angles to maintain a constant speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTurboprop engines use a gas turbine to drive a propeller, often via a reduction gearbox. \u00A0Gas turbines are most efficient when compression is highest, which is also when the compressor is spinning the fastest. \u00A0That\u2019s why you would normally want to operate one at its design RPM, even when you don\u2019t need all the power output it\u2019s capable of. \u00A0Even at low or mid power settings, I still want the engine to be using the fuel as efficiently as possible, so I want the compressor and turbine to be spinning as fast as they can.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that the RPMs displayed are for the \u003Ci style=\u0022font-weight:bold;\u0022\u003Eoutput shaft\u003C/i\u003E, not the compressor and turbine. \u00A0In real-world turboprops the turbine is spinning much faster than the output shaft. \u00A0For example, a typical propeller RPM would be ~1,500 RPM, but the turbine driving the propeller might be spinning at 20,000-40,000 RPM. \u00A0KSP has difficulty simulating things spinning that fast, so I think the rotors and turboprops are limited to 460 RPM, and other physical aspects are adjusted to counteract that limitation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, with actual turboprop engines, I wouldn\u2019t expect to use a torque curve over a range of RPMs. \u00A0I would expect the engines to operate within a very narrow RPM range, and achieve torque from 0-100% within that narrow range by adjusting the fuel flow into the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MAFman","CreatedById":101780,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-19T15:33:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

style=\u0022font-weight:bold;\u0022\u003Estock\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0KSP to function exactly like they would be operated in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E460 RPM\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0works well, but due to how KSP handles the physics of the propellers, the most efficient RPM is usually lower than that (in KSP). \u00A0The ideal speed for KSP props varies depending on your goal- Max Speed, or Max Efficiency. \u00A0But in general I\u2019ve found RPMs of about 390 give me the best performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s how I normally set up propellers, either turboprops or electric rotors. \u00A0\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EThis isn\u2019t the only way to do it- just what works for me..\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nMain throttle is tied to engine torque.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI tie Max RPM to an action group, or the translate controls. \u00A0This won\u2019t be used much, because I control RPM with propeller blade angle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI tie the propeller blade angle to another action group or set of controls.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, during flight-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nI control power (torque) with the main throttle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI normally leave Max RPM set to 460.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI control actual RPM with the propeller blade angle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI would normally set the desired power, and adjust blade angle for maximum speed, which usually is near 390 RPM.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEvery time you change power (torque, main throttle) you\u2019ll need to adjust blade angle to maintain the desired RPM.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a real turboprop a governor would maintain the desired RPM for you, by adjusting the prop blades. \u00A0In stock KSP I don\u2019t see a way to make that work, you\u2019ll have to control the prop blades yourself, in order to keep your RPM at the desired speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason 390 seems to work well is not due to the engine, but rather how the propeller blades work. \u00A0This mimics real life- a real propeller blade works best when the tips are perhaps just barely supersonic. \u00A0Any faster, and more of the propeller blade is supersonic, which decreases efficiency. \u00A0I\u2019m not sure how the KSP model works, but that\u2019s the basic concept, which applies in real life too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen set up the way I described, KSP does model fuel flow fairly realistically. \u00A0An increase in torque equals an increase in fuel flow. \u00A0I couldn\u2019t say how realistic the fuel flow to torque relationship is in stock KSP, but in real life there are a lot of different turboprop designs, which each have different fuel-torque properties.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne additional problem with running your props at 460 is how KSP handles extra torque. \u00A0Keep in mind torque equals fuel flow. \u00A0Say you are at half-throttle, and the engine is at 460. \u00A0If you increase throttle (to full), you have added torque, and added fuel flow, but the prop is still spinning at 460. \u00A0So you are using more fuel, but getting exactly the same thrust as before. \u00A0(Assume you left the prop blades as they were..). \u00A0So running the props at max speed (I think it\u2019s 460), you don\u2019t know if you are wasting excess fuel to provide excess unused torque.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, with the stock KSP props I usually find about 390 RPM works well, sometimes as low as 330. \u00A0Wouldn\u2019t surprise me if some designs do best at even lower RPMs, you\u2019ll have to experiment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
