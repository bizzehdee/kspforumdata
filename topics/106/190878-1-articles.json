I\u0027d attach the hinge - I-beam - leg to the fuel tank and then the hinge - piston - hinge to the fuel tank. But at the lower hinge of the latter I would also add a cubic octagonal Strut and add then strut that to the I-beam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried it, and got it to work after a fashion. But not reliably, something always got stuck after a few cycles. One important thing is to set the hinges and piston to be \u0022free\u0022 after a power loss, and not to set autostruts on the robotic parts themselves. Also don\u0027t try to extend the landing gear when the hinge between tank and I-beam is not locked! Otherwise I got 100% kraken-bait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally: I think just\u00A0 the lower part, without the piston and with an autostrut on the I-beam, would work just as well if you only move it in microgravity - with no forces on the structure - and lock it whenever there is some load on the structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruedii","CreatedById":57704,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-11T13:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey should add an option to attach two parts together IF they align close enough.\u00A0 This could allow for much better options.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
