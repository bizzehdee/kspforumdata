Rotors produce torque, shouldn\u0027t the unit be kNm or Nm instead? If it\u0027s given in kN, what is the moment arm? 1m? If it\u0027s 1m,\u003C/s\u003E why are the rotors so weak, 75kNm directly on output shaft is a lot, the rotors shouldn\u0027t just stop due to rotor blade drag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: I\u0027ve just realized those are kNm indeed. How come they come to a halt so easily despite having such a high torque?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT2: I think I realize what\u0027s happening now. After modding a rotor to have 10 times higher torque I realized that it didn\u0027t change the max RPM at all. What seems to be happening is that the RPM limit does not actually limit RPM - it limits torque using some weird linear function that does not account for the actual rotor RPM. It doesn\u0027t account for loading of the rotor, it just limits the torque to pre-calculated values. If there\u0027s literally anything attached to it it will never even reach the max value.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-07-05T17:59:53Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2019 05:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by m4ti140\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
