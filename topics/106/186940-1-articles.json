I add the command to the track window and place a point on the dotted line that shows near the end of the sequence. Yet when I play it the undock does not happen. I can see that the sequence is playing, and even see that I can place other items in the track like toggling lights and such and they work fine, but not the undocking command. I know it doesn\u0027t happen because the ports are still docked and it doesn\u0027t actually undock until I right click the docking port and chose undock, at which point it undocks fine as you\u0027d expect. I just can\u0027t get it to undock in the track sequence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody else having a similar issue getting certain commands to work in a track sequence of a KAL-1000 part?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-08-03T19:09:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2019 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by OldLost\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
