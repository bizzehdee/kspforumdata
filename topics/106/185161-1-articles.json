I\u0027m loving the new expansion, however, I\u0027m having some confusion with how to place down the science stations while landed on a celestial body. When I take out the equipment and put it in my inventory it goes in like normal, but when I go to put it on the ground, it doesn\u0027t show anything. I can take the equipment out of my inventory, but it doesn\u0027t give me any buttons or indications of how or where to place it down. If anyone could give some advice, I\u0027d be appreciative.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Cheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-05T02:42:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile it is in your Kerbal s inventory there is a small white icon in the bottom right of the item.
