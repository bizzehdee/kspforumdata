Unless you\u0027re extremely good at eyeballing the relative positions of the strut endpoints, you\u0027re probably going to end up with some unwanted linear force, causing your mechanism to grind to a halt. The offset tool can help, but in all likelihood you\u0027d need some sort of alignment indicator addon to figure out precisely where the thing is free to rotate and where it isn\u0027t. I might try lowering the linear strength a bit, but sooner or later there\u0027s no real point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E0 linear, 150 angular\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E(Like a telescoping piston):\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis one turned out somewhat better, although this might just have to do with the robotic parts rather than the actual struts. When tested with a piston, it could extend, albeit with some resistance. When tested with a hinge, it could barely even wiggle.
