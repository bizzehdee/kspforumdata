On a propeller plane, the motor\u0027s job is to keep the propeller spinning, the amount of thrust produced depends on effective blade pitch, which is a function of RPM and forward speed. This means that you need a coarser pitch at higher airspeeds and a finer pitch to get moving/accelerate/take off. If your motor has insufficient torque it won\u0027t be able to overcome the air resistance of the propeller spinning, your RPM will go down, and your thrust will drop. You will have maximum efficiency at a fairly fine pitch, which should allow you to reduce throttle.

A fixed-pitch propeller will have a thrust curve: it starts out pretty low at zero airspeed, rises as you build speed, then drops again as you near the aircraft\u0027s maximum speed. A variable-pitch propeller lets you push the peak of the thrust curve forward by coarsening the blade pitch, until one of three things happen: the drag produced by your airframe equals the maximum thrust produced by your propeller, your propeller\u0027s air resistance overcomes your motor\u0027s torque, or your blade tips break the sound barrier (I don\u0027t know if KSP models this though).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, again: if you\u0027re making a fixed-pitch propeller, experiment to find a blade pitch that lets you get rolling and produces enough thrust at your lift-off speed to get you into a climb, and if you\u0027re making a variable-pitch propeller, taxi at a fine pitch, accelerate,\u00A0take off, and climb at a slightly coarser pitch, and cruise at a much coarser pitch.

editor, checking \u0022invert\u0022 changes the direction the axis moves.\u00A0 So for instance, if you invert main throttle, the plane spawns with the throttle set to 0.\u00A0 However, this will be interpreted as full throttle so the plane will spawn with full throttle.\u00A0 Hitting LSHF, which normally increases throttle, will instead decrease it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make counter-rotating, separate engines (with 1 engine on each wing)\u00A0come out right, do the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAttach the 1st engine to the engine mount of 1 wing with radial (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E-style) symmetry set to 1 instance so you only get the 1 engine.\u00A0 You need to use radial symmetry here for step 2 to work.\u00A0 It\u0027s best to start with the engine on the left wing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nStill in radial (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E) symmetry, attach however many blades you want to the 1st engine\u0027s hub.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSwitch to mirror (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E-style) symmetry, change instances to 2.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGrab the 1st complete engine assembly (rotor plus blades) and put it back.\u00A0 This creates a mirrored duplicate on the other wing engine mount.\u00A0 The advantage of doing things this way is that it mirrors the direction of the blades on the 2nd engine, so you don\u0027t have to go back and change them later to spin the opposite direction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRight-click on the 2nd engine (right wing) and select \u0022Remove from symmetry\u0022, then reverse direction.\u00A0 Do NOT remove its blades from symmetry.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now, when viewed from the front, the engine on the left wing will spin clockwise and the engine on the right wing will spin counter-clockwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make a 2-engine push-pull plane (engines fore and aft), it\u0027s a bit different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBuild the front engine as in steps 1 and 2 above.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nALT-click on the complete front engine assembly to clone it, rotate it 180^, and attach the clone on the rear end.\u00A0 Rotating the engine around backwards takes the blade direction with them, so again you don\u0027t have to switch the blades around.\u00A0 Also, as the 2 engines where not installed with symmetry, you don\u0027t have to remove the rear engine from symmetry, or even change its direction of rotation.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhat you DO have to change, however, is the pitch of the blades.\u00A0 They have to be angled the opposite direction as the front blades.\u00A0 This includes any deployment authority you have set up for variable pitch.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE:\u00A0 There is some evidence that KSP models air being accelerated back past the plane by forward props.\u00A0 Thus, the rear prop could well need slightly more pitch than the front prop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-13T23:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

instances of \u0022invert.\u0022\u00A0 The one I\u0027m referring to is \u0022Invert Direction\u0022\u00A0on the right-click menu for the part in build mode - see picture below.\u00A0 I did some more testing, and as far as I can tell, it does reverse the direction the motor rotates - so \u0022clockwise \u002B normal\u0022 and \u0022counterclockwise \u002B invert\u0022 result in the same direction.\u00A0 Based on the italic text under the button, it appears that this lets you change the direction of only \u003Cu\u003Eone\u003C/u\u003E engine in a symmetrical set -- allowing you to do counter-rotating props without removing the engines from symmetry for other purposes.\u00A0 \u00A0In that case, seems pretty handy!\u00A0\u00A0[EDIT - on\u00A0second thought, this might be problematic for reversing the propeller direction.\u00A0 But could be useful for other contraptions - a pitching machine comes to mind.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuessing my original error involved using the two commands inconsistently, maybe in combination with the props ending up extending in the right direction.\u00A0 But at any rate, the plane is now working as expected with no net
