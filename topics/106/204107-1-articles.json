Robotic parts? They perform better than IR and the KAL controller does things beyond robotics that I\u0027d be dead without. Suit, Surface Science, those are nice but skippable. I couldn\u0027t play KSP the way I do without KAL controllers. The only bug worth noting is Robotic Drift. It\u0027s unavoidable and modded robotics will introduce the same bug as it\u0027s Unity-engine based. KSP does a clever workaround to calculate all the large \u0026lt;--\u0026gt; small distance differences and the result makes any moving part drift over time. Heck, the node connections on Infernal Robotics suffer from way more bugs than BG parts.
