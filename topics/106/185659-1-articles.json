I slapped four heavy rotors on the Ikarus-D. It went up to 122 m/s with six-blade rotors made with FAT control surfaces. I didn\u0027t attempt further optimisations to see if I could get it to go past that, other than trying with 4-bladers (slower, weaker) and larger diameter rotors (no difference to top speed, but so much lifting power it almost tore itself apart when I increased pitch.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to Eve, from my first attempts it appears that rotors are more effective on Eve because of the thicker atmosphere so they certainly won\u0027t limit your lifting power. Engine power however does. You might want a gizmoed double motor there where a freewheel \u002B single rotor is ample on Kerbin for that reason. Duna is the opposite, the limiting factor is the rotor\u0027s ability to produce lift so you\u0027ll want more blades and a bigger disk; however you won\u0027t need as much motor because of the lower gravity and the fact that you will be rotor-limited more than power-limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-20T14:59:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/20/2019 02:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-20T20:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot just over 160 m/s today with a tilt rotor, pics tomorrow morning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222mTzxNN.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2mTzxNN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then switched to a quad rotor design for better handling in hovers, and less strain on the servos (less likely that the nacelles get ripped off), and could move around a jumbo 64 tank at over 100 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002284tuyph.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/84tuyph.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTested the design on Eve, it had a habit of ripping the nacelles off in the thick atmosphere, so I have to be careful about the range of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, and transitioning, but I was able to get a jumbo 64 tank payload moving at 72m/s in a slight climb on Eve.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022RgmhgV1.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/RgmhgV1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnloaded, it was doing over 90 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-21T10:03:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2019 10:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-21T10:54:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forget where I saw it but someone made a post about torque stacking.

faster the rotor reaches whatever RPM you have it set for, provided you can keep the fuselage from spinning the other way instead.\u00A0 Also, I think higher torque enables the rotor maintain higher RPM against the ever-increasing drag.\u00A0 Torque also seems to help get and keep\u00A0big, heavy rotors spinning even at lower speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an aesthetic distaste for rotors spinning so fast their joints stretch and you\u0027ve got blade pieces magically hanging more than their own length away from the part they\u0027re attached to.\u00A0 So I prefer to keep the RPM down where that\u00A0doesn\u0027t happen.\u00A0 To get the necessary \u0022thrust\u0022, this might mean I need more blades, which also helps keep the RPM down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to me that rotor-based props\u00A0don\u0027t actually make \u0022thrust\u0022 by shoving a fluid atmosphere backwards like real props do.\u00A0 Instead, because they\u0027re made of wing panels or control surfaces, they function the same way wings normally do in KSP.\u00A0 That is, if they move forward through the atmosphere with a positive \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, a lift force magically appears on their upper surface and pulls them in that direction.\u00A0 Thus, the blades\u00A0pull the rest of the plane along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom line, therefore, is that to increase \u0022thrust\u0022 (actually \u0022pull\u0022), you want to maximize the lift the blades create.\u00A0 This argues both for higher RPM and larger blade area, although these things compete with each other.\u00A0 However, the blades are almost perpendicular to the direction the plane as a whole is moving.\u00A0 Thus, the blades act like deployed airbrakes---the faster the plane as a whole moves forward, the greater the drag from the blades impose on forward motion.\u00A0 And\u00A0the bigger the blade area, the greater the \u0022airbrake\u0022 effect of the prop.\u00A0 This is probably why there\u0027s such a seemingly low speed limit for rotor-based props.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might be, therefore, that variable pitch props might give higher speed.\u00A0 They\u0027d work exactly backwards from real life, using fine (flat) pitch for takeoff to maximize \u0022pull\u0022 at low speeds, then use course (steep) pitch for cruise to reduce\u00A0the frontal area drag.\u00A0 However, increasing blade pitch has to be mindful of exceeding the blades\u0027 critical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E in the direction they\u0027re spinning, to avoid stalling the blades.\u00A0 So pitch changes should probably be pretty small and might not have enough effect to bother with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-21T19:15:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

For a given RPM, a greater rotor diameter results in higher velocity of the wing/control segments, and thus more efficient low pitch blades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI sense that torque drops off as RPM approaches max RPM, so I think the key is rotor diameter\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYup, as you increase blade pitch, the lift vectors have more cosine loss towards forward motion but at the same time they also get longer, so the loss is less than the cosine of a constant force, although there are diminishing returns here.\u00A0 But at the same time, the blades\u00A0offer less frontal area drag to the motion of the plane.\u00A0 At some point, these curves cross, which is the max possible speed of a rotor-based prop.\u00A0 Or maybe increasing blade pitch increases rotational drag first.\u00A0 Either way, you hit a limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs to torque, to me it\u0027s a measure of the maximum power output of the rotor.\u00A0 You don\u0027t necessarily use it all.\u00A0 The more you use, the more EC/sec the rotor consumes, just like how rover wheels don\u0027t always consume their full listed EC/sec once you\u0027re up to speed.\u00A0 But, the capability is always there.\u00A0 Thus, the amount of torque actually USED, and thus the power consumed, might decrease once the rotor is at its max RPM, same as with rover wheels, but should you increase the load on the rotor, the torque you still have available will be there to maintain the highest RPM possible.\u00A0 Either this is the max RPM you\u0027ve set for the rotor or whatever lower value the torque can manage against the load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wider you make the rotor diameter, the more leverage its drag\u00A0has so the more torque is required to maintain any given RPM,, regardless of blade pitch.\u00A0 So again, you hit a limit.\u00A0 Rotors only have so much torque and all their max RPMs are less than infinity.\u00A0 And eventually you\u0027ll find an amount of rotational drag that the rotor\u0027s max torque can\u0027t overcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, there are practical limits to all aspects of rotor-based prop design:\u00A0 max rotor torque, max rotor RPM, and both the frontal and rotational drag forces on the blades, which increase whether you increase RPM or prop diameter.\u00A0 There\u0027s seemingly no getting around this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-22T06:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223623203\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561170747\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanes are not pulled forward by the lift of the prop blades (or the compressor blades of a turbofan), but are pushed forward by the reaction of shoving fluid backwards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe two are one and the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWings produce lift by Newton\u0027s 3rd law as well.

\u0022paddling\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLift\u00A0intentionally has\u00A0very little to do with the 3rd Law because it does not rely on reaction mass.\u00A0 That is, wings do not shove

little air as possible\u00A0because imparting movement to the air sucks energy away from moving the plane (aka drag).\u00A0 As a wing moves forward, its shape and angle of attack creates a pressure differential in the surrounding fluid, higher on the bottom and lower at the top.\u00A0 Thus, the partial vacuum on the top sucks the wing upwards (or, the higher pressure on the bottom tries to expand into the partial vacuum, pushing the wing ahead of it).\u00A0 That is lift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProps (and turbofan blades), however, create propulsive force by using reaction mass, so are all about the 3rd Law.\u00A0 The blade physically shoves a wad of air backwards and the 3rd Law pushes the plane forward.\u00A0 It\u0027s exactly the same thing as rowing a boat\u00A0or how a paddlewheel ship works.\u00A0 The oars/paddles shove water backwards and the reaction force\u00A0moves the boat forward.\u00A0 Thus, REAL props have more in common with rocket engines than wings.\u00A0 It\u0027s just that prop planes\u00A0don\u0027t have to carry their reaction mass around with them.\u00A0 This is \u0022paddling\u0022 and is the main thing happening with real props.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, in KSP (and most video games not going all-out on flight simulation), the atmosphere is not really a fluid--it really doesn\u0027t have any substance at all.\u00A0 It\u0027s just a mathematically defined volume of space where extra calculations happen that don\u0027t happen in vacuum, these calculations being designed to fake the aerodynamic forces in a \u0022close enough\u0022 manner.\u00A0 Thus, there\u0027s no way to shove a wad of \u0022air\u0022 backwards to get the 3rd Law \u0022paddling\u0022 reaction of real props, because there\u0027s no air to shove.\u00A0\u00A0This robs KSP rotor-based props of the primary propulsive method of real props, leaving them to rely entirely on the fake lift generated by the KSP aerodynamics system.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is why KSP rotor-based props perform so poorly compared to real examples.\u00A0 It\u0027s why rotor-based paddlewheel boats in KSP work even worse.\u00A0 With props, you basically have a wing that\u0027s creating most of its lift parallel with the desired direction of travel, which means that the wing\u0027s surface area is pretty much perpendicular to the desired direction of travel.\u00A0 Lift is a relatively weak force, barely enough to balance the weight of a plane in level flight.\u00A0 Thus, there\u0027s a low limit on the amount of propulsive force you can get from a rotor-based prop.\u00A0 And the faster the plane moves forward, the greater the drag becomes from the blades acting like airbrakes in\u00A0the air ahead of the plane.\u00A0 When this drag equals the forward component of the blade lift, the plane can\u0027t go any faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

possible, because moving the air wastes energy,\u00A0 This is why streamlining is a thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHOWEVER, this minimal movement of the air can be put to use to create lift.\u00A0 Lift comes from fluid dynamics, specifically Bernoulli\u0027s Principle, which can be derived from Newton\u0027s SECOND Law, not the 3rd.\u00A0 It\u0027s a conservation of energy thing.\u00A0 The air atop the wing moves a bit faster than that below, causing it to have lower pressure and creating a partial vacuum.\u00A0 The higher pressure below attempts to re-establish equilibrium and carries the wing with it.\u00A0 That is how aerodynamic lift is made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf\u00A0lift worked via Newton\u0027s 3rd Law\u00A0as you mistakenly believe, then there\u0027d be no difference between airplanes and helicopters.\u00A0 But they\u0027re\u00A0demonstrably different, as I shall now demonstrate....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe we can agree that helicopters are all about the 3rd Law, \u0022paddling\u0022 to use air as reaction mass, right?\u00A0 \u00A0Helicopters hover and maintain altitude by countering gravity head-on with the 3rd Law reaction force, same as a jet or rocket \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vertical Take-Off and Landing\u0022\u003EVTOL\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 And I\u0027m sure you\u0027re familiar with the strong, often dangerous winds under a low-flying helicopter.\u00A0 That wind is the reaction mass, accelerated by the rotor, and the volume of air and the speed it\u0027s moving are all necessary to counter the gravitational pull on the mass of the helicopter as a whole.\u00A0 It\u0027s exactly like being in the exhaust stream of a rocket or jet with the diameter of the helicopter\u0027s rotor disk.\u00A0 Agreed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, then if wings worked the same way as helicopter rotors\u00A0(using the 3rd Law), then to lift a plane of the same mass as the helicopter, the wings would have to shove down\u00A0just as much air just as fast.\u00A0 But an airplane\u0027s wing area is only a small fraction of the rotor disk area of a helicopter of the same mass (rather than\u00A0a larger\u00A0area\u00A0as you posited above).\u00A0 Therefore, to generate the same gravity-countering reaction force from a much smaller area, the airplane\u0027s wing would have to accelerate the air to a much higher downwards velocity than the helicopter\u0027s rotor to get the same mass-flow rate as the helicopter.\u00A0 Therefore, the wind felt under a low-flying plane would be even more intense than that under a helicopter of the same mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut this is not the case.\u00A0 In fact, there is no perceptible downdraft\u00A0under a low-flying plane, because wings DO NOT use the 3rd law to generate lift.\u00A0 They use fluid dynamics.\u00A0 Totally different animal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

This in turn means I need rotors that (1) maximise lifting capability per gram of dry mass and\u00A0(2) are robust enough to stand the stresses of the Evian atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve discovered so far:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(1) As far as I can tell, Big S Elevon 2s make the best rotor lifting surfaces. I\u0027ve tried wing connectors and other elevons, and these just lift best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(2) I get most lifting power per gram with the following power solution:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- 1 heavy rotor\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 1 flat servo\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 4 small servos for collective control\u003Cbr\u003E\n- 4 Big S Elevon 2s for rotor blades\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lifting unit is a classic contra-rotator, with the heavy rotor sitting on the flat servo, and the blades (2 in each direction) sitting on the small servos clipped to the top and bottom half of the heavy rotor.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(3) Well known fact, but still: rotors scale with size, up to a point where there are diminishing returns. Mine are about as wide as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried a variety of other solutions for this but this is the best I get. My craft weighs in at just under 50 tons, and it\u0027s powered by three of the above lifting units. It\u0027s currently at about 24 km altitude, climbing at about 7.5 m/s. Peak climb was 14.9 m/s between 13 and 15 km. The optimal collective setting appears to be 7 degrees, up until about 23 km when it starts slowly falling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-06-23T17:56:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2019 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngrybobH","CreatedById":165814,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-23T17:51:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223623847\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185659\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221561299628\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022167629\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brikoleur\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Brikoleur said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I\u0027ve discovered so far\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy discoveries are in agreement with yours.
