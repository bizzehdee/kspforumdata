But let\u0027s face it, it results a too cumbersome system to be enjoyable. The ideal would be a sort of mouse-guided arm, and you see potentially similar stuff in some mods. BDA has mouse-controlled firing turrets, and if I am not mistaken, retractable engines has a mouse-controlled spotlight or something like that. Now, configuring a couple of buttons where you could go foward/backwards with the arm, and using mouse guidance, would result a satisfying arm, wouldn\u0027t it? I think it would be manageable, the game would support such a thing, but someone would have to develop it first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-29T22:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBreaking Ground question moved to the Breaking Ground subforum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Okhin","CreatedById":201182,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-30T16:24:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, if you\u0027re going for mods, then you have mods which provides full fledged arms (such as Konstruction for instance, or Kanadarm which is, by itslef, a robotic arm iirc). You can probably map some actions to mouse action (probably not on mouse movement though). But you can move robotic arms in a not so cumbersome way, for a robotic arm with stocks. Just align various plane together, and probably use camera lock. The arm I made above is basically a rotating plane (with a 3 degree of freedom head), which means that it can reach any point in the X-Y coordinate (if it\u0027s in reach of course), and then you rotate your plan around X, allowing you to go 3D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not very instinctive but that\u0027s how robotics arms tends to work anyway (or they\u0027ll have some blind positions out of which they can\u0027t move, it\u0027s funny went it happens, the arm can\u0027t decide if it must go up or down, math saying it that both are valid options, it just stay stuck weirdly in its position and you\u0027ll have to move it by hand). The main issue with stock robotic arms is the wobliness of the structures (and the weight balance) which makes it hellish to move anything at more than few centimeters per seconds. At which point it\u0027s faster to dock, or claw your way through whatever you wanna do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I do not know if it\u0027s very realistic, but besides the canadarm and, I think, one arm on the ISS, robotic arms aren\u0027t really used in space.
