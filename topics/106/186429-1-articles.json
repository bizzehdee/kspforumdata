The lower the RPM, the lower the velocity of the blade, the higher the pitch needs to be. The higher the pitch is, then the more the lfit vector is pointed sideways instead of forward, and the more torque there is from lift in addition to just drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigher RPM, lower torque should make the problem not as bad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne Italian design in WW2 lengthened one wing to counteract the roll.

It doesn\u0027t fly as well as its counter-rotating prop twin, but it does fly O.K.

The biggest torque-related effect that I had was during landing, when I hit the brakes, at that moment the angular momentum in the prop turned the plane over. So I had to brake using the prop, by setting the blade pitch (authority limiter) to zero or slightly negative. (Which also helps against the planes tendency to faceplant when using the wheel-brakes.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a screenshot of the plane trimmed for stable flight: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kOXPP7fZy2gHpJUJZw7fnHpMkUfGteed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E[Screenshot on G\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kOXPP7fZy2gHpJUJZw7fnHpMkUfGteed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eoogle Drive]\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.
