First thing I made was a simple prop plane, and couldn\u0027t wait to try it out. Only I found that no matter what I tried the engine wouldn\u0027t turn the prop. I then figured maybe I needed the control editor... only to discover it was as straight forwards as Lombard Street. Could Squad really not take a little time to add an in-game tutorial. I know I can Google the stuff, but\u00A0it\u0027s just kinda annoying to be so ready to try out the new stuff, then realize I can\u0027t because it\u0027s so different to anything else in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
