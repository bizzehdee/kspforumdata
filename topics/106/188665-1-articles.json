I\u0027ve never docked with a port attached tirectly to a hinge and only a hinge, but I have used robotic arms to dock.

One of those crafts, an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E, also uses a robotic arm of its own configured similarly to reach out and dock with the space station.

I\u0027ve tried making movable docking ports so rovers could more easily attach to mining craft on the mun, etc. I also run tests on Kerbin, and when I do, the rover, once docked, using a hinge or hydraulic actuator, violently bounces out of control. I\u0027ve also tried to make extensions for rover wheels. The thought being, a compact design for transport, and then extend the actuators with the attached wheels for a stable, wide wheel base once a location is reached, i.e. the mun. But the wheels attached to the actuators bounce violently out of control. I\u0027ve tried using the larger actuators, and I\u0027ve used steel plates to stiffen the connections.

But they get \u003Cstrong\u003Emuch\u003C/strong\u003E stronger when the parts are locked, even more so when combined with autostruts. In the locked state autostruts are able to traverse the robotic parts, so you can autostrut a part on one side of the robotic part to another part on the other side of said robotic part. Constructs like folding wings that are folded inside a fairing during launch, folded in behind the heatshield during aerobraking on Eve, and then unlock-unfold-relock while hanging off parachutes, or rover wheels that are folded in during launch and unlock-unfold-relock in orbit work quite well for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(\u003Cs\u003EDon\u0027t activate autostruts on the robotic part itself, that\u0027s bugged in a way that may prevent the part from moving.
