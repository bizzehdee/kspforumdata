But I couldn\u0027t find a previous thread touching on this subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I know folks believe that money in career mode is too easy. But today I figured out how to basically have unlimited funds in career mode. I keep getting contracts for \u0022Science around \u0026lt;YourFavoriteCelestialBody\u0026gt;\u0022. Usually only worth 1-10 science depending on the planet targeted. But usually worth substantial cash. So I parked satellites, with lots of solar panels and batteries, around each of planets, moons, etc. Now when I get the contract, I just jump to the appropriate satellite and transmit the current temperature back. I just made $450k in about 5 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure this is not what the developers intended. And it likely needs to be fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T06:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn time this will probably be fixed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame issue could of been seen when Science and Career was first implemented.
