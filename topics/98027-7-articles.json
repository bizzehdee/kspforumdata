I believe that if it were up to FlowerChild, both of these would be kept/taken out...and that might well make the game more fun for more people. But I don\u0027t think reverts are likely to ever go away entirely; nor do I think it likely that more than a small minority of players will choose to turn them off in the difficulty settings. My thought process, then, is this: if reverts aren\u0027t going anywhere, and if overuse of reverts is worse than overreliance on Kerbal Engineer (as I believe it is), and if doing without the latter makes abuse of the the former more likely (as I believe it does), then making delta-v readouts stock would be the lesser evil.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) From the experience of the challenge, one thing I\u0027ve learned is that a good way to strike a balance between the extremes of pure guesswork and obsessive number-watching is to make the player figure it all out by hand.

Whereas you derive joy from being spontaneous and just seeing (which is a totally valid way to play, don\u0027t get me wrong) and others from calculating themselves (which is also totally valid) I personally like to see exactly how much I can do with the lowest cost (which doesn\u0027t always mean least fuel or lowest dV, but those are involved) and then see if I can actually do it. There\u0027s not much difference between not knowing if you can take that ship to Laythe at all, or if you can take that ship to Laythe with your paper-thin margins.
