I specifically asked Nathan about the camera and the mesh bug. He says he\u0027s \u0027fixed\u0027 the camera but was totally unaware of the mesh issue. His response was most amusing. -\u0022 I can say I\u0027ve hit the bottom and stopped at a depth of 950m, so unless there\u0027s something special about 1km...\u0022 - I let him know just how \u0027magical\u0027 1,000m\u002B depths really are.\n\nMaritime doesn\u0027t use any plugin so I\u0027m hoping it\u0027s safe. But it does rely on cheating KSP density calculations. Large volume\u0027s, low mass. At the worst, I\u0027m hoping all I have to do is pitch the blisters out the window and rework the mass on all the parts. I\u0027m hoping anyway.\n\nThe sub pack though uses Firespitter on all it\u0027s parts. I haven\u0027t looked at the FS code but I\u0027m thinking he completely kills stock buoyancy to create his own. If that\u0027s the case, and if stock buoyancy can still be killed using the same method, it should be safe.\n\nOne byproduct I hope to see out of all of this though is the final demise of \u0027Better\u0027 Buoyancy. I swear to god people are amusing. Ferram creates one popular mod and suddenly everyone jumps on his tailcoat thinking he must know everything there is to know about modding. After now understanding C# and looking at his code for BB... it\u0027s a joke.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-28T11:26:06Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2015 11:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T18:01:09Z","Content":"Nathan tells me the log spamming is fixed and now that he\u0027s aware of the issues at 1,000m\u002B, he\u0027s going to look into it."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T18:15:04Z","Content":"Fengist, please refrain from posting the content of private messages publicly, in accordance with [Rule 2.2f](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064)."},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T20:36:43Z","Content":"Hey, do you think you could make some type of clipper ship part that has an opening cargo bay?

Cargo bay\u0027s in water don\u0027t work the way you\u0027d expect. And neither do hulls. In the real world a hull displaces water. On Kerbin, the water intrudes inside the spaces. That means, if you were to look inside the hull, you\u0027d see it half full of water. How\u0027s that a problem? 1. Drag. Anything below the waterline that hasn\u0027t been \u0027tweaked\u0027 for this mod will add drag directly proportional to it\u0027s mass. 2. Collision. Anytime anything contacts the surface of the water, a collision check is made. Therefore, anything inside the hull at or about the waterline will have a LOT more chances to break and/or explode than things on the deck of the ship.\n\nHope that explains it.\n\nBut, I did once look into putting containers on ships. If I could get them working properly (it\u0027s an issue of multiple docking ports on one part) that would solve some of your requests."},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T21:31:37Z","Content":"Hmmm...maybe a part that has a shallow opening bay that has a lot of hull between it and the water...though for me water coming in isn\u0027t much of a concern due to me mostly using the parts for landship stuff since the drive from the runway to the water is kind of soul crushingly long."},{"CreatedByName":"minepagan","CreatedById":132643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T22:42:09Z","Content":"So....looking back, I have not seen any request like this, and it does not seem like it won\u0027t work....\n\nAny chance of hangar deck parts for the CVE pack?

And, more specifically, a flight deck piece with an elevator?\n\nIn order to do this it would require a completely new model for hulls. An elevator implies that there is a hangar deck below the flight deck. The clipper hull was never designed to be a multi-deck ship. In order to make a ship large enough to handle a carrier that has a hangar deck, you\u0027d need an SPH much larger than the current one. Working with Dice\u0027s Boat Parts clued me into that. In order to have a larger hangar, you\u0027d either need to use another mod or I\u0027d have to write the code to extend it. Nextly, a whole new collection of proper sized parts would have to be created, like the bridge, sponsons, fantail, hatches, etc.. And then, like the question below, I\u0027d be asked to make arrestor cables, arrestor hooks, catapults, catapult hooks, specialized docking ports to connect the aircraft to, specialized landing gear to connect to the docking ports... etc. And then, I\u0027d be asked to make support vehicles to service and move all the aircraft around. And then, because this thing would be a monstrosity I\u0027d have to completely rewrite the flotation code to make sure the thing didn\u0027t tip over because it would be massively top heavy since you can\u0027t put any mass below the surface without it creating huge drag. And THEN... just like Dice\u0027s Boat Parts (which has all that) you\u0027d be stuck with a ship that you\u0027d pretty much have to build to exact design specifications and I\u0027d end up repeating those instructions over and over again because no one would read them....\n\nUmmm. I think no.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Can we have an arrestor hook/line of some sort. The old boat mod had one, so I think it will work.\n\nsee above. BUT... one thing I may consider that would be fairly easy to do is just the arrestor hook with no cable. What may work is to consider it to be a wheel without all the wheel junk. But, have huge break torque on it so that once it hits the ground, you pretty much stop. I\u0027ll consider it. The problem there is, if I make one hook, it won\u0027t fit all sizes of landing gear so again, I\u0027m looking at multiple parts with different length hooks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-29T14:05:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2015 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T16:55:24Z","Content":"Does it make you happy that I find these parts great for mobile research bases for science and maybe eventually once i research it mining?"},{"CreatedByName":"scullyl","CreatedById":152844,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T01:01:38Z","Content":"I don\u0027t know if this has been mentioned before, but it seems like the Sidewheeler Starboard part doesn\u0027t have an attachment point but the Port side one does!

Like which pack they\u0027re downloading and their IP address and stuff that into a MySQL database. This information collection is to help me get some statistics on how well my mods are doing. Of late, I\u0027ve noticed a HUGE problem with my server... massive lag at times. I assumed it was my host causing this hiccup that prevented some of my images (like my signature images) from showing up. And it occasionally caused some huge lag downloading the packs.\n\nWell, I found out where the problem is. In the .php file that the download button links to I completely forgot just how asinine certain groups of individuals can be on this planet. I assumed that anyone who clicked on the download button actually wanted my mod. But, I forgot about the Chinese. After reviewing my database of downloads, I found not hundreds, but THOUSANDS of repeat downloads spaced only seconds apart coming from... China. So it would seem that my mod has somehow become either such a source of amusement to the Chinese in that they need thousands of copies of the Maritime Pack, or it\u0027s becoming such a threat to their national security that they\u0027re trying to do denial of service attacks against me. \n\nEither way, I\u0027ve made some changes to my download buttons.

I try to explain about this to Acea on his thread couple days ago, but because of me romeglish language, I don\u0027t think he understand much:(\n\nAnd they\u0027re Chinese so I\u0027m sure lots gets lots in the translation. Once 1.0.5 comes out it MAY be a bit better, depending on how they rework the float code. If not, I\u0027ll find some way to make it work.\n\nI just posted on his thread as well. I hope I explained it well enough.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-02T15:37:46Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2015 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"Generalstarwars333","CreatedById":151938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-02T19:04:28Z","Content":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I can\u0027t get that to email to myself for later since It\u0027s blocked on our school computers!"}]}
