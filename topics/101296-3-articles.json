I only ask because I am also interested about the centaur stage when you make it. First will you make optional like FASA where you can add two rl10s or one? Second as I am sure as many of us who have tried making stock Atlas/Centaurs in the past the 2.5 to 1.25 difference just doesn\u0027t look right. So what I am asking in a round about way is would you consider making an odd diameter for the centaur stage like 2.0 or even 1.875 just so it looks more like an atlas/centaur. Again I know you are going for a kerbalized look and I know this is not a replica. Still I know you are going for the feel of the Atlas. Also I am only talking about the Atlas V version. All the rest are standard sizes but if you look at the Atlas V there is a noticeable and iconic difference. \n\n![Atlas_V(401)_launches_with_LRO_and_LCROSS_cropped.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Atlas_V(401)_launches_with_LRO_and_LCROSS_cropped.jpg)\n\nIts actually only like that in the 400 series. In the 500 series the centaur is tucked away in the fairing with the payload but the centaur stage is the same diameter as the 400 series. All we would have to do in game if we wanted to make a 500 series atlas V is get creative with procedural fairings. \n\n![atlas_v_family.png](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/photos/uncategorized/2008/07/09/atlas_v_family.png)\n\n![a5family_full.jpg](http://spaceflightnow.com/atlas/av045/images/a5family_full.jpg)\n\nJust fruit for thought.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T15:18:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989**"},{"CreatedByName":"SnowWhite","CreatedById":121477,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T16:48:48Z","Content":"Ok, I\u0027ll make Centaur V 1.875-meter.

I agree with Karoffelkuchen however I am just looking to make sure that it doesn\u0027t look strange. As I said 2.5 to 1.25 just doesn\u0027t look right. 2.5 for the centaur would allow the widest variety of payloads. The rd180 can still be 2.5 and then it tapers up to 3.0 with the tank being 3.0 all the way to the top. Any way the main point being is that you should do as you wish or what you think would be best to make it looked kerbalized and accurate. You have done great so far.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T17:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 05:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sp1989**"},{"CreatedByName":"SnowWhite","CreatedById":121477,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T13:44:31Z","Content":"Thanks for everyone for the great pictures!\n\nNow, when textures are ready that would be hard to remake everything.
