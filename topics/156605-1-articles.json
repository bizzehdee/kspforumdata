I test-flew a version with that configuration and it worked okay, but I ultimately decided to just put a fuel tank adapter on the front since the hatch location on the Mk1-2 meant that there was nowhere that I could put a ladder that would allow Kerbals to get on and off the plane in high-gravity environments (such as Laythe, where I hope to eventually send a variant of that design.) I never gave any serious consideration to the Mk3 cockpit, though, mostly because of its asymmetry.
