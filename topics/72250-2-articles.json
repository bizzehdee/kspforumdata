I closely follow the Dream Chaser, it\u0027s my favorite of the bunch. Lower G\u0027s on re-entry and it strays from a capsule design (which isn\u0027t bad, it\u0027s just nice to have the lower G forces of the Dream Chaser). CST-100 just seems very basic, which isn\u0027t always a bad thing, though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Soda Popinski","CreatedById":92416,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-14T02:20:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Woopert\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Woopert\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDragon and Orion are for different missions and/or needs.
