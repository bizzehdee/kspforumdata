I\u0027ll explain it as simple as possible:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EHave the same parts be unlockable in several different nodes. Design the tech tree accordingly.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would allow the tech tree to have many more distinct \u0022branches\u0022, to allow for a variety of different ways to progress through the tree. It would begin with multiple starting nodes, all containing roughly the same parts. An \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, some simple tail fins, some form of manned or unmanned command module, a simple Science experiment, and the usual struts and girders. Parachute optional. From there on, different paths of progress would be laid out for the player. Stronger SRBs for more oomph, or liquid fuel engines for more precision? Manned or unmanned flight? Recovering your craft or sending it into the wide, wild yonder? Airplanes or rockets? Interplanetary flight, or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E space stations? Advanced vacuum engines or powerful lifter engines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlocking a part in one node would subsequently lower the cost of other nodes containing the same part, to the points of nodes being unlocked for free if every part in them is unlocked through other means. This way, you might accidentally unlock unmanned launch technology while working on a manned space program, or rudimentary aircraft while unlocking advanced rover parts, but that\u0027s just engineering in a nutshell. Sooner or later, you\u0027ll find yourself with the parts and tools required to do something completely different from what you intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeveral of the branches would eventually merge in certain aspects. For instance, no matter whether you picked unmanned or manned exploration initially, you would progress through the same nodes for fuel tanks, engines, stabilizer fins, decouplers and suchlike. Propulsion technology doesn\u0027t depend as much on payload, the lower stages would have to be pretty similar no matter where there are Kerbals on board or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat originally gave me this idea was playing through Career mode and realizing that I had to unlock three or four different nodes before I could build a working 2.5 m lifter. You get the fuel tanks in one node, the engines in another, adapters in a third and decouplers in a fourth. What if there was a node that had all the parts you needed for a rudimentary 2.5 m rocket, but which didn\u0027t offer any variety with regards to engines nor fuel tanks? With a \u0022tech web\u0022, this would be the case. You could rush to build a basic 2.5 m booster stage, or unlock a variety of engines, fuel tanks, adapters and decouplers node-by-node and eventually combine them into a more capable booster. Likewise, you could concentrate on aircraft if you so wished, without swimming through an ocean of rocket parts to get there. Or vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing a \u0022tech web\u0022 instead of a tech tree would make the research and parts unlocking aspect of the game a lot more flexible, and cater to a variety of different playstyles from the beginning. The initial node would be rather costly, say, 100 Science points, to encourage players to pick and stick with a specialization rather than spending all their points unlocking rudimentary parts for every purpose. Players would, of course, start with 100 Science points to unlock their first node, but have to earn their Science after that. That being said, since the initial nodes would all contain mostly the same parts, starting anew in a different branch would be dramatically less expensive after a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think? Is this a thing in some mod tech trees already? I kind of suspect it is, but if so, I\u0027d like to see it spread further. Laying down several paths of progression would do a lot to allow different playstyles with the same tech tree, without overwhelming the player with choices. I think it\u0027s an idea worth looking into, at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T12:22:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting. As a thought experiment, I\u0027ll see your tech web and raise you some \u0027tech dust\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo away with a player-visible tech tree and just give every part a science cost. The player can then pick and choose parts as they see fit and unlock them in whatever order they see fit. However, there are a couple of restrictions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe total\u00A0science cost of unlocking all the parts either\u00A0remains the same as the current cost for unlocking the whole science tree, or is a rather han that cost to a) compensate for the fact that most players will have a few parts that they\u0027ll just ignore and b)\u00A0because, as per your suggestion,\u00A0the costs for unlocking parts are related and parts get cheaper if you\u0027ve already unlocked a lot of similar parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that there is a tech tree of sorts \u0027beneath the hood\u0027 which defines those relative costs. That could be exposed to the player if desired but for the most part the logical relationships should be fairly - well, \u003Cem\u003Elogical \u003C/em\u003E- anyway. If I\u0027ve unlocked a whole pile of engines, then my engineers already have a lot of experience with building new engines, so researching more engines is going to be easier. Likewise for power generation, nuclear components, structural components, science gear etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn practice, players won\u0027t be completely free to choose parts in any order. There\u0027ll always be some constraints placed by the need to get to a place where new science can be earned. So, most players will probably start by unlocking enough basic parts to get to the Mun and/or Minmus in whatever style of vessel they choose. After that though - it\u0027s entirely up to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesign your spacecraft, spec out the parts required, check how much science you need to unlock those parts, decide whether it\u0027s worth it. OK, the tech tree is no longer a teaching aid that walks the player through the various parts in order, but tutorials, the KSPedia and, if required, better part descriptions should take care of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-17T12:29:35Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2017 12:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codraroll","CreatedById":163815,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T17:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with having every part available from the get-go, in any order you want, is that the \u0022guidance\u0022 aspect of the game design is lost. For absolute freedom, there is sandbox mode. A completely open tech \u0022tree\u0022 would be nice for the players who know exactly what they want, but unless you\u0027re already sure which order it\u0027s best to unlock stuff in to suit your playstyle, you\u0027d have no clear path of progression to follow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, a feature like this should be as useful to new players as to experienced ones. The tech web would lay down a few distinct paths to follow, so as not to overwhelm a player with what to choose, and to prevent strategical mistakes. For instance, newbies thinking that unlocking all the engines or all the solar panels before anything else is a good idea. Tech trees help distinguish which nodes you can go for early on, and which are clearly meant to be left until the end-game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think letting players access every part to design a craft before unlocking them is a good idea in a specified career mode. For sandbox, sure, but career is meant to introduce players to the game gradually. It\u0027s best to start with the parts required to build a very bare-bones craft, just to teach players what each of them do (note how the first node of the current tech tree does this very elegantly), and then introduce new parts gradually. Each node is clearly presenting the player with a set of items that do one specific - known - task better/differently than the parts (s)he already has unlocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with a tech tree is that the parts are only introduced in a single context. You get extendable ladders for the purpose of entering and exiting a Mun lander, but you also need ladders to enter and exit aircraft, and researching Mun landers to build a workable aircraft makes little sense. Likewise, you get probe cores only after you\u0027ve achieved orbit (unless you know exactly what to do to get them earlier), so you can\u0027t make meaningful unmanned sounding rockets. It makes sense to group rocket fairings and aircraft wings together under the node \u0022Aerodynamics\u0022, but their actual purposes are wildly different. A tech web would introduce the different parts at different points of progression, depending on your play style. For unmanned play, batteries would be among the first thing you\u0027d unlock, in manned play they\u0027re early mid-game. For aircraft play, you\u0027d unlock small orbital insertion engines (for satellites deployed from suborbital aircraft), before the first rocket lifter engine. A rover branch would give you large cargo containers before multi-Kerbal crew capsules, and so on. Putting together a tech web, and determining when to introduce the different nodes in different contexts would be a bit of a nightmare, but I think the gameplay experience would benefit in the end.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T17:21:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI quite like the way the mod Engineering Tech Tree does it. It has very specialized lines of research, so you can focus on improving a particular type of technology (like SRBs) with science costs increasing for the more advanced nodes. It has some of the benefits of both of the ideas presented so far in this thread, because you can choose several possible paths of progression whilst also having a lot of freedom in exactly what you unlock (the nodes tend to be low-cost and contain few parts). Such a system does not detract from the idea of a somewhat linear progression, but it provides more versatility for science gathering. It also helps to make a playthrough with low science returns more viable, as the individual nodes tend to cost less for the tradeoff of containing fewer parts in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-17T17:23:37Z\u0022 title=\u002201/17/2017 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 17, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-17T17:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222924920\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022155122\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221484673287\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022163815\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Codraroll\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n32 minutes ago, Codraroll said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with having every part available from the get-go, in any order you want, is that the \u0022guidance\u0022 aspect of the game design is lost.

Your example of building a 2.5m lifter is an excellent one. I think either of our systems offers comparable or better levels of strategy without being as irritating. Even my \u0027unlock any thing in any order\u0027 approach does require some prioritization and meaningful decision making. (How many engines do I need. All of them? Some of them?
