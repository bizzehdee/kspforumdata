The simpler way is to just keep burning retrograde until your in your same elliptical orbit but now backwards and finally drop your apoapsis back down with rockets. The more complex way is to stop burning retrograde earlier to set up an aerobrake that leaves you close your target apoapsis.\n\nOr as FancyMouse suggests you can launch a new rocket, wait to be in the plane of its orbit, and launch directly into the direction its rotating."},{"CreatedByName":"GreenCoconut","CreatedById":145697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T07:17:00Z","Content":"I had enough fuel to reverse the orbit, I didn\u0027t know that was possible before though haha\n\nand yes that was my mistake, I didn\u0027t launch in the plane of the orbit required by the mission, well just time for me learn from my mistakes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T12:38:35Z","Content":"With AP/PE around 4 million, both options would have taken less than 2k fuel by a fair bit..."}]}
