Well I kinda looked at the movie with two different viewpoints. One the one hand there was my inner science/strategy/lore nerd that was screaming about 80-90% of the movie that this **** made no ****ing sense, on the other there was my inner kid that grinned and marveled at the choreography, special effects and overall epicness (especially when enhanced by some pretty damn awesome music scores at times).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall I liked it when I saw it, because it managed to again give me that stupid grin on my face that I also got when I first saw the battles at helm\u0027s deep and gondor. But sadly, it did go hand in hand with several cringe-moments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re just looking for the epic, bombastic feel of pure awesome battle, you\u0027ll definitely like it. If you\u0027re bothered by blatant breaking of the laws of physics, tactics and battle strategy that makes absolutely no real-life sense and a playing kinda fast and loose with the source material, you\u0027ll hate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short: are you just looking for epic feels and willing to suspend your disbelief? You\u0027ll like it. Looking for more? You\u0027ll probably hate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the time, I certainly liked it (I think mostly because Guillermo Del Toro\u0027s choreography saved it for me) but I\u0027m not sure if I would like it should I watch it again when I\u0027m in more critical mood.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T15:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EForget the \u0022accuracy\u0022, the movie fails on a storytelling level first!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon144","CreatedById":80626,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T02:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/F1hxGHl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022F1hxGHl.jpg\u0022\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aghanim","CreatedById":76587,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T11:26:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBug: They have the giant worm, why they doesn\u0027t use it to drill under the defender and kill them all?
