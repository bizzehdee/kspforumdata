I remember in 0.90 and pre 0.90 that when you processed an experiment, it\u0027s scientific value would increase slightly. If I recall correctly? Anyway, I have a crap ton of science from my voyage from Minmus, and then built a station in the Eve-Gilly system, and transported all that data there, and gained new Eve-Gilly data as well. Now I am noticing that you can gain science per day, but now there also seems to be a size limit to the amount of science you can utilize... or something like that.

You click a button to turn science into science, but not too much or the lab is full, but you can put as much science into the lab as you want as long as it hasn\u0027t been turned into science.\u00A0 Then it gradually turns the science into science, unless it fills up the science but you can fix that by transmitting the science (which is way better than transmitting the science, because when you transmit the science you only get a small percentage of the science, but on the other hand if you transmit the science you get all the science), which turns the science into science that you can spend.\u00A0 What could be simpler?\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022

\u0022science\u0022 that need to get converted around.\u00A0 There are three different \u0022things\u0022 to keep straight:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EScience \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresults\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003EThese are the things that your science instruments generate.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EScience \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003EThis is what gets instantly stored in the science lab when you click the yellow \u0022research\u0022 icon on a science result, to get the science lab to start doing its thing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EScience \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003EThese are what you can spend in the R\u0026amp;D facility to unlock tech nodes.\u00A0 The science lab\u0027s job is to gradually convert \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E into \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E over time.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that we\u0027ve got the terminology straight, it becomes easier (and less confusing)\u00A0 to talk about how the lab works, as long as you never refer to just \u0022science\u0022 without qualifying which kind you mean.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s how the science lab interacts with the things above:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off:\u00A0 You can store science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresults\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in the lab, by stashing them there with an EVA kerbal.\u00A0 There\u0027s nothing special about this, it\u0027s just like stashing science results in a command pod or crew cabin. \u003Cstrong\u003ENote that there is no limit to how many science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresults\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the lab can store\u003C/strong\u003E, so you can use it as a convenient bottomless pit to stash your science as you wait to process it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next step is to convert the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresults\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E into \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, so that the lab can start doing its thing.\u00A0 This happens when you click the yellow \u0022process science\u0022 button on the science result UI.\u00A0 (Note that the science result \u003Cstrong\u003Edoesn\u0027t have to be currently stored in the lab itself\u003C/strong\u003E to do this; you can do it for any science result anywhere on the same ship as the lab.)\u00A0 The conversion from \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresult\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E is instant, it happens when you click the button.\u00A0 Here we run up against the lab\u0027s first limitation:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe lab can only store 500 science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E at one time.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 And that\u0027s not a super high ceiling.\u00A0 If you go to, say, the Mun with a full complement of science instruments, you can easily pick up enough science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresults\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in one biome to exceed the 500-\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E limit, and the problem only gets worse if you go biome-hopping.\u00A0 That\u0027s not a showstopper, though, it just means you can\u0027t process them all at once.\u00A0 Just stash all the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresults\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E in the lab, process as many of them into \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E as you can to bring the lab up to its 500-data limit, and then from time to time \u0022top it off\u0022 as the data points are consumed and more space becomes available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also worth noting that after you convert the science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresult\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E into science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe science result is still present and un-consumed.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 In other words, once you\u0027ve pressed that yellow button, \u003Cem\u003Eyou still have the result\u003C/em\u003E and the science lab doesn\u0027t need it.\u00A0 So at that point you could physically return the science result back to Kerbin for yummy science points, and you \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E get the goodies from the lab as described below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you tell the lab to start research.\u00A0 When you do this, the lab gradually starts turning science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E into science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E over time.\u00A0 The rate at which it does this is determined by a few factors:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAmount of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E stored in the lab.\u00A0 The higher the amount, the faster the rate at which the lab converts the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E into \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 So you want to keep your lab topped off at close to its 500 \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E limit as possible, in order to get the fastest return on investment.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAmount of crew.\u00A0 You can run a science lab with just one scientist, but if you have two of them, it goes faster.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExperience level of crew.\u00A0 The higher level your scientists are, the faster they will convert \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E into \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nNote that these factors all affect the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Espeed\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E with which science data is converted into science points, but not the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Econversion rate\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EScience labs always convert exactly one science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E into five science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 The only thing that changes is how many points per day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat brings us to the other limit you can bump up against:\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe lab can only store 500 science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E at one time.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0 (The fact that the number \u0022500\u0022 is the same for both data and points is one of the factors contributing to the confusion between the two.)\u00A0 So if you\u0027ve got your science lab researching, and the science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E fill up to 500, then it will stop processing and just sit there until you transmit the science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis brings us to the final step of the science lab lifecycle:\u00A0 transmitting.\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003E(Yet another source of confusion, because now there are two meanings of the word \u0022transmit\u0022.\u00A0 There\u0027s transmitting \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresults\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, i.e. what you do by clicking the little blue satellite-dish icon, which yields only a fraction of the science points; and then there\u0027s transmitting the lab\u0027s science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, which is fine and good and necessary, and doesn\u0027t lose anything.)\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 When you transmit the lab\u0027s science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, they become available to you to spend in the R\u0026amp;D facility to unlock those yummy tech nodes.\u00A0 It also clears them out of the science lab so that it will have more \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoint\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E space available, so that it can continue converting the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s pretty much it.\u00A0 Summing it all up, here\u0027s the way to use a lab most efficiently:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nCreate science results with instruments.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf necessary (i.e. if the ship-with-instrument isn\u0027t the ship-with-lab) use an EVA kerbal to transfer the result from the instrument to the ship-with-lab (could actually be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ein\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the lab, it\u0027s a convenient place to stash them).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPress the yellow \u0022research\u0022 button to convert the results into data stored in the lab.\u00A0 Try to get it as close to the 500-data limit as possible.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAfter researching a science result into data, you can go ahead and physically return the science result to Kerbin as usual.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTell the science lab to start researching.\u00A0 Make sure the science lab is fully staffed with the highest-level scientists you have available.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPeriodically revisit the lab over time for maintenance.\u00A0 Each time you do this, you do two things. First, transmit its accumulated science \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoints\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (so that you can spend them in R\u0026amp;D, and also to clear out space so you don\u0027t bump up against the 500-\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Epoint\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E limit).\u00A0 Second, research some more \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eresults\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E into \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E (to try to keep the lab as close to its 500-\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edata\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E limit as possible, to maximize the rate at which it converts data into points).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-22T18:24:27Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2015 06:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
