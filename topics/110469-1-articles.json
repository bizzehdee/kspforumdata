If you are okay with editing save files, start a new career and delete the funding, reputation, contract, strategy, and upgradable building SCENARIO{}s from the save file. You will essentially be playing a science mods game with kerbal experience. I read somewhere (a post from Harvester no less) that the game should cope fine when you edit out the different scenarios like that."}]}
