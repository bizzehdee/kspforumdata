I get that there are going to be factors limiting the specific impulse of thermal rockets, but having just a hard limit there is weird. I could live with that, though, if all the energy you put into a thermal rocket actually showed up again - I\u0027d expect it to appear as thrust. It does appear to do that for the most part, but there are some glaring exceptions. Sure, you\u0027ll have some losses since no system can be 100% efficient, but what you lose is still going to show up as waste heat - you can\u0027t just wave a magic wand and make excess energy go away. That\u0027s what appears to be happening on the antimatter thermal rockets - no noteworthy waste heat is being generated, the Isp is still low, an the thrust, while pretty intense for a chemical rocket, isn\u0027t remotely what it should be for a 405 gigawatt antimatter one. Unless the overwhelming majority of the power is being lost as gamma rays or only heating the exhaust after leaving the engine or something, we\u0027ve got a thermodynamics problem on our hands. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it would also be reasonable to expect that a 405 gigawatt engine with an Isp of only 3,000 seconds would totally break any vessel at full throttle, regardless of how strong it\u0027s built. If we assume an efficiency of 50%, that gives us a thrust of (405,000,000,000 W / (3,000 s * 9.81 m/s/s * 1/2)) * 50%, or just over 13.8 giganewtons (13,800,000 kN). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot on my ship, thank you very much!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, you\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E get a thrust that high by any realistic means (note that nothing on the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProject Rho table\u003C/a\u003E goes above about 400 meganewtons or so). The propellant flow would just be too big to manage, and you\u0027d inevitably end up with a substantially higher Isp. Of course, that wouldn\u0027t literally be a thermal rocket at that point - it would presumably be more akin to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#amplasma\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eplasma core antimatter rocket\u003C/a\u003E (Isp ~700,000 seconds, thrust ~50 kN for a 192-gigawatt system), which is a low-thrust high-Isp system, exactly the opposite of what the 3000-second Isp cap seems to suggest it would be. It could, of course, be \u0022geared\u0022 by pumping through more or less propellant, exchanging Isp for thrust to a certain extent, but I have a hard time believing that it\u0027d be able to gear itself as low as 3,000 seconds. (I may also point out that the 405-gigawatt antimatter reactor specifically identifies itself as \u0022Plasma-core\u0022 - this isn\u0027t that hard, people. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really know what\u0027s up with KSPI these days, but I really feel like putting the 3,000-second Isp cap on the antimatter thermal rockets did nothing for realism or gameplay.

KSP-Interstellar never shied away from real-life technologies just because they seemed overpowered (Alcubierre Warp Drives, on which the mod was founded, are a prominent example), and neither should it now. Oh, and by the way, if players utilize this strategy with RealFuels installed (if you take my advice and use the same resource stats as RealFuels to ensure compatibility), they will also have to deal with mitigating boil-off of the collected Nitrogen (though not nearly as bad as for storing Liquid Hydrogen)- which is another issue that adds difficulties to Propulsive Fluid Accumulator strategies...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEdit: I\u0027m realy not sure if Nitrogen should be allowed as an electric propellant.

This simply isn\u0027t possible (or if so, is VERY marginal- and doesn\u0027t work AT ALL for Real Solar System players such as myself- I play with the Kerbin 6.4x re-scale...) without Nitrogen-electric propulsion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strategy of Propulsive Fluid Accumulators is essentially no more nor no less OP\u0027d than any of the other ISRU strategies requiring ZERO input resources- such as ice mining on the Mun- and there\u0027s no reason to give this one special treatment. In fact, PFA\u0027s are *SIGNIFICANTLY* harder than Munar ice-mining, as on the Mun you can just land a really big nuclear reactor to power your ISRU plant and run it at 1000x time-warp if necessary... With PFA\u0027s, it\u0027s a *requirement* to set up a Microwave Beamed Power infrastructure or utilize some reactor with greater power-density for volume than basic fission (Fusion or Antimatter Reactors, for instance. Even Antimatter Initiated Reactors won\u0027t cut it, as they actually have a low ratio of volume, and thus induced drag in FAR, to power output- and instead opt for a lower reactor mass than fission, which doesn\u0027t help *at all* with the economics of PFA\u0027s when using FAR: where drag-power ratios are all that matter, and the mass of the satellite is completely irrelevant...), and PFA\u0027s can *only* be used at physical (up to 4x) time-warp, so Propulsive Fluid Accumulators are actually MUCH harder to set up than Munar ice-mining...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EP.S.\u003C/strong\u003E There\u0027s *another* MAJOR reason for utilizing nitrogen-electric propulsion for Propulsive Fluid Accumulators besides the ISP, by the way- one that you seem to actually have noticed in your discussion of thermal thruster degradation. As you\u0027ll notice in the PDF link I e-mailed you, Helicon Double Layer thrusters are not a design that allows for grid-erosion (the factor normally limiting electric propulsion engine lifespan), and have a virtually *unlimited* lifespan of use in space.
