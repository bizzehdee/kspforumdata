Refined Hyperium unlike uranium does not unleash abundant energy unless you first electrically charge it. What it is is a super battery, which can store electical charge equivalent to it\u0027s own mass converted into energy. Which means fully charged a kilogram battery would weigh 2 kilograms, and if detonated would explode like a kilogram of antimatter. Charging it takes time as too much electricity at once can overheat it, but that is why it is cooled while charging using liquid helium in massive industrial powerplants. Hyperium has the same melting point as steel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt occurred to me at first that using solar power in space to charge it would be ideal, but doing so would be a slow process, so slow that you may as well just build up industry on Earth to charge it faster.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy? Melting point that\u0027s why. If you hooked up a million solar panels on the moon to charge a kilogram of hyperium then I fear the electrical charge may overheat it and cause the battery to overheat and detonate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn earth we have a giant ocean to dump waste heat to, but on the moon water is scarce and putting giant radiator panels on the moon would make the whole process even more costly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMain Question: What is the fastest way on an Earth-like world to charge the super battery with a melting point of steel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess: Running tons of liquid helium over it while rocketing it out.... basically a stationary industrial rocket for waste heat disposal. That would allow for greater amounts of electrical charge without overheating it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInstead of steam plumes you have giant stationary rocket plumes shooting into the sky coming out of this powerplant. Cool eh?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWill this cause global warming? I dunno. Maybe if enough powerplants were built, but it is still arguably safer than a nuclear powerplant so long no one intentionally detonates the super batteries.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts? Would doing it this way enable faster charging times like I am thinking it would?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso I am unsure if the most optimal heat transfer coolant for the job needs a higher mass or not to transfer the most heat.... basically the difference between a slurry of crushed ice and liquid hydrogen or a slurry of crushed hydrogen ice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-29T19:47:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/29/2023 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 29\u0022\u003EJuly 29, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
