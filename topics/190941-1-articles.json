I don\u0027t think anyone Kerbal or human wants to have flaming debris raining down on their heads (or hae you ever seen that one Delta II Rocket launch thathappened back in the 1990\u0027s where the rocket explodes some 30 seconds into flight.. the debris had to go somewhere and it came raining down on the base (Luckily the people wer ein a concrete blockhouse but still it was a dangerous situation (Just look up Delta II Explosion on Youtube and you\u0027ll see what I mean...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the proposed idea is to put either th harbor of the launch sites for water based vehicles to either the north or the south of the base in line wihth the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.. reason is if a rocket were to explode well then the debris would hit the beach or the ocean to the east.. reducing damage.. even an inclined launch or a polar orbiter would not have an issue..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso just move these to a location in line with (or better yet slightly behind the VAD and you\u0027re good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENow let\u0027s add a 2nd Runway..

After all if Jeb wants to go from the Estrnaut complex to the Harbor eh\u0027s not going to hoof it there, it would\u00A0 take half the day, so let\u0027s drive him there in a prive car..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the administrtor of the program needs a plce ot park.. and ther eis a parkinglot in front of the administration building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah let\u0027s tie all of this together with simple two lane roads..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe End result I cam up with\u00A0 is this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/gallery/EeYYV4n\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/gallery/EeYYV4n\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd absolutely the final thing..Did I miss anything ?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a stickler for deatils and feedback.. and in fact to the folks of both \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Extended and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E harbor I hope you guys can give me feedback on this proposal I mean the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E peninsula is a large space..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe someone wants a new rocket base so they can start KErin World war 3.. complete with Missile silos..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr maybe a military base for those fighters..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mean with Kerbal konstructs and the other mods that are at our disposal, the skys the limit.. not to mention the sea air an even wpace..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay guys feel free to give feed pack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace-Coyote\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
