That puppy will reach almost 35km altitude before switching over automatically to LFO. And at that time going so fast, that I only need burn 1-200dV more (basically just to keep speed up whilst still cruising hyper-sonic through the upper atmosphere) to reach an orbit of 200km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, as Red Iron Clown said - fuel flow. Jet Fuel like monoprop isn\u0027t that picky. You can leave your tanks wherever you wish and fuel will reach the engines. LFO on the other hand need a direct connected route to your engines.
