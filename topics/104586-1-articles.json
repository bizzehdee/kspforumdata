It\u0027s obviously not a very well-thought out suggestion, \u0022hyperdrive part that takes u anywere\u0022, and little other detail.\n\nPoster B doesn\u0027t like the suggestion, but asks for more detail so he/she can change their opinion.\n\nPoster A doesn\u0027t handle criticism very well at all, so removes poster B\u0027s post.\n\nCue ***anarchy*** when Poster B finds out. Naturally, he/she\u0027ll be pretty dang mad that poster A removed their valid opionion, and may take their rage out on the thread. (If we were luckier, they\u0027d use the PM function..) In the end, it could work out to being *more* work for the moderators.Besides, that\u0027s what the report button is for. You can bring posts to the attention to moderators, and in the end they\u0027ll use their own discresion, preventing posts like \u0022Erm, this part would be overpowered, it could just take you anywhere. I don\u0027t think it would fit in with the rest of the game\u0022 from being removed for reason \u0022omg this person is stupid and meen\u0022\n\nI like how the KSP forums were built upon the philosophy of \u0022Resolve arguments with your words, not downvotes.\u0022 I\u0027ve never really seen starting a thread as *owning* a thread per say, more so like starting a conversation. If you say something ridiculous, then you have to actually defend your position, not click a downvote button. And on the topic of \u0022blacklisting\u0022 certain users, the forums have an ignore function. All posts by that user just basically say \u0022This person posted here, but you ignored him.\u0022 If one user consistently ticks you off, then consider using that.\n\n-my two cents\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T12:52:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Norpo**\n  \nadded something"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T12:49:53Z","Content":"Moderators moderate, not us.\n\nSorry if I offended you."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T13:18:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Moderators moderate, not us.\n\u003E Sorry if I offended you.\n\nThis.

(this could\u0027ve saved the old Zokesia Skunkworks)\n\nAlso, instead of permanently blocking a poster, they could make it so that a post from that user has to be moderator approved before posting.
