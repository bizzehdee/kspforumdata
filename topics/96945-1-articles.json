I can see these but even when Eve is roughly 51 degrees behind me, it doesnt show the negative angle, it just shows as 309 degrees?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve watched videos on YouTube (namely Scott Manley) and they all show a negative angle when behind?

Manley et al are using the convention of phase angle ranging from \u002B180 to -180 degrees, MechJeb is using the convention of it ranging from 0-360 degrees. You might notice that 309 degrees is 360 - 51, so the angles are the same, just being displayed differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-17T15:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Red Iron Crown said, MechJeb works correctly.
