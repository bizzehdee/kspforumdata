Unfortunately, it seems that like the previous \u0027formal\u0027 release and the dev releases, this new version is burning RCS fuel at a alarming rate, as compared to the version updated by sarbian. I set up a docking test where i had two vessels in orbit around Kerbin, 150 meters apart and then saved \u0022F5\u0022 the flight. Then using the new MechJeb release, i went back to the saved state, \u0022F9\u0022 and started the automatic docking run. I repeated this three times and the average rcs fuel usage was 72 units. I then replaced only the mechjeb directory with the version from sarbians updates and loaded the same saved game, and repeated the same test, but average rcs usage is 7 units.???? What do i have set wrong with the new version that is making it use 10 times as much rcs as the other version???\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for any help with this...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordAldrich","CreatedById":75838,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-24T07:43:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey!
