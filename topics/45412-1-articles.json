The rig I built should allow me to reach a depth of 600m, but this was just a test. I know that there are submarine parts one can get through addons, but if you attach to a submarine using a docking port, everything behaves like a part of the sub, which is not what the exercise was about. I really wanted a floating refinery that tanker could dock with and fill up on kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting with one of the orange tanks, I attached two of the small kethan drills, and a series of KAS winches.

I have a series of \u0022water strider\u0022 style transporters for ocean transport, but this thing was slightly wider than most other things I have transported (like a terrestrial kethane mining and refining setup for use on a continent across the ocean). Once in place, it works fine, but setting the rig up is difficult because as the tanks sinks, the center of balance for the entire craft moves. In the end there is a craft that is over 300m in length, making it very hard to click on any desired part. I found the best way to deploy the \u0022drill head\u0022 (the orange tank and the kethane drills) is to extend the winch closest to the surface and work my way down the chain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this was a successful test, there are still aspects that require refinement. Particularly the transport ship. The ship, without cargo, can average 60m/s on water. With a moderate load, 40m/s. This underwater mining setup had it\u0027s weight distributed in such an odd way that the whole craft nearly turtled. A bit more work and I think it should be possible to average speeds of at least 20m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T09:37:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInteresting.

Since the orange tank is attached to things at the surface, you can pump fuel around and change the buoyancy.

The transport of the entire mining rig is proving difficult and might end up requiring a two step process: A ship to deliver the mining rig to the spot in the ocean, and a second ship designed to transfer the liquid fuel and oxidizer into it. Right now, raising a two tank mining rig into one of my transports using winches creates a shifting center of balance. Which is fine on land, but results in near disasters at sea. It also means that top speeds are limited to under 5m/s. One possibility is to make the mining rig more modular.

The plan is to completely fill the tanker and then see how it handles and what it\u0027s maximum speed is in a destructive test. I have left KSP running for 24hrs to allow the tanker to load, which is approximately 6.5 hrs of in game time. I\u0027m assuming the lag is due to the three craft (mining rig, Tippy Canoe, and tanker) all docked together and making a pretty giant craft (remember that the drills are 600m away from the tanker). Anyway, it\u0027s paint drying, so I just let it run. I\u0027d time warp things, but I\u0027m afraid what the full tanker would do when suddenly do when exposed to 1x physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a somewhat related note: do the oceans have currents? I\u0027ve noticed that the ships are drifting over time, and that there is a bow in the 600m long cable as it runs from the surface down to the bottom. I suspect what I\u0027m seeing is an effect of the physics engine sort-of-kind-of changing ship positions in water relative to the rotation of the planet.
