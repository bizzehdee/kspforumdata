Possibly the same for fuel transfers as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I mean is, if you are building a rocket and it\u0027s just over weight for your launchpad you can reduce some fuel in 1 of the tanks. Problem with this is you get unbalanced fuel/oxidizer ratio. Maybe make it so that when you slide the fuel down it will move oxidizer at the same time to match, so if you slide your fuel down and the tank has 89.9% fuel it will also have 89.9% oxidizer. Moving oxidizer should not be linked that way you can still have a tank with less(or no) oxidizer for your spaceplanes with air breathing engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother nice option would be able to type in the fields so you can easily set your engine trust limiter to 50 or 1.5 without having to fumble the slider(or maybe 2 arrow buttons for 100/10 that turn to 1/0.1 steps with fine control capslock/shift pressed)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T22:34:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI heartily endorse the keyboard input idea.
