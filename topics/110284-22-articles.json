It\u0027s one of the things I\u0027m considering to solve the issues caused by uneven terrain. I could see it being compact enough to fit into a Buckboard (like one mega slab per Buckboard MC-1000). Like the Saddle, the big tarmac slab would be made on site from local materials; the stuff in storage just represents the chemicals needed to form the concrete. Unfortunately that\u0027s hard to depict in game; you\u0027ll basically pull out this 10m square slab from a Buckboard and bolt it into the ground. Ideally, the slab(s) would be single use; once you put one down, you can\u0027t pull it back up again and stick it back into storage. I could create an experimental part out of the Saddle and see what people think; it definitely needs nodes on the sides to make it easy to clip together.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pretender6","CreatedById":115798,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-26T14:50:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust noticed, should WBI_Chassis2u maxStorage be 200 not 100 and the WBI_ChassisEndu be 75?
