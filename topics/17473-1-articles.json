I didnt even get into an orbit around kerbin, i just raised my apoapsis to where it intersected it. Then i just disengaged my command module from the rest of the rocket and pulled the parachute when it was time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, Welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Use vectoring engines instead of the other ones, they use less fuel and are better for precision tasks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pebble_garden","CreatedById":30150,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T02:59:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe simplest way I know is to fly back along the Mun\u0027s orbit, the opposite direction. Eventually you\u0027ll pop out of the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence. At that point you\u0027ll be in a big orbit around Kerbin. You\u0027ll be aimed pretty much the right angle to keep retroburning, and as you do so the far end of your Kerbin orbit will drop closer to the planet. Stop burning when your orbit\u0027s periapsis is about 30,000 meters above Kerbin\u0027s surface and you\u0027re set to coast into an aerobraking reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simplemunrockets","CreatedById":22495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-22T03:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a MASSIVE lander.
