I\u0027m currently trying to make two small mods for myself -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA NASA Shuttle style end piece (diagonal part where engines attach)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a diagonal to straigh docking port (for the Endurance mod\u0027s ranger spacecraft.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027m having a lot of issues with diagonal attachment nodes. They don\u0027t want to attach parts at an angle, only straight on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, on my shuttle piece, the attachment node is set at the end and surface attach is allowed. The part where the engines attach is an angled plane, probably around 45 degrees. When I go to attach a part, it ignores the surface (clipping) and wants to attach directly to the node, in a spherical manner. Instead of attaching an an angle, they attach as if the part was a sphere and clip right through the part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas has anybody had luck trying to create a part with a diagonal attachment option?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:19:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee the following on specifying stack attachment node orientation vectors (including for diagonals):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Node_Definitions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation#Node_Definitions\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:34:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can also set up an Empty Game Object (EGO) in your model then called the EGO in your config using the NODE{} system, the node will be oriented in the EGO\u0027s Z\u002B direction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ZVPtex2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ZVPtex2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"-ctn-","CreatedById":130898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:42:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAha!
