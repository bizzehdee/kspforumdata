Yea, that sounds like the internet. \n\nAlso, I do not think it is exactly easy to reach mach speeds in a plane IRL. IIRC it was kinda a big deal when they did it the first time and even today, the planes that can do, only do it quite high in the atmosphere, are quite small compared to 737s and 747s and are super engineered and streamlined to hit those speeds .

I had to build a 12-boosters capsule (literally was a capsule \u002B part to test \u002B 12 boosters), marked as a one star, my capsule was almost exploding\n\nI have a rocket plane for those ones. Originally built for those contracts that require a reading/report ABOVE a certain altitude (I really should have read those contracts more carefully before I accepted), it\u0027s basically a plane with a pair of jet engines flanking a rocket or srb depending on the ridiculousness of the contract... a side note: it happens to also work really well as a low-speed rover due to the broad undercarriage which was originally designed to be really easy to land on rough terrain. If you\u0027re interested, I\u0027ll be posting it in the rocket builder\u0027s forum later in a few days.\n\nAs for the aerodynamics stuff, I think I am in agreement with NathenKell. The C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E for the pods is too low for a blunt body object, and Squad\u0027s response has been to increase drag across the board rather than correct the physics for it. To confirm my hypothesis I decided to accumulate some empirical evidence rather than rely on anecdotal bias.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My experiments centered around the Mk1-2 Command Pod, the idea being to measure differences in apoapsii between different pod orientations, as well as final velocity impacting into the ocean, again with the pods oriented both upwards and pointing straight down.\n\u003E \n\u003E To educate myself a little on the subject, I used this [NASA document](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690020179.pdf) on the Apollo CM as a reference for what I should expect in terms of proper blunt-body physics. Some further research led me to conclude that the Mk1-2 Command Pod with its truncated 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 cone^1^ and 1:4 meplat^2^ should have a C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E of about 0.50-0.65 (significantly less with a nosecone) nose forward, and a C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E of around 1.17 blunt end forward.\n\u003E \n\u003E I opted for a 3 part rocket consisting of the mk 1-2 Command Pod atop a rockomax 2.5m decoupler and a fully fueled Twin Boar booster, and did 5 launches of each orientation (staging the upper stage as soon as the lower stage ran out of fuel to avoid the booster striking the pod on the way down) - my control was the same launch vehicle (2.5m decoupler atop a Twin Boar booster) but with an RC-L01 beneath a X200-8 fuel tank with its oxidizer reduced to 264 to bring the mass of the upper stage to 4.1tons (similar to the 4.12 tons of the Mk1-2 pod). The results revealed the following:\n\u003E \n\u003E control yielded a typical apoapsis of 634,014m (got pizza sauce and black olive on the paper I was recording peak v on so data, um, corrupted)\n\u003E \n\u003E pod oriented pointy end up yielded a typical apoapsis of 848,138m (peak v eyeballed at 2477.5m/s)\n\u003E \n\u003E pod oriented blunt end up yielded a typical apoapsis of 724,825m (peak v eyeballed at 2389.7m/s)\n\u003E \n\u003E So there is an effect, but only a dv difference of less than 100m/s, which is suspect IMHO. \n\u003E \n\u003E Experiments trying to get the pod to re-enter nose down have all failed (the CoM causes the pod to automatically flip), but I noticed that pods that re-enter nose down and flip have a lower velocity when they impact the water (195 base down, 178.4 nose down attempt, the control was 147^3^). This led me to suspect that the greatest amount of drag a pod generates is when it is sideways (this should not be so, as the pod\u0027s sideways C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E should only be about 0.8)... so I built the exact same rocket with the pod sideways to verify.\n\u003E \n\u003E The results were quite revealing.\n\u003E \n\u003E First of all, the amount of drag the pod generates sideways is enough to reduce the Twin Boar\u0027s upwards acceleration from 4g to 2.25g in the transonic regime (300-350m/s) - it could have reduced it more, but the amount of drag was so high that it kept flipping the rocket before I could confirm no matter how much I fiddled with placing the pod to compensate for it! In comparison, pointy end up reduced the transsonic acceleration to 3.25g, the blunt end only as low as 3g, and the control was eyeballed at 2.8-2.9g.\n\u003E \n\u003E A few crude tests with the Mk1 pod resulted in similar behaviour, but I was unable to create a proper experiment due to an unexpected short in the laboratory logistical chain (I ran out of beer ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)).\n\u003E \n\u003E In summary, I tentatively submit that the command pods have a significantly greater drag sideways than they do blunt end forward, and that, as of 1.0.2, the difference between nose-up/nose-down orientation isn\u0027t particularly significant with regards to drag.\n\u003E \n\u003E I encourage others to confirm my results with their own experiments.\n\u003E \n\u003E *1. I have tried to avoid using technical terms where possible for the sake of discussion.*\n\u003E \n\u003E *2.

Apparently the cockpit isn\u0027t as streamlined as it appears.\n\nSo, reading Claw\u0027s post there, it seems the major reason why the air feels so \u0022soupy\u0022 is that pointy shapes (nosecones and such) that OUGHT to cut through the air easily are actually modeled as being much more drag-inducing - and since the majority of drag comes from the front face of the craft, this makes drag seem excessive overall. \n\nMy other comment is that, currently, reentry heating doesn\u0027t do much due to craft slowing down rapidly enough that nothing overheats (I had a craft turn out to be reentry-unstable and flip so that all the parachutes were facing forward, but it made it through the atmosphere just fine). This doesn\u0027t seem right, but there\u0027s more than one way to adjust things so that heat shields are necessary."},{"CreatedByName":"NoPanShabuShabu","CreatedById":91327,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:19:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E well... at what speed an meteor strikes the ground in RL?\n\u003E Now test it in KSP with this new aero...
