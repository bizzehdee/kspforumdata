The C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E for the pods is too low for a blunt body object, and Squad\u0027s response has been to increase drag across the board rather than correct the physics for it. To confirm my hypothesis I decided to accumulate some empirical evidence rather than rely on anecdotal bias.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experiments centered around the Mk1-2 Command Pod, the idea being to measure differences in apoapsii between different pod orientations, as well as final velocity impacting into the ocean, again with the pods oriented both upwards and pointing straight down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo educate myself a little on the subject, I used this \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19690020179.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA document\u003C/a\u003E on the Apollo CM as a reference for what I should expect in terms of proper blunt-body physics. Some further research led me to conclude that the Mk1-2 Command Pod with its truncated 70\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 cone\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E and 1:4 meplat\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E should have a C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E of about 0.50-0.65 (significantly less with a nosecone) nose forward, and a C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E of around 1.17 blunt end forward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI opted for a 3 part rocket consisting of the mk 1-2 Command Pod atop a rockomax 2.5m decoupler and a fully fueled Twin Boar booster, and did 5 launches of each orientation (staging the upper stage as soon as the lower stage ran out of fuel to avoid the booster striking the pod on the way down) - my control was the same launch vehicle (2.5m decoupler atop a Twin Boar booster) but with an RC-L01 beneath a X200-8 fuel tank with its oxidizer reduced to 264 to bring the mass of the upper stage to 4.1tons (similar to the 4.12 tons of the Mk1-2 pod). The results revealed the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Econtrol yielded a typical apoapsis of 634,014m (got pizza sauce and black olive on the paper I was recording peak v on so data, um, corrupted)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epod oriented pointy end up yielded a typical apoapsis of 848,138m (peak v eyeballed at \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E2477.5m/s)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epod oriented blunt end up yielded a typical apoapsis of 724,825m (peak v eyeballed at \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Helvetica;\u0022\u003E2389.7m/s)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there is an effect, but only a dv difference of less than 100m/s, which is suspect IMHO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiments trying to get the pod to re-enter nose down have all failed (the CoM causes the pod to automatically flip), but I noticed that pods that re-enter nose down and flip have a lower velocity when they impact the water (195 base down, 178.4 nose down attempt, the control was 147\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E). This led me to suspect that the greatest amount of drag a pod generates is when it is sideways (this should not be so, as the pod\u0027s sideways C\u003Csub\u003ED\u003C/sub\u003E should only be about 0.8)... so I built the exact same rocket with the pod sideways to verify.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results were quite revealing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the amount of drag the pod generates sideways is enough to reduce the Twin Boar\u0027s upwards acceleration from 4g to 2.25g in the transonic regime (300-350m/s) - it could have reduced it more, but the amount of drag was so high that it kept flipping the rocket before I could confirm no matter how much I fiddled with placing the pod to compensate for it! In comparison, pointy end up reduced the transsonic acceleration to 3.25g, the blunt end only as low as 3g, and the control was eyeballed at 2.8-2.9g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few crude tests with the Mk1 pod resulted in similar behaviour, but I was unable to create a proper experiment due to an unexpected short in the laboratory logistical chain (I ran out of beer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn summary, I tentatively submit that the command pods have a significantly greater drag sideways than they do blunt end forward, and that, as of 1.0.2, the difference between nose-up/nose-down orientation isn\u0027t particularly significant with regards to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI encourage others to confirm my results with their own experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003E1.

The first six groups of three numbers each represent the faces of the drag cube. The numbers are area of the cross section, drag coefficient, and the depth of the face. The third and the fourth faces are the front (1.263023,0.2716523,2.393878) and the rear (1.263023,0.9475985,0.3517535) of the cockpit; the difference in the drag coefficients is only 3.5x. Apparently the cockpit isn\u0027t as streamlined as it appears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, reading Claw\u0027s post there, it seems the major reason why the air feels so \u0022soupy\u0022 is that pointy shapes (nosecones and such) that OUGHT to cut through the air easily are actually modeled as being much more drag-inducing - and since the majority of drag comes from the front face of the craft, this makes drag seem excessive overall. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other comment is that, currently, reentry heating doesn\u0027t do much due to craft slowing down rapidly enough that nothing overheats (I had a craft turn out to be reentry-unstable and flip so that all the parachutes were facing forward, but it made it through the atmosphere just fine). This doesn\u0027t seem right, but there\u0027s more than one way to adjust things so that heat shields are necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoPanShabuShabu","CreatedById":91327,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T21:19:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022luizopiloto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell... at what speed an meteor strikes the ground in RL?\u003Cp\u003ENow test it in KSP with this new aero...
