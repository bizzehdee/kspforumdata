It might be a good idea to make use of the fuel depot in Kerbin\u0027s orbit before sending anything interplanetary. In fact, before we send any modules out, I will probably take Spyrit\u0027s recommendation and set up a small fuel depot in Duna\u0027s orbit. Won\u0027t need much, especially if most people are able to aero-capture well enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to bring up my previous idea for discussion, to have a very basic \u0022mothership\u0022 type design which can bring along several modules to Duna. And I\u0027m talking super basic. To save on mass it could just be a series of girders with a few docking ports and an engine cluster. It would have space for, say, 4 modules? It should save on time, but it might complicate the interplanetary travel side of things. Another option would be to launch a few modules in the same window and then return to them when they get to Duna. It\u0027d be necessary to be very careful with the persistence if we do it this way, since a bit of timewarp and saving at a bad time would be bad news.

Just remember to pack lots of chutes! On that note, if people want to use skycranes, that\u0027s totally cool.

Also, as Nauthy mentioned, a whole lot of chutes would be needed to keep the landing within the common impact tolerance of 6m/s, so i think a skycrane, or at least some detachable parachutes, are almost a must.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CakeNinjaProductions","CreatedById":92225,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T14:29:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, you know what, forget about keeping it a secret.
