First, the different intakes produces differing amounts of air for the jets so, what works for one may not work for another. Second, there is no max altitude as you can leave atmo with just two intakes per engine, and likely do it with only one ram air intake. Third, the only reason to cram excess intakes on a plane, correctly piloted with attention payed to the throttle, is to achieve max altitude and speed in the minimum of time. If you are looking for a plane that can run full throttle at 35,000 meters then you are going to have to cram insane amounts of intakes on the frame. If you simply want a platform that can cruise at around 40,000 meters at 1/4 throttle, then you can get away with just two ram air intakes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest factor in how your jet performs at altitude isn\u0027t the amount of intakes, but how you pilot the craft. The keys are to constantly lower your throttle while making only minute changes to direction and altitude. Changes in direction and altitude lower the amount of air the intakes gather. Chart your course before you reach your desired altitude and drop somewhat below to maneuver. If you do that while constantly lowering your throttle you\u0027ll be able to reach speeds and altitudes you hadn\u0027t thought your plane could achieve. I find it amazing how little throttle is needed at heights above 25k meters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-24T10:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOverfloater, interesting design there for \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ESpace Plane Mk1,\u003C/span\u003E an atomic biplane, with extra steampunkily crossed struts, which somehow seems to suit the Kerbal Space Program.
