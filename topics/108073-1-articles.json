Democracy isn\u0027t giving in to the loudest and most outspoken in the room, although, sadly, modern politics is increasingly about just this thing. This is ultimately what forum discussions are, not a reflection of what the majority think, but what the most outspoken think. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally, and anecdotally (in other words, the weakest form of evidence ;-) ) don\u0027t think there is evidence a majority of the people commenting on the forums are critical of squad in the main, frankly it seems to me (but I only hang around here, not reddit or anywhere else) there is a group of about four or five of the \u0022usual suspects\u0022 who are constantly criticising (constructively, I\u0027d say most of the time, sometimes not though) squad. A passionate, often thoughtful group, but by no means reflective of a majority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if we take it that a majority of the forum commenting community are critical of squads approach, this is still just a fraction of the total KSP playing community....
