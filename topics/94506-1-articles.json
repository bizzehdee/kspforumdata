The B series have deployed about 20-30 probes between them. The C1-E Starchaser singlehandedly built my Geoistationary comms network. The D1-E/D1-C Rockets Built my Main space station. The L2 and L1-H Avenger II and Avenger Heavy lifted the largest payloads, base modules, and landed them on Mun to make My first Munbase. No Rovers really. Except for the drop pod that I sent to Munbase Triton. It was basically a cluster of KAS containers filled with rover parts and two Rover bodies. The crew had to assemble them themselves, which was really fun to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
