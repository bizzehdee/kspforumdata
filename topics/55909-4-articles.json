The plane you saw me fly was designed with enough fuel to circularize orbit around the Mun and return back to KSC. Just building a basic LKO space plane won\u0027t require that. Also keep in mine, radials are much less efficient than Ramjet intakes, so if i were to use those it wouldn\u0027t have as many intakes. The other picture was a cargo SSTO shuttle, which is why it was loaded with intakes in the manner that it was.
