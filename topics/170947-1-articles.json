In order to change settings I have to move my computer to another room and plug into a 1080p tv. Just the restart\u00A0takes 45 minutes when you have that many mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI propose that the Accept and Cancel buttons be fixed in place on the UI rather than dynamically reposition depending on how many mods are installed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause I sure as heck can\u0027t uninstall any of my mods. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
