If so...\n\nTwo things... for some reason, Retina displays freak out when you use textures above 1/4... you should dial that back. Also, make sure you\u0027re running in low res mode. Right click on the KSP application in your KSP\\_osx folder and choose \u0022show info\u0022. Under options, make sure \u0022Open in Low Resolution\u0022 is checked.\n\nI was having this same issue on my brand-spankin\u0027 new macbook, and dialing back the textures to 1/4 or 1/8 solved a lot of problems for me.

It might not show the effect to the same extreme as the Minmus slopes, and I think the flats are just a sphere mesh anyway, not generated at all.\n\nAs for the crash, no idea, not from an OSX crash log anyway, there should be a crash folder containing several files and with the date of the crash in the KSP folder if KSP was able to write one.\n\nIf it is not there then the player.log from immediately after the crash would be needed, but if KSP was re-started it will have been overwritten."}]}
