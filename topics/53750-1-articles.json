I\u0027ve been playing the X games since the get-go so I\u0027m rather interested in this, even if it is a rather big change from the previous ones.\u003Cp\u003EBut anyway, in the X games, you character is usually an Argonian from Argon. And it just so happens that I have the Near Future mod with argon-burning engines. So, in honor of the release, I decided to build a ship with using the biggest VASIMR argon-burner in the mod, which I\u0027d never used before, and see how far I could get with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027d never used the big VASIMR before is because to get full thrust (which is only about 90kN) it requires 10,000 electricity PER SECOND, ISYN! And there is nothing in the mod that remotely comes close to doing that by itself. What it does have is 3 sizes of fission reactors, the biggest of which produces a \u0022measly\u0022 2000 per second, so you need 5 of them, and they weigh 6 tons each. Still, that\u0027s the most power-to-weight of all the power sources in the mod. And in fact it turns you need a bit more juice than 10,000 per second, so I slapped on some of the mid-size reactors as well. And to fuel it, I made a huge asparagus array of the biggest argon tanks. This created a very long monstrosity so I used 4 of the largest size of RCS tanks I could find and also the triple-power RCS thrusters from Nova-Punch to turn the thing. And then I topped all this off with a 1-man capsule \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI all this \u0022The Argonian\u0022.

And I wanted Jeb to fly the new version so there was nothing for it but to HyperEdit back to Kerbin and have Jeb test the capsule recovery system, which worked. Then I terminated the main body of the Argonian and redesigned it. Here\u0027s the new Argonian Mk 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5495/10970892363_9e904f181d_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970892363_9e904f181d_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI removed all the RCS tanks and thrusters and replaced them with 9 more of the 2.5m SAS units (20 torque each). This proved totally sufficient to orient the ship, no doubt helped by having the mass closer to the middle to reduce the moment of inertia. I also replaced the 8 mid-size reactors with 8 small-size reactors, and stuck these on the SAS units as that was the only place for them, to move that weight to the center, too. The result was a savings of about 23 tons, which increased the TWR in very high Kerbin orbit to 0.08 and also upped the delta-V to over 40,000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3743/10970891973_a1209f2ce6_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970891973_a1209f2ce6_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I did a test burn of the big VASIMR to make sure I had enough juice. Yup. It apparently uses more than the listed 10,000 EC/sec because 4 of the small auxiliary reactors didn\u0027t do it, it needed 8 as shown here. That makes for 10,405 EC/sec generated. When I 1st throttle up the engine, the available charge drops by about 200 but then holds steady, apparently because the reactors need to throttle up to match the usage. But anyway, in this configuration, I\u0027ve got unlimited maneuvering and all 82kN of thrust the engine can put out, without worrying about it sucking the ship dry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3828/10970650355_619c8eb27b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970650355_619c8eb27b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, after HyperEditing the thing back into a 40Mm orbit and full tanks, it was off to Duna again. Because this all happened the same day as the initial burn on the real launch window, I had to go around Kerbin again to get the right angle, which at this distance was a 9-day trip. Thus, the window wasn\u0027t as good and the burn needed 1371m/s over 28.5 minutes. Thank goodness for MJ. In fact, this burn was so long that I had to leave it running while I picked up one of my nephews from school. When I came back, however, all was fine, running in 1x some hours before leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2881/10970891803_4f9df7b9fa_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970891803_4f9df7b9fa_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5521/10970891853_93891e1853_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970891853_93891e1853_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a couple of mid- and late-course tweaks to give myself a prograde Pe just above Duna\u0027s atmosphere and did a capture burn into a 40Mm orbit again. I do these huge orbits because they keep the burn times low on captures, and circularizing them and fixing inclination is very cheap. Then, when it\u0027s time to leave, the orbital radius is so huge that I can keep burning the desired direction the whole time instead of having the problem with long burns at low altitude. I think the efficiency balances out to some extent when you consider the whole arrival/departure process instead looking at just 1 or the other. But efficiency isn\u0027t a great concern when you have so much smash in the tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2861/10970742296_f58e68cb33_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970742296_f58e68cb33_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter only a short stay at Duna, a nice Dres window came up so I went there next. This took about an 15-minute burn followed by this 9-minute mid-course correction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2877/10970827684_ccf83b7d73_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970827684_ccf83b7d73_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres has a very small SOI and I knew from the KTC\u0027s small VASIMR probe that it really pays to get the Pe as low as possible so you cut through as much SOI as possible. So I came in for 30km and set up a burn for the biggest elliptical orbit (and shortest burn time) I could get. This worked out to be 20Mm Ap, about 900m/s, and an 18-minute burntime starting WAY out from Dres. And all thise despite the TWR showing as not too shabby near Dres. In fact, as I passed Pe, I decided I\u0027d better get off the node marker and burn pure retrograde if I wanted to stay here. Anyway, it all worked out OK and I got the 20Mm orbit, which I then plane-changed and circularized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/10970649885_2ce3f44362_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970649885_2ce3f44362_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis pic, with the capture burn still going on, shows an interesting thing about argon tanks. Despite being stacked and fuel-lined in a regular asparagus arrangement, all the tanks drain at once like RCS. Thus, if you have any desire to do something like the Argonian yourself, you really need TAC Fuel Balancer. Here, I\u0027m using that to force the tanks to drain in the desired asparagus sequence. The Argonian has 45 tanks in stacks of 5, so the last 10 tanks on the TAC list are those of the 1st pair of asparagus. You might also have noticed in other pics that the side tank stacks have lights of different colors on them. That\u0027s to help me locate the proper tanks to be draining at the time. Anyway, as you can see here, going from Kerbin to Duna to Dres has consumed 3/5 of the 1st set of side tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3755/10970891393_28057c52ef_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002210970891393_28057c52ef_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen it was time to go to Jool. If you look closely at about 8 o\u0027clock to Kerbol and just above the rear edge of the side tanks, you can see Dres out there 20Mm away. The Jool transfer burn (less up-coming mid-course correction) was 740m/s over 14.5 minutes. At this point in the trip (before the transfer burn), the Argonian still had 83% of its fuel and it will still be a while before I drop the 1st set of side tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd this is where I had to stop for the day. Jeb reports no problems with the ship. It\u0027s only me having the problem, having to sit thorugh all these very long burns. But that\u0027s why there\u0027s MJ, TV, books, and visiting nephews. But OTOH, the nephew is a KSPer, too, so wanted to see all this instead of doing something else, so there we sat watching most of the time. But OTOH, I did have to fiddle with TACFB a fair amount during the burns (it kept forgetting how I\u0027d set it before and fuel started going every which way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m starting to get bored with this already \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T14:30:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2880/11049586586_2d5f62d65d_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002211049586586_2d5f62d65d_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, the Argonian has reached Jool.

First a capture burn from a 200km Pe into a huge ellipse with an Ap way out beyond Pol. Then a plane change out near Ap to get rid of most of the inclination I had coming from Dres, followed by raising the Pe out just past Tylo, taking off the rest of the inclination, and finally circularizing.
