Just wanted to check in to see if this is a known issue/if i\u0027m just doing something that\u0027s creating it.  From what i\u0027ve read and searched in the forum though, I have not found a solution.  thanks for any help - great mod!\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Update: I created a new save w/ sandbox mode.  Ampyear worked the first time i entered the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and used the mk 1 capsule with the panel, then upon exiting the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and re-entering and creating another ship, it has not worked again. hope this helps.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E my log file: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/kl2159vppqhadr4/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kl2159vppqhadr4/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E screen shot:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [![8X9RyTt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/8X9RyTt.jpg)](https://i.imgur.com/8X9RyTt.jpg \u0022Enlarge image\u0022)\n\u003E \n\nHi [@JPLRepo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/114736-jplrepo/) - I\u0027ve removed kopernicus, but still seem to have the problem with stock panels:![FUXvqZA.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/FUXvqZA.jpg)\n\nhere\u0027s a copy of my output log, not sure where i\u0027m going wrong here ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif \u0022:(\u0022)  thanks for any help, this mod is great, and completely necessary with RemoteTech.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/kl2159vppqhadr4/output_log.txt?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kl2159vppqhadr4/output_log.txt?dl=0)\n\nupdate:  I deleted Amp year via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, loaded my save, then quit, and reinstalled AMPyear via \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E, loaded my save and the panels work with new ships.  Old ships with panels from before i deleted ampyear and reloaded have the problem, but if i remove their panels and put new ones on it works in amp year.  strange.\n\nfurther update: it appears it may have something to do with dark-side calculations. it does not seem to recognize when i\u0027m not calculating darkside vs when i am calculating darkside.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-10T21:17:20Z\u0022 title=\u002201/10/2018 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bojangles9999**\n  \nupdate after test"},{"CreatedByName":"brooklyn666","CreatedById":88321,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-12T05:53:07Z","Content":"I\u0027m having a problem with ampyear not recognizing power generating parts in realism overhaul, specifically it doesn\u0027t recognized solar panels or RTGs.
