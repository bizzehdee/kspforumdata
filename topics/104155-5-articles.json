Considering I did not use neither the \u0022cheat\u0022 nor the gizmos to make this lander, I say it does not use clipping. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, now that you\u0027ve mentioned, I checked again and have to say that the two bottom ROUND8s (the ones near the main engine) were clipped into each other. Even though I didn\u0027t use the gizmos or the cheaty thingy. (I guess the ROUND8 are just prone to clipping, but I like it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I love this lander and for me is my best design. I can send you the files if you want. Think fast cause next week it may not work anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T13:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Veeltch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Veeltch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI hope some day we get the tweakable for what kind of fuel there is in a tank.
