During flight, I found that the elevators were too small to adequately lift the nose. Pitch control was pretty poor, and if I lowered flaps, it was impossible to pull out of a shallow dive the plane seemed to favor. It did not survive landing, but Jeb survived. As a side note, though it\u0027s hard to tell from the picture, the entire tail deflects, thus the rudder attached to it is quite useless. Test flew it 3 or 4 times....

Much better control over pitch. Unfortunately, it picked up a distinct downward counterclockwise roll. Ailerons were able to compensate for it, but obviously, not something to keep.

Bob set an altitude record for fixed wing, air-breathing aircraft by reaching 31km. However, control had been lost at roughly 21km up. After costing up to the record altitude, the plane remained uncontrolled until it had fallen back to 8000m. Again, test plane did not survive landing, but Bob survived.

I started off my day by timewarping to get to a point where I could raise me PE from being a Kerbin impact, when Kerbal Alarm Clock informed me that my Gily lander had a maneuver that needed to be done. I jump to the Gilly craft and boom craft disappears and the altimeter spins out of control with 9\u0027s and 0\u0027s. I go back to the space center and......black screen, except for the time warp bar at the bottom. Now this is where it gets weird (yeah I thought it was pretty weird already too). I relog into the game and go into the tracking station and look for my Gilly lander, but it is no long in the list of flights nor is there debris of it anywhere around the sun. Reload the quicksave I had just before I jumped to the Gilly lander and all is fine...so far. I make the maneuver for the Gilly lander without issue, so I go back to the asteroid ship to get ready for the maneuver that will happen in a very short amount of time. I get to the maneuver fine enough and even complete it but realize it will not serve what I need so I revert once again, and this is where things go from ok to terribad. Now whenever I time warp the craft explodes, I turn off the RCS, SAS, and even the lights but it still explodes as soon as I start to time warp. I log out and it still explodes, I cuss at it and still it explodes. The command pod seeming disappears as soon as I hit the time warp buttom causing it to all explode, including the asteroid (I thought that was suppose to happen?).

I really didn\u0027t need the crane part but I thought it might be useful for later. Man this thing was a real female dog to land, it had 4 small engines coupled to it for the descent. Even with the boom pointing upwards it was a little unbalanced so I had to alter the thrust on two engines and start slowing down early because anything over half throttle would cause it to spin and pitch beyond my control. I dropped an earlier version of one of these somewhere on the other side of Mun a while back, it\u0027s a bit more stable than anything else I\u0027ve sent up there with wheels. Still will create a spray of debris if you hit one of those \u0027invisible\u0027 ridges going fast enough... Parts include RCS thrusters for artificial downforce and an uphill push from behind if necessary, 8 RTGs because I\u0027m tired of looking at solar panels right now, 4 clampotron Jrs in case I want to carry multiple parts for a distance, a BTDT from SCANSat for anomaly hunting (its primary purpose), some stuff from KAS obviously, and some Infernal Robotics for the crane itself to tilt, raise, rotate, all the things you\u0027d expect a crane to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2014-06-3021-08-03-82.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2014-06-3021-08-03-82.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I also played around with one of the big soccer balls earlier.

In fact it now seems to attack anytime I time warp my asteroid capture craft, let me explain a bit. I started off my day by timewarping to get to a point where I could raise me PE from being a Kerbin impact, when Kerbal Alarm Clock informed me that my Gily lander had a maneuver that needed to be done. I jump to the Gilly craft and boom craft disappears and the altimeter spins out of control with 9\u0027s and 0\u0027s. I go back to the space center and......black screen, except for the time warp bar at the bottom. Now this is where it gets weird (yeah I thought it was pretty weird already too). I relog into the game and go into the tracking station and look for my Gilly lander, but it is no long in the list of flights nor is there debris of it anywhere around the sun. Reload the quicksave I had just before I jumped to the Gilly lander and all is fine...so far. I make the maneuver for the Gilly lander without issue, so I go back to the asteroid ship to get ready for the maneuver that will happen in a very short amount of time. I get to the maneuver fine enough and even complete it but realize it will not serve what I need so I revert once again, and this is where things go from ok to terribad. Now whenever I time warp the craft explodes, I turn off the RCS, SAS, and even the lights but it still explodes as soon as I start to time warp. I log out and it still explodes, I cuss at it and still it explodes. The command pod seeming disappears as soon as I hit the time warp buttom causing it to all explode, including the asteroid (I thought that was suppose to happen?). So needless to say it made for some interesting video today......lucky I managed not to swear, I think, too much. Anyone ever experience anything like this?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorta.... I had a few instances after loading up my save, going to the tracking station and jumping to a ship/station in orbit.... And said ship/station violently disassembles itself--It doesn\u0027t explode, but all the component parts fly away from where the vessel was at high velocity... Jeb died in one of these incidents. Quick loading fixed things... And after a few days, the problem disappeared, and I don\u0027t know why it happened or why it got fixed....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T02:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, open\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0mQk7JEVq4?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E in a new tab\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GnmlChh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GnmlChh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T08:14:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGoing to Minmus on first class\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/hrFGOR5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hrFGOR5.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/hrFGOR5.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever not everybody onboard is as happy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Mo3ETJe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Mo3ETJe.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Mo3ETJe.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeploying the core of an new space station to build at Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/KJmLh6Y\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KJmLh6Y.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/KJmLh6Y.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I know what mod are you using ?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T08:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built a tiny plane and tried to land it at the island runway.
