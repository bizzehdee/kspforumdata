Blacking out? Fairly sure that if you shifted to a 1.2g environment, a healthy person would feel much heavier, but it likely wouldn\u0027t just be like \u00222 days gone by, time up time to pass out\u0022. Anything below 2Gs would probably be manageable to live in, and even perhaps might be beneficial in some applications. Someone for example who lived on a station simulating 1.5Gs for a couple years, moving around and going about their business, then going down to earth and only seeing 1G, might almost feel superhuman in strength. While a person coming from earth might have a lot of trouble adapting to life in a 1.5g. But you know, given a year to build up the strength, then they\u0027d be just like the person coming down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough, it\u0027d be much more effective if the gravity were adjusted over time rather than a sudden jolt change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the note of mars. Well any majorly different gravity would have major changes on development. Someone raised on mars wouldn\u0027t need to be as strong, or have anywhere near the bone density or heart strength. Likely if someone lived there for 10 years and adapted to that environment, they might find that they\u0027re unable to return to earth simply because to them, earth would be ~ \u00223gs\u0022. But hey there hasn\u0027t been much experimentation on that yet. Id say forget messing with Mars and instead go for a moon base to get the first major test data of people living extended lives in a different gravity (besides, on the moon, they\u0027re literally a couple days flight away encase anything happens, and they might have some actual work to do while they\u0027re there). Rotating space station might also be a good way (but much better for testing the higher G situations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly do wonder though. The Human body is amazingly adaptable, and even in my own state, between summer and winter I get vast differences in my own physical fitness level (start of spring, I can probably do a 20 minute mile, and then flop on the ground and be done for the day. Winter bear fat and all that. End of summer, I\u0027ll have often gotten down to a 8min mile, while carrying ~50lbs total of airsoft gear, my shield, and occasionally a forest stormtrooper costume for the lulz, and I\u0027ll have run 3-4 marathons or half marathons. Sometimes I wonder what I could be like if I kept the same activity level through winter, but I tried the gym thing and it really wasn\u0027t for me.) Trained soldiers also baffle me in their endurance and conditioning. Hell people do ultra-marathons. They just run, 50 damn miles... for FUN. Put 1 of them on mars, and watch them go. Don\u0027t even need rovers, they could just run, jump, maybe fire a little compressed gas thruster for a little vertical boost to slow their decent. Cover a football field in 2-3 jumps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would hope to see in my lifetime, a large enough station with a rotating gravity block large enough for people to live for years. Start it off at 1G, and gradually speed it up by .5Gs a year, while studying the people living on it. Could a person survive sustained 1.5-2Gs? Probably, but you\u0027d probably have major back problems. Andre the giant was literally too heavy for his bones and heart to support towards the end of his life. And a 200lb person at 2Gs would basically feel like him.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jesrad","CreatedById":49762,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-25T07:13:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESailplane flying will subject you to 4Gs quite routinely.
