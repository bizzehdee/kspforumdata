Can I recommend NovaPunch? It adds a rather interesting and unique variety of engines, its own command pods, a good number of structural parts, and utility parts like inline chutes and parachute-loaded nosecones. The aesthetics aren\u0027t stockalike, but they mesh decently if you\u0027re careful enough about it. It actually has almost enough variety to serve as a replacement for stock (though not quite enough).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-21T20:13:24Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2015 08:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Whovian**"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T22:58:39Z","Content":"Ok, so I\u0027ve been bellyaching about Lave for at least two days; and it\u0027s probably unfair, because it\u0027s actually beautifully textured and colourful.\n\n![casEiPc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/casEiPc.jpg)\n\nBut I tell you what, it\u0027s also clanging my OCD and I finally worked out why; it\u0027s a freezing cold planet beyond the orbit of Sonnah, and it has an atmosphere, and it doesn\u0027t have ice caps. It looks warm and cozy.

And pumped up the mountains because *mountains*, Gandalf! Turned out there were still loads of spots flat enough to land on.\n\n![W6y40oX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/W6y40oX.jpg)\n\nI never did manage to make oceans though... I had to settle for painting the crater bases a bit paler to suggest ice and frost at the bottom.
