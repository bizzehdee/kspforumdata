Divide that result by 11.76 (9.8, Kerbin\u0027s Gravity, times 1.2, the generally accepted minimum TWR you can have and still expect to get into orbit). The result there is the maximum cap on your rocket\u0027s mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Work the Rocket Equation backwards for the atmospheric Isp of your rocket, setting delta-V to 4500.

Whatever is left is your maximum possible payload for the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPractical example: You\u0027ve got a single stage booster with a KS-25x4 booster which you\u0027re separating from the payload with a TR-18A, with a set of four AV-R8s for additional control during the early part of the flight (for 0.13 tonnes \u0022other\u0022 mass). The mass of the engine is 9.75 tonnes and its ground Isp is 320, and it outputs 3200 kN of thrust:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) 3200 / 11.76 = 272.108 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) delta-V = ln(M/Md) * 9.8 * Isp, 4500 = ln(M/Md) * 9.8 * 320, M/Md = e^((4500/9.8)/320) = 4.1994, M/4.1994 = Md, Md = 64.796 tonnes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) 64.796 - 9.75 - 0.13 = 54.917 tonnes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the maximum payload for that particular booster is 54.917 tonnes. I can work through another example if you\u0027d like, or you could wait for more help from Pecan.

You have a 207 tonnes tonne difference between the maximum mass and the dry mass, so that\u0027s 207 tonnes of fuel needed. That\u0027d correlate to six Jumbo-64s and an X200-32 worth (roughly), which have a dry mass of 26 tonnes when combined. Subtract that from the calculated dry mass there (54.917 tonnes), and it comes down to 28.917 tonnes. So that\u0027d be the payload mass for the booster (and no, the situation is NOT improved with the bigger fuel tanks, but rather the opposite; the new extra large tanks have an inferior mass-to-dry mass ratio as compared to the traditional tanks in the game).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-16T21:20:29Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2014 09:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nine_iron","CreatedById":37971,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T21:11:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESub Rocket_Launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Rocket = Explode Then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoarBoosters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELoop\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElse \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd Do\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd If\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnd Sub\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBegin Fun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpot the error?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-16T21:17:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2014 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nine_iron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bilfr3d","CreatedById":75448,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-16T21:45:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if anybody realised this, but this is in the tutorials section...
