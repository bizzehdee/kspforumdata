Here\u0027s what\u0027s happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0x6opLz.png\u0022 alt=\u00220x6opLz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently trying to reach Ike with my ship. According to Transfer Window Planner I should start my transfer at Year 12, Day 75. I don\u0027t want to wait so long with kame stock time warping, so I use Better Time Warp mod and use Hyper Warp option which allows me accelerating up to 10 000 000 times. Now, if I choose acceleration of more than 300 000x and wait for enough time, things will start happening. The ship will be torn apart, things will start exploding randomly for no reason at all, you won\u0027t be able to time accelerate any more as it says you are over the terrain despite being 22700 km away from Kerbin, flight log will say some of your parts hit launch pad or things currently on it, surviving parts will be thrown away from your current object (or you get free acceleration, it\u0027s hard to say), map view won\u0027t show orbits of debris of the ship at all, you\u0027ll get wobbling and other stuff. What\u0027s even more interesting is that reloading last quicksave with the same ship will lead to the same result without any time warping even before last \u0022buggening out\u0022. It will be so until you reload your game or launch another ship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ek13RYj.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ek13RYj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter random delay random parts will be shot away or explode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/oX0zHFI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022oX0zHFI.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a picture of shot parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J85yXtF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J85yXtF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also says all of them are on Launch Pad now which is clearly not true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have a bunch of mods, but most of them are helper mods:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBetter Time Warp (I don\u0027t know if the same thing will happen without it, I either need to skip a lot of time with any setting or have high setting.
