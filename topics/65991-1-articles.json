This effectively creates a version epoch for those mods. You could probably construct a versioning scheme that\u0027s loose enough to cover most or all existing cases, but it\u0027s then doubtful that you gain anything through standardization. In any case, this is a complicated task that should not be taken lightly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe version of KSP that the mod was developed to work with.\u003C/strong\u003E This is fairly easy to specify (although you could get into an argument over whether to specify with major/minor/revision versions or build numbers). However, I have to wonder what it would be used for. Are you suggesting that something like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65395-Voluntarily-Locking-Plugins-to-a-Particular-KSP-Version\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECompatibilityChecker\u003C/a\u003E become stock? I\u0027ve written before on why a single version cannot accurately capture compatibility details for a mod, so I see only limited utility for mod managers and the like.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe date the mod version was released.\u003C/strong\u003E Okay, this one\u0027s hard to punch holes in.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...but there are some more problems that apply to all three. In Kethane and KAS, I already include all of the above metadata. The current version is defined in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assemblyinformationalversionattribute%28v=vs.90%29.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAssemblyInformationalVersion\u003C/a\u003E attribute, the compatible KSP version is defined in CompatibilityChecker, and the release date is automatically part of the plugin\u0027s metadata. If KSP requires me to package a metadata file, I now have to update all of that information in two places. This may surprise you, but packaging a Kethane release can often take a full hour, and it\u0027s easy to forget steps. Adding duplicate metadata into the mix is just a recipe for errors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERather than putting forth an idea and then insisting it\u0027s reasonable, I suggest you try to uncover exactly why modders are resistant to it. Then, you can produce a proposal that\u0027s more likely to be accepted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T21:44:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Oddible\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Oddible\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuys guys guys, you have taken a very simple proposed idea, trivial for everyone to implement, and turned it into some kind of monster. What I am proposing is that KSP require that all mods contain one additional text file in their distributions that contains 3 trivial pieces of information:\u003Cp\u003E1) The version of the mod in a standardized format\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The version of KSP that the mod was developed to work with\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The date the mod version was released\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all! Very minimal, literally anyone with zero technical training could do it for you. But it would drastically improve indexing of mods and allow mod update utils for end-users. I\u0027m proposing that Squad FORCE mods to have this file in order to function properly - not sure why everyone is getting bent over being forced to add a trivial indexing file - Squad \u0027forces\u0027 you to do all sorts of things to make your mods work - like using correct spelling and capitalization of intrinsics (!?!?!?). I think that folks must be misunderstanding what the original proposal was because this is pretty minimal stuff here guys and in no way deserving of the outrage that seems to be present here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethese three things should all be in a mod\u0027s readme file anyway. its not my fault if users dont read it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"6.forty","CreatedById":97939,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T22:16:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis type of info is already used and required by a large number of moddable games in some form, either by third party mod loader/manager or the game itself.
