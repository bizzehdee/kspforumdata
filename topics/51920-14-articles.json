Anyone who has found themselves on the wrong side of the political power will soon find themselves in such a prison. The Prisoners are forced to perform hard and dangerous slave labor with no possibility of release. However in Hwasong Political Prison, there is a gang famous even outside the fences and mine fields surrounding the camp. The Salamdeul Kkangpae were practically untouchable. The gang started as a close knit group of villagers in a small town in Samjiyon-gun. As the gang grew they stuck to their roots. All the members knew the others surname and given name. After growing in power, they attempted an unsuccessful coup to bring democracy to the troubled peninsula. Even though only a handful of the gang members participated in the coup. As an act of loyalty all members surrendered themselves to the state police as a form of political protest. Despite Pyongyang\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s attempts to control any information about the gang, somehow information makes its way to the masses. They are the Robin Hoods\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 of North Korea. Their popularity even rivals the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. This left the ruling class with a problem. If they killed the gang members, news would break out and a mass revolt would occur, potentially bringing forth the very coup Salamdeul had hoped for. On the other hand they couldn\u0027t simply leave them be. They needed to be made an example of. They needed to break Salamdeul. The only method of coercion possible in this situation was The Tower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Tower was feared by all, even the Salamdeul. The Tower itself was not an instrument of death. This is what made it feared. When prisoners left The Tower, they were no longer like themselves. It was as if something inside The Tower took away what made them who they were, leaving a shell of a person. This is why The Tower was so feared.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately for the warden of the camp, only one prisoner can go into the Tower at a time.
