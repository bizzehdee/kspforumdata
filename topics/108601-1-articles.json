This will then expose any asymmetry in the craft. It\u0060s hard to tell for sure, but it looks to me like some of your struts might twist the lower part of the ship during launch. If you\u0060re too fast then the twisting will strain the joints further up and the entire thing will take on a life of its own. The closest I\u0060ve come to this was when I once used 16 boosters to get something heavy up and it just shot right up to 10k without even responding when I tried keeling over toward my orbit. Then when I tried doing it higher the bottom of my ship looked like someone swinging a club in a giant circle and then the top came off and I crashed. All I did to fix that was to sequence the boosters in two sets of eight and fire the last eight when I dumped the first ones. And then the ascent went perfectly because half my booster thrust went off above 10k where there\u0060s less resistance so you keep more of your speed. In general there shouldn\u0060t bee any thermal effects when you\u0060re going up. Even though you lose speed to that as well, sonic effects are fine. if you don\u0060t get those you\u0060re too slow. But if there are thermal effects you\u0060re going too fast and much of that speed is eaten away by air resistance. It would be more efficient to cut boosters really. If there are thermals you should moderate the thrust of your launch stage asap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, what I meant to say was that it\u0060s definitely just a small thing somewhere. Try lowering the thrust of the bottom first and see how that works. And if it\u0060s not that, try going over your struts carefully. It matters whether it\u0060s placed centrally on a fuel tank or on the sides. If it\u0060s attached to the sides it will cause some twisting. A little twisting or a lot of it at slow speed isn\u0060t a problem.
