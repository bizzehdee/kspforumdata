I had to add the below snippet to \u0022config.cson\u0022 under the section \u0022core:\u0022 and it works a treat. (Incidently, I also recommend using the Snippets feature).

I even have a plugin that synchronizes my settings so I can have the same plugins on different machines. ;-) As well, I do most of my developing in JavaScript these days, and there\u0027s very good support for that.
