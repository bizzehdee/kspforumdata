But the 2t rapier will still be needed for the kerbin assent as nothing else comes close to the efficiency of that.

(Putting chairs in a 2.5 meter service compartment and adding a heat shield and parachutes. I accidentally posted this on someone\u0027s submission also, sorry.\n\nYes, chairs are acceptable for Kerbin entry.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just a querry, about how much delta-v would a mothership need to traverse from kerbin to jool, through all of the moons, then back to kerbin?\n\u003E EDIT: Is 6500 dv enough?\n\nIf you park your mothership in orbit of Jool or a moon and send out smaller craft from there, it needs only about 3500. If you want to stop at all of the moons at a low orbit, maybe 7-8000 or more if you\u0027re not a great pilot? You can save on fuel by not sending the whole ship to the small moons, just going with your lander or using an orbital tug. You can also save dV with gravity assists if you know how to use them.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I wonder if you could save mass on the Jool trip by not taking a command pod with you. If it\u0027s only needed for Kerbin reentry, then maybe you could leave it behind in LKO and rendezvous later.\n\nIf it were not in the rules \u0022no seats for interplanetary transfers\u0022, I have no doubt that people would not take a pod at all for the low mass challenge. You don\u0027t actually need the pod for Kerbin reentry."},{"CreatedByName":"Mesklin","CreatedById":73898,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T20:19:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E When decouplong the first stage tanks the stupid game gives focus to the detached tanks, not the lander. I solved this by having an action group for decoupling on \u00220\u0022 with is close to the key to change active craft (\u0022\u00C3\u0192\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u0022 key on my keyboard)\n\nFor eliminating this situation probe on lander should be a root part, in this case game switch to second stage correctly after detach empty tanks.

I had sent a Tug and trailer type ship configuration too Jool, with the intention of visiting every moon and returning too kerbin. The mission had its little problems but in the end I was able to visit all the moons of Jool, Eeloo, Dres, and Duna before returning home. The whole mission was run in sandbox mode though.\n\nMission log and screenshots of the mission:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/135614-Jakalth-finally-works-on-a-functional-Jool-mission](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/135614-Jakalth-finally-works-on-a-functional-Jool-mission)\n\nThe final verdict of the mission is as follows:\n\nTotal mission success: 93%\n\nCompletion of Jool 5 contest: Failed...\n\nReason for Failure: Unable to return 2 kerbins due to failure of the Laythe plane design.\n\nTotal cost: 2,564,508 Kredits at launch\n\nTotal number of Kerbins brought along: 19\n\nNumber of parts left behind: 1 fuel module(expendable at Kerbin), 1 minitug module(expendable in Jool and Laythe orbits), 1 Tylo lander(disposed of properly), 2 laythe planes with crew(unacceptable, but crew is recoverable)\n\nTotal number of refuels: 9, using Lamp Post drive section(tug) to refuel its self and the modules\n\nTotal science collected: 0(was playing in sandbox) but all craft had at least 5 different science collecting gadgets and the crews went eva on each landing. for something to due while I waited for mining to finish.\n\nTotal time spent in space: 18 years, 238 days(around 4 weeks IRL, covering a massive 85 hours)\n\n:Edit: Forgot to add... Only mod used was Kerbal Engineer Redux. Part wise, it\u0027s 100% stock.\n\nLevel of contest this qualifies for: IRSU level\n\nI had to fight very low initial frame rates, several poorly judged maneuver burns, and a game/save that had become corrupted to the point of being unplayable(the corruption was my fault, not cleaning up the game since 0.24). But I made it back, and the Lamp post it\u0027s self survived the whole trip.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-28T01:32:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/28/2015 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jakalth**"}]}
