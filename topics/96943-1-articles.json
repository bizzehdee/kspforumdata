I took a semi-long hiatus from KSP, not for any other reason than to pursue a few other interests and games for a bit, but I\u0027ve kept following the forums and the progress. When the beta hit, I fired her up again and started goofing around with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t fly planes very well, and I\u0027ve only made one successful SSTO craft (maybe two) in earlier versions of the game (.20? I think). I\u0027ve been making some private videos for my son, who likes watching me fly but doesn\u0027t want to sit at the computer with me. The other night, I made a plane, intending only to show him the sights. It just had one jet engine and some RCS thrusters I always add just in case the plane isn\u0027t very maneuverable. But while flying, I noticed my speeds were approaching within the realm of orbital velocities, so I made a couple of adjustments and decided to see if I could make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis video is the result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/nN7u1nkakxI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(~39m video sped up to 9.5m)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was actually surprised it worked, and I could probably have done it with a lot less RCS fuel, and still made it back to KSP.
