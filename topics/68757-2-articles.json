I hardly ever see rockets that feature heavy clipping; if they have it at all, it\u0027s really minor. On the other hand, I rarely ever see spaceplanes that are not clipped. If I limit the selection to \u0022spaceplanes that fly well\u0022, the already small number of non-clipped craft drops off sharply again. It seems that the current system of building planes does not satisfy users at all, and basically demands the use of part clipping (in the eyes of those players). And it\u0027s understandable: whenever I build planes (which is not often, but still), I always struggle with properly attaching parts to each other in a way that I never do when building rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for my personal view of the subject, I consider it somewhat cheaty because space does matter. If I have a rocket with a 2.5m diameter, then six 1.25m diameter engines \u003Cem\u003Esimply do not fit\u003C/em\u003E. Period. KSP is meant to be a physics simulator, and in my opinion, ignoring an object\u0027s spatial dimensions leads the whole point ad absurdum. If the craft has only room for one engine, it only gets one engine, not two clipped right on top of each other. Everything else is deliberately breaking the laws of physics; you might as well hack gravity so that your craft flies with only one engine. Both means have the same end result, and both means are equally cheats. This counts double if you gain additional benefits on top of having two engines, such as being able to combine a high-Isp rocket engine with an air-breathing turbojet. You\u0027re effectively bypassing the challenge in fuel management and in construction that the game sets you. If you want both of these legitly, you would have to build your plane in such a way that it has room for these engines without causing asymmetric thrust, making the task more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I acknowledge that KSP is also a sandbox, and that people should be allowed to play with the toys they are given the way they want, and set their own challenges. While part clipping is a cheat from the perspective of the stock gameplay goals, those don\u0027t have to be the only goals. Some people like to define their own goals, such as \u0022my craft all have to look like something that exists IRL\u0022. And in the face of that goal, part clipping is not a cheat, but rather an enabler. It lets you get around an obvious limitation in the game engine (properly attaching two parts to one another) and pull off designs that without the clipping feature wouldn\u0027t be possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, while I personally refuse to use part clipping, I\u0027m not in any way against its existence in the game. If people find it a useful tool to set themselves new goals, that\u0027s a perfectly valid reason for it to exist in the framework of a sandbox.
