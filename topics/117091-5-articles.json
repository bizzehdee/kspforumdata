(IE no rotors clipping into other rotors)\n\nBut still, even with the extra weight of structure the 2x Aerosports have a very BIG energy advantage. They max out their thrust (which is ~40 kNt btw) at mach .1. This is the speed where the turning, banking dog fights happen. \n\nO my cheaty set up I was able to pull 5G sustained turns (no loss in airspeed, no loss is altitude) with the 2x aerosports.
