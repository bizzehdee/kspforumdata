It\u0027s going to be much more expensive (in energy and dollars) to get the energy to Earth orbit from anywhere other than Earth\u0027s surface, it\u0027s just that simple. Then, when you get to the surface of Mars, you need the energy on the surface of Mars to get back to Earth. Here you have the same exact situation as on Earth; it\u0027s going to be much more expensive (meaning wasteful) to get the energy from anywhere but the surface of Mars. You\u0027re just adding unnecessary cost and risk - more steps in a chain of things that have to go off perfectly in order for you to succeed.

Think of a mission to and from Mars in simple steps. Each stop costs money and adds risk, which makes the mission more expensive and less likely to succeed. Here\u0027s the way I\u0027m proposing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer burn to Mars -\u0026gt; Descent to Mars -\u0026gt; Mars ISRU -\u0026gt; Ascent from Mars -\u0026gt; Transfer to Earth. A grand total of 5 steps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is your scenario (or some version of it):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer burn to Mars -\u0026gt; Fuel transfer from Phobos to Mars orbit -\u0026gt; Refuel in space -\u0026gt; Descent to Mars -\u0026gt; Ascent from Mars -\u0026gt; Fuel transfer from Phobos to Mars orbit -\u0026gt; Refuel in space -\u0026gt; Transfer to Earth. A total of 8 steps. You have added three steps, and now you have to answer the following questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you get in your version that you cannot get from my version? I\u0027ll give you the correct answer: Nothing, and it costs more money and adds more overall mission risk. I have grossly simplified the mission, too. There are so many more steps than 5 in my version, and thus many, many more steps than 8 in your version. Your version would add up risk after risk after risk, dollar on top of dollar. What if some piece of the ISRU and prop production and depot hardware fails, and you have to replace it, where is that going to come from? Who is going to repair it, and where are they or it going to come from? More money, more risk. I could go on and on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this help make it clear why there is absolutely no need for off-world ISRU and propellant production and storage? I haven\u0027t even mentioned any number of details, like the fact that we haven\u0027t yet refined a single gram of fuel from space, but there are already technologically ready and tested Martian surface ISRU and propellant production prototypes.

By extension, I think this demonstrates that for similar reasons, Luna becomes a viable step in the roadmap to solar system infrastructure development. Ultimately, equipment and products manufactured on the Moon and destined for another planet will be cheaper to get into orbit (as opposed to those made on Earth, when a dV budget comes into play). Forays into the colonization of either Mars or Venus (or elsewhere) would ultimately benefit from the integration of a Lunar presence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T00:59:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shynung\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shynung\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf you haven\u0027t noticed, the first stage of that Proton burst into flames seconds after the fairing broke off.

Robotic exploration is great for places humans can\u0027t go, but they\u0027re limited. There\u0027s a third option, teleoperated robots from orbit, but that\u0027s still very expensive - you have to send the robots and the humans, and even if the humans aren\u0027t going on the surface of Mars (for example), they still have to go almost the entire way and back, and they still don\u0027t get as efficient as human autonomy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, they can\u0027t. In order to pull one member of the public (like me) for a space mission, that individual has to be trained intensively, especially if they don\u0027t know anything else beforehand. Astronauts who go to the ISS, for example, are usually scientists or engineers. Harder missions like Mars or Venus explorations require good piloting skills. Since most members of the public (including me) usually haven\u0027t much of these skills, they\u0027d have a lot to study in order to catch up with a typical ISS astronaut. That alone costs a lot already.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManned missions are more time-efficient than robotic missions, in the sense that a human can get things done faster than a robot. However, they are not very cost-efficient. Manned missions require plenty of life-support supplies just to do anything (or even just to survive), while robots don\u0027t need much other than a few command signals. Also, robotic missions aren\u0027t necessarily unable to distinguish interesting objects the way a human eye can; the output their cameras are ultimately seen by scientists (on Earth) anyway, which decides what to do next. It\u0027s slow, but not necessarily limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AngelLestat\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ecome on shynung, we already talk about this.
