However, now it\u0027s also significant to minimize the transition between attached parts. In other words: since RAPIERs are 1.25m, the small nosecones are not the best choice anymore, since that attaches a 0.625m to a 1.25m part. The Aerodynamic Nose Cone or Advanced Nose Cone do a better job on a 1.25m node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip: call up the debug console (Alt-F12 on PC/Win), and under Physics/Aero, enable the two first options to get some insight on design vs aerodynamics. The KSP aero model can sometimes still be pretty counter-intuitive, so it helps to see \u0027live\u0027 how things play out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223438966\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022177790\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221535062962\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002284817\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022I_Killed_Jeb\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, I_Killed_Jeb said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) It seems that locking suspensions is no longer a thing, which is sort of problematic for my bases (that rely on fixed height).

There\u0027s been a few upgrades to the game engine (Unity), which at one point completely borked the wheels/gear system. They were forced to change over to a new system, which has never quite got back to the level or stability the old wheels/gear had. One of a number of things lost in that transition was the option to lock suspensions - it no longer exists, and there doesn\u0027t seem to be any outlook on getting it back again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn return, the system we have now sometimes decides to ignore friction, or creates phantom self-amplifying forces and bouncing, and generally likes to explode a whole lot more than it used to.

Resource extraction has been made a bit more complicated and overall seems to result in less ore than in 1.0.5: you now need to keep in mind the optimal core temp of drills and converter, which requires radiators appropriate to the gear. Also, the small drill and converter have been nerfed so they basically never operate at optimum anymore - they overheat regardless of the amount of radiators you install.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I_Killed_Jeb","CreatedById":84817,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-24T03:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone for your time!
