If your satellite wobbles a little bit around a fixed spot in Kerbin\u0027s sky, that\u0027s good enough because you\u0027ll still never lose touch with the tracking station. It\u0027s like how Ike wanders around a small patch of Duna\u0027s sky but never leaves that area. So at the bottom line, all that matters is orbital period, which is what keeps your satellite from drifting below KSC\u0027s horizon over time. Put your satellite as close to KSC\u0027s zenith as you can, at approximately the right altitude and approximately 0 inclination, but don\u0027t sweat it if you don\u0027t get any of that exactly right. Then open some window that will show your orbital period and use RCS to tweak that until it\u0027s exactly 6 hours.
