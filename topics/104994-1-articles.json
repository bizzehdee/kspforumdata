I have got myself a new game idea, involving a never-ending space race in the kerbal world!\n\n Here are the KEY rules:\n\n1. NO WIPING OUT ANY KERBAL COUNTRY (ANYTHING. NUKES, KEBOLA, YOU NAME IT).\n\n2. NO GRIEFING OR FACE CONSEQUENCES (KICKING OUT OF THE GAME).\n\n3. NO TROLLING\n\n4.DEBUG PANEL NOT ALLOWED\n\n5 STOCK ONLY, NO MODS ALLOWED (mods that don\u0027t change gameplay is ok, e.g. alarm clock etc)\n\nok after securing the continuity factor we can get on with game rules.\n\n**FACTIONS and COMAPNIES**\n\n1.there are 2 factions that one must choose from. The USKR (Union of Soviet Kerbalist Republics) or the USK (United states of Kerbals). nobody can be neutral. (I take no faction myself to be fair)\n\n2. Everyone must represent a company (or a member of a company) in these factions. provide me with company details (Name of company, faction, members). No offensive or discriminating names will be allowed. (PM me the company details and i will post accordingly on this thread)\n\n3. Everybody in the same company will share 1 CAREER save file on hard difficulty. You may start separate comapny threads to discuss what to do. Each company must act as a whole.\n\n**MISSIONS**\n\n1.Each company can carry out mission once every 12 hours (By carrying out missions i mean posting them on here). ONLY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY (aka the founder/leader/whatever you call the guy who commands) CAN POST MISSIONS.\n\n2.Each mission must be realistic to the timeline of the real space race (OK, failures can be omitted of you don\u0027t think it is necessary) so NO ONE-TIME launches to all systems. BEFORE YOU UNLOCK THE NASA ARM PARTS YOU CANNOT GO FOR A MOONSHOT.\n\n3. EACH MISSION MUST HAVE PHOTOS AS PROOF (Post here, imgur photos preferred). Proof include photos of each stage of mission (Take the example of vostok 1, stages include liftoff, orbit burn, achieving orbit, de-orbit and landing) \n\n**TO WIN (just have to meet one of them)**\n\n1.Achieve a total of 1 million science in faction (at one time, not historic total so spent science does not count)\n\n2.Achieve a total of 5 million funds in faction (at one time, not historic total so spent funds does not count)\n\n3. Landing at least 1 kerbal on each planet (except jool and the sun) and returning them safely after they have all landed\n\n4. Finishing a colony on duna that holds 24 kerbals (no need for them to return), after landing a kerbal on the moon, returning him safely to kerbin and maxing out the tech tree.\n\n5. getting ten thousand points from getting achievements, listed below. Each achievement can only be completed once (not once per faction). \n\n**Achievements**\n\n(achievement credits to the ksp wiki)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Solid Fuel Rocketry (10pt)\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch RT-10 Solid Fuel Booster Rocket\n\u003E \n\u003E Must be unmanned\n\u003E \n\u003E Must have nosecone\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch Two-Stage Solid Fuel Rocket\n\u003E \n\u003E Must be unmanned\n\u003E \n\u003E Must be successfully retrieved (i.e., have a parachute)\n\u003E \n\u003E (Tip: To retrieve a craft, move the cursor to the center of the top of the screen. This can only be done after landing or splashing down.)\n\u003E \n\u003E Liquid Fuel Rocketry (10pt)\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch LVT-30 Liquid Fuel Rocket Eastwards\n\u003E \n\u003E Must be unmanned\n\u003E \n\u003E Must have nosecone or parachute\n\u003E \n\u003E Land that thing in the ocean lest you worry the \u0027Kerbiets\u0027\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch Two-Stage LV-T30 Liquid Fuel Rocket and Maintain 45 degrees Eastwards after 10,000 m and Reach Space (70 km)\n\u003E \n\u003E Must be unmanned\n\u003E \n\u003E Must have nosecone or parachute\n\u003E \n\u003E Enjoy the music once you reach 70,000 m\n\u003E \n\u003E (Note: You do not need to establish an orbit - save that challenge for the Space Race campaign)\n\u003E \n\u003E K2 Rocket (10pt)\n\u003E \n\u003E Those pesky Kermans...\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch LV-T30 Liquid Fuel Rocket and control its reentry point\n\u003E \n\u003E Missile must go above 70 km\n\u003E \n\u003E Missile must land near a pre-selected island of your choosing\n\u003E \n\u003E (Tip: The blue line indicating your trajectory does not account for atmospheric drag, so aim accordingly!)\n\u003E \n\u003E the First Satellite (20pt)\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch a Two-Stage Liquid Fuel Rocket into Orbit with a Satellite or Stayputnik 1\n\u003E \n\u003E The Kerbnik probe in the Lander and Probe Pack on CurseForge is an accurate reproduction of the real Sputnik.\n\u003E \n\u003E Must contain at least 4 Communotron 16 antennas.\n\u003E \n\u003E Antennas must deploy after reaching orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E Must contain enough electric charge (batteries!) to broadcast for a full orbit.\n\u003E \n\u003E (Tip: as your launches become more complex, it\u0027s usually a good idea to test them out to make sure your staging is set correctly.)\n\u003E \n\u003E (Tip: try establishing an action group to extend the antennas.)\n\u003E \n\u003E  the First Kerbal in Space (40pt)\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch a Kerbal into an Orbital Flight with an Apoapsis greater than 70,000m and Safe Return\n\u003E \n\u003E For added realism, the Home-Grown Rockets mod on CurseForge has stockalike Soyuz parts that can easily be used to represent a Vostok craft.\n\u003E \n\u003E Kerbal must return safely. This is assumed for all future missions unless otherwise specified - you don\u0027t want to scare off volunteers, especially this early in the space program.\n\u003E \n\u003E Must land on land (that\u0027s how Vostok 1 landed in real life).\n\u003E \n\u003E the First Kerbal to go \u0027round the World (60pt)\n\u003E \n\u003E Launch a Kerbal into an Orbital Flight with a Periapsis greater than 70,000m and Safe Return\n\u003E \n\u003E The FASA mod on CurseForge has accurate Mercury, Redstone, and Atlas parts.\n\u003E \n\u003E Must complete 11 orbits.\n\u003E \n\u003E Must land in water (Bonus points if it is near the Kerbal Space Center).\n\u003E \n\u003E Feel free to go through the rest of the Moho program. This includes one more Redstone flight, and four Atlas flights.\n\u003E \n\u003E (Will post more achievements later)\n\nCOMPANIES LIST\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-26T02:04:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/26/2015 02:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Goodle...**"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T02:36:42Z","Content":"Unfortunately, this kind of game, in which players take on the roles of competing countries, has resulted in some of the worst arguments this forum has ever seen, and so we\u0027ve had to make a rule against it ([2.2.j](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30064-Community-Rules-October-27th-2013)).
