I have got myself a new game idea, involving a never-ending space race in the kerbal world!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Here are the KEY rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. NO WIPING OUT ANY KERBAL COUNTRY (ANYTHING. NUKES, KEBOLA, YOU NAME IT).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. NO GRIEFING OR FACE CONSEQUENCES (KICKING OUT OF THE GAME).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.

The USKR (Union of Soviet Kerbalist Republics) or the USK (United states of Kerbals). nobody can be neutral. (I take no faction myself to be fair)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Everyone must represent a company (or a member of a company) in these factions. provide me with company details (Name of company, faction, members). No offensive or discriminating names will be allowed. (PM me the company details and i will post accordingly on this thread)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Everybody in the same company will share 1 CAREER save file on hard difficulty. You may start separate comapny threads to discuss what to do. Each company must act as a whole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMISSIONS\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.Each company can carry out mission once every 12 hours (By carrying out missions i mean posting them on here). ONLY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY (aka the founder/leader/whatever you call the guy who commands) CAN POST MISSIONS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Each mission must be realistic to the timeline of the real space race (OK, failures can be omitted of you don\u0027t think it is necessary) so NO ONE-TIME launches to all systems. BEFORE YOU UNLOCK THE NASA ARM PARTS YOU CANNOT GO FOR A MOONSHOT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. EACH MISSION MUST HAVE PHOTOS AS PROOF (Post here, imgur photos preferred). Proof include photos of each stage of mission (Take the example of vostok 1, stages include liftoff, orbit burn, achieving orbit, de-orbit and landing) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETO WIN (just have to meet one of them)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.Achieve a total of 1 million science in faction (at one time, not historic total so spent science does not count)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.Achieve a total of 5 million funds in faction (at one time, not historic total so spent funds does not count)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
