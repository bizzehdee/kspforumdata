Anyhoot, after some googling and forum reading Im sure ...... well 90% sure I found a mod which lowered my RAM usage by almost half \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E I was so happy, I should mention I already have \u0027ATM X86 Aggressive\u0027 (Active Texture Management) which I was also using last time as well as this other mod or program (it could have been a program that ran in the background I guess).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway I hope someone out there know what I am talking about or maybe someone just happens to know of a mod that does the same thing whether its what i used before or not.
