Gotta love ModuleManager\u0027s consistency.)\n\nEdit for 2020 - not tested for 1.10 yet. Not that anyone\u0027s looking at this, but I\u0027m spinning up my mods to play 1.10 - I\u0027ll update with a post once I\u0027ve done so, and it\u0027ll *probably* work fine because again - ModuleManager patches.\n\nDownload at bottom of \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\n* * *\n\nI was looking at how my science program was running, and noticed that there were some... inconsistencies. I could get full science from one type of data, but only 50% from transmitting another (far simpler) type of data. Similarly, certain types of science that don\u0027t seem like it\u0027d be practical to automatically analyze were returning entirely too much with transmission, and others seemed like they could be transmitting more useful data based on their descriptions.\n\nBased on all this, I decided to hack together some ModuleManager configs to bring some common sense consistency to transmitting science... at least as far as I\u0027m concerned. I debated whether to even post this - we\u0027ll see how many people find it useful.\n\nNote that this *decreases* the return on all of the \u0022full transmit\u0022 science parts along with increasing the return on some of the others. My goal with this set of tweaks is to bring consistency, not necessarily \u0022balance\u0022 of any sort.\n\n* * *\n\n**Required Mods:**\n\n[Module Manager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219) - if you have mods, you *probably* already have this. Fortunately, new versions typically disable old versions - it seldom hurts to grab the most recent one.\n\n**Supported Mods:**\n\nNeedless to say, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patches don\u0027t do a whole lot if you don\u0027t have the base mod it patches.

The missing 5% represents anything that a clever scientist might be able to pick out from examining the instrument itself - something like stress cracks from heating/cooling cycles. Essentially, the same sort of extra science you\u0027d get from returning the craft itself. It usually isn\u0027t much.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nThermometer, barometer, gravity detector.\n\n***75% return:***\n\nExperiments where all the value is in the data, but something extra might be gleaned from being able to examine the environment the collector has been exposed to - stuff that might take a sample and do a solid automatic analysis, but may have some sample leftover in the analysis tray that could be scraped out.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nAtmospheric Sensor, most ground-based science (since they\u0027re likely to pick up interesting stuff from the environment.)\n\n***45% return:***\n\nExperiments where the value is split between observation and being able to experiment on the returned science. Really, this is a middle-ground if you can\u0027t justify a full return, but also can\u0027t justify full transmission. This also applies to something that would do an intermediate automated analysis.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nMystery Goo, DMagic Anomaly Scanner.\n\n***15% return:***\n\nExperiments where almost all the value is in being able to return the sample, and only cursory automated analysis is possible/practical.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nMaterials Bay/SC-9001 Science Lab, DMagic ExoKerbol Core Drill, pretty much any \u0022sample collection\u0022 science.\n\n***0% return:***\n\nExperiments where *all* the value is in returning the sample, and no automated analysis is possible or practical.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nSurface sample returns from EVA are a stock example, as well as the KEES experiments from N3h3mia\u0027s Science Pack.\n\n* * *\n\n**License:** CC BY-SA 4.0.
