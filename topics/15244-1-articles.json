If anyone has any tips for improving the aircraft please let me know as i would like to be able to build bigger but the bigger I build the less (that looks like it should fly) works. Also it should be able to fly about 1000km or a bit more but I have not tested the range yet. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xvdBanksbvx","CreatedById":30451,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T00:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EForgot to put the craft in here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
