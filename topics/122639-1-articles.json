I run KSP, and only 35 mods are being loaded, when CKAN is showing 62 installed. I understand some of these mods will be dependencies etc, but I have parts mods that aren\u0027t being displayed, like Near Future Propulsion for example. It\u0027s in the GameData folder and the folder structure is intact, but it\u0027s not making it into the game. I have tried installing them all one-by-one (took a long freaking time too) and I opened KSP back up, only 35 mods are being registered once again. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mods installed one-by-one just fine until I got to the magic number of 35, then it stops adding them when the game is loading. Is there a setting somewhere that I\u0027m not seeing? Or something I\u0027m not understanding? This install is being run directly from my drive, not through Steam, and I\u0027m on Windows 10. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Upon further digging it turns out the problem lay with KSP AVC and Community Tech Tree not showing things properly. Mods were in there and available, I just never checked in sandbox mod. Moderators please delete, as I can\u0027t figure out how to or if I even can.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T03:56:25Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 03:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theoracle09\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
