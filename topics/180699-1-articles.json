One weakness of this setup is that you end up with two blind spots, one at the north pole and one at the south pole. Furthermore, at high latitudes you risk losing line of sight behind a hill or mountain because the satellite will be close to the horizon. To compensate, you can either add a satellite with a high polar apoapsis, or alternatively for very little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost you can change the \u003Cem\u003Einclination \u003C/em\u003E(not apoapsis) of each of your 3 relays to 90 degrees so that they alternate giving slightly better north pole and south pole coverage, albeit spotty coverage.
