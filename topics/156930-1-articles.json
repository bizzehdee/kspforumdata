I know on the PC you can track survey points by left clicking on them in the map mode. How do you do that on PS4? I can see the biome but when I click it, it just shows it\u0027s name and that\u0027s it. Can anyone help me, please?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: Ok I found out that it is a bug. This bug has been round since July 2016 and I\u0027ve heard that they are working on it. In that case,\u00A0does anyone have an idea on how to actively get to the survey point without over shooting it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-25T00:28:59Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2017 12:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Sam1257\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benjamin Kerman","CreatedById":172792,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T04:42:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI play on the PC version, so no help on the first part.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, when flying over a survey point, text will appear near the top of the screen stating something like: \u0022Now entering Jebadiah\u0027s Sorrow\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
