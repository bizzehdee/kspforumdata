The only fuel-intensive parts of my method are the initial orbit, and the burn to get your Ap to Minmus\\\u0027 altitude. After that, hardly any fuel needs to be used... even on landing. It\\\u0027s also perfectly possible with the patched conics to slingshot off of the Mun and use its gravity to help you get a much higher orbit. Takes significantly less fuel that way. It\\\u0027s also a fair bit easier to land on Minmus, due to its lower gravity.\n\nMy rocket was originally designed to be used on the Mun, but it actually takes *less* fuel to get to Minmus, depending on how you do it. I actually had to jettison my orbiter stage with a half tank of fuel left to be able to safely land. On the Mun, it usually ends up being emptied long before I have to prepare for final landing.
