I figured, why not simply change the background for the VAB - as in, instead of looking out over the launchpad during construction, you look out over Kerbin from orbit while you\u0027re throwing parts together. While I don\u0027t really have traditional understanding of coding, I was looking through my squad files to try to figure out how they use the background the do for the VAB. I normally am able to logic through the progression of code, but this has so far been entirely elusive to me. If someone wants to help me through this, that would be SO awesome. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, I\u0027m strictly interested in switching the VAB background to that of an orbital view of Kerbin or a view of literally any other background (oceans, from the mun, Jool orbit, etc., you guys get the idea). I also wouldn\u0027t know how to actually insert the background (a static image I\u0027m sure would be easier, but I\u0027d love to watch Kerbin rotate whilst building rockets). So all told, I propose the following phases for development:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase I - Replacement of the VAB background with an orbital view of Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Static image\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Orbital Rotation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase II - The ability to actually release ships from an Orbital VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Spawning of ships into orbit \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Integration with EPL capabilities to have a part to spawn from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. An actual physical building in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Animation of a ship being released from the OVAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase III - Modification of the VAB internals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Floating Kerbal engineers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. A more sensible design for oribtal construction (cylindrical shape, no floor as we know it now)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Launch clamp-like tethers to prevent whatever you are constructing from floating away\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPhase IV - An orbital SPH\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease let me know what you guys think!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf someone wants to take over that\u0027s cool too... I just wanted to get the idea out because I think this would be incredibly awesome to have. I just figured that instead of asking people to create mods, I\u0027d attempt to create one for once (albeit with copious amounts of assistance from modders).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-11T13:47:23Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2014 01:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by horndgmium\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
