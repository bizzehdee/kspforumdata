In career mode, once you have unlocked custom action groups, you should use action groups for this, by assigning \u0022toggle engine\u0022 to a group. If you only have basic action groups unlocked, you could use one of the basic ones. I rarely use the abort group, so If I really need to, I use this for stuff, as it\u0027s conveniently bound to backspace.\n\nIf your craft is already flying, you would need [this mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195-0-90-%28Jan31-15%29-Action-Groups-Extended-250-Action-Groups-in-flight-editing-Now-kOS-Support!) as it allows you to edit action groups post-launch."}]}
