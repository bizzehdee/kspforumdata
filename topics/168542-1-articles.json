I must have looked at all the Joystick and throttle combos available and even looked into creating custom controllers. I settled on the Saitek AV8R flight stick. For a Saitek product it is a good solid build and mine works just fine. It is good for lefties and righties. The throttle is on the front, easy to reach and out of the way. There are lots of programmable buttons and a four-way hat. You don\u2019t have to use the Saitek software, I don\u2019t. Best of all it comes with stickers :-)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022jvMVOdq.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/jvMVOdq.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022486\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCons; the stick is kind of big. People say I have big, beautiful hands, tremendous hands but this thing makes my hands feel small. That makes for a long throw and you may have to hold the base down. The base is a good size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Joy stick and key pad I wanted some thing like the Saitek Farm Sim control pad. It had a lot of cons; it is reportedly a poor build and big. It hangs off the desk edge and that is against the requirements. I was pretty close to purchasing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI found the IP Desktop from CH Products, it is an awesome find! It has a 3 axis joy stick, with a 2 button top, perfect for switching docking mode. It also has 12, yes, 12 programmable buttons I haven\u2019t been able to use them all. It is compact, good for lefties and righties. The stick is short-throw the foot print is small and the palm rest holds it place for good control. It shows up in the control panel as a regular game controller so it has potential with other games. It makes docking and rover steering really fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cOZDCDi.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022443\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cOZDCDi.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022466\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCons; CH Products makes game controllers this is not one of them. The IP Desktop is an enterprise product used for controlling PTZ security cameras. You may not be able to purchase it directly and it is expensive if you find it new, around $400.

I have owned a couple of their products that had great features but the quality and longevity of these were not up to snuff.

I recommend to anyone the tried and true Logitech 3d extreme pro. They have built this same model for a decade or more, it is dirt cheap, it handles abuse well, and it lasts for a very long time.
