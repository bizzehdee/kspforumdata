STuff in the middle gets occlusion, but that occlusion does not quite disable drag, but instead lowers it to like 10% or something, and the amount of drag also increases as you deviate from prograde vector.\n\nBasically from my own experience, the more crap you stick in a stack the better, as the front/rear parts are going to have alot of drag applied to them, and the stuff in the middle is going to have anywhere from major to some drag decreases. While 1.0.2 fixed most of the exploits, its still not a true vector based occlusion system. Things that are radially attached regardless of where they are placed on the craft will ALWAYS get full drag applied, period. This makes part clipping pointless from a drag saving perspective (the new exploity crafts involve shoving lucridious amounts of stuff into cargo bays, as those 100% disable drag on anything internal to them.\n\nThe drag works fine if you make conventional aircraft, but most truly high performance craft will abuse cargo bays for their unique ability to disable drag on anything inside (fuel droptanks go very nicely inside on of these, as do things like batteries, RTGs, solars, heck even ion engine clusters work from inside a cargo bay). The trick is to minimize part count outside of any bay, and place all radial stuff that isnt essential to aircraft appearance or function inside said bays."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T17:06:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anyways, from my experience:\n\u003E \n\u003E 1st part in a stack is always fully exposed, and the last part in a stack is something like 50-66% drag of a fully exposed part.

Considering that parts placed inside have basically become internal to the fuselage and are out of the wind stream.\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T20:48:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is pretty much spot on for subsonic drag.\n\u003E Although I am curious why you consider putting things inside a cargo bay as exploity and abusive from a drag perspective?
