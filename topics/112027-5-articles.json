Should they not work better when deployed?\n\u003E I\u0027m still wondering how the heat stuff exactly works in KSP. Most of the time it makes no sense to me or consufes me completely.\n\u003E \n\u003E And never warp faster than 100x when you get lower than 2Gm or the radiators (and other parts, even if they get no direct sun light) will explode.\n\u003E \n\u003E And the heat pipes tendend to overheat anyways. I had to be very carefull to get this mission done, including some quicksave loads.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/MshrRwf.png](http://i.imgur.com/MshrRwf.png)\n\nI honestly haven\u0027t confirmed whether part occlusion works at all to stop solar heating. I thought it didn\u0027t at all actually. Operating near the sun is quite risky in general and you need to take exposed cross sectional area into account. To get close you\u0027ll need to minimize the amount of area that can receive radiation (ship like a long thin needle maybe and use the rotating radiators to dissipate the heat that\u0027s still hitting the cross section. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E a) Do both heat pipe endings need heat exchangers or just the heat destination?\n\u003E For example if there\u0027s an asparagus cluster of engines and I want to divert all heat to the central one where the main exchanger with radiators is - can I just use the pipes to transfer heat from lateral tanks holding the engines (because engines don\u0027t have mesh to attach stuff to) or do I need exchangers for them, too?\n\u003E \n\u003E ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) Is the larger exchanger \u0022sucking\u0022 heat faster or just has more heat capacity because it has more mass?\n\nThe point of the exchangers is to provide convenient places for you to move heat to and from using pipes, kinda like a road intersection. They don\u0027t do anything else. The larger one transfers heat faster because it has a larger cross section.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyone else notice that the thermal physics kinda breaks down above 100x time warp? I had a reactor going, and my whole ship spiked to over 700 Kelvin the moment I exceeded 100x time warp.\n\nYou can try increasing thermalMaxIntegrationWarp = 100 in Physics.cfg if you\u0027re brave.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Any plans for adding some spaceplane heat solutions? My Mach 5 plane would definitely benefit from such things.\n\nNot really at the moment.
