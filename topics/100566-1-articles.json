The weird thing is that when I change the rotation of the child, the part in the part list image rotates with it, but when I take the part out it still uses the axis of the child to determine which way it points in the SPH.. It\u0027s like it\u0027s completely skipping the non-rotated game object coordinates, and also using the child coordinates to pick attach directions too. I can post pictures if that would make it clearer haha.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T04:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s outta my league, someone with more modding knowledge will have to take over from here \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T05:49:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, thanks for the help though \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
