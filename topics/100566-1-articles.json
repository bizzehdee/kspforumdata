Like the parts on the outsides are oriented? The darker section that the lettering is on opens and swings down so that the words can be read when the plane is on the runway, and I\u0027d like them to open symmetrically.\n\n![PoyDOtQh.png](http://i.imgur.com/PoyDOtQh.png)\n\n![A0U3yJwh.png](http://i.imgur.com/A0U3yJwh.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T23:33:22Z","Content":"Probably, but it can get clunky.\n\nTry this:\n\n1. Take the \u0022broken\u0022 ones off and toss them away.\n2. Use \u0022r\u0022 to change your symmetry to radial (MM instead of that weird plus symbol next to the cost of your vessel)\n3. Hold Alt and click one of the good ones, this will create a copy.\n4. Hover that copy over where you want it to go, but DON\u0027T PLACE IT.\n5. Check the little MM symbol to make sure it didn\u0027t change back for some reason. If it did, hit R again.\n6. Place the part, and it should look correct.\n\nThis MAY not work. Sometimes the game just won\u0027t let you change from radial (the plus) to mirror (MM) symmetry. If that\u0027s the case, you\u0027re kind of boned but usually re-placing the wings with mirror symmetry (similar to how I did it above) will work."},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T00:17:40Z","Content":"Hmm, that didn\u0027t seem to work for me.. But I did create this part so I have full control over how it is set up ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I have tried rotating it in unity different ways and using different config values but haven\u0027t figured out why I can\u0027t get them to orient correctly. Because wings are symmetrical in that way correct?"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T03:31:17Z","Content":"So I figured out that the part, when written from Unity, is using the coordinates of the object childed to the empty game object that I am using to write the part. The weird thing is that when I change the rotation of the child, the part in the part list image rotates with it, but when I take the part out it still uses the axis of the child to determine which way it points in the SPH.. It\u0027s like it\u0027s completely skipping the non-rotated game object coordinates, and also using the child coordinates to pick attach directions too. I can post pictures if that would make it clearer haha."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T04:50:19Z","Content":"That\u0027s outta my league, someone with more modding knowledge will have to take over from here ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T05:49:55Z","Content":"Alright, thanks for the help though ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
