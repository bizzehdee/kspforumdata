Both the Ares family and SLS existed/exist solely to keep the dollars flowing to the same contractors they\u0027ve always been flowing to since before the beginning of the space shuttle program. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObama\u0027s goal was \u0022man to an asteroid by 2025\u0022 then \u0022orbit mars by the mid-2030s\u0022 (not exactly the most inspired speech of solid goal), but NASA\u0027s budget keeps going down and down and down due both to the actions of the white house and congress - simultaneously telling them to do big things while not giving them the money to do so. The 2021 asteroid capture mission is kind of a bare-minimum cop-out for the \u0022man to an asteroid\u0022 goal, but in a way it\u0027s the best they can do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is of course avoiding all the problems that exist within NASA... for instance, the huge hairball of bureaucracy and constantly shifting priorities, the same sort of managerial machine that led to the losses of Challenger and Columbia, unfortunately.

In the event private enterprise does take over manned spaceflight, I think it would be ideal for NASA to go back to pushing the boundaries with robotics and deep exploration missions, while not even bothering with either spacecraft going to whatever celestial bodies are being utilized by commercial entities (why do that when you can hitch a ride), or anything in LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-16T20:18:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/16/2014 08:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T20:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Seret\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Seret\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe Ares prototype shot was suborbital.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot even that, apogee about 40km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"syfyguy64","CreatedById":47714,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T02:33:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMerging NASA with the military is really the only way to get things done at a rapid rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat, or splitting the military\u0027s budget, which is harder than splitting the atom.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Pseudonym","CreatedById":27614,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-18T02:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:eurostile;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ESig says all.
