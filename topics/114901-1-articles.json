Civilization, for example, may get old after a while, and people generally find one strategy that they like and stick with it. You might have more fun choosing different leaders and using strange, unique techniques just to see how they work to extend the lifetime of the game and minimize memorization of tactics. In KSP, certain rocket designs are common and work well, but that doesn\u0027t stop players from making outlandish craft for poops and giggles. Try playing a noncompetitive game of Starcraft with a build mainly of roaches and corrupters, or play chess using pieces only on one side of the board.

The problem with the strategy genre in general is not so much how games are played but with their unchanging sameness. In almost all members of this category, every match starts the same way, or at least largely so (i.e, there may be different maps in Starcraft, but the pool is limited, and in any case they still involve the same six matchups), which leads to the rise of builds--certain ways of playing a race or color or whatever distinguishes your team from another, and the strategy begins to leach out of the game to be replaced by technical skill or memorization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn chess, for example, beyond a certain level, the game stops being about playing well and becomes one player trying to outmemorize the other; I got to this point in my early years, became quickly disillusioned, and simply quit. In Starcraft, for example, I quit after I saw enough of the game to realize that regardless of one\u0027s strategic ability victory is basically guaranteed for the player better at pushing buttons at the right times than the other, and there is no real strategy in that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, a true \u0022strategy game\u0022 is one wherein a player must rely on their intellect, rather than their memory of a build or technical ability, to claim victory over the opponent, and the only true way to do that is to randomize everything, and then one must deal with the problems of balance...Alas, creating one of these may be impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYeah that\u0027s why I like low level starcraft macro might be a thing but the ability to multitask isn\u0027t there. You can have fun in those levels. Instead of it being work.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-05T22:43:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think you know what type of mentality you\u0027re supposed to have in PA.
