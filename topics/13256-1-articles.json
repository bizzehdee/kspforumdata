The only problem is, I don\\\u0027t know how to rendezvous. I know you need to go higher than the target to get it to catch up with you, and vice-versa, and I also know you need to match the targets inclination, but other than that, I\\\u0027m clueless. Can someone give me a step-by-step guide as to how to do this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duckunlimited2","CreatedById":14973,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-26T01:11:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9726.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9726.0\u003C/a\u003E - a table that will tell you when to do a transfer burn at where you have to be to rendezvous successfully; best for satellite rendezvous\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7138.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7138.0\u003C/a\u003E - a step by step guide for any rendezvous - best for bigger orbits like planetary or minmus rendezvous\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8021.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8021.0\u003C/a\u003E - I believe this auto - pilot plugin (mechjeb) can do a rendezvous\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you can do the MacGyver way - set your satellite in a slighty smaller orbit than the other satellites orbit, time warp till they get close (like you can see it close) then point your satellite at it and RCS towards it \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-26T01:33:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that the docking will only really last as long as you\\\u0027re still playing the ships in the current version; When you switch to something that isn\\\u0027t in the same 2.5 km physics sphere, or if you warp faster than 2x, they\\\u0027ll pass through one another and disengage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
