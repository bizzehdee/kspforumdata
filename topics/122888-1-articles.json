Reaction wheels, engines, and control surfaces. The SRB engines you are using do not have steerable nozzles (called \u0022gimbals\u0022), so that engine is not helping your control the craft. Also, the fins you have chosen do not pivot. That leaves only the inherent reaction wheels of the capsule with which to control the craft. Try experimenting with other parts. But even then, a craft of that general shape just isn\u0027t going to fly very well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot said to make you feel bad.

You\u0027ll be going way too fast when you\u0027re still low in the thick atmosphere. Use a thrust limiter to reduce the thrust and spread it out: in the VAB, right-click on the booster and set the thrust limiter to something lower than its default 100%. Try going down to 50% to start with, and tweak it from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, I note that you\u0027ve only put fins on two sides of that bottom rocket-- have you tried making it a foursome, like the liquid stage above it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird: Get rid of the little fins on the 2nd stage. I suspect that you don\u0027t need them, and they may actually be hurting it if they\u0027re in \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Efront\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E of the CoM for that 2nd stage (the command pod is only 800ish kg, whereas the engine is like 1.25 tons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth: What sort of engine is that on the 2nd stage? Reliant, or Swivel? If it\u0027s Reliant, switch to Swivel if possible-- the Reliant doesn\u0027t have engine gimbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried re-creating your craft and played around with it a little bit. I went ahead and used the Reliant engine, which is the \u0022harder\u0022 one \u0027coz it doesn\u0027t have gimbal. Here\u0027s what I found:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiment #1: run it as pictured, with the SRB at full power. Result: it flips out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiment #2: As pictured, but the bottom fins are 4-way instead of 2-wy. Result: it flies just fine, totally stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExperiment #3: Get rid of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eall\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the fins, reduce the SRB to 50% power. Result: it flies just fine, is stable. And, incidentally, flies a lot higher than experiment #2 (since it\u0027s not wasting fuel fighting drag by going too fast too low).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you\u0027ve got a fair number of options. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing to bear in mind: When you do have fins, you always want them to be as far towards the rear of the rocket as you can possibly manage.

Fins are draggy bits, and because you have some at the front, they are destabilizing your vehicle. Snark goes into a little more detail, but for a newcomer, it may potentially help you to have a simple rule to follow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockets are also more stable if they are longer and narrower, provided the weight isn\u0027t all concentrated at the bottom (see golden rule, above).

Launch your vehicle without fins first to check if it remains stable, and revert to the editor to add them if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Always mount passive guide fins in three- or four-fold symmetry, unless you know what you are doing. Using less than three does not stabilize all axes of movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Always mount active guide fins (\u0022control surfaces\u0022) in four-fold symmetry, unless you know what you are doing. Using three will sometimes screw with your steering, depending on your orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Only ever mount fins in places other than the bottom of the first stage if it\u0027s necessary. I.e. if your rocket flies fine until first stage burnout, and then immediately flips after staging, that\u0027s a good reason to mount fins on the second stage too. Besides this, there exist few other reasons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sybeck2k","CreatedById":152277,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T13:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor the moment...thanks all!!!
