Well, the existing Javascript API didn\u0027t work very well for me and kept throwing errors. It also seems to depend on having an Internet connection for its copy of JQuery-ui, and it seems to use Google\u0027s graphing API rather than having its own. So, I\u0027ve rewritten it (or have at least started to).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, I\u0027m running into difficulties turning the heading, pitch and roll values into something that makes a navball rotate the way it should. I figured it\u0027d be a gimbal issue, so tried rotating the remaining rotation axes along with the navball. Still no joy. I\u0027m aware the texture is probably 90 degrees out longitude-wise, but that doesn\u0027t explain the wierdness.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EAnybody here know the math to translate a heading, pitch and roll into X, Y and Z rotation values?\u003C/span\u003E Solved.

If it is minimized, or if it is behind the front tab in a multitabbed browser, it will most likely be given a far lower amount of CPU time. As this main window relays information from the Telemachus API, this means that anything relying on it starts slowing down to maybe one update per second, rather than the 10fps I currently have it set to. The main window can be \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C/em\u003E another window, but not behind another tab, or minimized.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T03:01:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 03:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by technicalfool\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERemoved links, moving them to first post.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T20:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can access the raw Euler angles using the \u003Cem\u003Erawpitch\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003Erawroll\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Erawyaw\u003C/em\u003E API calls available in the latest Telemachus development build.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T17:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK, I managed to get this working (I wasn\u0027t launching the pages from the index you provide), and I have to say ... the navigation ball is 100% awesome (unfortunately, due to forum policy, I cannot use expletives to express how much I love this).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease keep up the good work \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E, as this project has me grinning like an idiot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GavinZac","CreatedById":68719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T11:03:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExciting \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E looking forward to my second monitor being genuinely useful for KSP\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeblote","CreatedById":79303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T14:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow is it a hack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shand","CreatedById":57781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T15:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehacking doesnt mean what you think it does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehacking is (amongst other things) changing the way things works, getting under the bonnet, examining whats inside and changing bits for betterment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gerner","CreatedById":80041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-23T18:12:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETelemachus looks great and this looks like a nice set of tools and lib wrapping the Telemachus API.
