I might rework the model sometime in the future, but after working on three cockpits and IVAs back to back, I don\u0027t really want to make more cockpits for a while. As for the MATTOCK, yeah, it is a powerful little engine. Used it to made any planes without any control surfaces of any kind yet?"}]}
