The file I linked here includes a 7 Jumbo tank with asparagus style staging. With that payload it has a whopping 4838 atmo and 5701 vacuum delta-v, you can get the 252T payload to an orbit of 620km without touching the fuel in the payload. It has flight controls (RCS and SAS*6), 6k Battery life and 6 RTG\u0027s to keep you powered up until forever. It\u0027s also so stable I just launch it from the platform, no Launch Stability Enhancers. Some of the strutting could be prettier, but that\u0027s as nice as I\u0027m making it tonight. The center booster is set to 25% thrust limit and has its own RCS pack because it has a tendency to flail about when it pushes that big of a load by itself. The Mainsails are separated from the tanks by an octagonal strut to allow them to cool properly, meaning you never have to reduce thrust on any of the other engines. The vertical I-Beams can be removed, though I like to use them for stability of payload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Larrt_M","CreatedById":104021,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T18:06:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I\u0027m a bit new at this.
