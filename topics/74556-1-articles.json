I\u0027m looking for a theoretically-perfect orbit, I understand that slight imprecision may eventually mess it up. And I don\u0027t want to spend the fuel to go all the way to a polar orbit on the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI to effectively minimize eclipses to once ever few decades or so like Kasuha did... Can you demonstrate (with screenshots and math) what this would actually look like?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
