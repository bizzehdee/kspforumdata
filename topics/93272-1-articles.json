Larger ships tend to suffer less because the user has to add that much torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t dug into it, but it seems like when the SAS is \u0022really\u0022 close, it just puts too much input in (when there is a high torque/mass ratio) causing a small overshoot, where the process repeats itself. Simply damping down the input rate doesn\u0027t really fix it though because planes already suffer from a SAS unlock problem, where under some circumstances if you provide even the slightest input, the SAS is to slow to put its input back to keep the nose up, and the craft never comes back under control. Some of that is aircraft design, but the SAS will fail to keep up even if there is enough control authority available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ed Gauss","CreatedById":110895,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-18T17:43:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Claw\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Claw\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027d say it\u0027s less of a \u0022small vs. large craft\u0022 problem and more of some magic ratio of torque for the weight.\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s very easy to see with small craft because there are a lot of cases where even just the Mk1 pod has too much control authority.
