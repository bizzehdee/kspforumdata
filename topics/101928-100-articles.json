They all use the Drill-O-Matic model, so you can probably already see where this is going. It\u0027s the inventory volume bug that\u0027s already been reported. I know it\u0027s getting fixed in KIS 1.2.10.\n\nThat being said, I have a question. Is this a general fix, or does it specifically fix the stock drill-o-matic drill? I hope it\u0027s generalized to all deployable parts, because the bug happens with all inflatable MKS modules that don\u0027t have \u0022volumeOverride =\u0022 set to a custom value. This bug is making it a pain to ship stuff in KIS crates, and that\u0027s my preferred method of supplying a base with smaller parts, as I only have to make one craft and then adjust the contents of the KIS container as needed.\n\nIt didn\u0027t take me long to figure out that this is a bug, but it wasn\u0027t crashing my game or throwing exceptions that I was aware of, so I didn\u0027t give up. I ended up using the 5m KIS crate from MKS (160,000L inventory size) to ship out 12 MKS drills, 2 standard-size radial Karbonite drills, and a 2m Karbonite distiller. Fortunately I already had a craft that could send the (otherwise identical) 5m MKS Kontainer to Minmus with relative ease, so I just had to swap out which 5m cargo container the craft was hauling. With all of that cargo, the MKS 5m KIS crate reported that it was slightly overfilled. At least this bug acts consistently.\n\nI could have sent a bunch more stuff in that huge container than I did, which leads me to my next question:  \n\nHow do I go about making a MM patch to modify how much inventory space a specific part takes up?\n\nI can\u0027t find the MM patch file that\u0027s adding ModuleKISItem to every part anywhere in KIS or KAS, and I don\u0027t know where else to look. Heck, I don\u0027t even know if that patch file even exists in the first place, it could be the DLL that does that for all I know. I could probably just use :FINAL, but I try to avoid that if I\u0027m writing a MM patch to fix a bug because it doesn\u0027t leave any room for a further \u0022tweaking\u0022 patch (like adjusting reaction wheel strength).\n\nSince this isn\u0027t a crash-bug or something that causes NRE spam, I figured it would be more constructive if I asked for advice on how to work around the problem myself via an MM patch rather than be annoying and ask for a release date on KIS 1.2.10.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-21T02:48:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2016 02:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SciMan**"},{"CreatedByName":"Helbrecht","CreatedById":158332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T02:50:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 14 minutes ago, Gryphon said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I presume you have the right Kerbal and the right tool for the job, and it\u0027s equipped?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: Oh, and you\u0027re using the right attach mode?\n\u003E \n\nI am using an Engineer kerbal, with a Wrench trying to attach a mk16 chute to the nose of the starter command pod, by attach mode you mean the node right?"},{"CreatedByName":"ExplorerKlatt","CreatedById":107424,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T02:57:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 minutes ago, Helbrecht said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am using an Engineer kerbal, with a Wrench trying to attach a mk16 chute to the nose of the starter command pod, by attach mode you mean the node right?\n\u003E \n\nIIRC, the mk16 can\u0027t be surface attached and the wrench can\u0027t be used to node attach."},{"CreatedByName":"Helbrecht","CreatedById":158332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T03:06:48Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, ExplorerKlatt said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E IIRC, the mk16 can\u0027t be surface attached and the wrench can\u0027t be used to node attach.\n\u003E \n\nso I need the electric driver to attach things on nodes like fuel tanks on top of other tanks?"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T03:25:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 18 minutes ago, Helbrecht said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E so I need the electric driver to attach things on nodes like fuel tanks on top of other tanks?\n\u003E \n\nAccording to the manual yes."},{"CreatedByName":"Helbrecht","CreatedById":158332,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T04:34:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, goldenpsp said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E According to the manual yes.\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the help, I was pulling hairs trying to save my ship that has like 200 science in it."},{"CreatedByName":"IgorZ","CreatedById":155445,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-21T08:45:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, SciMan said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That being said, I have a question.

The only way to reliably get part\u0027s model state is having it created, initialized and activated: in the very best case it takes 2 frame updates. I can do it in editor and in flight but there are intermediate states where it\u0027s not feasible to create a part (e.g. loading an inventory). That said, for a part that has a deployed model by default the only way to fix the volume issue is overriding via MM patch. Here is [an example](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/blob/master/Patches/MM-StockParts.cfg) for the stock drills. Though, better solution would be asking model\u0027s designer to make the right initial state.\n\nWorking on another bug I figured out a trick which may help with *some* models. E.g. \u0060Drill-O-Matic\u0060 defines a deployed model but with proper animations set to enabled state. These animations can be speeded up programmatically which results in a compact model within one frame. Though, this approach won\u0027t work with other parts that setup animations in OnInitialize/OnLoad methods. The trick is not implemented as for now, and I\u0027m not convinced it should be (because it\u0027s a hack, actually)."},{"CreatedByName":"Jarin","CreatedById":71395,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T02:28:40Z","Content":"Portable explosives apparently don\u0027t destroy landing legs.

But if you put it on the ground or leave floating in space at some distance from the container then on next grab distance will be measured from that new location. Parts that can be carried on the back should be specifically designed for that, stock parts cannot be carried. Small stock parts can be put into SC-62 container that can be carried.\n\nAs for your situation I may suggest the following:\n\n1. Adjust mass and distance limits so what you\u0027re comfortable with them. See [here](https://github.com/KospY/KIS/wiki/Settings.cfg).\n2. Build larger sections nearby to the container, and then move them to the place of the final construction.\n3. Move parts from container to the construction site in several hops.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 hours ago, Enceos said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E [@IgorZ](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/155445-igorz/) Here\u0027s the way I\u0027ve been doing it in 1.0.5\n\u003E \n\nWow! Never thought about such way of using KIS ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) What you do is actually not completing a drag action which isn\u0027t how it supposed to work. Until you complete the action the part is considered to be in the container, and distance is checked relative to the container. If I do mass check on the drag start then limit will start checking even when moving items between two containers. Though, may be it\u0027s a right thing to do: if you cannot pull out heavy part then you also cannot move it into another container."}]}
