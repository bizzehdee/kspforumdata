From deadly reentry to not enough fuel to return. Finally I may this super efficient floatable lander using jet engines to gain speed to break orbit. Well my trip was a success until I decided to use quick save. I wanted my Kerbal to swim to a nearby island but it was too far and upon quicksaving he infinitely fell through Laythe\u0027s liquid ocean. This whole mission was jinxed with bugged heat shields, physics problems, and now when I actually got there my kerbal infinitely falls through the map! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, here are some pictures of my success. Despite losing my kerbal the ship had a remote pod and did in fact leave orbit of Laythe pretty easily. I may upload to the \u0022ships\u0022 section if anyone wants a lightweight laythe landing system. I\u0027m going to reattempt tonight and try to get my Kerbal off the planet this time. Oh and despite the mechanical jeb, I did all the trajectories/dockings/planning manual, I really only use it to keep my ship oriented correctly during those notoriously long engine burns!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/532870610464610940/7483EA76B3492EDCEAB3AD72E4C48F0A68C88AA4/\u0022 alt=\u00227483EA76B3492EDCEAB3AD72E4C48F0A68C88AA4\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/532870610464612625/A235F8F8623C4E50454526D6462F2C91F2139B58/\u0022 alt=\u0022A235F8F8623C4E50454526D6462F2C91F2139B58\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/532870610464613571/B39D80D3AE391D71A684E8017798888A652BD860/\u0022 alt=\u0022B39D80D3AE391D71A684E8017798888A652BD860\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-04T00:10:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh the words I\u0027d say if \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E first Laythe mission ends in disaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a serious note, ouch.
