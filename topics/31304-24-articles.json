Trusses shouldn\u0027t cost 10x as much as probe cores, for instance. Further, heavier items that do the same thing should cost _less_ than lighter ones in many cases, for example five Z100s vs a single Z500. The energy density is higher so the cost should be too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, in the real world the payload makes up the majority of the cost of the mission. Satellite example: $100m for the payload, $40m for the LV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I went ahead and rewrote the cost function to (1) consider part category and (2) consider part modules, and in doing so tried to make particularly command, utility, and science items cost far more, and structural far less. For most parts (3) I consider mass-efficiency: Reactors (treated as big RTGs) will be per-unit-of-generated-electricity more expensive since they\u0027re more efficient than the stock RTG. Same goes for fuel tanks, solar panels, batteries, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means, most importantly, that mods that add overpowered components (compared to stock) will have those components cost way _more_, not way _less_ as it stands now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did keep some cost for mass (i.e. construction labor and structural parts) but that is under different multipliers for different kinds of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tweaked nobody\u0027s formula for engines so that gimbal and atmo Isp are taken into account and so that mass-efficiency plays a role: the more mass efficient an engine is for its performance, the more expensive it will be--so if a mod adds an LVT-45-alike that masses only 1 ton, it will be more expensive, not the same cost (MC\u0027s current engine formula) or _less_ expensive (MC\u0027s engine formula \u002B MC\u0027s mass formula). Jets (and the Kethane turbine) are also now included, at at 1/20 price ratio. That works out, because high-performance jets are actually more expensive than rocket engines, IIRC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample costs:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOcto2: 2000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESmall stack probe: 1200\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk1 pod (with DRE ablative coating): 7000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk1-2 pod (with DRE heat shield): 29000\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience sensor: 250\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAntenna: 150\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComm Dish: 750\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoteTech SatDish 9000: 30,000 \u002B 700 construction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELVT-45: 4000 \u002B 100 in construction costs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESLS Bearcat (NovaPunch; 240 thrust, extra gimballing, similar Isp, still 1.5t): 5400 \u002B 100 construction costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDSM Nuclear Reactor: 601,000 \u002B 50,000 or so in construction costs\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructural parts: a few K here and there!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple example pictures (note that I\u0027ve doubled costs for batteries and panels since then, so increase Utility by x2)--note that the total costs should be broadly comparable to where they are in stock MC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Pics fixed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/pWf21aw\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pWf21aw.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022pWf21aw.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/i0mF2Rq\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i0mF2Rq.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022i0mF2Rq.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI _believe_ the license allows me to upload these changes compiled; I can certainly upload the code.

Like a Mainsail costing as much as an LV909 (or something), or mod parts leaving the default cost. That\u0027s why nobody44 developed the new balancing system based on mass, and then fuel and engine costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for liquid fuel being so cheap is that, well, it is. It\u0027s just kerosine. What\u0027s expensive is oxidizer. The way the costs were set up, if you\u0027re building a rocket, you either pay for LF\u002BOX, or you pay for solid. So solid should cost more than LF alone, but less than LF\u002BOX. The reason to have LF so cheap is so that jets, which use LF alone, just pay for cheap gas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I agree with you that fuel should be (because it is, IRL) cheap. Or at least cheap compared to payload. Under the code I released, fuel should be something like \u0026lt;1/3 the cost of the rocket; payload should be 1/3 to 1/2 (best if \u0026gt;1/2 but that\u0027s hard to do), and engines, structure, etc, should be the rest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happened to the pod costs for the KerbalX?
