We not only didn\u0027t get one, but the announcement was not great.\n\u003E This is like the old joke, doctor tells a guy \u0022I\u0027ve got good news and I\u0027ve got bad news. The bad news is, you have cancer and will be dead in a month.\u0022 The man, horrified, asks, \u0022please, doc, give me the good news now!\u0022 and the doctor answers \u0022Just this week I cut a whole two strokes off my golf game!\u0022\n\u003E \n\u003E A PS4 release is great news... for Squad. It doesn\u0027t mean squat to us and it had nothing to do with the development of 1.0.3, which they - like the doctor and his \u0022good news\u0022, implied was forthcoming.\n\u003E \n\u003E Call me ingracious. Call me self-entitled. I don\u0027t care. I was told the rug was safe and they pulled it out from under me anyway.\n\nSo true.\n\nWith every console port, the game developer is saying the pc version would not be affected, and it was never true. It is just a PR phrase to keep the pc gamers calm.\n\nBut at least there can\u0060t be a graphic downgrade.\n\nThe step to ps4 is purly economical, I guess Ksp revenues from other stores are decreasing so that such a step was nesseccary.\n\nEdit:hate mobile typing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T11:16:13Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 11:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alewx**"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:56:13Z","Content":"Great news for Squad, maybe - they get to get more money, which they totally deserve IMO.\n\nAs for us...

A quick look a their (oh god awful) creations made my intestines convulse in weird ways. they honestly don\u0027t seem to be the right people for KSP...\n\nAnyway good luck to them if they have to port a buggy,unfinished, CPU demanding game that runs on 2 cores only on a already-outdated console with 8 low freq cores ! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n3-Where are the Devnotes ? i wait for every tuesday so impatiently and... this banner.\n\n4-Where is 1.0.3 ? it\u0027s supposed to be the hotfix for 1.02, wich itself is the hotfix for 1.0.1, wich itself is the hotfix for 1.0...... Squad had said that 1.0.3 hotifx was imminent about 3weeks ago, and then it got \u0022slightly\u0022 slowed down... \n\n5-According to 4- why didn\u0027t we just get a super simple thermal gages hotfix while waiting for the main bugfix update ? \n\nand then how do you even VAB with a controller ? How do you fuel transfer ? i look forward to seeing that anyway.\n\nhey guys, at least there won\u0027t be any graphic downgrade, the game looks terrible already ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEDIT : ninja\u0027ed by this (about warframe)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E until they started adapting the controls... The menus on PC(!) suddenly were optimized for console controller inputs, the whole UI structure was \u0027consolified\u0027.\n\nReading this, I really really really hope that the new UI redesign SQUAD promised us for Unity 5 isn\u0027t linked to the PS4 port in ^^that^^ way.

This WILL take up time and effort unless Squad is bringing on additional staff to assist the Flying Tiger team.

Beyond the port, someone has to be responsible for maintenance and further feature/fix porting - if not Flying Tiger, that\u0027ll be Squad\u0027s responsibility too.
