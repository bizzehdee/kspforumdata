(All of them as machinists/mechanics, not engineers.) But as a kid in the late 60s (a very young kid -- I don\u0027t remember much) my parents say I was obsessed with the astronauts and the moon landings. I do remember some of my favorite snacks being Tang and those \u0022food sticks\u0022 that Pillsbury made for NASA and then marketed to the public.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I grew up I watched Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz and the Space Shuttle and read books about planets and watched Cosmos.

I think rocketing off into space is just about the coolest thing I can do, and I\u0027m still set on that goal even if it takes me a lot of failed tries.
