The effects look good but I have surely come in too steep or shallow and have lived to tell the tale. I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s an add-on because that would be in-game physics I\u0027d imagine, but perhaps there is an add-on the simply tells me that the angle was bad and I draw my own conclusions. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other \u0022must-have\u0022 add ons?

Fairings and shrouds are add-on only parts for the moment (except for a few engines, which get shrouds placed around them automatically if you connect something under them), but there\u0027s also no real need for them, as the atmospheric drag model the game uses now is highly simplified. Realistically lethal reentry heat is also planned for a future release and will probably come along with the general atmospheric overhaul (or at least that\u0027s my best guess).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for add-on recommendations, some of the ones I tend to use quite frequently are the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/maneuver-node-improvement/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EManeuver Node Improvement\u003C/a\u003E plugin, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/kerbal-alarm-clock-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/haystack/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHaystack\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/?p=7456\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESubassembly Saver / Loader\u003C/a\u003E, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/18-1-kerbal-crew-manifest/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Crew Manifest\u003C/a\u003E, and \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/tac-fuel-balancer-v1-0/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETAC Fuel Balancer\u003C/a\u003E.
