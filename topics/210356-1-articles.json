First you\u0027ll need a highly chaotic and ideally metal rich solar system, this thing will go on a journey. Then you need a proto super earth to form, this super earth will need to have excess amounts of nickel, which means ideally it should be close to the start. Now, we need to crash a planet into it. If all plays out nicely, youll get a decently large exposed planetary core, with lots of nickel, also lots of other junk floating around, but we can just ignore that. Then, we need this core to book it outwards, the faster the better. As it migrates faster it needs to do two things, get hit a lot, and collect gas. We will want this planet to have lots of craters, ideally deep ones, and we want this planet to become something resembling a small mini neptune, the more gas it collects the better, as the things that arent gas will cover up the core, meaning we will want it to collect most of this gas from farther away from the sun. We\u0027re nearly there to our bootleg kerbin, it just needs to continue migrating outwards. Due to the mass of this planet being relatively low, the lighter gases will escape the planet, leaving you with lots of oxygen and nitrogen, with minimal of other gases. This oxygen will react with the nickel in the planet, forming lots of nickel oxide, this nickel oxide will be a nice green color. As the migration carries on, the planet wont pick up just gas, but fortunately for us, we have a lot of nice craters for the solid material to settle into. Now, it needs to continue its journey, and go far. Far out enough, the gas will cool, compress, and liquidify. Remember those craters? The oxygen will come down from the clouds in a nice blue color, filling in the craters. And there you have it, you have a planet with a green surface from nickel oxide, with blue oceans from liquid oxygen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-10-31T22:41:43Z\u0022 title=\u002210/31/2022 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 31, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Strawberry\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-31T23:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere does the oxygen come from?
