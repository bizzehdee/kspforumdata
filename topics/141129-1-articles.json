No just aero brake, but use the lift to go back up, maybe not back to space but to reduce entry time.

Magta bounces off Laythe\u0027s atmosphere at 20km/s, using lift to change her heading by 45 degrees and increase her speed by 4-fold (non-physical). She doesn\u0027t survive it for very long, though! The video starts in the middle, but you can start at the beginning if you\u0027d like to see the setup- it\u0027s no cheats just minor glitches. I suspect you might have had ships and survival in mind, though?
