Also, generally each module will rest on its own legs/wheels, which requires a minimum of 3 for stability (usually 4 if you\u0027re going for rough bilateral symmetry). 4 wheels or 4 legs makes no difference to part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA while ago I was using KPBS and its extendable rover wheels to move modules into position, but I still used 4 legs for the modules to sit on their own, so I stopped that and just went all stock and used 4x rover wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I was doing with KPBS was using a rover \u0022truck\u0022 that would dock one section of extendable wheels to the front of a module, then dock to the back, then extend wheels (lifting the module), then it would drive into position, lower the module and undock. Then both sections would dock, and push the module the last few meters from the back (without wheels on the front, luckily that mod\u0027s wheels had good traction and torque).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a \u0022tug\u0022 or \u0022truck\u0022 can still be useful.

gentle slopes are ok, but it must be the same gradient everywhere. \u00A0The Kraken will attack you if your base is not on level ground. \u00A0Dock as gently as you possibly can. \u00A0Docking at a slight angle can cause some parts to stick into the surface, meaning that when focusing on the vessel, some parts will be below the surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Don\u0027t try and establish your base on a steep slope. \u00A0What will happen after a little mining of resources is that the base will be heavier and start to slide. \u00A0I had an Ike base once that suffered a catastrophic 2km downhill plunge due to starting on a steep slope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Bases can be put broadly in three types categories based on how they\u0027re constructed and expanded -- Disconnected bases, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E-constructed bases and docked bases. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0-- A disconnected base has multiple vessels within 150 metres of each other - so for example, having a habitation section, a mining section and a manufacturing section all as separate components landed near each other. \u00A0This setup in theory is kinder to your computer than having a single base because different vessels run in different cpu cores. \u00A0In practice, you end up needing extra parts on each vessel to make them work - aerials, batteries, extra storage, etc. so it ends up being just as laggy. \u00A0Easy to expand - just land another component within 150 metres. \u00A0(example -- Ike base)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222XEFPsS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2XEFPsS.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0-- A \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E-constructed base is one where you start with a basic base or structure to which other parts can be manually attached by Kerbals using screwdrivers. \u00A0This type is relatively easy to expand but base setup generally takes a lot of time and normally requires a flexible construction rover to help. \u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E-construction techniques are often helpful in the other two base types. \u00A0(example -- Dres base).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mzZxI2m.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mzZxI2m.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0-- A docked base is one where multiple components are landed and then docked together on the surface typically using the Konstruction docking ports -

a very slow slide down the hill. \u00A0The flatter the terrain, the better. \u00A0Also to be noted is trying to park it on a slope that is even. \u00A0That is, don\u0027t park it across a bit of slope that\u0027s at 5 degrees and another bit that\u0027s at 8 degrees - this is an invitation for the Kraken to attack because certain bits of the ship may load below ground.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* All resources. \u00A0Whilst it\u0027s unusual to find a biome that has everything that you need, it\u0027s often possible to find two areas (e.g. Highlands and Midlands) that are next to each other and between them have all the required resources. \u00A0An initial exploratory rover to pinpoint a landing site here is almost required, and it helps hugely if base vehicles are on wheels for fine tuning. \u00A0A \u0022remote miner\u0022 is extremely helpful in this instance as well - which features kontainers, a drill, electricity generation and not much else to sit in that foreign biome less than 150 metres away whilst the main base pulls resources to itself. \u00A0Very generally, the most important resources are Substrate, Minerals and MetallicOre. \u00A0If your base is advanced enough to have machinery generation, then you\u0027ll effectively want all raw materials available. \u00A0If you have a vessel that can mine remotely and then fly back - that\u0027s fine, but these should be for the less common resources (exotic minerals, rare metals, uraninite)\u003Cbr\u003E\n* Equatorial. \u00A0Assuming that you have return ships waiting in orbit to be refuelled or simply to be rendezvoused with, having your base near the equator can simplify this hugely as take offs can be done at any time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n* A nice view. \u00A0As examples -- my Ike base is at the south pole with Duna on the horizon ; My Vall base is equatorial with Jool on the horizon ; My Dres base is right by the big canyon;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* You can also try the World Stabiliser mod -
