That\u0027s shocking!\n\nWell, these were my early days of KSP. I didn\u0027t have many mods yet. I think I had MechJeb but I might not have.... I\u0027d found ModularFuelTanks (Real Fuels was just a set of configs for it back then) and a bunch of parts packs like KWR and some Bobcat parts. Real Chute didn\u0027t even exist back then, which really caused me problems with my Laythe rescue ship because after having a Kerbal clamber around the outside of this really tall tail lander perched on a 5% slope repacking chutes, loading up the refugees and then lifting off.... I discovered a bug in the stock chutes where launching the ship caused all the repacked chutes to immediately deploy. Hilarity ensued. And of course I had SAVED the game so they were all now saved in a repacked state ready to go off the instant I launched. Only the action group mod saved me by assigning each chute a \u0027cut\u0027 group so I could immediately cut them all."},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-21T17:45:33Z","Content":"Yes, the funny old days of KSP, where realism (or something similar to) was an utopia...
