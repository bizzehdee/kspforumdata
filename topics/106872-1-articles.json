You can run the engine for as long as the ore lasts, which with a class C is a very long time. \n\nI started burning with an intercepting class C well out from Kerbin and made an orbit after an hour or so.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ozw9n81cj9hemiw/Mini%20miner%20pusher%201.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ozw9n81cj9hemiw/Mini%20miner%20pusher%201.craft?dl=0)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T14:33:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 02:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T15:00:11Z","Content":"Genius idea, will have to try out!
