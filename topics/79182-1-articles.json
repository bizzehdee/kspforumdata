Do we know if such a contract exists? i.e. get such-and-such many kerbals in orbit with such and such amount of liquid fuel and a science lab and a bunch of docking ports and you get 500,000 and a 200,000 advance. Anything like that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been delaying taking the interplanetary exploration contracts in the hopes that at some point someone company or nationality on Kerbin might finance a space/refuelling station so that I can not waste too much of my funds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T17:08:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK, there are only contracts to test parts, explore planets, and rescue Kerbals. I have yet to see or hear of contracts to build stations, launch satellite networks, or anything else of practical value. I fully expect to see mods offering such contracts in the near future, however. In fact, the Station Science mod says such a feature is already in development for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mpk10","CreatedById":109917,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-23T18:56:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E I fully expect to see mods offering such contracts in the near future, however.
