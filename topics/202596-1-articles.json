Often times when playing around maneuver nodes you end up intersecting a body you don\u0027t want or getting too far for an encounter so apoapsis, ascending/nodes, intersections, nearest encounters often times disappear and when you fix it they\u0027re no longer highlighted so I need to right click them over and over again.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nShow entering \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E point of parenting body.

If you\u0027ve done many rescue missions in low kerbin orbit you probably have a whole bunch of stuff around there, that makes it pretty annoying to operate a ship as you try to add a maneuver node and instead it shows the dialog to switch to another object\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
