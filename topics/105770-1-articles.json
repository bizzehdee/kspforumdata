It\u0027s lining up all the rest of it that seems truly daunting to me, although RIC\u0027s link should be very helpful for that. Another way in which I thought perhaps a Munar assist might be helpful is in terms of giving you another place to make use of the Oberth effect. If you have a really low TWR, that might allow you to split your boost between Kerbin and Munar periapses and thus enhance efficiency. However I have no idea how much the Oberth effect helps you boosting from 6000m above the Mun vs. 70km above Kerbin.

Burning retrograde at apoapsis until you get a second encounter is one way to do it, though if you\u0027re lucky you can probably use Kerbin, Duna or maybe Dres. A second gravity assist from Eve should be enough to get you well beyond Jool\u0027s orbit, with a bit of luck you should be able to get an encounter with Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA formula for getting resonant orbits is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea1 = factor^2/3 * a0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea0 = semi-major axis of the body you\u0027re trying to achieve resonance with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea1 = semi-major axis of your orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd factor is the difference between your orbital periods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ET1 = T0 * factor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere T1 is your orbital period, and T0 is the orbital period of the body you\u0027re aiming for resonance with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESemi major axis can be worked out via:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea = (periapsis \u002B apoapsis \u002B 2 * radius of the body you\u0027re orbiting) / 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a 2:1 resonance you want your semi major axis to be roughly 1.59 * that of the body you\u0027re aiming for resonance with. I.E. your apoapsis should be close to 2.2 times your periapsis (your periapsis will be roughly equal to Eve\u0027s semi-major axis after a gravity assist).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t want exact resonance otherwise you\u0027ll have an encounter with Eve at the same place every time coming directly from behind it which makes gravity assist impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: An alternative to the retrograde burn at apoapsis is to perform a plane change at apoapsis before the second Eve encounter so that at your second encounter with Eve you\u0027ll either be coming from slightly above or below, and the gravity assist will work by cancelling your plane change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit2: I tried the plane change thing for Eve, it\u0027s not worth it, you\u0027re better off burning retrograde at apoapsis to lower your periapsis inside Eve\u0027s orbit so that your next encounter has enough of an angle for gravity assist to be useful, less dV, and makes it much easier to line up the encounter especially if you manage to get close to 2:1 resonance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T18:53:57Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 06:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by psyberduckling\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
