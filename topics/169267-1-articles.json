A few minutes ago my pc crashed and after restarting it my whole data was not reachable ingame. The only thing I see when i go to the menu to continue the game is a blank data file.

I\u00A0would create a new game and save it, then go to the files folder for the old game and copy your ships/backup and subassembly folders to the newly created game and to complete this resume the new game and then select load saved game select your last save and see if that works\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhope this helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJammer\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-06T14:57:15Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2018 02:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Jammer-TD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S0M3B0D4","CreatedById":184153,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-06T21:10:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did what u told me and I luckily have all my ships back.
