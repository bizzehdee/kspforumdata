You would need to use something like firespitter to do that. Even with that having multiple animated objects on a single part isn\u0027t the best idea. In reality you should separate each animated object into it\u0027s own part so they can each be used individually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis doesn\u0027t mean they have to each be their own physical part in KSP. They need to be separate in unity with their own animations. For instance, make 4 separate parts in blender with their own animations. Import all 4 parts into unity. Once in unity you can child them all to the same gameobject, as long as their animations all have different names. When you export that gameobject to KSP it will show up in game as a single part but you can reference each animation in the cfg separately and even call them simultaneously and it will work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-09T17:50:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2015 05:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T17:56:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eah thank you for the reply! yes I had thought multiple animations on one part was a no go but its just on one object ey? thats good news making multiple objects with multiple animations and combining them in unity is easy enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edon\u0027t suppose you know about calling on animations with modulescienceexperiment too? it would be so much simpler if the module just enabled you to call an animation by name to trigger on science experiment, but alas I have been learning over the last month that things never turn out quite that simple \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T18:04:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never tried it with the science module, but I know you can\u0027t do it with the generic animation module(and you can\u0027t add multiples of those to one part either).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T19:56:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eah fair enough, well thanks for the help! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I will have to make a test object and have a muck around seeing how things work I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eah hah! love it when you start researching something different and find something that might be the solution to your problem :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EDeployModuleIndex is the index of the animation module that opens your cargo bay.
