Pre-release updates were very likely to break mods, since anything could change at any time, and entire new systems were being added.

So I think some mods will slow down in updating, and some will not break after each update, but others always will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know with my parts pack, the main things that forced me to do updates were when they fixed the \u0022rescaleFactor\u0022 bug, or changed how SAS worked.
