A major thing is that KSP calculates how a certain part will respond to a physics interaction (like drag, thrust or impact) and how every other part will move and experience stress as a result of this certain part moving or turning-- like poking a puddle and causing a ripple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, I get very annoyed when a given craft\u0027s part count passes 100 and I consider KSP unplayable when total part count in physics range reaches 300. Some people have the patience to still play KSP when their \u0022frames per second\u0022 becomes \u0022seconds per frame\u0022 and wouldn\u0027t be troubled in your situation. If your station is doing too much (such as, it has lots of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E LS and MKS parts and all their converters are on) that will hurt you too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI assume you have lots of docked modules. These docked modules may likely have their own probe cores, batteries and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is bloat and should be replaced, as much as possible, with an orbital tug system (Only the tug will have the probe core, battery and (most of) the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E.), and all extra \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters removed when no longer needed. If you have lots of open/unpaired un-shielded docking ports, they will create their own special kind of lag. Those are always scanning for whether another docking port is near and about to connect to them. Shielded docking ports have the ability to stop that scanning. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E Konstruction contains welding docking ports-- docking ports that vanish and directly attach the nearest parts behind them to each other. It\u0027s massively useful for permanent orbital stations and helping to control part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a mod that lets you destroy parts and reclaim resources from them, make more use of that mod, and if possible, install and use OSE Workshop to build (and put into inventory) bigger, better versions of the weaker parts that you have been spamming. One large solar panel from the Near Future Solar mod will save you from spamming stock Gigantors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have lots of ladders (especially for aesthetic value) then definitely remove them. 99% of the time, there won\u0027t be a kerbal holding onto them, and when a kerbal is holding on, it will be to 1% of the total amount of ladder. That\u0027s also an enormous waste of CPU. Instead, have the kerbal carry a single ladder and a tool in their inventory. If the kerbal needs to hold onto a particular place while working, have them bolt the ladder on where needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith how long \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E has been around, it would surely be able to have stored parts not count so I think you\u0027re safe with many incredibly full containers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally: Just install an FPS counter app (I use the freeware \u0022FRAPS\u0022) or such a mod and watch how the numbers change.
