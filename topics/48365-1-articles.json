I don\u0027t have a picture, but it\u0027s basically the most powerful jet from the B9 pack, coupled with a intake at the front with a pod and small fuel tank between the two with and a few wingtips, as previously mentioned, to provide control. It tends to flip out on takeoff though, even though it\u0027s basically a rocket. Am I missing something or?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"karolk","CreatedById":26764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-14T15:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis should be moved to addon support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan you take a screenshot and upload it to imgur.com, then post the bb-code here?
