I am thinking about doing more missions that aren\u0027t tied to contracts. But how do you deal with the missions you do? Do you just use contracts to fund your other projects? Or do you only send missions where the contracts are?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-12T02:01:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of both.

Early on (Mun and Minmus, basically) I do whatever they ask me to do. If a juicy Minmus contract comes up and I haven\u0027t done much on Mun, I\u0027ll whip up a quick Minmus mission, I mean I\u0027m going there anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut by the time I\u0027m going interplanetary I\u0027ve usually got tons of money and science so it\u0027s more about what I want to do than what anybody else wants. At that point I\u0027ll only take Satellite contracts for places that still need some relays and contracts specifically for the place I want to go (usually governed by orbital mechanics).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The rocket exploder","CreatedById":208113,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-12T03:37:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually do both.

Typically, if you are waiting for a transfer window to another planet, you can do a lot of such time warps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually create multi-contract missions to the other planets. Only the special missions (e.g. Eve landing, Jool-5) are without contract. Those are difficult enough without having to do something special.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-12T13:31:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin addition to what others said, i like to make reusable stuff, so i can fulfill a contract and then go on a mission of my own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to make a mun landing but i\u0027m only paid for bringing tourists in mun orbit? i make a ship with two modules, in mun orbit i detach them, the tourists stay in orbit and the lander lands.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni want to make an eve probe but i\u0027m paid to put a satellite in orbit around minmus? i send the eve probe with plenty of extra fuel, i place it in minmus orbit to fulfill the contract, then i go on to eve\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nafter i unlocked \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E, that was magnified exponentially, because i could keep reusing my stuff infinitely. shortly after, i stopped playing the career as it was not challenging anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
