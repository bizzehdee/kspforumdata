Very likely *the* number one cause for structural failure, because it multiplies -rapidly- the effect of the forces that happen in high G maneuvers. Try to be conscious of how large of a lever there is between the wing (piece)\u0027s attachment point and the point where the game calculates dynamic pressure on it. If you succeed in keeping those small, your plane will survive longer.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nJoint elasticity. Yes, strength is important too, but from my experience it\u0027s near impossible to get kerbal joints strong enough on pure strength. Why does elasticity help? Because the angle of the veering wing (section) to the vector of aerodynamic forces can change just enough for it to stay within tolerance. Confucius say: the stalk that bows in the wind does not break. Otherwise stated: (auto)strut too much and it will shatter like porcelain.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLift area. When aiming for structurally sound planes in extreme maneuvers, you need to make a choice. Deliberately under-\u0027lift\u0027 your wing to keep lift area (and thus range of possible aerodynamic forces) low and outside ranges that would risk it. Or deliberately over-lift. So much lift area that when you do make a fast and/or large enough attitude change, it will -by design- slow down your plane fast enough before it goes past tolerances. There\u0027s a very risky corridor in between where too much speed for too long means gone with the wind.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point I apologize to Confucius for continually misquoting him. And I apologize to all those of you who have made an actual study and or job out of aerodynamics. I claim no expertise, merely experimentally derived practical knowledge of how the kerbal physics work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-08T15:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA more practical response perhaps.
