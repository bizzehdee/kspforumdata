However my point in this exercise is showing that even without a part rebalance, we can create a sensible tree that I think would be an enormous improvement over what we have. This is particularly true for the modded tree I\u0027m working on, since we\u0027ll actually be able to play it now with the parts we have. Certainly the tree could be even further improved with tweaked and supplemented parts, but I think it\u0027s too easy to get bogged down in thinking that if it\u0027s not perfect then there\u0027s no reason to do anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn #2, eh, I disagree. In reality it\u0027s actually a quite old technology and fairly simple -- it\u0027s not a nuclear reactor, just a device that uses the heat of radioactive decay to generate electricity. Gameplay wise, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s too overpowered for level 2 as it definitely has strong tradeoffs: it\u0027s heavy, expensive, and produces quite little electricity. I like giving people the option of seeing what they can do with that earlier rather than later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-02T22:47:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2015 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sherkaner\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-02T17:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s best to base the tree off the parts as they are now.
