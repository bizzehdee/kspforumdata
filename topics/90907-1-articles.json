If I\u0027m wrong, I apologize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see crews saved when building ships. For example, having 2 parts that have room for crew, getting ready to launch you want them in only one (but it defaults to the other, \u0022starting\u0022 pod). Set the crew and hit launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I forgot something, back to the VAB, fix it, and launch again. Well now the Kerbals have changed seats like a class of 3rd graders messing with a substitute teacher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt happens too when switching from part placement, to crew manager, back to part placement. And if you don\u0027t catch it right away it can have profound effects on a mission...or sanity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tetryds","CreatedById":50204,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T17:59:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was stated on recent weekly dev reports that this feature will come on the next version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will be as persistent as it can get, and only be cleaned when you delete the pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it seems that the persistency will even count if you copy the part with ALT\u002BLMB or place with simmetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-21T18:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo offence, but this gets suggested about every other week.
