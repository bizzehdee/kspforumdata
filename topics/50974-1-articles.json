My issue is that I cannot quicksave or return to the space center. I REALLY do not want to lose my work on my most recent landing, as the same thing has happened before and my save got sort of rolled back. When I try to click the Space Center button, it appears to be pressed, except does nothing. Doing an F5 quicksave does not show any signs of quicksaving either. Please help! I seriously do not want to do this entire flight over again for a third time! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T20:05:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA few things can cause this.
