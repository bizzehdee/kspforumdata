Ended up with 0.5L of RCS fuel(out of 5 budgeted for the descent, I removed all probe/command pod torque). This high usage was due to the lander being a little more un-centered as I designed it in the VAB and I lost all practical rotational control during the proceedings. It\u0027s back to the drawing board for now. I set my periapsis at 6km and about 5 degrees ahead of my target, I then tried to keep my time to touchdown(based on vertical speed and radar altitude) to the same amount of time it would take to burn off all my horizontal speed. It\u0027s worked quite well so far as I landed with an additional 336m/s dV still in the lander\u0027s tank right in the center of my target crater( I aimed for the edge though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JpyqBiR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022JpyqBiR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*PS Ignore the Aerozine.

This means that Earth will complete 0.6195 of a full rotation. Given that there are 360 degrees latitude, that means that if you burn at 0 degrees, when you reach apoapsis 223.02 degrees latitude will be under your periapsis. Since apoapsis is on the other side of the planet, 43.02 degrees latitude will be under your apoapsis. If you set your periapsis to be higher, then it will take longer to reach apoapsis, which means that Earth will rotate more. So your answer is that you\u0027ll probably end up somewhere around 43 - 50 degrees east of your periapsis burn location.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kass","CreatedById":91615,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T22:27:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Nathan.

Amazing mod btw. This is my all time favourite mod without a doubt. I literally haven\u0027t played stock since this came out. Makes the game a real challenge again.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve encountered what may be some kind of bug/ problem? When using Kerbal alarm clock and/ or protractor, it seems those mods no longer recognise some of the adjusted planets and moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, I want to set an alarm for the next transfer window to Laythe. That planet is no longer recognised as even existing any more. Same for all moons except The Mun. Protractor does exactly the same and those planets and moons no longer show in the the list to allow me when to calculate burns. Mechjeb still recognises them however so one can use mechjeb to get to those if one so desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure where the problem lies but just a FYI \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the problem there is that some of those planetary bodies had different parents before. Additionally, Alarm Clock uses (IIRC) 100 years of precalculated data which RSS invalidates. (or rather, the data is only valid for the Kerbol star system, not Sol)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027 know about Protractor having any major issues. I have used it to make transfers in RSS so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s using any data tables such as KAC does.... but it\u0027s not by itself accurate enough either. What I do is I use it to calculate my ejection burn. Once that\u0027s done and I\u0027m out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I target the planet and bring up a Target info window (I don\u0027t think MJ has it by default, I think I had to make it with the custom window editor) and find out the time of my closest approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might have to play with this part a bit... sometimes you really don\u0027t have to do anything but tell MJ to fine tune your approach. If it complains (yellow text...) then I abort the course correction. (do not have auto-warp on for any of this until you\u0027re sure that you\u0027re sure.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf fine tune failed me then I use the \u0027Intercept Target...\u0027 option. The one that lets you define how long after the burn you actually intercept. (default is 0s but you may want to schedule the burn for later, I\u0027ll assume you already know when you want to make these kinds of burns). The real question is the \u0027how long after burn\u0027 part. I use the time of my closest approach as a starting point and if I don\u0027t like the numbers I play with either the intercept time or the burn time. One caveat with this approach is that MJ might do something foolish and try to put you into a retrograde orbit around Kerbol because it apparently thinks you\u0027re piloting a warp driven starship...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne possibility might be to use the Rendezvous Autopilot but it really has no concept of time and it basically assumes you\u0027ve got lots of fuel to spare and lots of time. It might be ok in stock KSP but RSS could trip it up. But it might be worth trying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thesonicgalaxy","CreatedById":71406,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T00:49:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022metaphor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022metaphor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EApparently there was a new patch to that mod yesterday. But the config file is still called cloudLayers.cfg and it seems to be in the same format so I\u0027m not sure what the problem is.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new GUI has a reset feature now, so it creates a new config file called usercloudlayers.cfg when you make changes. You\u0027ll need to update it and give me the usercloudlayer config. But don\u0027t rush, i can wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna know the exact problem i\u0027m having, the clouds are not changing at all. Nothing is changing so....it would be nice if you could update it. Trying not to sound forcey or anything, but it would be really nice if you could update it as soon as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
