For the unknowing, these use a freewheeling rotor to generate lift by airflow going through the rotor from below. It turns out that KSP\u0027s lift/drag model is absolutely up to the task of making one of these work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is required is a slightly backward-raked helicopter rotor that will begin to turn due to the force of air hitting the blades. They need to be angled such that the forward-moving side is producing conventional aerodynamic lift, i.e. is near level, while the rear-ward moving side is pitched to generate greater drag, like a pitched-down elevator, which provides some lift as well as the drag force that drives the rotor around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried a long time today to make a stock autogyro, and in the end I failed because my skills with making stock roller bearings are, well, not. However, I know that others have made stock bearings that are perfectly adequate to operate a lifting rotor - all stock choppers have one!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here\u0027s a showcase/proof of concept using mod parts from the KAX mod to make up for my lack of bearing ability.

Offset the cargo bay bearing box up, added 30 degrees of rotation to the mast, -15 degrees to the blades. And yes, holy crap, it works a dream while you\u0027re on the ground. Beautiful. But of course, once airborne... Wants to backflip. But thinking about, I suppose it just involves experimentation to find the angles that give you enough airflow to spin, yet don\u0027t lead to asymmetric lift and don\u0027t induce massive backflips. This is definitively cleaner than the road I was going down. And I would never have gone to such \u0022extreme\u0022 angles on the mast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever... Before I\u0027d read your reply and tried it, I did manage to kludge one into being by going down the \u0022camshaft lobe\u0022 style route that would allow a flapping rotor blade. I only got as far as adding freewheeling bearings to the rotor blades, but it works. There is a lot of flap in the blades and it ain\u0027t pretty (to be fair, I don\u0027t think helicopter flight when you see the blades flap can ever be described as pretty...), nor optimal... But she flies, and is relatively stable. Although disc needs more spin. I suppose this is a cheating autogyro...

Most of the time there were blades hitting the ground, uncontrollable rolling or pitching while accelerating ... I think decreasing blade angle would help for spinning up. Coaxial would certainly help. I made a version with a long tail with a reaction wheel, and placed wide side wheels. Still no success. It has potential, in the mean time I think I\u0027ll stick with normal helicopters :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-30T12:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm interesting.
