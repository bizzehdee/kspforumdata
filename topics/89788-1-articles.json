However, not all the exception messages that appear in the log cause issues, some are caught by the code that causes them and the exception printed without any bad effect. I believe that the Clouds one is one of these as it shows up all the time (and is quite annoying when searching for \u0022bad\u0022 exceptions). The output_log.txt file should include a call stack after the exception message which should indicate exactly which bit of code in which mod (or in the core of KSP) is throwing the exception.
