I\u0027d like to pause the game at this point to make sure at least one option is selected so I don\u0027t have to check that condition everywhere else in my code. Is it possible to pause the game and how would I do it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T03:43:34Z","Content":"I\u0027m not 100% sure, but I\u0027d check the GameEvent class for a pause/unpause event, or the HighLogic class for a pause game status.\n\nCheck the TimeWarp class to see if time is passing or not might \u0022work\u0022, but it would be pretty hacky.\n\nD."},{"CreatedByName":"MrHappyFace","CreatedById":76365,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T06:27:16Z","Content":"If you need to pause in the flight scene, just do this: \n\n    FlightDriver.SetPause(true or false);\n\nHowever, It seems you want to make sure that an option is selected from a GUI before allowing the player to continue, which can be accomplished without pausing.\n\nSimply use an InputLock, like so:\n\n    InputLockManager.SetControlLock(ControlTypes.All, \u0022YourUniqueLockName\u0022);\n\nThen, when an option is selected, and you want to restore user control, just remove the input lock, like so:\n\n    InputLockManager.RemoveControlLock(\u0022YourUniqueLockName\u0022);\n\nAlso, the ControlTypes enum works like a Bitmask, so choosing multiple ControlTypes is possible using the | operator.\n\nI\u0027m assuming that the option-choosing GUI will pop up when the space center loads, correct me if I\u0027m wrong."}]}
