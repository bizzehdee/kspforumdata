As GreenWolf already said, we can measure the Big Bang and can thereby show that it actually happened. The \u0022moment before the big bang\u0022 doesn\u0027t exist, because with the big bang, time started (I\u0027m not entirely sure on this, people that know more about this, please correct me). Without time, there can\u0027t be a moment, so if there\u0027s a moment in which time started, there isn\u0027t a moment before that moment. While the concept of no time existing before the big bang may seem to contradict common sense or something, as far as I know, that\u0027s what happened.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jeb.","CreatedById":104516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:22:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GreenWolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GreenWolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBecause it\u0027s a stupid question.
