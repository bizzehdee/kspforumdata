I won\u0027t blame you if you can\u0027t get it into orbit, mainly because the craft is an early prototype and still in development. It\u0027s tough even for me to handle. The small radial engines are for balance in a vacuum because the weight of the third jet engine causes the plane to pitch down.

I expanded the generator count on the craft to accommodate this as well, which adds weight, which requires more thrust/fuel, and so on. It\u0027s pretty slow and requires a lot of electricity (which is why I also added a pair of solar panels to the nose spars), but helps add some insurance against the \u0022oh crap, I\u0027ve botched the flight profile and now I\u0027m out of fuel just before circularization\u0022 situation that has happened often enough to be considered a regular thing now. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still loving the heck out of this, though. Just added some nav lights and a couple of strobes to make it that much more fun to fly around the station and other orbiting vessels. It has already saved the life of one kerbal who was stranded when his vessel flew apart at near light speed (bug related to MechJeb, I think). I love that it can get around so quickly, especially since the primary rockets were upgraded.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfinityArch","CreatedById":66832,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T23:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm...How do you think this would perform if the jet engines were replaced with electric firespitter props for use on Duna?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T01:57:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably not all that well, since you\u0027d have to get the ship into Kerbin orbit first, and the props won\u0027t get your initial velocity up high enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes make me wonder how those props would actually behave on Duna anyway.
