However my question is, could the Portuguese Man Of War become proof of many organisms becoming one, new organism? It is believed that mitochondria were once an independent bacteria that became part of cells when they realized survival and reproduction were more likely as part of a cell than alone. \n\n[http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/organelles/](http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/organelles/)\n\nThe Portuguese Man Of War seems to be working in the same way. With multiple organisms working together because survival and reproduction are more likely. Could in the next 50-100 years could we start seeing whole Portuguese Man Of Wars being born instead of the cluster that we see today (my estimate may be off but I am no biologist ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) )"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T16:26:37Z","Content":"It seems you think these colonies are a collection of separate individuals of various species that come together - I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the case: [http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=28025.0](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/forum/index.php?topic=28025.0)\n\nIt seems they\u0027re born as a kind of larva which buds off the other specialized individuals.

There are different forms, they all depend on each other, and they are all the same species.\n\nThere\u0027s a large grey area in terms of where you draw the line between a collection of single celled organisms working together, and a \u0022true\u0022 multicellular organism.\n\nLikewise... while we don\u0027t currently recongize any multi-organism-superorganisms... one could imagine a grey area too.\n\nThe individuals are to the superorganism what cells are to multicellular organisms.\n\nThe man-o-war would be one candidate for such an organism.\n\nHymenoptera colonies would be another.\n\nCorrals would be another\n\nHuman tribes, clans, nations, civilizations, etc would be another\n\n...\n\nand so on\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell\n\nThey are also (in multicellular organisms) involed in the immune response, in apoptosis, and are the site of Fe-S cluster formation.\n\nThey also play a role in branched chain amino acid synthesis.\n\nIts quite an oversimplification to say they are just the powerhouse (ie ATP source).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E they realized survival and reproduction were more likely as part of a cell than alone.\n\nThey didn\u0027t realize anything.\n\nFirst, they are most closely related to alpha proteobacteria that are parasitic.\n\nThey were likely invading cells long before becoming mitochondria.\n\nWhat likely happened, was that they evolved ot be rather benign (too virulent, and you kill your hosts too quickly... much like the selection pressure for lambda phage... and a lot of viruses that are persistant, but not lethal).\n\nAnd if you\u0027re going to be a long term parasite of your host (much like mycoplasma today), if your host does better, so do you.\n\nWhat we\u0027ve got, is a parasite that evolved to be more and more benign, to the point it became beneficial.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-11T17:30:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/11/2015 05:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KerikBalm**"}]}
