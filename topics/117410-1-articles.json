It seems no matter what angle I do my Mk16-XL parachutes keep burning up upon reentry to Kerbal. I just did a mission with just the 3 seat command capsule and the parachute on top and it burned up again. How are you supposed to re-enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and not lose parachutes?\n\n\\*\\*let me be more specific: the parachute is not \u0027burning up\u0027. I get no heat meter or whatever upon reentry and it doesn\u0027t explode. Everything looks fine until I try to deploy it and then it tells me that the chute was damaged due to heat and aero forces.\\*\\*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T18:15:06Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SickSix**\n  \ndetails added."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T18:00:53Z","Content":"Don\u0027t deploy till your speed is below 250 m/s.\n\nIf you right click on the parachute you can see if it is safe to deploy or not.\n\n[This mod should be stock](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/129154), but it isn\u0027t.\n\nIf you aren\u0027t getting below 250 m/s in time, try coming in more shallow (Pe at around 40k should come in just fine).

They can be deployed at 290 m/s to get you slowed down enough for the mains. You can also use the new A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E. part, or the good old fashioned method of just saving some fuel and using the engines.\n\nYou could also use strategically placed sepatrons to shave off some speed, or if you like to use the Launch Escape System, don\u0027t jettison it. Keep it around to slow you down.\n\nThe point is, you have options.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T18:22:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 06:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T18:54:11Z","Content":"I opened drogue chutes at nearly 700m/s. 600m/s is safe for Kerbin\n\nNote : for Duna, regular chutes are safe ate nearly 800m/s"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T18:58:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I opened drogue chutes at nearly 700m/s. 600m/s is safe for Kerbin\n\u003E Note : for Duna, regular chutes are safe ate nearly 800m/s\n\nOh really?
