Or possibly even seen, so I figured I\u0027d come ask the same things here. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions about what to do about big parts not being moveable in EVA. I currently have 3 \u0022Skylab\u0022 style MPL\u0027s from the stockalike station parts mod built like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Yp1RxD5.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Yp1RxD5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I\u0027m trying to join the one orbiting Kerbin to my main station but am encountering problems.

I want to remove all the extraneous parts -solars, heatsinks, etc- , slap a construction port on the end, and attach it to the other ports already on the station at that 6-way junction. As this is my first time in 1.12.3, I of course didn\u0027t read the directions and have found out the 2.5m parts can\u0027t be moved or something? I tried to temporarily\u00A0 move one of the 6-way\u0027s construction ports to the lab, but despite having 5 Kerbs around it to offset the weight req\u0027s but it won\u0027t detach, and I can\u0027t send up another docking port as they are too big for ship storage inventories apparently. My poor old PC doesn\u0027t like having 954978923 mods installed, so I\u0027m trying to keep the mod count down, but are there any mods that remove the weight limitations on parts? I used to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E wayyyy back when...are they compatible with vanilla EVA cargo/construction? And does \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E up the weight limit for EVA work? Or better yet, (and this would be my preferred solution) I\u0027ve monkeyed with the part configs before, is there something that I can change there to make the part moveable? All I want to do is pop off the conical adapter and docking port on the near end and put a Construction Port Sr on it but can\u0027t. My station construction has ground to a halt until I find the solution, but I\u0027m stumped my dudes, any help is appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stamp20","CreatedById":202020,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-11T17:00:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E is completely separate from stock EVA construction, and its mass limit is 1 ton per kerbal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can install Kerbal Inventory for All which makes every part valid for EVA construction, then use the debug menu to disable the mass limit under the Kerbals category.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MSE","CreatedById":219224,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-12T00:28:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!
