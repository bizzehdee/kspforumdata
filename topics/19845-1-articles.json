Since installing 0.17 and the appropriate new version of MechJeb, I\u0027m having a problem with the new orbital operations for the various planets. Basically, when the MechJeb drops out of warp to do the insertion burn, my ship disassembles. It doesn\u0027t explode, it just...falls apart and makes the staging sound. Fuel tanks separate from each other, etc... It does not occur on ascent when warping to apoapsis, or when I abort the warp...only when MechJeb takes over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ferrin","CreatedById":41837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T15:52:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is actually caused from the fast change in warp speeds.

Unfortunately, it\u0027s usually moving parts like vector capable engines.
