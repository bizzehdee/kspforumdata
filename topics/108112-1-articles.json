I saw a lot of persons who gave up recently complaining because this is too hard, I got an idea to help us and maybe it is the little thing the game need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe test room:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew building where you can put your new design or just a stage and apply different stresses to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lvl 1 : aero stress simulation up to xx parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lvl 2 : heat stress simulation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Lvl 3 : unlimited parts, vacuum and different atmospheres test\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I think is the most usefull is that could show you with colors and replays with differents speeds where the highest stress is apply, if the design is stable in particuliar conditions and what part make trouble. It could be much intuitive and clear to \u0022learn\u0022 the game mechanics wich I think actually is the most difficult part and the learning curve is unfriendly. You can see plenty videos but your designs still don\u0027t work, sometimes you don\u0027t know why and it could leave you just frustrated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
