I\u0027ve posted this elsewhere but I think this fits here as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a dream a long time ago where I was on board the International Space Station. I know it was a realistic representation because it had Kibo and that little odd cylinder that sticks out of Kibo...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I was sitting in the Cupola, strumming the guitar that\u0027s up there, staring out at the Earth below, with my crush sitting there with me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI couldn\u0027t remember the rest of it, but even just that is the happiest dream I\u0027ve ever had. So happy, in fact, that I was unable to will myself to come out of it. I wanted to stay in bed all day and relive what I could. I wanted to go there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is why I got out of bed a few minutes before school started, didn\u0027t have breakfast, and just barely didn\u0027t make it to class on time, meaning I had a detention (I don\u0027t usually get those, everyone was wondering what I was doing in the detention room) and I then proceeded to have the worst day I\u0027ve ever had in my life. Not because of any huge reason, but the dozens and dozens of small reasons piling on top of each other, over and over, and over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat night I had another epic dream. This time it was me with my friends, who were actually being good friends. We were happy, involved, and exploring a gigantic old warehouse full of secrets at every turn in a dramatic hilly green landscape.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I woke up again, out of the second most wonderful dream I had, and went to school again. I had a slightly better day than the last, but it was still pretty bad for various reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next night I had another dream. I do not remember a single moment of it. But I woke up with that feeling - the feeling where you know you just had an amazingly epic and amazing dream. The feeling was stronger than ever before, leading me to think that had I remembered it, it would have been the best dream I have ever had.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd then I had another bad day.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wish I could just go back into my dreams forever.

You\u0027re still young, and you still have decades of opportunity to live through your dreams. Seeing life as imperfect is not a sign that you should strive to move away from it. Live to change it, to improve it. If you see something you don\u0027t like it, if you experience or go through something that makes you feel cheated, then don\u0027t let it go.
