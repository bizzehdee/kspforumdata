I would say roughly half the time ive noticed something going slightly wrong and had to manually correct when landing with mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jgkamat","CreatedById":62575,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T05:03:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is how I land (without mechjeb (with mechjeb you can just use the landing autopilot))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eenable normal ASAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurn on thrust to full\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to map\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait until the two points of the orbit arc are close as possible (or until they start to drift apart)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint retrograde again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFire thrust to slow yourself down, make sure to keep yourself retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand at 12m/s or less\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding without mechjeb is so much more fun/rewarding than with mechjeb, I suggest you try it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to change your navball to a surface refrerence frame, you can just click on the \u0022orbit\u0022 name above it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nostur","CreatedById":10400,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T07:16:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI do most of my maneuvres by hand, however mechjeb is handy because of Smart A.S.S. and to make last-sec corrections.

You DO have some degree of control over how you go about your landing. You can burn at low throttle for longer earlier on, so that if need be you have the juice to slam on the brakes later so to speak. Mostly just do lots of little burns to tweak your landing while you are coming in. An ASAS is vital in this respect, to keep a heading steady.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to landing in atmosphere though, the only way to learn how much your trajectory is going to change is to make so many landings you just know where to aim. There are not nice tools to do it by hand really. By the point you are using calculators to help plan the landing, you might as well just give mechjeb control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dcon930","CreatedById":112511,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T04:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb helps you learn how to play the game.
