Because the longer the time you go on high velocity, the further you go. But the differences come with the limitations of the engines and fuels. You can\u0027t get as fast as you want in a given time span. It\u0027s about balancing between a long, steady acceleration to a high velocity or a short burst to lower velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo illustrate this i made the first two figures below. Each showing the velocity curve of two different rocket configurations. The blue rocket takes a lot longer to accelerate and the burnout is ~1000sec, but the maximum velocity is higher. On the other hand, the red rocket only needs about half of the time to reach max speed, but has a lower end velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe area under the curves is the corresponding travel distance - and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ethat\u003C/span\u003E is what we want to maximize. So lets take a look at the two graphs: The first one goes up to an hour (3600s) where the area under the blue curve is greater than the area under the red curve. In the second picture, with 15min (900s) to go, the result is inverted and the area under the blue curve smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo go even further, intelligent staging is the key. The third picture shows the blue rocket again and a larger black rocket with a second stage added to the blue rocket. It takes the maximal velocity up by ~5000m/s, just by using a (quite larger) second stage to generate some more dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Salda007","CreatedById":3432,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-04T03:36:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E23,463 km, stock parts only.
