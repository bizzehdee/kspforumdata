If it is ok, I will write another. Now keep in mind That I have never even attempted this so I may not be the best. Also, Be aware that I will try to make my rockets realistic, but sometimes I will fail at that. I will also use the rules I make up. If I say that I am not allowed to do something, I wont do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I use mods, I will post them below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods used so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprocedural fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadish command pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter 1\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One day, Jebediah saw an ad in the newspaper saying \u0022astronauts wanted\u0022 he read on and discovered that the Kerbal Aeronautics and Space program (K.A.S.P) was hiring astronauts to fly the first rocket ever built, the zen 1. He ran over to Bill and Bobs house and told them that K.A.S.P was hiring (All 3 of them were pilots). Bill and Bob were not as enthusiastic about joining but Jeb had the convinced that they would love it, so they all signed up to be enlisted. After a week or so of testing their skills, K.A.S.P offered Jeb, Bill, and Bob a position as astronauts. Jeb was chosen to fly the first rocket, Zen 1.

He asked if he could go to the mun and, after long and hard thinking, K.A.S.P allowed him to go. But, they said that he had to go with Rodney Kerman. The first rocket of the new series Atan was made. The first Atan rocket was actually special because, once in orbit around the mun, a kethane probe is released and will scan for kethane on the mun as the Atan lander lands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/OuMap\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
