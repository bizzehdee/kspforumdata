Unfortunately, I have not seen even a single launch of a rocket, and this fact brings me great mental pain and sadness. I cannot do anything but admire and wonder at the accomplishment of seeing not only a single launch, but an entire series of very different launches. I was not even living on this Earth when the Apollo and Skylab rockets were launched, and whilst I was around during the Shuttle era, I was and am still too young to purchase an aeroplane fare and travel to Cape Canaveral to see a launch. I can only hope that I may be able to travel to Baikonur and see a Russian spacecraft launch or that private ventures such as Orbital Sciences or SpaceX will have advanced enough so that a regular schedule of launches is established.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESincerely,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Mr. Flymetothemun\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Katojana","CreatedById":100060,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T06:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esee a rocket launch? i want to be the rocket. that sounded a little far fetched, what i mean by is i want to stand next to it before it launches, therefore, becoming the rocket, and yes, it would be right before i die \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
