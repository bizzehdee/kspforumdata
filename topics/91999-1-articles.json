I think kerbonauts are a little shy lol. It\u0027s a nice craft and we\u0027ll designed but when practicality comes into the equation; why would we need 50 kerbals in low Kerbin orbit? This craft would probably be more popular if those crew fuselage were cargo bays or perhaps extra fuel tanks. Then maybe adding a few nuclear engines. It\u0027s basically everyone\u0027s goal to make a Laythe SSTO as they are difficult to construct, however doing so may get you a bit of praise and some downloads \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeptun","CreatedById":131282,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-08T10:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis looks amazing! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t tried it out yet but wow, it looks fantastic and I\u0027ll take your word on it for now that it also flies good! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try using this for bringing the full population of a station in one go \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love the holes in the wings too, it gives it a cool futuristic sci-fi feel.
