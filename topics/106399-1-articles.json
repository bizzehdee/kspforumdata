Because the capsule itself is out of batteries, I have no capability to correct after I jettison the service module. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only things attached to the pod are a heat shield, a parachute, and an antenna. I initially thought the antenna was the source of the issue, as it\u0027s the only part offset from the center of mass, but the tilt is 90 degrees from from the location of the antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any ideas as to what might be causing this?
