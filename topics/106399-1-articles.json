Because the capsule itself is out of batteries, I have no capability to correct after I jettison the service module. \n\nThe only things attached to the pod are a heat shield, a parachute, and an antenna. I initially thought the antenna was the source of the issue, as it\u0027s the only part offset from the center of mass, but the tilt is 90 degrees from from the location of the antenna.\n\nAnyone have any ideas as to what might be causing this? Or how I can bring my ship home safely?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T04:36:58Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 04:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spenzor**"},{"CreatedByName":"Louella","CreatedById":89561,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:52:29Z","Content":"you could try the \u0022stock bug fix\u0022 mod, it mentions something about capsules and heat shields tilting:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-0-27-Apr-15%29-Misc-Utilities-%2818-Jan-15%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-0-27-Apr-15%29-Misc-Utilities-%2818-Jan-15%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:53:55Z","Content":"The problem is caused by the heat shield having no mass but aerodynamic drag.\n\nThere has been quite a few discussion about it recently and a bugfix has been made.\n\nJust search a little about it in the forums and you will find a solution easily."},{"CreatedByName":"Thahat","CreatedById":100130,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:54:21Z","Content":"its the heatshield. those are currently buggy and put their weight in the wrong place. some forum members have already found a fix you can do. either via module manager patch or the modification of a part file. dont have it on hand cause im on my phone in the bed but it has been posted on this forum numerous times by now"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:55:28Z","Content":"I happen to have a thread about exactly this, with a simple solution on the first post. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117279-How-to-fix-those-heatshields%21-%28get-rid-of-command-pod-flipping-into-the-heat%21%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117279-How-to-fix-those-heatshields%21-%28get-rid-of-command-pod-flipping-into-the-heat%21%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"Spenzor","CreatedById":103399,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T04:36:46Z","Content":"Thanks, guys!
