Gives me only a small white dot.\n\nWill have to sign up to github, but will gladly do it help you out in the future as well.\n\nCheers, and many thanks for your time. Appreciate the swift response.\n\nEdit: [@blackrack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104258-blackrack/) I never used github like that and will have to read into it and such. Might take me a while, dont think I can tackle this one tonight.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-21T21:23:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2019 09:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Dafni**"}]}
