If that is not sufficient in that case, you would have to add your own PartModule. It might be enough to query the ModuleGimbal, read its gimbalAngle-fields and animate your stuff accordingly. In the worst case, you would have to create your own gimbal module, like done \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45303-gimbals-and-transforms\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PrivateFlip","CreatedById":68273,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T18:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-0-20-Last-updated-17-06-13\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis thread\u003C/a\u003E has a couple of links in the first post which might help you out\n"}]}
