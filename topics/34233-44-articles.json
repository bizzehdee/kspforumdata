Any weak point compromises the armor shell. The Vanguard has a super weak point in the armor right next to its engine array, I\u0027m talking about the 4 white aerospace wings that give the armor its angle. The 2x2 structural panel has an impact velocity of 80m/s, the wing is something like 8m/s. Any hit to that from anything stronger than a naked decoupler will strip the battle cruiser of a quarter of its armor shell. Every outer and structural part of your armor shell needs to have an impact tolerance of 80m/s. Which leads me to my next tip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Make the exposed armor as small as possible to limit damage. The Vanguard has 4 large sections of armor that protect the bulk of its hull, but any hit to the above mentioned weak spot strips the vessel of a quarter of its armor. But it is worse than that: because the \u0022section\u0022 is so large any hit that defeats the armor will also break off every piece forward on that section! To limit collateral damage to the armor shell, join as few pieces as possible together so a strike can only make a small, nigh untargetable hole two or at worst three panels wide. Anchor the panels to protected girders (or expose them and trust that their smaller surface area will evade hits) in small groups to limit damage. Speaking of size...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Smaller vessels are harder to hit; seriously, this cannot be overstated. Your armor shell will survive 100% of the shots that don\u0027t hit it. I admonish you to make your vessel as small as possible to achieve its mission for a variety of reasons: smaller ships are more accurate with weapons fire as they turn faster to track targets, accelerate faster, shorter stacks of ammunition \u0022sway\u0022 much less than deep magazines of larger vessels, and most importantly present a small crossection to incoming fire. But making a small vessel won\u0027t help much if you forget this next tip...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Use weapons as reactive armor by placing them outside your armor shell. You will use less parts by armoring everything except the weapons, \u003Cem\u003Eeven if you double the number of ammunition stacks\u003C/em\u003E. The Vanguard armors its side SRB stacks, and uses over fifty additional parts to armor them. A better use of parts would be to only armor the central fuel tanks and command pod (and engine array, can\u0027t forget that), and mount two more stacks of ammunition above and below, and use 25 less parts. Having a large volume of ammunition encircling the hull acts as an extra layer of armor, which instead of guarding an empty void can be shot at something you want to go away. This is an important facet of...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Longer range barrages favor the vessel with the most ammunition. In space, ammunition is precious commodity second only to fuel, and not a thing which would be wasted. We want every salvo to not only hit, but at the very least mission kill the intended target. Even if the first salvo connects, rarely will it do the latter. If a vessel can turn and either accelerate or still has usable ordinance it is a threat of the highest order and cannot be ignored. It is so important to have enough ammunition to eliminate a hostile vessel. But deep magazines also have another benefit: you can choose to fire off shots further out and hope to disable your target from a great enough distance that it cannot accurately return fire, remember tip 3? Long range fire is also more destructive; rockets need enough distance to accelerate to a velocity sufficient to defeat armor. As long as we are talking about ammunition, don\u0027t forget about this next tip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. There are only two types of armor, neither of which will stop a SRB. Everything bigger than an SRB is overkilling the overkill and eating up part count. The minimum number of parts for a reloadable SRB is 4 (clamp-o-tron, blue stack separator, small SRB, clamp-o-tron; you can save parts by making \u0022clips\u0022 of two or four SRBs with a clamp-o-tron at each end and blue stack separators between them, but the \u0022inner\u0022 salvo will overheated and explode around ~1.5km. A 1x1 structural panel will prevent the over heat and still take up less space, but it uses the same number of parts), and it will consistently defeat a stack of 5 2x2 armor plate each spaced apart form each other, albeit inconsistantly (sometime all 5 are toast, sometimes the third and fourth, but that was with crazy spacing, it universally defeated a close laminate of 5 2x2 at 100m. My ship tests, where I wheeled an armored ship off the run-way and shot at it, gave interesting results: an SRB will defeat the first section of armor it passes through and what ever is under it out to ~300m, where it will then blow though the entire ship and leave a neat hole (remember tip 2?). I stopped testing after 5 because by then it was far too unrealisticly heavy to mount on a ship, as well as driving part count through the roof. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, an SRB is totally overkill, a military weapon designed to defeat plate armor, which will resist any lesser weapon, but that doesn\u0027t mean lesser weapons don\u0027t have their place. The best \u0022light\u0022 weapon I\u0027ve tested is a little three part 1m grey decoupler with two separatrons radialy mounted at 5\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E, 3 very light parts that can pop unarmored fuel tanks, with a chance to knock off aerospace armor, which can be defeated by a pocket I-beam propelled by 2 seperatrons. The reason I prefer the decoupler over the I-beam is that it weighs less and uses less parts to make a relodable clip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGuided munitions get their own paragraph. I am not a fan of guided munitions, personally I suck at getting them to impact a target, technologically I refuse to put probes stuff that I cannot allow to be hacked/jammed, physically they present a huge advantage to a local maneuvering defender who gets to enjoy a operational delay equal to twice my distance to them (light speed lag, them to the wewpon, the weapon to me, me back to the weapon), and they are the only way to get orbital mines to work (but which won\u0027t work in KSP because the physics load distance is 2.5km and the minimum velocity of vessels in opposite LEO is 5.2km/s, you will just never connect outside of Mech-Jeb and copious amounts of prayer). That said, probes are proof that forewarned is forearmed, especially if you can slam that probe into your enemy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Don\u0027t think that I\u0027m ragging on the Vanguard. We stand on the shoulders of giants, and would not progress if nothing came before.
