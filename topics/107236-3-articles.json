Or does getting a surface sample count? Another line that anyone could argue is true or untrue to their heart\u0027s content. Argue that they shouldn\u0027t be advertising it this way and someone is certain to come along and point out a bunch of good marketing reasons. Propose a better way to state what you can do and someone else will come along to give you another bunch of evidence demonstrating how difficult it is to do this kind of promotion, how expectations operate in marketing yada yada, etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you take things literally like this, all that\u0027s left is circular logic and infinite strings of nonsense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u0022Procedural Terrain delivers detailed terrain at a vast scale.

Vastness means nothing these days - the Minecraft engine delivers more detail per square unit of surface if one wanted to compare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could go on from here, but I think it\u0027s pretty clear that if we were to take any of this literally enough, then we can go on complaining ad infinitum that we\u0027re not getting our money\u0027s worth (the most disgusting of arguments ever conceived).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want an accurate simulator, KSP, or any game, will never be enough. Ever. I don\u0027t think people realize that accurate simulation software tends to operate very very far from real-time and still has massive inaccuracies when the algorithm used is applied to situations it isn\u0027t accurate for. Take a look at various orbital simulations and what algorithms they use and what criticism they come with. Materials, statics, thermodynamics, chemistry etc. we could go on forever and slap in the most insane simulation libraries to get an incredibly accurate game but it would require a few supercomputers to run at 30fps and people would \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Estill come up with reasons why it\u0027s unsatisfactory\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E and you know it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, when you buy KSP, are you really, \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E under the impression you\u0027re buying a simulator? It\u0027s on Steam and has little green men for crying out loud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, these complaints make so little sense when the same players have accepted a solar system as small as the game\u0027s but with a lot of real values turning everything extremely dense, when we are still working with SOI-based gravity (not even N-body, which is quite basic in orbital simulators), when there are no robotic parts, no sloshing of fuel, we get science from being landed on the launch pad, no life support systems, no telescope science, no comms delay, no preprogrammed probes and very little automation etc. etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI saw someone argue on another thread that they have to learn a new physics system every few weeks, which is a ridiculous statement, but it shows very well what the kind of mentality that goes with these complaints is. In all, the game is the same it always was but better - if you ever had a reason to play it, now you have more. If it was unsatisfactory before, due to physics inaccuracy, it will always be. There\u0027s a difference between constructive criticism and suggestions, versus this mindless whining about \u0022Squad should never have released an unfinished game\u0022 and \u0022I was promised a simulator\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone, truly and honestly raise their hand and claim they feel cheated out of their money for KSP as of 1.02?
