Because it causes a lot of stress to the vehicle. You don\u0027t slow down your interplanetary mothership by sending it into an atmosphere, you slow it down using engines or gravity (hard to do in KSP because everything\u0027s so ~tiny~). Since I personally would never risk a massive transfer tug and its delicate systems by sending it into a planet\u0027s atmosphere, I have no real problem playing on increased heat settings.\nE: Yes, I realize certain novelists have written this and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s impossible IRL, but it also relies on bare skimming of the atmosphere and using the gravity of the planet as opposed to the aerobraking we do in KSP, which dives ridiculously deep into an atmosphere (because everything is so ~tiny~).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T19:17:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:26:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E One of the great things about KSP is being a member of a community--Being able to share crafts, diagnose each other\u0027s problems, etc. If everyone is operating in universes with slightly different physical constants, the community gets fragmented.

Word of the law or spirit of the law? Let\u0027s see:\n\n1. \u0022The Vehicle Assembly Building and the Space Plane Hangar allows players to build spacecraft out of any imaginable combination of parts.\u0022\n\nNot really since there are quite a few combinations of parts imaginable that will never work in game. I\u0027m sure most any experienced player can think of a few so this is, going by the interpretation of those complaining, **false advertising**.\n\n2. \u0022Fully-fledged, Physics-based Flight Simulation ensures everything will fly (and crash) as it should.\u0022\n\nWasn\u0027t true in the beginning, isn\u0027t true now, won\u0027t ever be true - if you take it 100% literally. One could easily point to this line and argue it isn\u0027t true even if KSP was the most accurate simulator in the history of man-kind, since even then, it would not be a perfect model of reality since such a thing is impossible. So is KSP realistic enough or not? Up to interpretation to be sure, but I would argue this: what kept all the people complaining it isn\u0027t good enough of a simulation playing all this time? Hope? False hope? Expectations for something they were never promised?\n\n3. \u0022Take your Kerbal crew on expeditions out of the ship with Extra Vehicular Activities gathering data and precious minerals.\u0022\n\nKerbals can\u0027t gather rocks on EVA can they? Or does getting a surface sample count? Another line that anyone could argue is true or untrue to their heart\u0027s content. Argue that they shouldn\u0027t be advertising it this way and someone is certain to come along and point out a bunch of good marketing reasons. Propose a better way to state what you can do and someone else will come along to give you another bunch of evidence demonstrating how difficult it is to do this kind of promotion, how expectations operate in marketing yada yada, etc. etc.\n\nWhen you take things literally like this, all that\u0027s left is circular logic and infinite strings of nonsense.\n\n4. \u0022Procedural Terrain delivers detailed terrain at a vast scale. The Kerbal Planet is 600km in radius.\u0022\n\nNot very detailed. Vastness means nothing these days - the Minecraft engine delivers more detail per square unit of surface if one wanted to compare.\n\nI could go on from here, but I think it\u0027s pretty clear that if we were to take any of this literally enough, then we can go on complaining ad infinitum that we\u0027re not getting our money\u0027s worth (the most disgusting of arguments ever conceived).\n\nIf you want an accurate simulator, KSP, or any game, will never be enough. Ever. I don\u0027t think people realize that accurate simulation software tends to operate very very far from real-time and still has massive inaccuracies when the algorithm used is applied to situations it isn\u0027t accurate for. Take a look at various orbital simulations and what algorithms they use and what criticism they come with. Materials, statics, thermodynamics, chemistry etc. we could go on forever and slap in the most insane simulation libraries to get an incredibly accurate game but it would require a few supercomputers to run at 30fps and people would *still come up with reasons why it\u0027s unsatisfactory* and you know it.\n\nIn the end, when you buy KSP, are you really, *really* under the impression you\u0027re buying a simulator? It\u0027s on Steam and has little green men for crying out loud.\n\nAlso, these complaints make so little sense when the same players have accepted a solar system as small as the game\u0027s but with a lot of real values turning everything extremely dense, when we are still working with SOI-based gravity (not even N-body, which is quite basic in orbital simulators), when there are no robotic parts, no sloshing of fuel, we get science from being landed on the launch pad, no life support systems, no telescope science, no comms delay, no preprogrammed probes and very little automation etc. etc.\n\nI saw someone argue on another thread that they have to learn a new physics system every few weeks, which is a ridiculous statement, but it shows very well what the kind of mentality that goes with these complaints is. In all, the game is the same it always was but better - if you ever had a reason to play it, now you have more. If it was unsatisfactory before, due to physics inaccuracy, it will always be. There\u0027s a difference between constructive criticism and suggestions, versus this mindless whining about \u0022Squad should never have released an unfinished game\u0022 and \u0022I was promised a simulator\u0022.\n\nCan anyone, truly and honestly raise their hand and claim they feel cheated out of their money for KSP as of 1.02? Can anyone claim the game is getting progressively worse?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T20:42:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Do you know why aerocapture relies on everything being inside of an aerodynamic shell in the Real World?\n\nIs there even real world examples of aerocapture?
