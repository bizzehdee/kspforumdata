That will get more payload to orbit, but the costs and inefficiency go up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximizing for cost becomes incredibly complicated with the new aerodynamics. You\u0027ll probably want to utilize SRBs as well, since they provide a bigger bang for the buck... but they also complicate control. You\u0027ll likely end up with a higher TWR when using SRBs as you\u0027ll want to ditch them earlier to avoid control issues that could provoke a more costly design. I generally hit 2.0 to 2.5 with SRB using cost-friendly crafts early on. 1.6 is probably a good number to ballpark for cost efficiency. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaximizing for d/v efficiency is really just an academic exercise...as there is little point in doing that. Using more d/v can be cheaper, faster, and/or lower cost. In 0.9, ~1.8 was the magic number, but the new aero has clouded that. Depending how your craft handles in the atmosphere, it might be more efficient to clear 35km sooner (higher TWR). There are so many factors here, you\u0027ll just have to experiment with whatever payload you\u0027re working with. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is something to be said for maximizing for time-to-orbit though. In sandbox mode or later in career when cost isn\u0027t a concern, I want to get launches over quick. It isn\u0027t the interesting part of the game at that point. Higher TWR gets you up faster! I quite often overbuild my launch stages in late career as I just want to get the craft up and doing its job ASAP. Spending an extra 20k to do it is fine when I\u0027m sitting on 5M and the missions are paying 200-500k. My \u0027get it done\u0027 TWR is 2.0-2.2.
