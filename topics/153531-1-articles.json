Still testing non kerbin aerodynamics and deltaV with addition of wings and fuel after finishing the aerodynamics. But if it gets anywhere like it did previously it will be close to SSTE if not already it. Just needs a nice low weight mining setup to refuel and you have an SSTE refueling aircraft. I\u0027ll do testing on duna and other places later for aerodynamics on landing but it\u0027s looking pretty good if it\u0027s anything like Kerbin. If anything it should get to Duna and Laythe where it is most useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I got to orbit with about 1350 DeltaV. Not quite SSTE but with mining gear you can probably get wherever you want in a few trips. And this thing has fantastic aerodynamics in low altitude on kerbin. You can adjust from most angles to get on the runway. And it can land at 160m/s with ease. It\u0027s harder to slow down in time than it is to land. The only downside is the massive roll at high altitude. And this can\u0027t be changed because you need it at low. The plane needs a preset to adjust the back control surfaces for high altitude then change them back for low altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit2: There is one problem with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E going behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E near empty fuel. If you go upside down, stall, or otherwise loose control of the aircraft you will not be able to recover at low fuel. The craft is still flyable with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E ahead of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTip: Get to above 1400m/s below 20k to get into orbit. You willl likely go past the apoapsis and start descending back around 60km apoapsis. Make sure to gain sufficient speed(up to 2300) and pull up to get into orbit fully. it\u0027s a little tricky to get up completely. But it is absolutely doable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Use cheat \u0022Unbreakable joints\u0022 to load on the runway or it will destroy itself. It\u0027s a problem with the design and the physics easing slamming the rear of the plane into the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAction Groups:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Toggle Nukes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: Toggle Rapiers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: Toggle Mode Rapiers \u002B Toggle Intakes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4: Toggle Whiplashes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCraft file:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/lpp4drth6y0nl8p/IDGAD%20100%20KT%20Cruiser.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIDGAD 100 KT Cruiser\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022photo IDGAD100KTCruiserNewcockpit4_zpsevzvtunh.png\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/IDGAD100KTCruiserNewcockpit4_zpsevzvtunh.png\u0022 style=\u0022margin-top:2.08333px;width:1000px;height:576px;\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-15T06:55:25Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2016 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"duk","CreatedById":131720,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-15T03:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-05-25T03:13:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2022 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by duk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T15:59:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot rid of a part with superdrag.

I was looking for the effects of curved wings. Really cool and runs into the same issues I had. My old plane I had to pull back wing surface very far back to get the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E not to get in front of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E. This is currently an issue with this craft. But this craft may be able to brute force it. This craft has alot of similar design features to how I build my craft. It was very interesting to see something actually semi similar and dealing with the same issues i\u0027ve been dealing with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI may have to change my elevator design so they are both on the rear like I originally intended. When I placed those on I had plenty of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E to spare and moved the forward to give agility. I may have to put them back again to get some more stability and have enough room for empty fuel loads. It would at least make the rear have this sort of cicular shape in essence, but in a different way. It would support the craft better potentially. Although i may loose some authority on the nose. I have a feeling it is helping to prop it up because I don\u0027t think I get enough lift on the nose relative to the weight. Although I need to fly this in far or similar to see how it flies. I need to start making these craft in realistic physics for fun. It would bring more out about how they fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was reading how the wobbliness of the nose is unrealistic. I have to say that it is getting very annoying. All space planes have to potentially deal with this alot. I\u0027m getting sick and tired of it. We need completely realistic aerodynamics. On that note.
