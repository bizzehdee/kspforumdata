Basically, you start with an unpressurized and cold habitat where you have to set up oxygen, power production, water production, and radio. You also have to pay attention to your astronaut\u0027s needs such as food and water. Later missions have you set up sample retrieval and such. It is a really interesting game that I highly recommend despite it looking like someone\u0027s college final project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is also supposed to be a sequel in the works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
