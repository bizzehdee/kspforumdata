However, when I write it, it comes out as a 160 byte file and KSP says it can\u0027t find the model (no error reading the model, checked in output\\_log.txt for it, just says it\u0027s missing).\n\nModel/texture zip: [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13281778/blank%20plate%20part.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/13281778/blank%20plate%20part.zip)\n\nI followed the stickied tutorial as closely as I could, bearing in mind the link to parttools on it is incorrect and is parttools 0.18 not 0.23. I\u0027m using unity 5 on windows 64 to build the model, but I doubt that makes much difference since the resultant file shouldn\u0027t be version specific.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nFor others who end up having this issue, when adding the mesh collider remember to pick what kind of mesh collision you want.

Check your console tab (at the bottom, next to \u0022project\u0022) and see what errors it throws when you\u0027re trying to export. It threw these for me as soon as I loaded the .obj file:\n\n    ImportFBX Warnings:Can\u0027t import normals, because mesh \u0027default\u0027 doesn\u0027t have it.Mesh \u0027default\u0027 has no normals. Recalculating normals.\n\nIf it\u0027s not calculating the normals for you automatically, go back to the project tab and click on plateblank.obj in the assets window. This should bring up some options in the inspector window (right hand side). Click on Models, and set the normals to \u0022calculate\u0022, then apply. You may need to recreate your scene afterwards.\n\nIf that doesn\u0027t work, please take a screenshot of your Unity hierarchy with \u0022default\u0022 selected and the inspector window visible.\n\nI was able to export it alright, so at least the model is not inherently broken.\n\n![ilvcklr.png](http://i.imgur.com/ilvcklr.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-19T04:46:37Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2015 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"}]}
