I sent my first rover ever to the Mun just two days ago. I mounted it to the top of a two-stage rocket using Asparagus staging. Stage one got me out of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. And stage two got me into LKO, to the Mun, and landed. Yes, I used the entire stage two as the lander. Just sit the thing down on its engines and tilt it forward so the rover\u0027s wheels hit the surface. Stage two had so little fuel left that I didn\u0027t feel bad abandoning it. I used docking ports to hold it all together. So I simply undocked the rover, which had an SAS module which made it front-heavy. To fix this, I added a docking port to the very front of the rocket. I lined it up to the docking port on stage two and undocked it from the rover. The module docked to the rocket, and the rover was free to do whatever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make sure that if your rover has a mono-prop. tank, that it is full.
