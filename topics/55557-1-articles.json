Roundview\u0027s feet(Duna) and Windstorm Plains(Duna). Afterwards, I thought; \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Hey...maybe I should go to Gilly. An Eve window is about to arrive, it\u0027s proximity to Kerbin makes it easy to reach, and I always wanted to go to Gilly\u0022\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so Gilly was confirmed as my next destination. I made the rocket for Gilly and everything, and I was ready to launch until I remembered I left six Kerbals on Minmnus for several days(around 108). They\u0027d pretty much snap(except for Johnlorf and Jebediah, who were constantly happy) if I forced them to stay there for more time, so I decided to send them back to Kerbin. However, the Kraken thought it was the perfect time to strike, and ripped off the Mk1-2 pod out of the ship, taking the ASAS module, solar panels and parachutes with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship was still functional because it had a Mk2 Lander Can AND a MechJeb unit, and the crew that were on the Mk1-2 pod were transferred to the Hitchhiker Container(now I\u0027m glad I did that), but without solar panels, they would have limited time until the batteries supplying the Mk2 lander can\u0027s built-in reaction wheels died. Bummer. Regardless, I took the ship into Minmus orbit, and taking one last look at the mint-colored moon, burned Prograde when my rocket was moving retrograde relative to Minmus\u0027 orbit, so I would quit Minmus\u0027 sphere of influence while having a Periapsis of about 40km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan was to use the 10 EVA parachutes packed with the ship to land the Kerbals safely into Kerbin\u0027s surface, one at a time. Sounds easy, I know, but unfortunately I learned that deorbiting Kerbals is (much)easier said than done. The plan was scratched. So...without a method of safely landing the rocket in Kerbin\u0027s surface and without reaction wheels, the only thing I could think of is to just start the Gilly adventure and leave the Minmus crew to die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah, end of mission. Farewell, Johnlorf, Doodvan, Jebediah and other Kerbals I cannot remember their names.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn idea popped up in my mind, though that\u0027d require some work on Fate\u0027s side. The plan was to pray that, during the Apoapsis, the rocket would be facing Retrograde, and fire the engines to generate some power for the reaction wheels, and then burn until the Periapsis was low enough to perform a full-fledged landing aerobrake at Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, Fate decided to give me a chance and left the rocket facing around 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 away from Retrograde. Not exactly what I hoped for, but that\u0027d work. I burned the engines, then used the Poodle\u0027s thrust vectoring feature to spin the rocket into Retrograde. Pressing M, I noticed the Periapsis was now at 9km. A bit lower than I wanted to, but hey, close enough. It was only a matter of time until I reached there. Knowing the batteries would run out again, I used what remained to have the rocket face Prograde, so once it reached Periapsis it would be facing Retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a couple of in-game hours, the rocket was now aerobraking at Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. It sank deeper and deeper into Kerbin\u0027s inner atmosphere, increasing the speed of the aerobrake. Finally, the rocket was just above the perfect landing spot, so I fired the engines Retrograde and moved it to the very top of the NavBall, and began to perform a safe descent, Tylo Style\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2. After a lot of adrenaline, the rocket landed on a silly pose, but the work was done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/685968273269594645/FB792B526FAEA25FC06B670B2156B3DC4DADCF70/\u0022 alt=\u0022FB792B526FAEA25FC06B670B2156B3DC4DADCF70\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImpossible Mission...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EACCOMPLISHED!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hunter54711","CreatedById":94701,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T16:26:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood thinking!, I might try something like this for my 4 stranded Kerbals at Minimus!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T20:12:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENicely done!
