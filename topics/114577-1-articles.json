This was very strange to me but I thought maybe I poorly balanced the vessel and with less fuel it simply \u0022happened\u0022 (even though it caused the vessels to move around erratically sas or no sas).\n\nI\u0027ve now discovered that it was the gimbals, for some reason forcing the thrust in some random-ass direction. When I locked the gimbals in neutral everything seemed fine but obviously I had to now turn using purely the OP torque.\n\nIt seems that the violent SOI change (seriously I don\u0027t remember it being that shaky in pre 1.0 and I\u0027ve only started playing again when 1.03 came out) causes the gimbal behaviour to freak out. Craft file for the vessel below.\n\n[http://www./download/xpdl81d1g4kl8vm/Auto-Saved_Ship.craft](http://www./download/xpdl81d1g4kl8vm/Auto-Saved_Ship.craft)\n\nOnly modded parts on the ship (I think) are 2 SCANsat parts, the srb and everything else is vanilla I think.\n\nMods I have installed are:\n\nAmbient Light Adjustment - 1.4.4.1\n\nChatterer - 0.9.5.86\n\nContracts Window Plus - 1.0.5.2\n\nEditor Extensions - 2.12\n\nFerram Aerospace Research - 0.15.3.1\n\nKAS - 0.5.2\n\nKerbal Engineer Redux - 1.0.17\n\nKerbal Joint Reinforcement - 3.1.4\n\nKerbal Inventory System - 1.1.5\n\nKSP-AVC Plugin - 1.1.5\n\nInfernal Robots - 0.21.2\n\nModularFlightIntegrator - 1.0\n\nDocking Port Alignment Indicator - 6.2\n\nPlanetShine - 0.2.3.1\n\nRCS Build Aid - 0.7.2\n\nSCANsat - 1.1.2.1\n\nTextureReplacer - 2.4.6\n\nTrajectories - 1.3\n\nKerbal Alarm Clock - 3.4\n\nAlternate Resource Panel - 2.7.2\n\nAlso \n\nKSP: 1.0.4 (Win32) - Unity: 4.6.4f1 - OS: Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (6.1.7601) 64bit\n\nThis is seriously strange behaviour from the engines. And yes I\u0027ve noticed it in multiple different engines (the tiny one present on this probe and the bigger 45kn thrust ones)\n\nPS. Sorry if this already has been reported. I did a rudimentary search but I was always terrible at them."},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T08:32:49Z","Content":"Check this out [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127386-v1-0-4-Gamebreaking-Gimbal-Bug-with-Video?p=2066907](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127386-v1-0-4-Gamebreaking-Gimbal-Bug-with-Video?p=2066907)"}]}
