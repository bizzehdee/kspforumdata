I made a very basic outline of some starter topics, but I really want this to evolve to be whatever the community wants it to be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe huge advantage here is that it\u0027s easy to crosslink info. You can write a basic tutorial on something, then go back and direct links out to advanced info on the various topics. It also supports interwiki, so we can point topics at the official wiki where it makes sense to do so. It also is very easy to maintain and add information as the game, and our knowledge of it, matures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll slowly start filling things in and I\u0027ll message the tutorial authors from the sticky for help or permission bringing their tutorials over, but I\u0027m going to try to gauge how much effort to put in by how active other people are... if nobody bothers, I\u0027m not going to break my back on it. I got a great cybermonday deal on the hosting for the year, so if it doesn\u0027t take, I won\u0027t be heartbroken. But I DO think it could be a great resource to put everything we know in one place. It\u0027s very possible to learn to mod from the existing tutorials, then spending weeks importing other people\u0027s .mu\u0027s into blender and taking apart their .cfg files... but more people would turn out more mods if we make it easier. So that\u0027s the spirit I\u0027m starting this in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also WELCOMING mod authors to use this wiki for their documentation, but I\u0027m not going to try do document any mods that aren\u0027t my own there and I\u0027d appreciate if others respect mod author\u0027s right to document things as and where they see fit. If you do want to put a mod\u0027s documentation there, let me know and we\u0027ll figure out a namespace of your own and such. I will be reaching out, eventually, to the folks who\u0027ve written mods that heavily affect other modders. If they\u0027ve got documentation I\u0027ll just be making sure I\u0027m linking to the right place. If they don\u0027t, I\u0027ll talk to them about community efforts to get their documentation up. This would be for things like FAR, Firespitter\u0027s DLL, RPM, DRE, TAC, MechJeb, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this is a community resource... I\u0027m not going to try to document the whole game on my own... so if you\u0027re interested, please get involved and run with it! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T01:25:45Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 01:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by artwhaley\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"philotical","CreatedById":109390,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T12:28:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never added to the officil wiki, because of one simple reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I know/confirm, that what I think is \u0022correct\u0022 - I had to realize dozens of time, that what I thought at first, is not how it is at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I could contribute usually would be \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022it might be\u0022, \u0022I think\u0022, \u0022probbably\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit\u0027s sad I know lol..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever - I\u0027d appreciate an updated wiki too - if it\u0027s the official or a new one, I don\u0027t realy care..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-01T18:07:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this is a fantastic idea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely agree with the feeling on the official wiki, once or twice I have come across something on it that I knew had changed but I didn\u0027t feel like it was right for me to change it or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been playing KSP for a couple years now and have been slowly progressing from casual player, to using ALLOT of mods, to now modding my mods, adjusting cfgs, using part welding, and even in doing that I sometimes have trouble finding info about how some part MODULE works, or what the various attributes in it do and how they change things; and now I have reached a point where I am finding that I have a need for some part that isn\u0027t in the game or any of the mods I use and I would like to make it, but I have absolutely zero experience with 3D modeling or anything like it, and it would be awesome if we could get a wiki going with up to date tutorials that range from basic cfg editing, very basic 3D modeling (i mean super basic like how to make a fuel tank, I have no idea how blender works or anything) to more advanced stuff like making animated parts, wheels, landing gear, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also be cool if there was a section with Plugin documentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike a section on FireSpitter that lists all the various part MODULEs it adds with all the different attributes for them and what they all do, a section for USITools and all the converters it adds, RT documentation and how to add it to new parts and get the animations and stuff to work, a section for MM, ATM, and EVE documentation and every thing invlolved there, etc. I know allot of plugins usually have documentation of this kind of stuff but sometimes it is a pain in the rear to find, and sometimes it isn\u0027t very descriptive due to trying to keep forum posts short.
