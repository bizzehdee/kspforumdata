While watching it make progress on the scan I noticed the periapsis marker on SCANsat\u0027s map going down at around 0.1 m/s. Thinking this was just a glitch I exited the map I was looking at and checked MechJeb\u0027s orbit info, and much to my surprise my periapsis was actually going down. As I was at an altitude of at least 74 km at the time, and do not have any mods that add this sort of thing I am very confused.

Obviously this should not be happening as Kerbin has an atmosphere that extends to roughly 69,078 meters. You are clearly well above that. Make sure your engines are all completely off. Otherwise I have no idea what could be the problem. Maybe don\u0027t rely on MechJeb\u0027s orbit info as it could be incorrect. Idk I never use MechJeb. The game is easy enough.
