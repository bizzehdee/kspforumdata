For ecample, in the Map Screen with the navball hidden, an input lock will show up, indicating the craft cannot be controlled or staged in that particular mode. It\u0027s generally used for bughunting, to see if there are any inputs being blocked when they shouldn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPause on vessel unpack means that the game will halt whenever you drop out of time warp so that it has time to properly re-load the vessel (i.e., \u0022unpack\u0022) and apply physics before resuming real-time simulation. There are some rare occasions where the usual system fails to unpack the vessel properly before it switches physics back on... which can destroy a ship entirely, especially if some parts are unpacked and others are still being loaded up, potentially splitting the craft in half, if you\u0027re lucky enough not to have it explode into a million pieces. Thankfully, those occasions are pretty rare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
