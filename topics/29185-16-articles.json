So I don\u0027t know where the problem might be that it (seems?) unrealistic, but there is another problem about realism: There was never a nuclear engine mounted on a rocket so we don\u0027t know how much fuel it would need. The LV-N needs not very much mass but a lot of volume and this adds additional dry mass making your over all \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the Space Shuttle example: The SSMEs (and the LV-T45 when fitted to LH2\u002BLOX) are burning both and as LOX is very dense (compared to LH2) a SSME/LV-T45 burns longer with the same volume of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to test that would be to test the LV-N with a heavier craft, so that the additional mass by the LV-N doesn\u0027t matter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay I tried to rebuild rosenkranz\u0027s ships but my LF/OX craft (build like yours) was able to add one FL-T100 and one Oscar-B fuel tank and the mass is only 5.48 t? Now the dry mass for my ship is then 2.07 t so there are 3.43 t fuel on board. With a LV-N rocket like you build and reduced the mass of the LV-N to 1.5 (LV-T45\u0027s) I was able to put 2.45 t of fuel in it. That explains your discrepancies: LH2 (and LOX) drymass/fuelmass ratio is worse than the LF/OX ratios. Now I don\u0027t have a good solution for that, except maybe to either use large amounts of LH2 (at least you choose to do the hardcore mode) or stick to classic engines which use the heavier LF, OX and LOX.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way: With the reduced mass of the LV-N I get 4.9 km/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv (due to the additional fuel I was able to add).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFabian\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-02T17:36:56Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2013 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by xZise\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T20:02:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut what could be wrong?!

This mod is also bringing to light the potential fact that the NERVA isn\u0027t quite all that an a bag of chips like we have all come to expect.

What is killing it is the tankage\u0027s dry mass ratio to the fuel within.

For example liquid fuel has a density of 0.005 u but according the density of RP-1 is about 1 g/ml (= 1 g/cm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 = 1 kg/dm\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3 = 1000 kg/m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B3).
