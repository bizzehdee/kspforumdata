This is for my own personal use). At 25 KM away it looks really big still but when I warp it disappears and as soon as i stop the warp it appears again. Also, when I get 30 KM away it disappears. I\u0027m guessing that distance is where the game stops rendering random objects like debris, pods, etc. So my question is...would there be a way to make this into a planet so that it is visible from very far away kind of like minmus is from kerbin?

Every time you go from physical to on-rail time warp the accuracy of it deminishes very quickly hence the teleporting of the object.
