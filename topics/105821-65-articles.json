In particular, I really need feedback from Mac and Linux players to know if the shaders are working (or are the MFDs showing pink blocks?).  martinmike2 reported a problem in Linux, but I have no idea if it\u0027s a widespread problem, or specific to some combination of Linux / hardware.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Q: Why aren\u0027t you testing it?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E A: My modding time is focused on the RPM replacement mod MOARdV\u0027s Avionics Systems.  I\u0027m keeping RPM operational, but I don\u0027t have the spare time to thoroughly poke around it to test it.  And I don\u0027t have access to Mac or Linux systems.\n\u003E \n\n[@MOARdV](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/60950-moardv/) first of all thanks a lot for all of your fantastic work on RPM -- it is one of my favorite mods! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  I am a Mac user and have been testing out RPM 0.29.0 beta 3. I just wanted to let you know that it seems to be working well and I have not encountered any issues (I didn\u0027t have any issues using beta 2 either).  Shaders seem to be fine and I do not have any pink blocks."}]}
