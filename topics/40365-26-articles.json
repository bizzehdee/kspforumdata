I recall it\u0027s max output thrust used to depend on the max output of the reactors, but I think that was the output when they were outputting max, not what their theoretical max was, so now the thruster has plenty of MJ available but is limiting itself to what it sees as the current gen output, which is like 5MW at max.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really need to install a C# compiler and look at your source code, good practice for my coding skills \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T00:23:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rampart\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rampart\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think I tried that previously, but for testing sake I tested as you specified, no dice. I think I have an idea though, you can see the generator adjusting output as you adjust the throttle, for a quantum thruster with upgraded gen/AM reactor that plus the computer core is pulling about 5.88 MW, which is way, way too low I think. Maybe the plasma/quantum is adjusting based on the MW generated?

The bug is due to a particular method in my code that tries to calculate the \u0022stable resource supply,\u0022 namely the amount of power that the generator can provide without overtaxing itself. Before active management, this value was always the max output of the generator but now it can drop, at which point a whole host of other things start dropping and you end up in a downward spiral.
