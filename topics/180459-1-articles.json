With an FL-T200, you have about 1500 m/s: enough to circularise and return with a very decent safety margin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat means that whatever else you do while at Duna, on leaving Kerbin you want to have a full \u0022return stage\u0022 consisting of the above Mk1 pod, FL-T200 fuel tank and Terrier engine, ready to take you back.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOr if you are using the 3-man pod, you want the smallest 2.5m tank plus a Poodle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou say that you\u0027re getting there easily enough. Therefore the obvious answer is droptanks. A Mk1 pod (plus parachute, batteries, solar panels, battery and 20% heatshield), with an FL-T200 and Terrier underneath, flanked by a pair of jettisonable T200 tanks (with nosecones front and back), will give you a massive 3100 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. If you can get \u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E to orbit, you can orbit Duna, land on Ike and return to Kerbin, easily. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve sent heavier ships to the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs always, the thing is to shed as much mass as possible. If you can throw empty fuel tanks away, do it. If you use boosters, place fuel tanks on them and make sure they drain fully through your main engines at as close to exactly the same time as you have to drop the boosters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure you\u0027ve already been to Minmus and back with a \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E of fuel to spare. Going to Duna shouldn\u0027t be a problem, as long as you keep the mass down. One easily understandable tendancy is to try to do a lot more than what you\u0027ve done for Minmus, just because it\u0027s so much further away. Don\u0022t. It\u0027s not a huge leap from Minmus to Duna, it just looks like it \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-10T03:23:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might help to have a screenshot of your current craft, and/or\u00A0more detailed description of what you\u0027re trying to do.\u00A0 For example, by going to Duna, do you just mean going to Duna orbit, or actually landing on Duna?\u00A0 The latter is going to impose a lot of more requirements than the former.\u00A0\u00A0As \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153264-plusck/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022153264\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/153264-plusck/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Plusck\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003Esays, a Duna mission is not that different in terms of total requirements than a trip to the Mun, but due to the extra steps and time requirements, it[\u0027s a lot easier for something to go awry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in a general sense, if you need your rockets to go farther, I think the best framework to work around is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETsoilkovsy Rocket Equation\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 (Not sure if you\u0027re familiar with this, or with the concept of delta-v).\u00A0 There\u0027s quite a bit of math involved, but in general, the Rocket Equation says a rocket\u0027s total delta-v (i.e., effective range) is a function of only three things: the dry mass, the wet mass, and the engine\u0027s specific impulse.\u00A0 So, to get more delta-v, you can do a few things (these are very general tips, so they might or might not be applicable to your current issue):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EReduce dry mass\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 This means getting rid of any parts you don\u0027t absolutely need, including excess engines.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncrease wet mass\u003C/strong\u003E.
