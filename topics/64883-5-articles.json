Just watch it and control the navball modes (Orbit, Target Modes).

Remember to use the navball the way Mechjeb did. Use Mechjebs Smart A.S.S. to help you in orienting the ship. Repeat until you get a hang on it, then move to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3: Only let Mechjeb time the launch towards the target for you, but do the rendezvous and docking for yourself using the navball and Mechjebs Smart A.S.S.

You will already have the knowledge to do it from the steps before, it is just practice now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYesterday I did the first dockings (completely manual) for over 2 months. (Note: My missle tests didn\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t need any docking). My targets and my ships were both really big (Minmus orbital station core \u002B heavy tug \u0026amp; the biggest lander i have ever built \u002B heavy tug) but i had no problems with docking them. The first docking was actually 1-touch/ no dancing. So I can tell you , that docking is like riding a bike.

Now, it\u0027s fairly routine. I don\u0027t know how much you want to learn by yourself, but here are a few things that I noticed were important and missing from the link mentioned above: First, circularize the target\u0027s orbit (within a few kilometers) so that it\u0027s moving at a steady speed. This makes it a lot easier to figure out how to approach it. If you are ahead of it, then match the periapsis of your orbit with the target\u0027s orbit. If you\u0027re behind, match the apoapsis with the target\u0027s orbit. You might want to approach the target from behind at first, since the point of rendezvous will then be when you are traveling the slowest. At that point, matching the speed of the target is essentially making your orbit match the target\u0027s. Once you get close, just slow your approach to less than 1/2 m/s and take your time maneuvering your ship into position. If your orbit is matched with the target, you have all the time in the solar system to dock. My first attempt took almost a full 750 tank of monoprop, but now I typically use less than 50.
