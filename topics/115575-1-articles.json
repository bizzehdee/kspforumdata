What you want to do right before closest approach is burn retrograde in \u0022target\u0022 mode till you and the station are no longer moving in relation to each other. Then find the target the nav ball, and burn towards it slowly. You\u0027ll want to monitor orbital drift and burn towards where the station will be. On the orbital map, you should maintain the slow burn until the orbital map slowly shows your closest separation to be 0.0km.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-10T18:31:26Z\u0022 title=\u002207/10/2015 06:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Edax**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lef-T333","CreatedById":147843,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T18:27:11Z","Content":"This doesn\u0027t happen after closest approach. \n\nThis happens right after the burn to get a close approach of less than 1.0, and way before I even get to the closest approach.

This causes the orbits to shift and the ship to bend, especially when fireing the engines or using the reaction wheels. Entering timewarp or saving is not possible. It only happens with specific ships, so if this is the cause, designing a slightly different, **new** ship and **restarting** the game should fix it.
