In this building you need to work with parts like nozzles, cooling jackets, fuel pumps, auxiliary power turbines, coolant, magnetic coils, gimbles... and whatever else you guys might think of. This way you could make precisely the engine you need for a task. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpon save, the program could simply write a CFG file for the engine, thus the in-game physics wouldn\u0027t have to work any harder during a space flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose these features could also be built into the R \u0026amp; D facility too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tidus Klein","CreatedById":72277,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-03T10:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes such a thing is a ace in my book do it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS ( did you start this because of the random new building in the update that just sits there and looks pretty?
