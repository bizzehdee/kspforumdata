Unfortunately, however, billions of humans had already died until the appearance of the \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day link\u003C/strong\u003E to the cosmos, and it\u0027s sad to think that they missed out on the \u003Cstrong\u003Egreat opportunity\u003C/strong\u003E that it brought us. However, if a \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day link\u003C/strong\u003E to future day medicine is found, we could essentially acquire immortality and perhaps revive the dead so that they may finally experience the great beauty of the \u003Cstrong\u003Euniverse itself.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, one would wonder, if these \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day links\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ehave given us everything, what would the point of life be? There would be no more need for science, since a \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day link\u003C/strong\u003E to future day science could make us omniscient. There would no more need for caring about your health due to the \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day link\u003C/strong\u003E to future day medicine. We would not be trapped by gravity anymore due to the \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day link\u003C/strong\u003E to the cosmos, so we wouldn\u0027t need more vehicles built. In fact, all of these together turn life into something meaningless, where you live \u003Cstrong\u003Eforever\u003C/strong\u003E. And forever is a long, long, long time. We\u0027re not talking about a hundred years here, not a thousand, not a \u003Cstrong\u003Ebillion\u003C/strong\u003E. We\u0027re talking about \u003Cstrong\u003Eeternity itself\u003C/strong\u003E. Sure, perhaps you could do anything you wanted, but soon enough you\u0027d run out of ideas. Things that were \u003Cstrong\u003Efun\u003C/strong\u003E to do before, would become boring since you already did them a lot. Perhaps even the very essence of love would become meaningless due to being so repeatedly experienced. This would become an universe of boredom. An universe of \u003Cstrong\u003Epain\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Esuffering\u003C/strong\u003E, knowing that you will have to endure this meaningless, boring life \u003Cstrong\u003Eforever.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither that, or the \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day link\u003C/strong\u003E to future day medicine would constantly modify our minds so that we would not remember the activities that we\u0027ve done before or put us in a state of forced constant happiness, so that everything that you do feels like it is the first time doing it. But then, life would be a mere illusion. Much like\u003Cstrong\u003E Plato\u0027s Cave\u003C/strong\u003E, we\u0027d be staring at the shadows of reality, being \u003Cstrong\u003Eforced\u003C/strong\u003E to live the illusion and rejecting anyone that said reality was different. Maybe even becoming violent against them, like we are in the current day against those that have ideologies different from ours. How many times have you seen someone on, say, YouTube, \u003Cstrong\u003Ebashing\u003C/strong\u003E another person for believing in a conspiracy theory, for example? Like in\u003Cstrong\u003E Plato\u0027s Cave\u003C/strong\u003E, we could be living an illusion already, and being violent towards the ones that have seen the truth. So our violence would not be due to the \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day links\u003C/strong\u003E, but due to something \u003Cstrong\u003Eburied deep inside us\u003C/strong\u003E ever since we rose as a species. The fear of change and finding out our views are wrong is something irrational that terrifies us and has been haunting us \u003Cstrong\u003Eforever\u003C/strong\u003E. And this fear will remain. Unless we find a \u003Cstrong\u003Emodern day link\u003C/strong\u003E that keeps it away from us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/173044-moderndaylink64/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022173044\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/173044-moderndaylink64/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ModerndayLink64\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cratercracker","CreatedById":171449,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-27T19:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown for combustible lemons that you use to begin hostile takeovers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHostile takeovers are pursuited and banned by the law in every country.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown for being in jail once,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso you stated that they can burn down my houces, that means you endanger my property.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is also puruited and banned by the law.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown for being in jail twice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoadRunnerAerospace","CreatedById":177973,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-27T21:02:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nknown for.......\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nabstract art?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T04:11:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnow for posting a lot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiffedStarfish","CreatedById":175356,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T13:44:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown for being dundun92s brother.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbinorbiter","CreatedById":172446,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T17:28:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown for being the real life Danny2462\u003Csup\u003ETM\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cratercracker","CreatedById":171449,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-28T17:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown for helping ISEA\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Confused Scientist","CreatedById":179591,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-30T20:18:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKnown for being the post above yours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Good luck to whoever posts below this)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbinorbiter","CreatedById":172446,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-30T21:28:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:72px;\u0022\u003ECHALLENGE ACCEPTED!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nknown for making people pay to land on Eeloo\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-08T03:50:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGrating cheese.
