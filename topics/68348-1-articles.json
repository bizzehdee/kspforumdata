It has very little inclination, relatively low gravity/escape velocity - and best of all, it has an atmosphere- which helps a lot for capture (ie orbital insertion, so you don\u0027t just go whizzing past Duna) and landing. Yet the atmosphere is thin enough that it doesn\u0027t cost you all that much dV on ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts pretty much the opposite of mar\u0027s atmosphere - mars has too little atmosphere to ignore (spacecraft can burn up if they come in too steep), but too little to be of much use (even with parachutes, a spacecraft will be going far too fast, and needs relatively powerful retrorockets).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna\u0027s atmosphere allows you to land with just parachutes, assuming you brought enough, and land in the lowest depressions (where the atmosphere is thickest) - but you don\u0027t need to worry too much about it on ascent (although you should still ascend at terminal velocity).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor most incoming trajectories , you want a perapsis between 10.5k and 12.5 to aerocapture into Duna orbit (it should give you an apopasis outside the atmosphere, and you burn there to raise your perapsis outside the atmosphere, or for a lander - do nothing and let the orbit degrade for no additional fuel use).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the added dV of taking off from Duna again, you should do it \u0022apollo style\u0022, and use a lander that will launch and rendevous with the inter-planetary stage (or at least leave some fuel in orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No sense in deorbiting the fuel you need to get from Duna back to kerbin, only to have to haul it back into orbit again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in Kerbin orbit, perhaps you should practice orbital rendevous\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T09:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry to do a flyby on Eve and land on Gilly.

Ike loves to be a pain in the ass, and Gilly is a pain in the ass to get to and even more of one to land on. I tried landing the cruise stage for a probe mission on there on a whim, and it literally would not settle properly. A single nuclear engine and bunch of weight, and it only actually settled down because the engine snapped off.

The inclination is about the same as Kerbin\u0027s, so you don\u0027t have to worry about extra fuel for an inclination burn. Also, If you go at the right time, you can get an intercept with really low fuel usage. Then you could an aerobrake with Duna\u0027s atmosphere. If you set your incoming periapsis to about 25k above Duna, you should have enough for an aerobrake, you might need a little burn going retrograde to assist with the first pass, but after that you should be good and then just circularize around 60k for an orbit. Duna is an excellent place to drop a rover and go exploring if you want to try that first and do a manned ground landing later. Use the atmosphere to your advantage and put parachutes on your landers.
