Flying around between the moons of Jool is strange just in the stock game, especially between the big 3 of Laythe, Vall, and Tylo. Out by Bop and Pol, it\u0027s no big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I understand things, it\u0027s sort of an artifact of KSP\u0027s small scale compared to reality. You have the planet-sized SOIs of these moons all close together and changing position to each other rapidly as they orbit within the monumental SOI of Jool. There\u0027s nothing in the real world like this, even at Jupiter, so strange things happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s really not so much brute force as it is illogical. For instance, you\u0027d think that for going from Laythe to Vall, you\u0027d need phase and ejection angles similar to going from Kerbin to Duna. While the phase angle between the moons is similar, the ejection angle is bizarre. Sometimes it\u0027ll be on the retrograde side of Laythe instead of the prograde side. Sometimes you\u0027ll get a Vall encounter by leaving Laythe pointed straight at Jool. It may depend on the positions of the other moons, I don\u0027t know, but it does seem to vary each time I do it. No matter what it looks like within Laythe\u0027s SOI, however, if you drag and tweak the node enough to get a Vall encounter, that\u0027s what you\u0027ll get. Eventually. I say \u0022eventually\u0022 because you\u0027ll often get 3 or 4 unexpected encounters back with Laythe in the early part of the trip, that come out of nowhere and then disappear for no reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the delta-V required, it usually seems to take about 800m/s for the transfer burn between Laythe and Vall, IIRC. Maybe 1000m/s but no more than that. Capture at Vall is additional.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
