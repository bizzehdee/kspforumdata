Anti-Spacecraft defense had shot down most of the Federation landers, but some had landed, and now the Minmusian stations were surrounded by Federation Tanks. Commander Ludfry sighed and zoomed in on the Holomap. A small Federation force was landing on Starlight Plateau. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That\u0027s Munbin\u0027s zone.\u0022 Said one of the Tactical staff as Ludfry panned the camera to look at the Republic defense force. Twelve Rapier ion fighters hovered over the airless, turquoise surface. Nearly a hundred Ion-propelled Skimmer tanks floated behind them, some drivers tensely powering up their sunbeams. A kilometer beyond that, Minmus Monitoring Station Three towered over the landscape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sound of Ion drives spinning up stunned Billy-Bobdin. He quickly fired his own drive, floating carefully\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebehind Captain Munbin\u0027s command Skimmer. Billy-Bobdin\u0027s sunbeam spun 180 degrees, looking for Federation tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA small blip on the radar alerted Billy-Bobdin and he spun his turret around. Floating directly above a ridge to the right of the Republik tank column, a small Federation tank was trying to get a count on the Republic mediums. Alerted by Billy-Bobdin\u0027s sudden rotation, it tried to scurry behind the ridge. Billy-Bobdin\u0027s face twisted into an indifferent mask. He fired a sustained shot and nailed the Federation tank directly where the light tank\u0027s Xenon gas was stored. Silently, the pressurized gas jetted out of the ruptured container, propelling the light tank high above the Minmusian surface to the sound of whoops and cheers over the intertank comm system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Great shot, MDF-32.\u0022 Said a calm voice over the comm system. Munbin spoke again. \u0022I only wish that all Federation tankers were that stupid.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a flash of light, and one of the voices on the intercom shut up abruptly. A Republic tank silently exploded, fragments of metal spinning off in all directions. The main body of the ruined vehicle slowly pitched downwards, ramming into the Minmusian landscape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Ambush! We are attacked!\u0022 Yelled a nameless voice on the comm as another tank was shattered, doing backflips as it\u0027s oxygen tanks decompressed, the shards of metal falling slowly in the low gravity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBilly-Bobdin heard fired his sunbeam in two long bursts, Annihilating one Federation tank and destroying another\u0027s ion drive. The damaged tank sank to the Minmusian ground but kept firing at the Republic column. Seconds later a Republic anti-tank rocket blew it to bits. Far above the battlefield, the Republic Rapier fighters were doing battle with Federation Hellhound Fighters. A Hellhound ripped a rapier in half with a sunbeam shot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELemtin\u0027s Rapier spun around, turned inside of a Hellhound, and bisected it with a sunbeam. Locking on to another Hellhound on the tail of a Rapier, he launched a rocket and gutted the Hellhound, sending it flipping into orbit. Seeing the disheveled state of his squadron, he called on the comm for a status report. 3 fighters killed and 2 damaged. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You get back to MMS-3. Goybart, Ranton, stay with me. I want those Fed tanks dead. The rest of you, recharge and rearm.\u0022 Lemtin was so engrossed in his tactical map, he didn\u0027t see the Hellhound. One sunbeam burst ripped his weapon pods off, and another destroyed his ion drive, with no way to control his fighter, Lemtin died cursing the Federation pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBilly-Bobdin saw the fighter falling like an artillery shell. The Rapier\u0027s hulk smashed into a Federation tank, flattening it and spraying debris. Another enemy tank shattered, then another. Another Rapier dove towards the ground, firing sunbeam blasts into the lightly-armored roofs of tanks and emptying it\u0027s rocket pods. The fighter pulled out with centimeters to spare, nearly brushing the turquoise surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith one last push, the Republic armor burst through the Federation lines, ripping tanks and buggies apart and transforming landers into debris clouds.

Tactical staff uncorked KerbalKola and other spirits. Ludfry was too tired to party with them, and as he wiped sweat off of his thin brow, he could only think of securing Minmusian space. There was a more pressing problem, however. The Federation controlled nearly 2/3 of Kerbin\u0027s surface. The great desert and the Northern Icecap, the two most prestigious research locations on Kerbin, both flew the White and Grey of the Federation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the Tactical Staff entered Ludfry\u0027s chamber and shut the door.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes?\u0022 Ludfry said coolly. \u0022Sir, I think you should see this\u0022 the staff officer told him. Ludfry put on his reading glasses and turned to look at the grainy photograph that the Staff Officer had placed on his desk. Ludfry was shocked by the image. It was a photo of a Federation shipyard, orbiting a nondescript moon. \u0022It\u0027s their shipyard at Tylo,\u0022 the staff officer told him. \u0022But if you look to the right...\u0022 Ludfry saw it. An Antiatus class interplanetary battlecruiser. But instead of the distinctive 4-nuclear engine cluster, Ludfry saw a large ring, connected to the ship\u0027s main body by a few dark lines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They call it the Stardrive.\u0022 The staff officer said. \u0022Our intel agents say it can propel a ship at the speed of light.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELudfry was shocked. With an engine like that, a fleet of starships could reach even the furthest enemy outposts. His features contorted in fear. \u0022Tell Sambo to double the fleet strength over Verviedi and to produce double, no TRIPLE the amount of tanks he is now.

I fear that this war is coming to Verviedi.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe staff officer rushed out of the room, running as fast as his short legs could take him.

He stretched and walked to the Interplanetary Communications dish.

Green blood spewed from his nose and ears as he collapsed atop of the receiver, completely brain dead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Federation fleet flew through interstellar space at the speed of light. Commander Joebart grinned ferally. \u0022By now the Federation agents in the Interplanetary Communications facility should have done their jobs.\u0022 He thought as he passed into Abaddon\u0027s SOI. The 3 battlecruisers and destroyer flotilla came out of Lightspeed near Diamas. Not even a single missile sailed forth from the moon\u0027s famed weapon batteries. Alarms were blaring on Phobius, but all of the cries fell on dead ears.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly a minute later, the Federation fleet reached Verviedi, jewel of Abaddon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA single Rapier fighter was in orbit, performing sensor duties. Captain Sonbo couldn\u0027t believe his eyes. On his radar screen, 3 large blips and too many smaller blips to count appeared. He radioed these findings back to the Republic defense force, and moved in to investigate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as the signal reached the VDF, chaos began. Ships engaged their engines, sunbeams powered up, and the fat carriers pumped out fighters like some ocean-dwelling leviathan laying eggs. Captains radioed in ready messages, and as one, the VDF moved to defend their planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fighters met each other first. Nearly 600 Republic Rapiers and Shrike interceptors smashed into the 300-strong Federation Hellhound swarm. Sonbo burned towards a Hellhound, turned, and ripped it apart with a guided missile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe flipped and killed another one, and was rewarded with a sunbeam shot that flew within centimeters of his cockpit. Seconds later, the responsible Hellhound was smashed by a Shrike\u0027s floating hulk. One Rapierr, then another exploded behind him, and he pulled a 180 degree turn and saw a Federation fighter shoot by at incredible speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVDF cruisers and Federation destroyers dueled with each other indiscriminately, beams disintegrating any fighter caught in their path. Sonbo nearly missed crashing into a Federation battlecruiser and fired a torpedo at a heavy sunbeam firing at a VSF cruiser. He didn\u0027t have time to see if it hit, as a Hellhound fired a rocket into his stabilizers, ripping a hole in his cockpit. Air and blood flowing out of his suit, he pulled a radical turn and accelerated towards the battlecruiser\u0027s bridge, firing every single munition he had at the blast-glass windows of the leviathan. He impacted, crashed through the thick metal plate, and gutted the battlecruiser, exploding munitions bays,and gravity generators. The ruin of his fighter emerged from the outer hull of the Federation battlecruiser, sticking out like a dart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne VDF cruiser exploded violently as Joebart\u0027s ship gutted it with a heavy sunbeam.

Why isn\u0027t the rest of the VDF helping us?\u0022 Sambo shook his head miserably. \u0022They think we are lost. The entire planet is under blockade. We are out of supplies.

A few dozen kilometers away, slightly below the horizon, the top communications arrays and bridge of a Federation destroyer poked up from behind a ridge. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKirfrey beat his hand weakly against the hard metal door desperately, cursing himself for accidentally locking himself inside. He had never been a proper soldier.

The other soldier calmly raised his weapon, and was hit extremely hard in the groin by a bottle of Clear Clean. He slid to the ground groaning, and Kirfrey knocked him out with the mop. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKirfrey dropped the mop like a hot potato.

The final Technocracy line had formed on one of the ridges surrounding Vall\u0027s many \u0022seas\u0022, and waiting silently for the Federation invasion force among their emplacements. Anti-Space weapons scanned the void above the great emplacement, and every single remaining soldier, vehicle, and esoteric death-machine stood in wait for the Federation army to appear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED1009 was one of the Technocracy soldiers who had survived 5 years of constant, desperate war for survival.

Autonomous drones fought side by side with native soldiers. Now, machines outnumbered Kerbal 5 to one. In all likelihood, there were only 20,000 living Technocracy soldiers left. By all estimates, the attacking force numbered 300,000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWar-drones walked down the lines, holding up signs with orders for the troops. On the 1,471st day, the Technocracy had flooded every single communications channel with memetic kill agents.

Starship-grade heavy sunbeams fired, annihilating Federation tanks and APCs. Sleek, shining Technocracy skimmer-tanks glided outwards, firing precise shots that wrecked vehicle after vehicle. The Technocracy infantry fired last, releasing a bewildering array of energy weapons that tore apart, exploded, temporally dispaced, imploded, or caused vehicles to shake themself apart. D1009 fired his Sunbeam again and again, but it was mostly ineffective against more heavily armored targets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was not enough. It wasn\u0027t even close to enough. The Federation began firing, and the fighting began in earnest. D1009 flung himself down as a Sunbeam shot reflected off of his armor. The armor of the Kerbal next to him failed, and the corpse flew backwards in the low gravity, the green blood freezing in it\u0027s veins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Federation vehicles hit the Technocracy lines. Powerful Sunbeams disintegrated Kerbals and shattered war robots. D1009 saw a death machine wrestling a Federation mechsuit, and decapitate the white and grey engine with one of it\u0027s many blade-arms. Seconds later, it took a beam directly in the central computer, causing the self-destruct to immediately trigger. The scything, red-hot debris cut down a score of Federation infantry and rattled of D1009\u0027s armor.

In the next three days, Tylo, Bop, and Pol had joined the fledgling Federation.

War against the Federation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoho always had a small population.

And the unlucky Republic invasion fleet was on the wrong end of it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeconds after sending a warning to the rest of the fleet, the cruiser that fired on the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E was destroyed by a furious barrage of sunbeams and more exotic weaponry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main body of the Republic fleet could finally engage, and they fired wildly at anything resembling a target. A stray kinetic weapon punctured the hull of the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E near it\u0027s drone hanger, but the AI aboard fought on. Five quick shots destroyed a Technocracy destroyer, and \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E moved it\u0027s crosshairs to a one of the large Eve battlespheres, blowing out it\u0027s engines and collapsing a section of hull. Suddenly, the AI registered an impossibly large contact. It broke away from the damaged battlesphere, and burned towards the alert \u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poryy","CreatedById":81075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T14:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EChapter Eleven - Jool Space - Dragonslayer\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E fired first. A heavy sunbeam blazed across space to the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E, burning a small crater in the stealth cruiser\u0027s mirrored coating before glancing off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe AI-driven cruiser continued burning towards the \u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E, entering the 100 kilometer range of it\u0027s weapons. As soon as it entered the effective range of it\u0027s weapons, the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E began firing it\u0027s array of weapons. Most of the cruiser\u0027s sunbeams were deflected by \u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s hull coating, but one punched through an engineering bay, and one hit a hanger, spacing a company of battle-ready pilots and fighters via explosive decompression.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Admiral called off his escorts. This battle would be his and his alone. \u0022Prepare to fire main armament! Brace for primary weapon discharge! This fight is ours! For the Republic and Kerm curse the Feds!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDeep in the bowels of the \u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E, the central reactor increased it\u0027s output massively. An energy spike was detected by every ship in the fleet. Six massive beams fired out of the Archangel\u0027s primary armament, hitting the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E dead on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFour beams ricocheted off of the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 armor. One tore through the armor and hit a coolant tank, starting a fire that was instantly extinguished. The sixth beam burrowed right into the core of \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E, severing cables and damaging sensors. It cut into a drone hanger and storage deck, causing secondary explosions that collapsed an entire deck and caused a battery stack to explode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe AI aboard \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E was not programmed for mercy. It ignored the damaged systems on-board and collapsing structures near it\u0027s reactor-core. It made a minute course adjustment, and begin firing at maximum rate, not caring for power conservation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace between \u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E glowed for a second, as \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E put all of it\u0027s power into it\u0027s sunbeams. A deluge of sunbeams tore apart the Republic flagship\u0027s armor in 6 places, causing explosive decompression through several decks. A stray missile tore through one of the breaches, into a reactor stack, causing a fourth of the massive vessel to lose power. The few crewmen that survived the blast managed to jettison the reactor before it went critical due to loss of coolant, but all non-emergency onboard lights went off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Admiral watched the Federation ship closing, and smiled ferally. This smile was interrupted by a navigation officer. \u0022Enemy contact on collision course, sir! ETA 3 minutes!\u0022 The Admiral frowned, his face appearing hollow in the emergency light. \u0022Fire point defense weapons, complete spread of enemy vessel. Order escorts to provide supporting fire.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rain of fire impacting \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E intensified. Sunbeams and kinetic rounds ricocheted off of the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 fragmented armor, but yet more lanced through the spaces inside the AI-ship. A shot from the \u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E tore a massivd chunk out of the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 side, but the AI aboard the vessel continued firing wildly, thinking of nothing but vengeance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002230 seconds until impact!\u0022, the navigator shouted. Most of the bridge crew had abandoned the bridge, hiding in the bunker decks. The only ones on the armored edifice now were the Admiral, Navigator, Communications Officer, and a robed Vallite sensor officer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s point defenses began firing, blasting chunks out of the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E\u0027 hull. The computer banks containing it\u0027s AI commander had been destroyed, and all the venerable drone-ship was now was a high-speed hulk.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Cem\u003EArchangel\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s main weapon fired for the last time, detonating the last munitions in the heart of the \u003Cem\u003EKryptos\u003C/em\u003E. The drone-ship broke into a rain of debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA chunk of debris filled a viewscreen for a split second.
