The entire system has been reshuffled and reorganised into a completely new layout, Jool currently sits probably around Eeloo\u0027s orbit in stock, if not past it. Yes I am aware that the system layout is probably not the most realistic, especially since i left the star as stock until I finish the modifications for the new star types to come in. The reason I have it so far out s to have a relatively \u0022stable\u0022 system in place. The system was balanced in universe sandbox 2 so the orbits themselves are stable (apart from aptur, but until i can correctly create lagrange points that is staying put), however the SMA for each planet was scaled down afterwards to fit a reasonable scale that players can actually get to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is the same i said above. Gameplay always wins over realism. Creating my system realistically would make it unplayable for most KSP players.

It is true that, despite what science nuts like me want to believe for lack of a more fun game to compare to RL, KSP is just that ;a fun game, not a realistic space flight simulator. KSP players pay the game not (exclusively) for its attention to realism (even though it is much closer to home than others obviously), but for its fun factor, and therefore KSP is not always obliged to file some arbitrary rules just because we have been taught that\u0027s the right way - especially when fan -made mods come into play. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways -great job on that mod, man.
