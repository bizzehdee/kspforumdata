Science is low in the home system, and the planets aren\u0027t exactly easy so theres always a challenge around. The focus of the layouts came from a gameplay standpoint over realism, at times i had to stretch physical rules to get the desired challenge....."},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T20:50:12Z","Content":"Well, I understand the atmoshpere part, but I don\u0027t really think Jool has been moved close enough to Kerbin to get the same amount of sunlight. Since I did read the OP, Jool seems to remain at the outermost parts of the Kerbol system, so this would mean that either the majority of the system (which is much bigger than the stock Kerbol system) has been stuffed in one KAU\u0027s (Kerbal Astronomical Unit) radius, or Kerbol is much larger than stock."},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T21:05:59Z","Content":"currently Sonnah, Kerbin\u0027s parent, sits at about 2.3KAU or 2.3x the distance Kerbin originally orbited. The entire system has been reshuffled and reorganised into a completely new layout, Jool currently sits probably around Eeloo\u0027s orbit in stock, if not past it. Yes I am aware that the system layout is probably not the most realistic, especially since i left the star as stock until I finish the modifications for the new star types to come in. The reason I have it so far out s to have a relatively \u0022stable\u0022 system in place. The system was balanced in universe sandbox 2 so the orbits themselves are stable (apart from aptur, but until i can correctly create lagrange points that is staying put), however the SMA for each planet was scaled down afterwards to fit a reasonable scale that players can actually get to.\n\nThe reason is the same i said above. Gameplay always wins over realism. Creating my system realistically would make it unplayable for most KSP players. All I have been trying to do is create a fresh start for the system, as that\u0027s what i needed to get back into the game seeing as i haven\u0027t actually had a playthrough since 0.25"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T21:23:39Z","Content":"Yeah, I see your point as regards both the position and science. It is true that, despite what science nuts like me want to believe for lack of a more fun game to compare to RL, KSP is just that ;a fun game, not a realistic space flight simulator. KSP players pay the game not (exclusively) for its attention to realism (even though it is much closer to home than others obviously), but for its fun factor, and therefore KSP is not always obliged to file some arbitrary rules just because we have been taught that\u0027s the right way - especially when fan -made mods come into play. \n\nAnyways -great job on that mod, man.
