You start out with a space craft with nothing rotating so your momentum is zero. Since no external forces, at least in our model, are acting on it, the final momentum also has to be zero. We begin spinning up a disk inside the space craft clockwise, so that it has momentum in the clockwise direction. Since we have clockwise momentum, but our final momentum has to be zero, the rest of the craft will begin to rotate counter-clockwise.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are a couple of ways you can demonstrate this.

Sit on the stool and keep your feet on the ground. Hold the bicycle wheel, so that the wheel is parallel with the ground have someone spin it for you as fast as possible.

For this one you will something with a rotating wheel that you can hold while hold the bicycle wheel. Sit in the stool with your feet off the ground. Hold the bicycle wheel in one hand the the object in the other. Press the rotating object against the wheel, so that the wheel will begin to rotate. When I did this in class, we used a drill attached to what appeared to be a hole saw with it\u0026#39;s blades ground down.
