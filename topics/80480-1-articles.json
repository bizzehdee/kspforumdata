If your crashing it\u0027s possible you have to many part mods. If your using 32 bit version of ksp that only allows 3.5 gigs of ram to be used. If the textures of all mods go over that then you crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 choices use 64 bit version of ksp. Or use a texture reduction mod to reduce the textures in 32 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe warned not all mods run well in 64bit.

The scanner and drills appear to work, but the converters don\u0027t do anything. It looks like the developer hasn\u0027t had time to update Kethane since the new release, but someone temporarily patched it for him.
