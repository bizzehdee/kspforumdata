I found a few minor issues that are probably due to the fact that they\u0027re not finished (textures/model jittered when viewed from certain angles, crew in modules not accessible, etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only feedback I could give on things that I think aren\u0027t related to the unfinished nature would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The HOME2 Hub module looks off when you stack it with round parts since it isn\u0027t quite round. Not a big deal, just noticeable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The HOME2 Living module looks odd if you stack 3.75m parts on top of it (like another Living module) because of the tapered shape. Not sure if it\u0027s worth asking for an alternate version of the Living module that doesn\u0027t taper, and if the choice is one or the other, stick with the tapered design, it works better for any case that doesn\u0027t involve stacking something big on top of the Living module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) The legs are integrated into the HOME2 Living module, which means that if we try to use the Hub module in a design that doesn\u0027t put it right under a Living module, we\u0027ll have to fuss with things to get the legs in just the right position for docking ports to line up properly. Any chance we can get a stand alone part that either goes on top of the Hub module or under it that keeps it at the right height that\u0027s lighter and/or lower profile than a Living module? Wouldn\u0027t have to be too thin, the extended modules collide with each other if you try to stack Hub modules directly on top of each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe modular nature of this is really nice. If I had this instead of the original HOME 3m stuff when I did my mothership to Jool mission, I could have used one Hub module with four greenhouses (or two greenhouses and two of something else) instead of two HOME Habitats, which would have resulted in a much more stable ship. This is definitely more usable for motherships/stations than the original HOME 3m stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Texfire","CreatedById":58165,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T00:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELove the new modules, It\u0027s going to be my new favorite lander config but have a question about one of the parts.
