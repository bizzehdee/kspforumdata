Some of us were watching a quiz show. The question came up, which APPEARS to be bigger from earth: The moon or the sun? I must admit, i did ponder for a bit, until i thought of an eclipse and came up with the correct answer that they seem to be about the same size, when looked at from earth. But one of my co-students asked, without shame:\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Okay, but which one really IS bigger?\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 (It turned out years later, when i told this story to my mum, that she didnt know either and had complete understanding for the validity of that question from an university student...) But the same person managed to top this when once after i had driven her around in my car and she tried to get out of it - and i swear i am NOT making this up -: \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4I cant get out!\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4 - \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4Well, unfasten your seatbelt\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4, i replied. That solved the problem. Drawing a line parallel to her ceiling, for painting purposes, was also an unsolvable problem to her. And no, she did not try to hit on me, or something.\n\nIt is also quite surprising how many germans think that the US had 52 states, not 50. A former roommate of mine (a bet with whom on this earned me a crate of beer) as well as the law-prof i had at the time. Well i guess he was counting money instead of counting stars (to reverse quote a pop-song).\n\nBack to meter-reading:\n\nRandom person walking by: \u0022Are you gonna do x-street today, too?\u0022\n\n- \u0022Well, i am not sure, if not today, then tomorrow.\u0022\n\n- \u0022Not before 11am at our house, please\u0022\n\nThat\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s just average everyday stuff to me - like i know which house is hers. Empathy? 0 points.\n\nI could write a book about facepalm moments connected to my job - and might actually do it, once my legs wont carry me around anymore - but i\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ll leave it at this here, for today.
