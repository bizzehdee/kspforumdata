It was 97.34t. So is that is on the heavy side?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing with Laythe is that I find it very difficult to land at a specific spot. I am trying to do the mission where you get to the creature of laythe, but as landing within only a few km, or even hitting land at all is going to be tricky, I built a small detachable rover. Then added the main 2 seater command module plus the usual ancillaries (reaction wheels, battery, solar panels etc) then I just built it out from there to have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and delta V to get back into lathe orbit to be docked with the mother ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo get the rover centered (so not to throw off the center of mass) and low to the ground for safe deployment, I built the command module above it with fuel tanks, a detachable heat shield below it (you can just see it in the picture under the rover) then put a vector engine either side straddling the rover. Seems logical right? I thought it looked pretty sweet as well! It ended up at 90ish tons. It doesn\u0027t look excessively large or heavy, especially not for these large landing legs. You can also see that I have left plenty of room under the engines and rover (after heat shield is detached while under parachutes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI kept adding parachutes to slow it down. I actually had 32 main and 8 drogue parachutes at this point, which slowed it to about 13m/s, I guess Laythe\u0027s atmosphere is thinner?\u00A0 So I throttle the\u00A0 vector engines to slow down in the last 10 seconds. It was 2m/s and looking beautiful with these large landing legs, then KABOOM! Oh, and the heat shield on the top, which is only there to keep it pointing the right way during entering the atmosphere is saying it\u0027s extended but I can\u0027t retract it, that\u0027s another bug. I guess if the mission was successful I\u0027d have to detach it from the docking port before taking off, which is a shame as I planned to use the retracted heat shield as a nose cone during the ascent through Laythe\u0027s atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022lander_legs_too_weak.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://brickshelf.com/gallery/radbot/online/lander_legs_too_weak.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-03-24T08:33:27Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2024 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Mar 24\u0022\u003EMarch 24\u003C/time\u003E by allanp11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allanp11","CreatedById":233033,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-24T08:34:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224374882\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224228\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221711260042\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225599\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Infinite deaths\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Infinite deaths said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy lander exploded using the big legs.
