I use this to get to the moon and back. I use the 2nd to last stage in the landing and jettison it around 5km from the ground. I use the last stage to land, ascent and for transkerbal injection. I learned once I land to to retract the solar panel. Once I did an EVA and jumped off the lander I hit the solar panel and broke it. I was barely able to do a transkerbal injection and make it back. I was unable to make a mid-course correction.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T03:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn game, you cannot change the size of the VAB without undergoing a major construction project at the authorization by at least three high ranking KSC employees, only the-...I\u0027m sorry, am I taking this too seriously?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"triffid_hunter","CreatedById":61814,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T12:36:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Noticeably FAT\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Noticeably FAT\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure the Editor Tools mod makes the VAB taller.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyes it does. wider too. also allows you to go through the roof from memory as well!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
