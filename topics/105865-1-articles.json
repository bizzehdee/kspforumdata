I\u0027m going to get technical here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who don\u0027t want technical, a summary: SO. MUCH. THIS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the thing: SAS is a rocket controller. Not a plane controller. I don\u0027t mean \u0022it isn\u0027t tweaked to fly rockets.\u0022 I mean the algorithm itself is designed for a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn controls engineering, there is no \u0022one solution.\u0022 (No, not even PID). And planes, dynamically, are wildly different beasts than rockets. Theoretically, the \u0022best\u0022 solution is a custom controller for every craft. However, since I don\u0027t see stock (or even mods...) giving us transfer functions and Bode diagrams anytime soon, this is never going to be feasible in KSP. At the \u003Cem\u003Every least\u003C/em\u003E, though, there should be some consideration for how fundamentally different planes and rockets behave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreaking it down a bit, here\u0027s what rocket SAS has issues with on planes, in my (fairly limited, to be honest) experience:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- The damping ratio on roll is ridiculously low. Over-rolling is incredibly frequent in many small aircraft. On the flip side, and this is where the \u0022one size does NOT fit all\u0022 thing comes in, larger aircraft with longer wings can barely roll at all, even with a fair amount of control surfaces!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- There is zero tolerance for pitch instability. I\u0027ve kept an aircraft with center of pressure ahead of center of mass under control in KSP 1.0, but there\u0027s no way to harness the instability (as in real-life aircraft like the Su-27 and F-22).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Yaw...I don\u0027t even know. Most designs I see don\u0027t have enough tail, but even so, constant veering in one direction \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be damped out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- Control inputs \u003Cem\u003Etotally disable\u003C/em\u003E the controller! This is the behavior I\u0027d most like to see changed. Control inputs should be inputs to the controller, not overrides for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAS seems to be the same algorithm for all control axes (roll, pitch, yaw). That works pretty well for rockets, but it doesn\u0027t for planes. Ultimately, a slightly different controller for each axis would make a world of difference, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the flip side:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea how this would be implemented for planes and planes only. By cockpit? No good, they\u0027re used for plenty of other things. A separate hotkey? Probably confusing. A different class of Kerbal *could* work, but I\u0027d personally prefer Jeb and Val to be able to fly both planes and spacecraft. It\u0027s certainly a tricky issue to circumvent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Maybe one of these days I\u0027ll stop being so grumpy about sticking to C\u002B\u002B and Python, learn C# and Unity, and make a controller mod myself....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T02:23:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 02:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngusJimiKeith\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T03:54:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LadyAthena\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LadyAthena\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso are completely rocket based.

A jet that provides 150kN on the runway somehow can blast 1000kN under the right conditions, then can drop to 0 as soon as you pass 20km or so. I don\u0027t usually *want* that much power out of an engine, for one. But I find the wild variability annoying to design around to fly (with most jets, if you don\u0027t throttle down as soon as you clear the runway you\u0027ll go down in a fireball). Slightly tamer curves would be a welcome change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAutopilot/SAS - I would love some more plane-oriented stability system, a keypress or HUD button would be fine for this. A pitch hold, wing leveler, and autorudder would be my biggest requests, and maybe a roll/yaw switch. It seems that it should be easy to toggle out SAS for this alternate system with a keypress. I would also love to see control inputs as inputs to the SAS controller rather than temporarily disengaging it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want ejection seats, there are mods that cover that and give kerbals personal parachutes. That should be sufficient. Maybe someday Squad will add something like that, but I expect it\u0027s pretty far down their list (also ejecting isn\u0027t really an option at the super-high speeds that most KSP vehicles operate).

Also, with stock aerodynamics, making them extend back from the wing on deployment wouldn\u0027t change them functionally (okay it would move their CoL by a few inches, but that wouldn\u0027t be noticeable), the pitch is what actually matters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stealth2668","CreatedById":57377,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T14:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso a stock tool to make custom wing parts one piece.

A jet that provides 150kN on the runway somehow can blast 1000kN under the right conditions, then can drop to 0 as soon as you pass 20km or so. I don\u0027t usually *want* that much power out of an engine, for one. But I find the wild variability annoying to design around to fly (with most jets, if you don\u0027t throttle down as soon as you clear the runway you\u0027ll go down in a fireball). Slightly tamer curves would be a welcome change.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you fly the plane like a plane, you\u0027d have tamer curves.

I wouldn\u0027t mind stuff tapering off (even lower, maybe 16km or whatever), but it should be *somewhat* gradual. The switch suddenly happens and it\u0027s the abruptness that bothers me. The engines blast along better than ever than and then they switch off and you squeeze out the last bits on momentum alone. I\u0027d like them to taper down and find some sense of equilibrium. My issue is that I constantly need to readjust the throttle because the thrust curves work out that you either slow down to a crawl (or stall) or accelerate until the ship breaks up from heat, at least with the turbojet and RAPIER.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion_herrera","CreatedById":66284,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:48:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuestion: In real life, name one aircraft flown via a keyboard.
