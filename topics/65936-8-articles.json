So I\u0027ve been playing with the design concept of logistics - basically, the auto-transfer of resources between MKS modules without direct connections. The main rub has been that this can feel too much like \u0027magic\u0027. so I would like to put forth a design proposal for early feedback that I think mitigates this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world, interconnection of modules for a colony should not be required to transfer stuff. Folks would either hand carry, or more likely, use rovers to shuttle resources around. thus, a new part will be created (along with a subassembly) that is basically a cargo rover body. These would be parked in between modules to build and extend logistics chains. Working numbers are 50m from a Rover to the Colony Hub or an MKS module, 100m between Rovers. There has to be a chain from the MKS module to the Colony Hub for this to work, but with enough Rovers, players could build very large supply chains.

So I\u0027ve been playing with the design concept of logistics - basically, the auto-transfer of resources between MKS modules without direct connections. The main rub has been that this can feel too much like \u0027magic\u0027. so I would like to put forth a design proposal for early feedback that I think mitigates this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the real world, interconnection of modules for a colony should not be required to transfer stuff. Folks would either hand carry, or more likely, use rovers to shuttle resources around. thus, a new part will be created (along with a subassembly) that is basically a cargo rover body. These would be parked in between modules to build and extend logistics chains. Working numbers are 50m from a Rover to the Colony Hub or an MKS module, 100m between Rovers. There has to be a chain from the MKS module to the Colony Hub for this to work, but with enough Rovers, players could build very large supply chains.
