I had thought it was part of a toroidal space station/asteroid mining mod, but I\u0027m likely misremembering. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that I have the full game, and I\u0027m having fun pushing asteroids around, I can\u0027t find that mod again in spite of looking for what seems like a long time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d really like a grappler that\u0027s less \u0027whippy\u0027 when attached to an asteroid. I built a three-point grappler using trusses and three stock grabbers, since some people on the forum had said that worked for them, but I\u0027ve not yet tried it and it seems like an awful kludge, and probably much heavier than alternative methods. I heard about the \u0027pull\u0027 method of moving asteroids, but it seems a bit less realistic, and I\u0027ve yet to try it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone help me find the mod I\u0027m thinking of?
