This is generally because if you seem to be their tech level, plus a couple decades, then they can draw conclusions about what you can do. And if you sent just a simple solar sail probe over then they can somewhat reasonably assume that you are incapable of landing an invasion force. As a result, they will likely take knowledge of your existence a little more calmly. Meanwhile of course, you are cloaked in orbit having gotten there in your warp drive (coming out on the backside of the moon to hide the gamma burst) and watching the news in real time, possibly even hacking their data systems with your quantum computers, to see how exactly it is that they are going to react. Once it looks like you can trust that they have peaceful intentions, then you let them know that in X number of years a peace envoy will be arriving. This ship would display better technology, but not enough to make them suspicious. Maybe you show off your nuclear drives fueled from comet water, etc. Old hat to you, but new to them. Just don\u0027t go too far or they will get suspicious. The meeting happens, you set things up and as you grow ties between the groups you slowly let them in on the technology. This is particularly useful because it keeps you ahead of them for a while, meaning that if you end up having any sort of interstellar trading going on (information or rare valuables), you end up with the better part of things. But you also get to seem generous, passing off old technologies to them, with them believing that you are willing to just hand over your bleeding edge technologies rather than guard them. Such generosity will tend to slowly color and influence relations between the groups favorably. Eventually they are up at your level, and you have been nothing but kind to them, which if you are a peaceful race, is probably what you wanted in the first place. Sure eventually they figure out what you did, but by that point they would likely see the logic in it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, this thread made me think of a new scifi book. It starts with some astronomers detecting the incoming solar sail ship. They figure out relatively quickly what it is given its tremendous speed, size, and low mass. So they try to talk to it. We end up getting a message back explaining the dire situation on board. Their original plan had been to have laser boosted acceleration into the system, then they would detach their first sail to use as a reflector for the laser beam, and use that to slow down. Only something went wrong, they have last communications with their home planet and the laser was no longer active. The sun will slow them down, but they are going too fast for that to keep them in the solar system. They can adjust their orbit to buy is several more months, but they need our help to survive as they do not have the resources for another interstellar journey. They transmit over schematics for a massive laser cannon, a copy of the one they used, and power plants. This thing is massive and in the time we have, nations have to come together to share the economic burden of making something so massive in such a short time period. The book of course would cover the political situation of nations jockeying over the choice bits of the systems construction. Who gets to keep the death ray (IE: Where is it built) etc. The social setup of this, people who believe we should build it vs people who don\u0027t. The devious plan by someone to retarget the laser system to blast the \u0022invading\u0022 aliens rather than help them. All that jazz.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally in one series I read, after humans had invented warp drive, they went around to all the cryo-sleeper ships to wake everybody up and ask if they wanted a warp ship instead.

Assuming they have fusion drives or better and have adapted to life in space (they may colonize systems with no terrestrial planets) such, they may prefer to start with small gravity wells - it start mining the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt, Earth, with all of its biohazards and its nearly 10 km/s dV requirments, and resources hidden deep underground, may not be attractive to them. However, its industrial output may be of interest to them. If we build stuff for them, they can grow their colony faster. I don\u0027t foresee direct enslavement - more like they give us technology, and we have to build stuff for them, perhaps this is arranged via \u0022gunboat diplomacy\u0022 - accept, or they bombard us from beyond earth orbit (likely only delivered to governments in secret).

They are only good against civilizations that are limited to one system with a handful of planets.

Earth would not pose an existntial threat to them if they\u0027re already expanding across start systems. If they\u0027re here, they\u0027re long past their single inhabited planet stage.
