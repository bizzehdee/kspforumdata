So, there\u0027s a point where it\u0027s slightly more efficient to have multiple smaller thrusters compared to a single larger thruster, but it depends on how much power you can actually supply. With regards to the 1.25m and 2.5m engines, you should stick with the 1.25m engines and add a new one for every 25GW of power you have available, until you get above 150GW. However, if you\u0027re not beaming that power in, the extra mass will have a fairly-negligible effect on your total dV when compared to the mass of the rest of your ship and the adapters to mount the extra engines, so you might as well go with a 2.5m engine if it fits your ship\u0027s aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Einarr","CreatedById":4809,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T20:15:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny tips for building a spaceplane utilizing the thermal turbojets for atmospheric flight, followed by a thermal rocket once the jets are no longer effective?
