To do this easily, the whole thing will be able to be launched as smaller sub-parts, landed, docked together, and then it can crawl its way from one Kethane deposit to the next on solar power, that way I don\u0027t have to re-launch and re-land the thing when the current deposit has run dry. An additional benefit is that I can still separate each module from the others to move them around on more rugged terrain, or to \u0022mountain-hop\u0022 (small sub-orbital \u0022hop\u0022 to get over something instead of having to drive all the way around it) them to reduce travel time.
