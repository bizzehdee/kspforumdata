I was building it at about the same time as the SpaceLifter (next one). I was having trouble getting anything up into orbit and I was playing with HL chassis spaceplanes that somehow kept losing control or not going into orbit. One of the things I learnt with this design is that less can be more. Because the Mk4 chassis doesn\u0027t have any engine mounts at the rear, I had to use engine mounts on the wings. So I used lots of small SABRE engines mounted above and below the wing with a Eurofighter-style delta wing-plan. This worked better than mounting fewer SABRE M engines nearer the rear. Once I learnt this lesson, I went back and redesigned the SpaceLifter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did transport cargo to orbit successfully with this, but the awkward loading bay at the rear caused an explosion in the Munar module (the Command module was fine) when somehow it interpenetrated with one of the sections. I think it was a bug. A reload later and the module blew up in the cargo hold. The SkyLifter didn\u0027t notice, though. At the time, I remember how it handled the weight beautifully and was a joy to fly. I\u0027ve since revisited it and it\u0027s not nearly as good as I remember: getting it off the runway requires several attempts and it still has bad low altitude handling. I\u0027ve never landed it successfully, as the explosion did take out the battery packs and it was a remote-guided test flight. Once I switched off the engines, it lost power and did the whole re-entry unguided. It was still flying when it spiralled gently into the ocean many minutes later, so a good design. But it would have been nice to land it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003ESpaceLifter (HL Chassis)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8RxbK8T.png\u0022 alt=\u00228RxbK8T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/yyowy43xiedqdb1/AI-400%20SpaceLifter.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ECraft File\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EBizarrely, every time I flew this in a mission, the rear SABRE M blew up partway through the flight.

In a test flight, I flew it up and docked it with my space station. I was really pleased with this design, but when I came back to it, it did flips of death on the runway every time it tried to take off.

So I went and added an extra S2 fuel tank. By now I was starting to be very aware that changing one small thing can lead to an almost completely different design, which makes redesigning from scratch imperative sometimes. The Undine Plus was an example of this. It handles slightly worse than the Undine in nearly every single way and is prone to transsonic instability. It\u0027s still a good craft and it gets to 366km where my space-station is, so I\u0027m happy, but I have the feeling that if I redesigned it completely, it would have been an impovement. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EBlended Wing Proto 2\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/0CNr2Rz.png\u0022 alt=\u00220CNr2Rz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThis one I\u0027m really proud of, although it hasn\u0027t got a name yet. I\u0027m thinking of taking this to a release level and replacing the SpaceLifter as my small Heavy Lifter. It\u0027s completely experimental and came from being inspired by the \u003C/span\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-48B\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ENASA X-48B\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E design and seeing that the B9 inspired procedural wing had an option to change the thickness. The idea of a blended wing is to mix the wing and the body so the body produces lift. In spaceplanes, which are pretty heavy, and in which the weight is concentrated in the middle, this can be exceptionally useful and can take a lot of strain off the wing-body junction as well as maximise lift. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EThe awesomeness of this design is that it has really good handling characteristics at all altitude levels, from what I can tell. It has none of the problems of the Entente in that regard. The blended wing design also allows for easier attachment of landing gear in a manner that works sensibly, so this thing is the most stable thing I have ever put down a runway and takes off the best. But, despite all of this, it still has a 40m/s greater take-off speed than the Entente.

Behold the X-693 Super-heavy tanker. The picture maybe doesn\u0027t do it justice, but those are the 3.75m large tanks from KW Rocketry. The thing weighs 518tons on take-off and holds a staggering 40,000ish amounts of fuel, of which 3/4 seem to get into LKO. I haven\u0027t actually got a use for such a beast yet, as my space station doesnt have enough tanking capacity and, in fact, probably never will. Drat. But, still, if I want to create a fuel dump at some point, it would be worth having. I\u0027m also interested how it\u0027ll handle in DREC once I install that. The ballistic coeeficient should be small, so I think it should handle it, but... *fingers crossed* \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EX-683a Piggyback Lifter\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UEt8QQr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UEt8QQr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigned to deliver piggyback loads into orbit, particularly in this variant, four 3.75m fuel tanks.
