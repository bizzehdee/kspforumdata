Since then I scrapped the design because I figured if it\u0027s that bad when I am flying it, how bad will it be if I decide to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I know this is a very open ended question and it will depend on many factors like computer specs, moded parts, settings of the game etc etc but is there a \u0022sweet spot\u0022 when it comes to a number of parts when building something? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of my settings are default, but I have turned off v-sync and AA and the game does not run heavy at all, only when I over-engineer things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the specs for my laptop (will move the game to a PC after, way more power on that) but I have upgraded the RAM to 16 gigs. Although, as far as I understand, game is more dependent on GPU and CPU rather than RAM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely going to stay will try to stay with as few parts as possible but I really like building huge things and I understand very well that it will come down to me experimenting to find the sweet spot, but wanted to see if anyone had advice on how to maybe make the game more efficient considering I would want to take advantage of docking things to the space station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR I go part crazy, what would you recommend, based on the specs, should be the preferred number of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are the laptop specs if this helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.cnet.com/laptops/asus-k55vd-ds71-15/4507-3121_7-35280046.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.cnet.com/laptops/asus-k55vd-ds71-15/4507-3121_7-35280046.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I rushed, found this topic. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45979-How-to-stop-Space-Station-Framerate-drop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45979-How-to-stop-Space-Station-Framerate-drop\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThread can be deleted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------\u0026gt; k retarded question but how does one mark a thread as answered....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T13:13:30Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 01:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Amoun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheDarkStar","CreatedById":37056,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T02:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEdit the post and change the topic to start with [ANSWERED!], as far as I know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T02:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust remember you have to go in Edit post, and then \u0022Go Advanced\u0022.
