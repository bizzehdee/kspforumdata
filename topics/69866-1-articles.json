I\u0027m orbiting low over Eeloo, preparing to try my landing - with a proven craft, I might add.

Probably some of them are clipping into each other, and phantom forces are tearing everything apart. If you have panels on action group button, you can try folding them immediately after save loads.

Not only can I fold and unfold them normally up to the point where I undock, but also, previous versions of the craft (using the exact same solar wings) don\u0027t do this behavior either. I\u0027ve also undocked with the ship folded up and SAS off. Still shreds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe it is though. maybe its such a borderline case that it doesn\u0027t cause issues except in the \u0022perfect storm\u0022 circumstance.

Come to think of it, the to row might be colliding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne constant here is that the battery always snaps off the ship and remains stuck to the docking point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had similar oscillating implosions occur to a number of ships of radically different designs and sizes since the update. I believe some part of the physics update is responsible. I just never had Gravidon III do it before, and that makes me sad. This craft and it\u0027s brethren have been proving exceptionally capable among Ion landers up to this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll review it\u0027s many variations and see if there isn\u0027t some critical difference between them that may have destabilized the latest model. Come to think of it, I think my Dres landing had one freak-out as well (albeit much less catastrophic), and its the same version. Could be some clues in that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the past, struts are usually the solution to this physics bug, but struts could really hurt the performance of a lightweight like this one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-20T02:51:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2014 02:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T21:39:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m gonna go ahead and eat my words - I believe the solar panes WERE related to my my problem.
