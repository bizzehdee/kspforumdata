When you reach 500 parts even with a good computer you will start feeling the lag even more so when you want to meet with your station using a 300 part ssto it will kill your computer. Use the biggest parts you can find. You want a refueling station up there? Use the biggest fuel tank you can get. If you don\u0027t have it you can just get rid of old tanks when you have bigger fuel tanks. Make the utility module separate from the parts that you are never going to change so that when you want to use the bigger models of solar panels or be it reaction wheels or maybe batteries you can just discard the obsolete module and put the new one in.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
