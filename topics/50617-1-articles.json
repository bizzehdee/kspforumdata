He waited patiently, circling Kerbin every 30 or so minutes, to put his name down in Kerbal history. It had been just over a year since Stephen Kerman first developed his warp theory, and although the logic had been proven over again there was no way of applying it, until now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CCome in, Explorer 1\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 A rough voice called, interrupting the absolute silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThis is Explorer 1, where are we with this thing?

An atmosphere of sorrow permeated the mission control room. Nobody knew or wanted to know the horrible fate Bill may have succumbed to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment of warp Bill was blinded and tossed about the confined cabin of the pod. He heard a large boom and then another followed by multiple alarms and flashing lights. The ship began to fall into a tumble. Bill was allowed a brief look out his window were he did not see Duna, but what looked to be Kerbin, but something was wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CGround control this is Explorer 1, we have had major failures Fusion reactors 1 and 2 have been disabled\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 Bill cried out with shrill desperation. A glance to his left at the radar indicated he was fast approaching the planet; he had no choice, but to perform an emergency landing. With the flick of a single switch a chorus of mechanical noises filled the cabin followed shortly after by a loud \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cclunk!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and the separation of the capsule. Shortly after he hit the upper atmosphere, red flames began to flicker and dance outside his window. It wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t until he reached the real dense atmosphere when the craft began to glow a brilliant red, and then streaked through the air forming contrails. As the activity began to die down slightly Bill reached out a pressed a small green button. The capsule slowed slightly, but violently jerked side to side as the parachute that had been damaged during the failure of the fusion reactors broke roughly half the strings. He was going to fast he surely wouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make it. The radar counted down: 500m\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6300m\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6200m\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6100m. Bill clenched his hands together and uttered a short prayer as the capsule smashed into the ground. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChapter 2: We\u0027re coming to Equestria\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a beautiful day in Ponyville: the sun hung atop the sky looking down upon bustling ponies visiting the market, going to work, or just chatting with friends. All seemed at peace when a large \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CBOOM!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 was heard overhead. Shocked eyes turned skywards as the ponies traced two objects in the sky. The larger of the two objects seemed to be on fire, ablaze with a red glow slowly disintegrated as it reached the ground. The other however stayed together, and as the flames began to die off it shot out a large piece of fabric that nearly tore lose sending the mysterious object crashing into a nearby plain. Within minutes ponies were already crowding to get a glimpse at what had happened. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CClear a path!\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 two white ponies called out, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWe need to check for injured.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were looking for ponies who could have been hit by the debris, but near the center of the crash site they spotted a single green creature dressed in some bulky orange suit and a large helmet. Partially in shock the two white ponies immediately dragged the lifeless green body onto a stretcher. As they exited the crash site shocked gasps followed by a wave of chatter seemed to follow the group. Nopony could believe a creature had fallen from the sky, and that creature wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even a pony. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the hospital they weren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t able to accomplish much: Bill had been loaded into a bed, his helmet removed, and he began to appear somewhat stable. It was decided by the mayor that Canterlot officials would not be involved in this affair, and that the leadership of Ponyville will be able to handle itself in this situation. To decide on how they should approach the situation Mayor Mare brought together a small council made up of various ponies from around town, including Twilight Sparkle. The meeting was rather brief, and two major decisions were made. The creature would be handed off to Fluttershy to nurse it back to health, and once the creature was deemed healthy interspecies conversation would begin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill was still unconscious when he was delivered to Flutershy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cottage; the doctors informed her he should be awake within a few hours. Fluttershy scrambled to prepare. She placed Bill on the couch and covered him with a small blanket. After her cottage was spotless she sat in front of the strange creature filled with excitement and fear. The creature began to stir, first one then two eyes, and know Bill was fixated on Fluttershy\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s smiling face.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-03T10:57:40Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2013 10:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by aceassasin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sytaline","CreatedById":64225,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-27T18:57:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry typing it up on the ksp forums\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aceassasin","CreatedById":20841,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T10:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust finished Chapter 3: \u0022Close Encounters of the Kerbal Kind\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand for convinience here is a typed version:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClose Encounters of the Kerbal Kind\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as Bill saw Fluttershy he was filled with a crippling fear, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CWhat is this creature; What is it going to do to me, and Where am I?\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 All questions rushed through Bill\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s mind as he began to hyperventilate and panic. However he began to feel a calm rush over him as Fluttershy softly said, \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s okay you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need to be scared.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 He could not understand what she was staying, but something inside him said she did not incite malicious intent. Fluttershy asked if he was hungry, but all she got was a slightly confused look from the green creature. Realizing the language barrier between them she did her best to imitate eating. Bill gave a quick nod, and Fluttershy dissapered into another room. Moments later she re-emerged holding a bowl with strange looking plants in it. Bill gazed into the bowl, which consisted of various greens, fruits, and vegetables. The variance of color was utterly alien to Bill, all he had ever eaten back on Kerbin was the various grasses native to his homeplanet. He cautiously picked up a red wedge with a whitish interior. Taking a bite the sweet flavor filled his mouth, and he continued to devour the entire assortment in the bowl. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I guess you were hungry,\u0022 Fluttershy giggled. \u0022Well now that that\u0027s done lets check out your leg, the doctor mentioned it may be injured.\u0022 She slowly touched Bill\u0027s right leg. A sharp pain raced through Bill\u0027s entire body and he let out a loud cry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh my, that is quite the break, We need to wrap it as soon as possible,\u0022 she said as she trotted into another day. Bill sat there on the couch, many questions raced through his mind, \u0022Where am I?\u0022, \u0022What are these strange creatures?\u0022,\u0022What are they going to do with me?\u0022 Before he could think anymore Fluttershy walked back in holding a large kit in her mouth. She set it down next to Bill popped the lock revealing various medical supplies. She pulled out some strange materials, and began wrapping them around Bill\u0027s leg. After his leg was wrapped Fluttershy brought in two crutches for Bill to use. Ponies and Kerbals were roughly the same height so he adjusted relatively easily to them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Now, all better,\u0022 Fluttershy stated confidently. \u0022Oh,my I almost forgot, where will you be sleeping? Ummm... I really don\u0027t want to make Angel give up his spot on the couch, so I guess you could just sleep in the bed with me.\u0022 Bill payed no attention to the words utterly alien to him, but to the sweetness of Fluttershy\u0027s voice; It had only been a few hours, and he already had a deep sense of trust in her. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat night Bill relaxed and truly rested for the first time in a while. Equestria was very different from Kerbin. The constant sounds of engines tests and launches that persisted nearly everyday were replaced by the silent night save only the chirping of the crickets. As he lay there quietly staring at the ceiling while Fluttershy was fast asleep he wondered. \u0022What is this place like?\u0022, \u0022Will the other creatures be as friendly?\u0022, and \u0022Will I be able to go home?\u0022 and with that he closed his eyes and was soon asleep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krevsin","CreatedById":83150,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T15:10:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am quite interested to see where this will go. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as criticism is concerned, I don\u0027t really have anything that\u0027s really worth criticising.
