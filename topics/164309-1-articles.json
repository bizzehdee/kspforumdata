And when i wanted to \u00A0test drive my rover the connection is completely fine in the beginning, but as soon as i start driving I lose connection and when I\u00A0lose the wheels stop spinning. A fraction of a second later i regain connection because im not using the wheels and this ends up with the connection display flickering and my top speed being about 2\u00A0m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis might be a bug.
