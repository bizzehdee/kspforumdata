Proving that FAR is no barrier to making crazy stuff fly!\n\u003E Maximum speed around Mach 0.8, it has Wheeslies as well as turboprops but **this is obviously not a supersonic design.**\n\nWell how do you know if you don\u0027t even try?! ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif) Seriously, awesome invention, though.

I made it mostly with procedural fuel tanks. Apparently they\u0027re lighter than procedural structural elements, so I just took a load of them and removed a lot of fuel, and hey presto, a lightweight plane! The procedural parts allowed me to make a much sleeker plane than my previous designs.\n\nVery clever idea to use procedural tanks to sculpt the plane, and it turned out beautifully, too! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nIt\u0027s been too long since I\u0027ve posted anything. I\u0027ve been flying a lot of DCS: Fw-190, Bf-109, and P-51 Mustang, so I wanted to make a plane that behaved similarly to those old WW2 fighters.\n\nThere\u0027s no engine torque, or prop wash striking the left side of the tail, but in a fortunate quirk of KSP wheel-collider shenanigans, the plane required a lot of footwork on the rudder pedals when taking off and landing, which so closely mirrored their real-world counterparts, I was ecstatic! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nIt\u0027s not much to look at, and I\u0027ve tweaked the KAX radial prop as best I could, such that it\u0027ll deliver 400 knots in level flight. It\u0027s still a bit OP, but also fun, flying low and slow through mountain passes. It\u0027ll land at a very smooth 100 knots on almost any terrain, too. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Just touch down at 60m/s or less (prob possible at slightly higher speeds too), which isn\u0027t exactly a problem with a stall speed of below 40m/s.\n\nEven if you do start to yaw, the thing won\u0027t flip, so that\u0027s no issue either.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T07:05:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 07:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FourGreenFields**"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T07:05:53Z","Content":"Here\u0027s my Rafale.
