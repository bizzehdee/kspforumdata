With a scientist the contract could give more science, with a pilote more reps... It would add a layer of the newly introduced roles.*\n\n*Or even you should use stupidity and courage too to adjust the contract\u0027s overall parameters adding variatons.*\n\n*Stupidity can be trained???* ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) *Or courage rises with successfull missions? then there should be a contract wich specially targets their education maybe from the \u0022own Firm\u0022* \n\n**Hauling / pinpoint landing contracts?**\n\n-Pick up something from a planet/orbit and land/orbit it to another one. (almost like the kerbal rescue but better variation on target end source celestial body, and this package should have weight and shape and size especially for landing missions)\n\n(1 star could be M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn to Minmus ViceVersa, or from kerbin to its moons or back limitation in size: small little weight like probes or boxes..etc)\n\n(2 star could be even more weight to carry or nearby SOI-s)\n\n(3 star could be something like including 2-3 times SOI changes between destinations)\n\n-Pinpoint landing maybe even mined materials which can be \u0022sell\u0022 in this way as a contract\n\n1 star contract: mine x ton of \u0022ExoticMaterial\u0022 on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and park it to Kerbin\u0027s northpole\n\n... \n\n3 star Mine .. from Eve and park it to Eelo/Moho/Laythe for instance...\n\n(This would be a broad wanting feature I think as I see the mods: Mining)\n\nOr even \u0022easter egg finding\u0022 as a contract Just land a craft after a suborbital flight/stable orbit at x.y \u0022GPS coordinates\u0022 on Kerbin (more stars: other planets)\n\n**Contracts Including some kind of interplanetary (not in the game yet) feature**\n\nLike shipbuilding/launching in orbital dock, or on other celestials\n\nWith Specific part/ Specific celestials\n\nEven more landing site on Kerbin integrated would be nice and contracts with 1 star should point them out\n\n(This would be a broad wanting feature I think as I see the mods: orbital or other planets launch)\n\n**Contracts could/should unlocks features/parts...**\n\nComplex contracts with neither money nor science nor rep gain, but a \u0022special\u0022 usefull parts opening in tech tree OR maybe not in the tech tree.\n\nEven give it a 3-5-10 steps to complete the contract.\n\nadded: \n\n**Better \u0022involvation\u0022 of your own creations**\n\nLike contracts related to do something with Your launched and named stations/bases maybe installing something new to it or even changing something like an antena for a better one. change it\u0027s orientation reposition it to another orbit (usefull I mean)\n\nFor scansat all repositions should be some kind of highly inclined orbit and such...\n\nOr docking with it. I really missing contracts involving docking.\n\nBut the update is something we all do in carrier I guess. As better parts unlocking we should deorbit our old garbage and launch a new one with the new/better equipment.\n\nIt shouldn\u0027t be hard to implement as you already have the specific orbit kind missions. I think that shouldn\u0027t be too hard to track a specific \u0022ship\u0022 in either landed or destructed as a status when this kind of contract is in effect.\n\n**More E.V.A. / automated maintenance related contracts (invovling lot more possibilities on eva (minimum like K.A.S. mod) OR robotic parts like infernal Robotics)**\n\nAnd that\u0027s how we could change on the fly our stuff like antenas, docking ports. \n\nNot to mention building in space if the grab and place functions stok recreated and better supported... \n\nBut as for EVA-s (3 possibility is not the kind of variation which ties down players for too long so it should be at least 50 including skydive ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) with an EVA chute... )\n\n**Contracts involving manufacturing**\n\nJust like printing xthousand of rocketparts or something better...\n\nPerhaps for this we need mining and a station/base with managed inputs/outputs/workflow/maybe even life supporting it (we talking here a stock game so theese features are minimal I think)\n\n**Contracts including \u0022alien lifeforms\u0022**\n\nThis one could be neat even if it is not an inteligent lifeform scattered around at least one celestial body (minimal option: Kerbin scatter like trees, just with birds/cows alternatives)\n\nbut it would be better to dedicate them a whole planet other than kerbin\n\nSo you can make sience learning their habbits, scanning all kind of data near them, EVA \u0022todo\u0022 possibilities and such.\n\nIf they were \u0022inteligent\u0022 then we could negotiate or erradicate them ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) But I know THAT is TOO much to ask.\n\n**Contracts including more possibilities with asteroids** \n\njust towing/pushing/ejecting them is fun. but building on them a base, or mining them is just pure joy, or using them as refueling containers after melting their inside is practical. Not to mention the posibilities onward you have a huge amount of mineable resource which can later used to manufacture things or convert them to \u0022fuel/lifesupport/Money as selling them in KSP/etc\u0022\n\nMore science dedicated to them like soil analisys, surface (or better inside/core) temperature scan could make the game a lot more fun.\n\n**Contracts including Science over time**\n\nAs for not overpowering science over time just limit the amount a part can \u0022gather\u0022 and you have to manually gather the data periodically (on a pendrive or such) and land it on one of your \u0022command bases/orbital docks\u0022 (I assume you DO HAVE TO enable us to make command bases/launchpads outside Kerbin)\n\nSo for the Science over time is: (I am sorry to mention but look at rockstars favourite san andreas you bought a shop and you had to periodicaly go there and collect the money) in this way it should be \u0022containers\u0022 attached to a special part limitting the amount of how many science it can gather even what rate... \n\nSo if enought scientist working on that project they \u0022make something ongoing\u0022 therefore the science constantly flowing as long as they have enought magnetic space tape to record the data... or such.\n\nSo as for the contracts? maybe more part with different ongoing options and the contract can specify which one the contractor want to get X science returned to kerbin (or another dedicated built off kerbin command base)\n\nIn this way we need a module, a big enought recorder capacity (some time it is fullfilling) and a carrier (commandpod should do it with a rocket/spaceplane of course) and a destination \u0022planet/base/station\u0022 to land /dock it with.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T17:52:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ricardo79**\n  \nMore Ideas"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T02:57:17Z","Content":"Great post - have some rep!

Along with other fine additions as mods but I cannot came up with for example a mechjeb contract.\n\nI think these must be unified, standardised, make them self compatible with each other, so basicly they should be in Vanila version. \n\nThis games gets a lot of attention MOSTLY because of the mods. and so... something in progress already have mods which is used commonly about 1-10 million or maybe more people... If I would be the programmer surely prioritize to including them officially.\n\nOn the other hand the basic idea of having a NASA simulator sandbox with a purpose is great. So allowing us to participate in missions is the best way to show people of what they could do with this nice box of LEGO. So in short... There should be a waaaay tooo moooore Kerbtracts."}]}
