You can then find an 5km intercept without ever establishing orbit at all (you establish orbit as you approach and slow your relative speed instead). The upside to this is less expended fuel trying to rendezvous and a much faster intercept. The downside to this is you end up approaching the target very fast, so you need to be on your toes.\n\nThis gets a little harder if it isn\u0027t equatorial, but still possible.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T17:40:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T18:12:52Z","Content":"I added the click and drag thing to the wiki.

You can only launch twice per (Kerbin) day -- when either the AN or DN of your target\u0027s orbit passes overhead -- which means that you can\u0027t launch straight to rendezvous unless your target passes overhead at the same time. If your target\u0027s AN is passing overhead, you need to launch to 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0-target\\_inclination. If the DN is passing overhead, you need 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u002Btarget inclination. After launch, rotate 3-4\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 west of that heading to account for Kerbin\u0027s eastward rotation. When you start getting significant horizontal velocity (pitched down to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or so), switch to the map screen and observe how well your sub-orbital arc aligns with the target orbit. You can rotate left and right as you ascend to adjust your orbit\u0027s inclination to match the target. (This sounds difficult, but is surprisingly easy to do if you try it.) Push your orbit out to the target\u0027s altitude, coast to apoapsis and proceed to rendezvous as normal.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T18:32:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaezan","CreatedById":108274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:16:21Z","Content":"The best way to learn orbital rendezvous is to practice.\n\nLaunch a station with 4-5 docking ports.

You still need to know what you are doing to give it commands. Since it can fail from time to time. And it is really not possible to do some of the precision movements like getting a sattelite into specific orbit using mechjeb. Sure you can get close to it easy. But then its up to you to create the node and make precision movements. On the other hand mechjeb makes boring and repetetive tasks like executing a node that you created or orbit ascent easy. Just create your node and let the mechjeb execute it with precision. Why warp yourself and then use the thrust yourself its just repetitive. If you want to intercept something from ascent even mechjeb can\u0027t do it in 1 go atm. It will takeoff at a close encounter and get you into a close orbit near your target. But then you need to use randevous autopilot. Even then the randevous autopilot cannot do moves like randevous with something that is in a polar orbit while you are in equatorial orbit. It will probably try going trough the planet itself and crash you. The thing is manuvers are allready calculated and executed by computers in real life. The only thing the pilot does is either give the manuver info to computer or just sit there and supervise it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T19:41:22Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 07:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by n0xiety**"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T20:40:03Z","Content":"There\u0027s a couple of rules of thumb, but for most Kerbin intercepts (which are equatorial), I launch just before the target passes overhead, and I launch into a lower orbit.

If you have KER, add up the burn times of every stage until the cumulative dV reaches 3,3km/s or so. Based on that you can decide how far back the target needs to be behind KSC for you to properly time your launch.\n\nThen, while launching when you get within 100km of your target you switch the navball to target navigation so you see your relative velocities, and you push your relative retrograde-velocity marker on to your anti-target marker as close as you can, while monitoring your closest approach until they minimize. The retrograde-velocity marker can be pushed by burning on the far-side of the anti-target marker.\n\nAt the same time you need to track your distance and the amount of distance you will traverse to cancel out your relative velocity with the V^2/2A formula ((relative) velocity squared divided by double your acceleration) so you don\u0027t let your target overshoot you.\n\nAs long as you don\u0027t need to burn more than 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 away from your retro velocity marker you don\u0027t lose more than ~5% of your total mission dV.\n\nAnd just practice and practice.

Besides, at a certain point in your KSP career, it becomes more about building your space program, and less about actually piloting all the missions yourself. I generally personally fly all my \u0022historically significant\u0022 missions (all my first landings, major launch of a new interplanetary explorer class ship, etc). But do you really want to do something like personally dock every single fuel tanker transport coming from Minmus to your LKO refuelling station? I don\u0027t. Those are what I fly with MechJeb fully automating, since it will go far faster. I\u0027m good at flying and docking, but MechJeb, since it uses time acceleration so well, can fly a Minmus fuel mission to my LKO station and have it docked there in a tenth the time I can do it myself - for a mission profile I\u0027ve done a half dozen times personally and need to do at least a dozen times every Kerbal year."},{"CreatedByName":"Rickenbacker","CreatedById":2349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T09:02:17Z","Content":"Draw an imaginary, straight line that crosses the outer orbit and just tangents the inner orbit where the orbiting craft is.
