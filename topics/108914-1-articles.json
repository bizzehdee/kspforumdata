You can only launch twice per (Kerbin) day -- when either the AN or DN of your target\u0027s orbit passes overhead -- which means that you can\u0027t launch straight to rendezvous unless your target passes overhead at the same time. If your target\u0027s AN is passing overhead, you need to launch to 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0-target_inclination. If the DN is passing overhead, you need 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u002Btarget inclination. After launch, rotate 3-4\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 west of that heading to account for Kerbin\u0027s eastward rotation. When you start getting significant horizontal velocity (pitched down to 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or so), switch to the map screen and observe how well your sub-orbital arc aligns with the target orbit. You can rotate left and right as you ascend to adjust your orbit\u0027s inclination to match the target. (This sounds difficult, but is surprisingly easy to do if you try it.) Push your orbit out to the target\u0027s altitude, coast to apoapsis and proceed to rendezvous as normal.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T18:32:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 06:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaezan","CreatedById":108274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:16:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to learn orbital rendezvous is to practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch a station with 4-5 docking ports.

You still need to know what you are doing to give it commands. Since it can fail from time to time. And it is really not possible to do some of the precision movements like getting a sattelite into specific orbit using mechjeb. Sure you can get close to it easy. But then its up to you to create the node and make precision movements. On the other hand mechjeb makes boring and repetetive tasks like executing a node that you created or orbit ascent easy. Just create your node and let the mechjeb execute it with precision. Why warp yourself and then use the thrust yourself its just repetitive. If you want to intercept something from ascent even mechjeb can\u0027t do it in 1 go atm. It will takeoff at a close encounter and get you into a close orbit near your target. But then you need to use randevous autopilot. Even then the randevous autopilot cannot do moves like randevous with something that is in a polar orbit while you are in equatorial orbit. It will probably try going trough the planet itself and crash you. The thing is manuvers are allready calculated and executed by computers in real life.
