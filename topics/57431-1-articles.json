Constantly telling people they should have already known that that\u0027s what \u0022robotics\u0022 means is not reasonable because that\u0027s not what the word means. Causing a thing to move by twisting a control knob is not robotics.

It makes sense to me for it to cover both functions for the purpose of keeping the noise down in the suggestions forum.
