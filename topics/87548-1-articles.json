As for mods, I was thinking that Bahamuto\u0027s Weapons, DMP, PFairings, and probably Alarm Clock would be the only ones that are really required. I\u0027ve heard of the texture reduction packs, but idk how well they work - so more information on that would be nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try to set up a server in the next few days, but I need volunteers to test this sort of stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
