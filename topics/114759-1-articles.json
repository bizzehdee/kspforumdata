It is however not the fastest; in fact, it\u0027s the slowest you can go without deliberately overshooting and flopping around the target. You can also spend extra dV to fly a route that gets you there significantly faster, for example (a so-called high energy transfer). But, the ideal time for that accelerated trajectory does not have to coincide with the ideal time for a Hohmann transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, a transfer window is always trajectory-specific. You decide on how long exactly you want to be in transit, and the \u0022window\u0022 is the specific trajectory solution on the specific date of departure that offers the minimum dV spent overall. If you don\u0027t care how long you are in transit, the window \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E describes the ideal Hohmann transfer and pinpoints the absolute minimum dV cost among all possible solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow big the window is and how fast the dV cost ramps up as you deviate from it varies strongly depending on where you are, where you want to go, and what trajectory you want to fly. Moho and Eeloo are typical candidates for generating highly variable windows depending on when you want to leave, because of their eccentric and inclined orbits that present you a different picture everytime they are in alignment with Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo play with the linked calculator, give it some initial conditions, let it draw a graph, then mouse over it and let it recalculate a high energy transfer by clicking into the graph at a lower in-transit time, for example.

This can mean a more expensive burn to depart, and/or a more expensive burn to match velocities at the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes this matters more than others. For example, aerobraking can take care of a lot of the dV expense on arrival. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re going to Duna and you\u0027re significantly off the optimal launch window. You may be able to find a good trajectory that doesn\u0027t take a hugely bigger expensive burn to depart Kerbin, but which results in a very high-velocity intercept with Duna. Well, if you can aerobrake on Duna, that takes care of a lot of that dV. It means a bigger challenge designing your ship to handle very high-velocity aerobraking, but the dV requirements are mitigated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that these launch windows all assume simple Hohmann transfers. Two-burn transfers can also be an option. For example, if you\u0027re going from Kerbin to Duna or Jool, and you\u0027re really really off the window, and you don\u0027t feel like waiting, one approach may be to eject from Kerbin \u003Cem\u003Eretrograde\u003C/em\u003E (so that your periapsis is lowered down towards the sun), then do a prograde burn at solar periapsis to adjust your orbit. Yes, this process will be more expensive than an ideal Hohmann transfer... but it will be a lot cheaper than trying to do a direct intercept if the alignment is really wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazin","CreatedById":147235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T00:47:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWOOOW that launch window planner really explains it all.
