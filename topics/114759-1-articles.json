I have installed the Kerbal Alarm Clock mod to notify me of when transfer windows become available. My question is, how important are transfer windows? is it impossible to capture yourself to another planet outside the window? does it take tons more of delta v? also, how big are these windows, time wise? do i have to be in orbit already when the window comes, or is it open for several days so that i can send more than one ship?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T00:45:22Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tazin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Falkenherz","CreatedById":141969,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T13:36:48Z","Content":"[Look here](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/), for dV requirements outside of those transfer windows."},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T13:47:07Z","Content":"A \u0022transfer window\u0022 is a point in time when the dV cost for a given transfer is minimized. You don\u0027t have to take the window; you can fly at any time you want. But going outside the window gradually increases dV costs as you need to fly a less optimal trajectory.\n\nUsually, a transfer window is given as a \u0027porkchop plot\u0027, which is a graph that relates time in transit with dV spent for a specific departure date.\n\n[A calculator that shows you a porkchop plot](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) usually defaults to a specific trajectory, namely the ideal Hohmann trajectory, because it is the cheapest dV-wise. It is however not the fastest; in fact, it\u0027s the slowest you can go without deliberately overshooting and flopping around the target. You can also spend extra dV to fly a route that gets you there significantly faster, for example (a so-called high energy transfer). But, the ideal time for that accelerated trajectory does not have to coincide with the ideal time for a Hohmann transfer.\n\nAs such, a transfer window is always trajectory-specific. You decide on how long exactly you want to be in transit, and the \u0022window\u0022 is the specific trajectory solution on the specific date of departure that offers the minimum dV spent overall. If you don\u0027t care how long you are in transit, the window *always* describes the ideal Hohmann transfer and pinpoints the absolute minimum dV cost among all possible solutions.\n\nHow big the window is and how fast the dV cost ramps up as you deviate from it varies strongly depending on where you are, where you want to go, and what trajectory you want to fly. Moho and Eeloo are typical candidates for generating highly variable windows depending on when you want to leave, because of their eccentric and inclined orbits that present you a different picture everytime they are in alignment with Kerbin.\n\nGo play with the linked calculator, give it some initial conditions, let it draw a graph, then mouse over it and let it recalculate a high energy transfer by clicking into the graph at a lower in-transit time, for example. It\u0027ll help you understand how to read the graph. Then let it re-draw the graph with different initial conditions and see how that makes the minimum appear in a different spot.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-01T14:00:07Z\u0022 title=\u002207/01/2015 02:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind**"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T14:25:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E is it impossible to capture yourself to another planet outside the window? does it take tons more of delta v? also, how big are these windows, time wise?\n\nBoth getting there and achieving capture become more and more expensive if you don\u0027t launch at the right time. How much more expensive? That depends.\n\nFalkenherz has already linked to Alex Moon\u0027s launch window planner. I suggest you give it a try.

You can almost always go to your destination whenever you want however it will take somewhere between a little more delta v to many times the amount(example: you can go in basically a straight line to another planet but it would take a lot of delta v to accelerate up to speed and a lot to slow down, which crafts generally don\u0027t going to have)\n\n Only times when you cannot go to your planet that instant is when you would collide with another planetary body, which is rare)\n\nThe \u0022pork chops\u0022 in the plots will generally span at least a day or so with variations of about 10 m/s delta v, so if you\u0027re right in one, you should be able to launch a craft, circulize and plot the course without losing out on any saved delta v. It\u0027s similar to the effects of the oberth when burning for 5seconds at a minute to periapsis and burning for 5second a few seconds from periapsis. It\u0027s not the most efficient but you shouldn\u0027t lose out on much delta v"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T16:16:21Z","Content":"In addition to the good advice given above, you should note that transfer windows get shorter the closer your target is to the Sun. You can miss an Eeloo transfer window by several days and not have much of an effect on the cost of the transfer; in contrast, a Moho window can\u0027t be missed by more than an hour or two without significant penalties (this is one of several reasons why Moho transfers are hard to do efficiently)."},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T18:12:59Z","Content":"Another really handy transfer calculator, with an intuitive interface:\n\n[http://ksp.olex.biz](http://ksp.olex.biz)\n\n...you tell it:\n\n- your origin body\n\n- your target body\n\n- the height of your parking orbit\n\n...it tells you:\n\n- what relative positions the origin and target should have for the ideal launch window (with a nice graphical display)\n\n- what position in your parking orbit you should initiate the burn (also nicely graphical)\n\n- how many m/s of dV you will need\n\n- a little warning if the target body has significant orbital inclination to your origin body (i.e. if you\u0027ll need to do an orbital-plane adjustment partway through)\n\nAs previous posters have said, missing the window just means that the dV requirement goes up. This can mean a more expensive burn to depart, and/or a more expensive burn to match velocities at the target.\n\nSometimes this matters more than others. For example, aerobraking can take care of a lot of the dV expense on arrival. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re going to Duna and you\u0027re significantly off the optimal launch window. You may be able to find a good trajectory that doesn\u0027t take a hugely bigger expensive burn to depart Kerbin, but which results in a very high-velocity intercept with Duna. Well, if you can aerobrake on Duna, that takes care of a lot of that dV. It means a bigger challenge designing your ship to handle very high-velocity aerobraking, but the dV requirements are mitigated.\n\nAlso note that these launch windows all assume simple Hohmann transfers. Two-burn transfers can also be an option. For example, if you\u0027re going from Kerbin to Duna or Jool, and you\u0027re really really off the window, and you don\u0027t feel like waiting, one approach may be to eject from Kerbin *retrograde* (so that your periapsis is lowered down towards the sun), then do a prograde burn at solar periapsis to adjust your orbit. Yes, this process will be more expensive than an ideal Hohmann transfer... but it will be a lot cheaper than trying to do a direct intercept if the alignment is really wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"Tazin","CreatedById":147235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T00:47:27Z","Content":"WOOOW that launch window planner really explains it all.

Thanks guys! One question, what do the three transfer types mean?

I was aware of the existence of the technique for long, but I always undervalued it\u0027s efficiency in conserving dV while thinking that it\u0027s a complicated, \u0027*really pro-thing*\u0027 to do.\n\nOnce I read into it, I found that it\u0027s easy to preform, and saves much fuel - especially these days since 1.0.4 made the atmospheres hit like a hammer, thus making aerobraking- and capturing harder.\n\nSo [that wiki page](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Gravity_Assist) is worth a read - with a bit of practice this trick can get your carft to Duna for the dV cost of a Mun flyby. And it can achieve much more later.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-02T17:45:44Z\u0022 title=\u002207/02/2015 05:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Evanitis**"}]}
