As the title suggests I am at my wits end and could use some help finding an old mod. Specifically a mod containing several heat shields of many different sizes and styles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst let me say that the heat shields I am referring to were not and are not in the DRE (deadly reentry) mod. These were a standalone heat shield mod pack containing a variety of of shields of different sizes and styles. Some of the heat shields were inflatable, others had extendable metal blades/fins that were designed to dissipate heat when fully extended. I believe they were compatible with DRE (the deadly reentry plugin), but as far as I remember they were a standalone pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would appreciate any and all information about this mod, even if it\u0027s just to tell me that it was abandoned by it\u0027s author/creator and can no longer be found. That way I can stop pulling my hair out and give up the search lol!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-22T23:26:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you thinking of Planetes Co Heatshields?
