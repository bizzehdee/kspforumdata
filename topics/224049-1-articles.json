Most lenses are for dispersion correction. Refractive indices of all real materials are dependent on wavelength which leads to chromatic aberration. \u00A0 It is managed to acceptable levels by using suitable set of different lenses made from different materials which dispersions cancel each other. Then there are lenses for correcting geometric errors (often aspherical shapes). And all corrections should happen at all focal distances (and lengths in zoom lenses).
