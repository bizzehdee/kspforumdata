There are a number of people pestering in threads about 1.1 updates, ETA\u0027s etc.  Let the modders do their work, there is no need to pester them about it, as many have their work cut out for them.

The point of the pre-release is for testing, period.

It is bad enough with a normal release.  They don\u0027t need that grief in this situation (they don\u0027t really deserve it ever tbh). \n\nSo bottom line, if you are helping to test stuff, just be patient and when a mod is updated grab and test.
