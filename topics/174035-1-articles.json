I found a way to do something interesting that may go to some basic principles applied to plants that may make them more water efficient. This could probably be used in several different areas. Don\u0027t know if this is already applies to things like plants in space or other normal plant potters. I know some use seperate bases for water to drain. But I don\u0027t know if to the same effect. They may though. I think orcid pots or similar might do this regardless of if it\u0027s intended to. I don\u0027t know either way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was at some point also trying to make a double layers terrarium concept I think. Although I was seeing if it was useful after making some out of other plastic bottles to save money and just mess around with stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. What I started doing was taking 2 liter pop bottles and to save money I cut off the top just above the label where it starts to curve. take off the cap unless you find some reason to leave it on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Possibly poke holes in the top of the part you just cut off for drainage and possibly the bottom of the 2 liter bottle(if you do make sure the holes are on the flat part touching the surface it sits on unless you want drainage holes also.). The bottom was if I wanted to water from the base to stop dirt condensing over time. If so you need something to put it on to hold the volume of water you want to water it with. If you have too little volume on the thing it sits on it can get very annoying quick if you want/need to put more water in(unless you don\u0027t care and just put the rest on the top, but this can lead to it spilling over in the bottom container after it settles and making a mess). The holes on the bottom should be as small as possible but big enough for water to get in. The smaller the better as far as I know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Fill the bottom of the 2 liter with some dirt. This should be packed into about the height of the top of the bottom dents. Originally I cut a hole in the side I wanted to tape close to put other plants and or water directly in the bottom chamber, but this turned out to be a bad idea. And it decreased how long I could go between watering.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Put the top you cut off upside down and push it in. There should be a space that is clear with no dirt between the label, dirt, and the top of the upside down plastic top.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. Fill the top with dirt. If there are any other steps you know yo should do do it to this and the bottom layer of dirt first. There may be additives you want or need depending on the plant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Plant your plant in the top layer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Water and stick in an appropriate place and wait.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis doesn\u0027t work as well for young plants and care should be given potentially to them. Although it may keep a nice even moisture for longer than other planters. But once a plant is of moderate size and the roots go deep it should be able to avoid watering for 3 - 6 months. It may also help with more tropical plants like oranges or whatnot as it creates condensation/humidity that may help them survive better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I can tell it decreases the oxygen flow through the plant. this combined with condensation from the bottom layer and general sides of the bottle slowly and evenly spread the water throughout the plant. Also, I have mine in only moderate sun because I don\u0027t have the best windows for plants. The sun is partially blocked by trees etc. This may extend the watering time but I don\u0027t know by how much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownsides:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. If you water too heavily from the top it may take a little longer to drain and can more easily waterlog the plant or roots potentially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Two liter bottles may become a little prone to being top heavy in this configuration. This is because of their general shape. Other bottles may solve this. Although if you cut a little more off the base of the bottle it may help with this. But it may reduce the space the roots have to grow in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Can potentially grow mold or fungus or other oddities in the base of the bottle. From what I\u0027ve very briefly looked up, what is in the bottom of mine may be a harmelss fungus. It\u0027s white and soggy soil and might be what I\u0027ve seen called a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://homeguides.sfgate.com/dustylooking-mold-soil-houseplants-41109.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esaprophytic fungus\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cb\u003E. \u003C/b\u003EBut I\u0027m not even remotely knowledgeable on this. So, I can\u0027t say realistically. It may be more prone to this type of thing and take longer than normal to dry out also because of how it retains water. This can be annoying with younger plants as you have to keep watering them. It\u0027s a bit less of a problem when the plant is older as you don\u0027t have to water as much. Not sure if this can be bad for your health or not. \u003Cstrong\u003EUse with caution.\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve seen stuff about using cinnamon as an anti fungal. You might be able to put some in water and feed it to the plant. It might circulate into the area and reduce it without having to open the container if it needs to be. I\u0027ve tried using cinnamon in the past but I don\u0027t remember much about the results. I think it worked in general. I have no guarantees on this though as I don\u0027t really know anything about it.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn a separate note. The dirt I use may be slightly clay like and this may reduce the oxygen flow further. I think it is the oxygen because if you cut a hole or bigger area and increase the air flow potential through the plant it will drastically reduce the time between watering from my experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone ever tried this or seen this concept applied elsewhere? I do it so I don\u0027t have to water plants very often and to save money as plant pots are a bit expensive. But if it\u0027s applicable it could be an interesting concept in other areas, assuming it\u0027s not already used. It could help anywhere water is short or needs to be preserved relatively.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a similar concept which I think I have tried:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00220bbc16ea2216ceeb87d7e08ea75bfb19.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022480\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0b/bc/16/0bbc16ea2216ceeb87d7e08ea75bfb19.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut these tend to get nasty because of the sitting water. I also have no idea how long these go between watering and probably work differently and may use more water. The type of bottle I described above will not release smells as far as I can tell. Although you may get some mild stuff in the bottle in the clear gap. But it will likely be heavily reduced to non existant. You also will not need to open them up virtually ever. Literally until you need to repot or replace the plant. At which point you can simply let the bottom chamber dry out with dirt sealing it in until it\u0027s a non issue as far as smells go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: With my written instruction above you don\u0027t cut the bottle at the base or near the bottom. You cut the top at the top of the 2 liter label at the top curve. This goes upside down all the way to the bottom. You do not cut it halfway like in the above picture.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t think that type of water in the base thing seals the oxygen off as well either because it\u0027s just sitting on the bottom of the pop bottle. The ones I do actually put the top of the pop bottle deep in the 2 liter bottle and cover it with dirt making a seal. It also removes the need for any type of wick which is annoying and rots over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither way, the point is the ones I\u0027ve been making have a possibly absurd amount of time per water for the plants. Or it makes it seem like it does. It could just be the dirt allows a sponge to hold the same volume of water but retains it in the system and then evenly slowly distributes it. But either way it leeds to less water over time potentially. Or a lot less hassle. It\u0027s also cheap because you only need an empty 2 liter pop bottle, some scissors, the dexterity not to cut yourself, and dirt, and a plant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrain fart: I think this idea is part of the reason a terrarium works. 8) That is one of the reasons I made it this way originally. But it\u0027s a cheap way to do it and from my experience pretty effective. Do they use this concept on the ISS or anything. It could be useful in certain circumstances. Might be good in habitats etc. Not with pop bottles necessarily, but in general. And potentially the ISS and habitats are somewhat a giant concept of this. But it might work in even smaller scale. Although the fact it can grow small amounts of mold or fungus in the base might be bad if the container is in a sealed habitat... not sure about elsewhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActual pics:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00226PcAf3n.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022407\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/6PcAf3n.png\u0022 width=\u0022216\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BXEbqT5.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022414\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BXEbqT5.png\u0022 width=\u0022412\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sjsEY7n.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022631\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sjsEY7n.png\u0022 width=\u0022281\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last pic is a bit bad. But the bottom has dirt. And you want you ca place holes at the bottom of those little flat spots on the bottom that the pop bottle rests on. this will allow it to draw up water. Just don\u0027t make big holes. And place it on something to collect excess water and or put water in to water the bottle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also don\u0027t know whether you want the label on it or not. if you leave it on it may expose the roots more. I have no clue which is better or worse. Or if it matters to different plants.

I completely forgot you could do that. Probably would have speed up the sprout time since I\u0027m growing a pepper plant. I\u0027ll have to leave it on and see if it helps it grow faster. 8)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forget little things like that easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimple tip, if anyone does this. Make sure the greenhouse top is inside the base so the water dripping down goes back inside the main bottle. Or else you could get water getting on things and water leaving the system. It\u0027s simple but it\u0027s easy to forget until you have water pooling up on the table. BTW, I\u0027m speaking from experience. 8d I actually cut two very small slits in the top of the greenhouse base(less than a centimeter) on each side to give a little room for the greenhouse top to fit inside more easily. It seems to help. Just make sure the greenhouse top goes down farther than the slits so it doesn\u0027t leak. And that the slits are well above any dirt line you want in the bottle in the future. Modifications are permanent. But of course the bottles are cheap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if keeping a greenhouse top on it the whole time would help even the water out enough you could get plants growing on the bottom. If you are careful about the water added and it helps spread it out enough not to overwater the bottom, you could get a little terrarium in the base. I wanted to do this originally to grow things that might help the upper plant grow. Say, if a certain plants likes or needs nitrogen, maybe grow a legume. Or something that can grow and die enough to reduce the need for fertilizers etc. Anything that might aid in the systems longevity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if watering from the bottom would help as it may provide a little extra outlet for water, but I don\u0027t know for certain. You might be able to put some pure drainage holes that might help get some back into the base until it needs to soak it up again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried this a little but messed it up. But it still may be doable. I think a tip may be to prepare a bottle without planting in the top but having the dirt on top and water slowly to get the terrarium going first. Then plant the plant. Might not make a difference though. That is an idea I have wanted to do properly for some time though. When I did a version where I cut a hole in the bottom for access I was hoping to get access to grow a second plant to harvest like basil with tomatoes. But you could sacrifice watering time for a second plant growing area. You could also put more dirt in the bottom and put the pop bottle top up higher or use something to hold it up in the middle so it doesn\u0027t sink to much and give a bottom plant more dirt to grow in for a double layered planter. You could even do more than one hole in the bottom but you might have to watch out for structural issues at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, I don\u0027t know enough about complimentary plants to really do a lot with this idea outside of stuff that is good to eat together.
