Stability problems in Kerbal rockets I have found come primarily\u00A0from mass/momentum issues. In real life situations, the first stage fuselage mass\u00A0generally remains remains evenly distributed (not perfectly, but certainly reliably distributed). That is the total mass of one end of the fuselage does not become significantly heavier or lighter (past the ideal point) through flight. Now, most rockets we build will likely consist of more than one tank piece placed in a stack. By default the farthest tank will drain first. This creates a certain momentum problem where the rear of the first stage fuselage\u00A0becomes far heavier than the top. This artificially shifts the center of mass to the rear, this exacerbates the mass/momentum issue\u00A0thereby allowing momentum to win out and flip the rocket, with the heavy end pointing forward. What needs to be introduced is a way to drain all tanks at the same rate thereby equally distributing mass along the entire fuselage. Now in real life the balance is not perfect but it is no where near to the issue we have in Kerbal. My assertion is easy to test. simply keep the furthest most tank constantly filled and you will see your rocket fly relatively\u00A0nicely. Also, I need to make a quick mention of how lift across the body of the fuselage is distorted to to these mass differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am frustrated about is being told to redesign my rockets to compensate for a flawed/limited mechanical feature.
