On the K-35 craft included in the example craft, I have the rear throttle set to ~30% which sets the center of thrust just a hair behind the COM, and an action group which toggles the vtol mode of the rear engine, and toggles the front fan on and off. This makes it so that as the front fan is deactivated when vtol mode is toggled off, the rear engine is returning back to normal mode with only 30% thrust while the front RCS stabilizer jets handle the aircraft\u0027s want to pitch nose-down. After that I put the thrust limiter to 100% for forward flight, and back to 30% when I want to go back to vtol mode. I tried it in FAR today and it didn\u0027t go so well (fire and explosions), but this method works in stock!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hadn\u0027t considered making the front fan an RCS part...but you\u0027re right, that may make more sense when I think about how the actual plane works. On the issue of getting a multi-angle setup: I for sure have looked into it (it was my original plan to have a slider bar to control the animation) and while Firespitter would be great to use, that specific vtol module is driven by rotating a single gameObject with the thrust transform childed to it, as opposed to having an entire animation doing the rotating like I have it. This makes it impossible unfortunately. Although I\u0027m going to do some more digging and see if there is an existing plugin that would work, otherwise I\u0027m gonna have to learn C# and have a crack at plugin writing. But, anyways, I know what you mean and I\u0027d love to make it possible!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ramon91","CreatedById":110639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T12:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give this a try, if I find more issues I\u0027ll comment again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter install:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch better, the only issue I\u0027m noticing is that the vtol engine (the vertical fan) is producing very very high drag forces even at low speeds (At 130/140 m/s it\u0027s producing like 30 kN of drag, that part alone).

Intake air is used as a propellant, and like liquid fuel, would be used less when the engine is putting out less power, thus freeing more for use with the rcs jet parts which use intake air also. Does that answer your question? I don\u0027t think it is possible to write the config to boost the amount of intake air based on engine thrust...because you can\u0027t just create air right?
