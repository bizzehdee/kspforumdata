The timer runs from the moment you reload the quicksave \u0022Course Set\u0022 (via Alt\u002BF9) to the moment you activate the \u0022Thud\u0022 engine on the mid-level roof (by entering the seat and activating stage). **To record your entry take a screenshot of the moment you activate the engine and post it. - Entry time will be based off universal game time.**\n\nNote that you are allowed to use quicksaves, as well as phys-warp 4. All times will be based off of the \u0022Course Set\u0022 quicksave so phys-warp and additional quick saves will not decrease total time (They might even have a negative impact).\n\n**The Leaderboard:** (note that entry time is based on game time. A run takes ~5 minutes)\n\n1. 57:58 Avera9eJoe\n\n\u003E ![etb0xSz.png](http://i.imgur.com/etb0xSz.png)\n\n~1:00:00 LavaCake   \n\n\u003E ![CD510527C1F750270BA356E5692FD574799F66D3](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/519385180222469194/CD510527C1F750270BA356E5692FD574799F66D3/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T05:47:47Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 05:47  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T18:07:44Z","Content":"Does this make me the Kerbal parkour master?
