I\u0027d think it\u0027d be hard to get to a fuel station unless you could some how have it somewhere along the path on the way to Duna. Then of course you\u0027d have to hope the station would be located at the same place at the same time as your orbit path to Duna.

Then maybe another station at the target planet/mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever unless you have the kethane mod, having a full fuel station in orbit around other planets/muns may be kind of hard.
