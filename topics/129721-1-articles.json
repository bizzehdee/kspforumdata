Therefore in a perfect universe, since you\u0027d have to burn almost to escape and then burn back after the plane change (giving 2x 41.4% your current orbital velocity in burns), you\u0027d want to burn right to the edge of the SOI if your delta-v to make the plane change is more than 83% of your current orbital velocity. Obviously this is less than 100% accurate because a plane change at the edge of the SOI will not be free, while at infinity in a perfect universe it would be, but still, it should hold true enough as long as your starting orbit is relatively low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if it is less than 83%?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCall your original orbital velocity v0. When you increase your Ap, your velocity at Ap will be v1. Call your initial radius r0 and let it be equal to 1, so your radius at Ap is\u00A0 r1 and is therefore a multiple of r0. Dont forget this is radius, not altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe delta-v cost of a plane change = 2 * v * sin(angle/2). If you know the angle, then you have your figure for delta-v cost for a plane change. And from that you can deduce that if your plane change exceeds 47\u00B0, then you really should go to the edge of the SOI to do it. A plane change of 60\u00B0 costs 100% of your orbital velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut you don\u0027t actually need to know the figure for the delta-v cost - just the figure for your Ap velocity (v1), because the gain you make will be simply = 1 - v1/v0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis page\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u003C/a\u003E gives lots of helpful equations because you want to know the delta-v to raise your Ap, and the value of v1 at that Ap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe delta-v for the first part of a Hohmann transfer is: dv = sq.root(GM/r0) * (sq.root(2r1/(r1\u002Br0)) -1).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, sq.root(GM/r0) is our initial velocity, and r0 = 1, so this simplifies to dv = v0 * (sq.root(2r1/(r1\u002B1)) -1). And we need to do this twice, so our Hohmann transfers will cost us:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n= 2 * v0 ((sq.root(2r1/(r1\u002B1)) - 1). \u00A0 As r1 tends to infinity, r1/(r1\u002B1) tends to 1 therefore the cost of attaining escape velocity and returning is 2* v0 ((sq.root(2))-1).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, what our Ap velocity will be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAp velocity = sq.root(GM(2/r1 - 1/atx)). Where atx is the semi-major axis of the transfer elipse, and atx = (r0\u002Br1)/2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince v0 = sq.root(GM/1), this again simplifies down to:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nv1 = v0 * sq.root(2/r1 - 2/(r1\u002B1)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you double your radius, your plane change will be made at 0.58 * v0 and you \u0022save\u0022 0.42x your initial plane change dv, but it will cost you 0.31x your initial velocity on the transfers. The point at which 0.42x dv =\u00A0 0.31x initial velocity is for a plane change of about 43\u00B0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore (assuming I didn\u0027t miss something above), the gains are zero or largely irrelevant until you get past about 40\u00B0 plane change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFunky","CreatedById":128066,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-12T10:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat was awesome!

Would this not also advocate a steeper launch profile and a higher circularisation burn at Ap, while still at suborbital speeds? Though gravity losses will be mounting up at the same time...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeeing what you wrote, I went back and read OP\u0027s question again, noticing a bit I missed last night. The equations that I gave are only for a simple case where you\u0027re already in orbit, at more or less the intended target orbit. Indeed, if you already have to raise your Ap significantly, then clearly you want to combine the manouvres. Also, as pointed out in that link that I gave (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u003C/a\u003E), IRL insertion burns can also be done in three steps to save fuel, going higher than the target orbit to reduce the plane-change cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, the \u0022only worth it if above about 40\u00B0\u0022 rule only really applies if you\u0027re already at the target level. If you have to raise your Ap anyway, and all the more so if you are not even off the ground yet, then there are benefits to going higher, even if the plane change is much less than 40\u00B0.
