I am in need of advice on how to armor ships using structural plates. I used to use wing parts which I was rather good a but these plates are far superior in terms of protection to the old wings parts. However, I struggle quite a bit with creating ships with armor, how do you guys do it, Do you build a structure of I Beams, and then armor the ships or what?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt_Reynolds","CreatedById":72492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T13:13:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMay I ask why you need to amour plate your ships?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfish57","CreatedById":69214,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T14:37:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHe might be playing with KMP, or just wants it because it looks cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T15:38:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMount them on the ends of cubic struts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Caldari Navy","CreatedById":92605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T16:29:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason is because I submit combat ships to the UKSC (United Kerbal Space Command)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epthelyn","CreatedById":57970,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T16:32:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) Start out by putting a panel (symmetrically if necessary) on one side of the craft by using a cubic octagonal strut; they can be placed pretty much anywhere, so this makes it considerably easier to do part 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Attach more panels to the edges of those panels by selecting the part, moving the mouse over the very thin edge of the panel and then rotating it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Repeat with the next panel and so on\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once you get to a point where you can\u0027t fit more panels on, you\u0027re either done or you have gaps left.
