Then, once you\u0027re close to AP, perform your circularization burn. Burn slightly above the horizon to push your AP away from you, burn slightly below to pull it toward you. Alternatively, you can lock your SAS to prograde, and when about a minute away from AP, start burning at max thrust. If your time to AP starts increasing, cut thrust, and wait until the time to AP is lower (for example, when 30 seconds away, and then 15 seconds etc.).

Is there something wrong in my technique?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing (I\u0027ll probably update the guide later) is that you should just be pointing your ship at your target, and move the velocity marker side to side using the IJLK keys (with fine control turned on). If you\u0027re doing burns, then it\u0027s probably going to be difficult to get the precision you need. Unless the two are perfectly aligned, then as you get close, it\u0027ll get further apart (imaging shooting at a target 1 mile away, but missing it just by a few feet, only when you get closer will you notice that you\u0027re not heading directly at your target)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also the case that since you\u0027re not exactly the same orbit, you\u0027ll slowly drift apart, but assuming that your relative speeds are small (\u0026lt;1 m/s) you\u0027ll drift apart very slowly, over the course of many minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ibanix","CreatedById":147140,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T19:05:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for all the helpful advice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Is there a way to disable SAS from using RCS?
