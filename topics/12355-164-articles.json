Atmosphere is thicker so terminal velocity is lower. Landing even on thruster only should be easy. Unless you\u0027re using FAR in which case, as discussed recently, MJ would have no idea what your drag is. \u003Cp\u003EOf course I also know nothing about your ship, its mass or what the TWR is for a poodle and 2 909s as I don\u0027t know what other mods were used for this. (example, RSS \u002B MFS could spell trouble for a thruster only landing)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not saying there\u0027s not trouble with landings btw, just thinking this is a case where stock vs non-stock needs to be separated out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that subject, I noticed last night that landing (mostly stock, just MJ \u002B KWR) using thrusters and parachute on Kerbin, that MJ2 was firing its thruster too early and constantly while descending on parachute. It shouldn\u0027t have fired at all until the final 8 seconds of descent. On parachute it was coming down about 15 m/s and the thruster wouldn\u0027t stop firing even when I set the landing speed above 15 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landers I was testing were all stock, originally done in .21 before I had any mods other than MechJeb installed. When dropped from 50 meters (starting at zero velocity) with hyperedit, they can land but the legs sink into the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the few successful times using that to land, I refilled fuel with hyperedit and they could lift off. Wouldn\u0027t get too high before running out of fuel of course, but it showed that TWR should be high enough to land without breaking things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf MechJeb would start the final burn high enough to slow to .5 meter/second at touchdown, and if the legs wouldn\u0027t sink, it wouldn\u0027t take higher power engines and gobs of fuel to land on Eve. Lifting off, well, that\u0027s a whole \u0027nother design problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have Two-Step lander in a craft file by itself. Will remove it from a ship and post it by itself later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Eh, whatev on posting the lander on its own. Here\u0027s the lander on top of its SSTO launcher. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/EzkWZks7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/EzkWZks7\u003C/a\u003E Many hours of building and refining and launching went into getting that to where it\u0027d make it to a 71KM orbit without any staging. Just set MJ\u0027s ascent guidance to 71KM, terminal velocity limit off, corrective steering on, don\u0027t change the ascent path. It\u0027ll also work in .21 with MJ 1.0.9 and its default path. That was my goal, build an all rocket SSTO that\u0027d work on MJ\u0027s default ascent path. Launcher is easy to remove, pull one of the stack separators off a side tank, then yank off the center one. Reconfiguring this to asparagus staging is a simple job of removing some of the pipes that loop the fuel around, and altering the staging position of radial decouplers. In SSTO form the big central decoupler could be swapped for an ROC so that after staging off the lander (leaving a large core section intact) it could be used for a return from somewhere stage. \u0027Course it would take a big tanker to refuel this thing before going somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-02T13:24:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/02/2013 01:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Galane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Big_Ron","CreatedById":58256,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T20:01:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Virtualgenius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Virtualgenius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis will get you started with the ar202 case this is what i did \u003Cp\u003EMODULE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E name = MechJebCore\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebLocalSettings {\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleCustomWindowEditor { unlockTechs = start}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleSmartASS { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleManeuverPlanner { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleNodeEditor { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleTranslatron { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleWarpHelper { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleAttitudeAdjustment { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleThrustWindow { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleRCSBalancerWindow { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleRoverWindow { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleAscentGuidance { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleLandingGuidance { unlockTechs = start}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleSpaceplaneGuidance { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleDockingGuidance { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleRendezvousAutopilotWindow { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E MechJebModuleRendezvousGuidance { unlockTechs = start }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E }\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewere exactly does this go??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigD145","CreatedById":417,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-02T21:03:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s already in the cfg\u0027s.

I have flown several missions to Eve with no problems landing. The ship had a TWR of approximately 1.6 at the surface of Eve. In the lower atmosphere the terminal velocity was approximately 80 m/sec. Thus it took approximately 8 seconds of full thrust to kill the descent velocity and a distance of approximately 320 meters. MJ started braking between 500 and 400 meters altitude and throttled back to less than full thrust before landing. I have only seen problems similar to the ones that you describe when landing on Kerban with a TWR less than or approximately equal to 1. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eskips\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(and yes I was cheating. the ship had essentially infinite fuel, but a reasonable reported delta-V.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
