See how the tracks are still selected? The issue, is that the bounds of that part, the medium track, seem to be larger than the visual model, at least on the up-down axis. This wouldn\u0027t be a big deal, if putting batteries and structural panels too close to the tracks didn\u0027t periodically cause them to vibrate the craft to bits. It seems to me that when that happens, there is an invisible chunk clipping with the rest off the structure, causing issues.
