He took a shower then combed his hair. Inside the mirror he saw a very different person then the hero he was some 25 years back. Hair fading and falling out ; pale skin. Features sagging. Then he muttered some words about what the KSP had done to him. Jeb turned on the TV and went to KNN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENews Reporter: Hello Kanada! Today is a rather tragic day worldwide. Today, dubbed Mission Day, is the day that eight Kerbals of Kamerica\u0027s KSP on Ship Alpha of the Hephaestus Program were killed in orbit. According to computer error reports Mission Control received \u0022Two NERVAs failed causing a large rotational force that ruptured the hull.\u0022 Mission day is famously known for people around the world launching fireworks in memory of the 8. Today is also when KSP canceled all their manned flights due to safety issues. Here is the speech from Kamerican Head of Space Exploration:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHSE: Today we have witnessed a terrible event. A failure onboard Ship Alpha has resulted in the death of her eight crew. This has caused me and many others to finally realize the safety issues of manned spaceflight.

He could not bear to listen how that crew was killed. He felt anger building up on his inside so he rushed for his depression and mood swing pills.

Jeb I understand how bad things are going for you. Losing your Son, Wife, and Job. Ever since Hephaestus every single Kamerican Kerbonaut has had to face challenges. You\u0027ve got to stop living in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: But I have no future. I was born to be a kerbonaut; an obsolete job. They shut us down for a reason. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve come to have known after my son\u0027s death. It\u0027s good that our kind die off unsuccessfully.
