I am making something which has 8 nozzels but the fx have only displayed up until the 6th, i can\u0027t find anything I have done different about these ones so I guess there\u0027s a limit? if not then i\u0027ll have to figure out what I\u0027m doing wrong, but if that is the case then I guess my question becomes: is there a way to get multiple particle streams exported into one FX model?\n\nEDIT: can a mod please delete this thread I\u0027ve been a right idiot and placed two sets in the exact same place so I couldn\u0027t tell until I zoomed right in ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nhahaha teach me to create a thread before exhausting all the options, sorry about that!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T22:05:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Squiggsy**"}]}
