I\u0027ve got a ship pretty close-by. It *MIGHT* have enough delta-v to intercept and then return to Kerbal. Only problem, I forgot (DOH!) to include a hatch, so my stranded astronauts are going to have to EVA over. \n\nHere are some screenshots of my situation. I would appreciate your help and advice! \n\nMost importantly, once I get close, what - exactly - am I supposed to do? There\u0027s still going to be a slight gap even after I execute this next maneuver. \n\n![2015_08_12_00003.jpg](http://s5.postimg.org/hk7wrjgfr/2015_08_12_00003.jpg)\n\n![2015_08_12_00004.jpg](http://s5.postimg.org/8b5qhf7jr/2015_08_12_00004.jpg)\n\n![2015_08_12_00005.jpg](http://s5.postimg.org/blu3haxh3/2015_08_12_00005.jpg)\n\n![2015_08_12_00006.jpg](http://s5.postimg.org/vvrewfylz/2015_08_12_00006.jpg)\n\n![2015_08_12_00007.jpg](http://s5.postimg.org/dcd4isf07/2015_08_12_00007.jpg)\n\n![2015_08_12_00008.jpg](http://s5.postimg.org/t0ebpkulz/2015_08_12_00008.jpg)\n\n![2015_08_12_00009.jpg](http://s5.postimg.org/61m7kenzr/2015_08_12_00009.jpg)\n\n![2015_08_12_00010.jpg](http://s5.postimg.org/v8x3knr3r/2015_08_12_00010.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-15T02:02:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2015 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Hegemon**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T04:00:50Z","Content":"That Mk2 cockpit you have includes a hatch already.\n\nOnce you get close, switch over to the stranded kerbal by pressing ] or [. Then you can EVA over like normal (pressing \u0027R\u0027 to activate the jetpack) and get close to the hatch. Hopefully you\u0027ve EVA\u0027d before.
