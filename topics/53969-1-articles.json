Those 2 part designs are even practical lifters! (eg: LV-T30 \u002B x200-16, Skipper \u002B orange tank) When adding a rocket to a rocket, you can also easily synergize (eg: asparagus staging), getting enhanced performance. Even with bad staging, current parts mean that you\u0027re more likely to see minor performance improvements rather than losses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJets are none of these. At a minimum, you need 3 parts. Practically, you\u0027ll be looking at over a dozen. Lift and drag must be dealt with in greater detail to produce a stable and controllable craft. Thrust is affected directly by speed, and indirectly by environment (altitude, speed, angle of attack) and craft design (intake count, directions, and types). Worse-still, synergizing is hard and mostly impractical. If you\u0027re using jets, it\u0027s well worthwhile to push their performance to the point of giving you a 30 x 75 km orbit. Switching to rockets at 25 km and 1000 m/s (mostly horizontal) leaves you in a rather high drag situation, with a velocity vector poorly suited to establishing orbit. Fairly often, craft show up that would see greater performance by switching to fewer/smaller engines or less fuel(!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-27T08:35:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eactually, I figured out why rockets do it easier. It\u0027s because when the rocket is down to 25% of the launching mass, it has 15% fuel--the plane at 25% remaining mass is empty. Considering the weight of the dry rocket to the remaining fuel, tha bit of fuel can actually grant almost as much delta-v as the plane gets from start to finish under its rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
