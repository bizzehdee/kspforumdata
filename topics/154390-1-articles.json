Depending on the height of your orbit, if you plan your maneuver node when your orbit is perpendicular to kerbin, it may take so long to get around to the node that you\u0027re pointed significantly off from where you want to be when you make the burn. Before you reach a perpendicular orbit, plot a prograde maneuver node sufficient to eject you from munar orbit, then delay it by right clicking on the node and clicking the right hand button. If you look at the effect each delay (one orbit) has on your orbit around kerbin, you should be able to figure out exactly where the optimum ejection time is. Once you have that, you can go ahead and do the other adjustments to the node that are needed to reach minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
