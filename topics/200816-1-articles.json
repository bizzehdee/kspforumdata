Additionally, there could be an EVA camera that a kerbal could place\u00A0down.\u00A0\u00A0Second, in addition to taking pictures for all of kerbalkind to see, it can have a use to take actual screenshots, with a choice of just having the normal picture, or showing it through\u00A0filter that would make it look something like the recent first pictures from\u00A0Perseverance. Thirdly, since seeing photos and videos of space really gets the public buzzing here in the real world, it could be that, on top of earning science, cameras\u00A0could also provide a boost in reputation when kerbals get to see pictures from other worlds.
