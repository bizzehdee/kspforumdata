I finally got a full Jumbo-64 from the run way into orbit! I had almost given up but left the throttle open during a test flight and it made it to low orbit with enough fuel to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Covalize\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 the orbit! Once I correct the fuel configuration I should be able to reach low orbit with enough fuel to deliver the jumbo-64 to space station! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is was almost an obsession. To get the fuel configuration right I had to mod the wing panels to kill the fuel cross feed. The orange tank is locked in the SPH and TAC balances the fuel so the COM doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t shift drastically during flight. Finding the flight profile for this thing was half the challenge.

I\u0027m still not sure that as a concept this makes a whole lot of sense. It easily drops two jumbos into orbit already, the cargo hold is massive. So, the best option would be to transport the cargo with planetary transfer vehicle attached. This craft is 100T dry and that\u0027s alot of wasted dV. It\u0027s better to have a orbital specialist with a transfer specialist waiting to pick up the cargo from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving said that. The superstructure(30T) of this thing is basically a big spring and built specifically for rough landings so, it also functions very well as a lander to service bases on an atmospheric planet. This would be the most important reason to cart the entire craft across the Kerbol system. To ensure your package arrives undamaged at the other end, seeing as you can REALLY strap your payload down in a cargo hold prior to takeoff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fellow314","CreatedById":76781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-09T12:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KissSh0t\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KissSh0t\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOhh I know it has been done...
