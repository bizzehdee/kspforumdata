I still have a copy of a Shuttle operations manual with a mission profile for self-contained satellite insertion that would, hypothetically, be used to insert a payload into orbit that would then self-transfer into a new orbit meeting the mission profile. (The Shuttle Orbiter was trackable from ground telescopes and radar; a stealth satellite using an ejectable booster motor would be much more difficult to track to a new orbit.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery interesting.
