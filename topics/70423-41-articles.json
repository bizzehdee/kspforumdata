When combined with Sin #2, this also means I always skip the DP-10 antenna (the 500km one for atmospheric flight). Because of this, I\u0027ve become better at pre-programming flights than at flying them myself.

Except, I use it in parts mode (only active with an Engineer, a computer part, or an L3 tracking station) and forget to attach the part about 90% of the time. And because everything is all screwy, I have a tough time synchronizing orbits. And because of that, my communications networks... well... they drift. Sometimes significantly.
