They made the outward bound journey before v1.0.5 and tried to get home on 1.1.1.\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsually, I slingshot from Tylo and adjust to get a close encounter with Kerbin. I could do neither this time. Luckily, the latest version of the rocket ship had the best fuel budget sofar and eventually managed anyway. On the last drop and came in hard enough to blow up some of the science during the reentry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI want to fly my ships manually. I don\u0027t want to use Jebmech whatever to get precision. Flying manually used to be fun and rewarding. And I progressively increased my understanding of and feel for celestial mechanics. But right now it\u0027s just annoying and frustrating. And requiring huge amounts of fuel to compensate for the lack of accuracy or for the lateness of corrections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI now have a few mods, but they are recent. I had this problem already before, on stock only. Before 1.1 I sometimes had this problem, but then I could usually make a navigation node farther away and then drag\u00A0it backwards. This doesn\u0027t work anymore. Right now I\u0027m totally screwed on an important test flight to Vall. Luckily it\u0027s an unmanned mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. Okay, okay,.. a happier update. I figured to try advancing time a bit and reload the game. And this time I also loaded the 64-bit version, since that has worked fine for me when I\u0027ve tried it lately. Anyway, I don\u0027t know why, but this time I could create a working\u00A0navigation node and drag it backwards. So right now I\u0027m good. \u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-16T21:05:46Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2016 09:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vermil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
