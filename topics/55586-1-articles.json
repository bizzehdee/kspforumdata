In this episode (I won\u0027t give out spoilers), the Doctor and Rose find a planet that is holding its own against a black hole hardly an asteroid\u0027s throw away. What I\u0027m wondering is if you guys think this is possible or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe episode explains that the planet is beaming out a huge gravity field in the shape of a funnel into clear space. This is how a group of \u003Cem\u003Eunnamed humans\u003C/em\u003E came to temporarily reside on this planet, by simply flying through it. Somehow, an \u003Cem\u003Eunnamed object\u003C/em\u003E deep within the planet\u0027s core is keeping it more or less unaffected by the gravity of the black hole. It is, however, still being pelted with huge amounts of debris from the wreckage of structures the black hole has ripped apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you think, somewhere in our universe or another one, this could possibly happen?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dominatus","CreatedById":76870,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T23:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seriously doubt it. Although I\u0027m certainly no expert, assuming the funnel thing was even possible, it would require insane amounts of energy to remain suspended like that. In fact, so much energy would be needed that it would show up on scans at incredible distances- assuming it were still the Milky Way, we may even be able to detect it on earth, and wonder what could create such a strong energy signature. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd being in such close proximity to the black hole, it wouldn\u0027t be enough to simply \u0022resist\u0022 the incredibly strong gravitational pull of said black hole. Odds are, the entire asteroid/ planet would be torn apart by the gravitational forces pulling in one direction and the anti gravity field resisting in the opposite. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides, there are examples of incredibly dense neutron stars being \u0022consumed\u0022 as they fall into the black hole. If something with such high mass and gravity cannot even resist the gravity of a black hole, much less counteract it, then I find it highly improbable that any kind of technology can exist that would resist it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this is loosely based on what I know, and is part fact, part conjecture, and should be taken with a grain of salt. Feel free to correct me on any if this, I\u0027m sure I got something wrong. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AndrewBCrisp","CreatedById":57119,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T23:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been some years since I\u0027ve watched that episode, but one thing I remember was how much the characters were OVERstating the danger. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlack holes, really, are like any other lump of matter re: the gravity fields they put out and how objects can orbit them. The difference comes when you get too close to a black hole. IIRC - someone with more physics experience can confirm or refute this - \u0022too close\u0022 is generally defined as 1.5 x the black hole\u0027s radius. Outside that distance, orbital and escape velocities are huge, but still below the speed of light. At 1.5 radii, the orbital velocity equals light and as you go closer still, orbital and escape velocities exceed light - nothing can orbit there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven the size of the black hole as depicted in the epsiode, the \u0022Impossible Planet\u0022 was not impossible at all. Of course, said planet would likely be whipping around the hole at a good clip, so rendezvous and escape would probably have insane delta-V requirements. Perhaps, then, the \u0022Impossible\u0022 part resides in the fact that going there and returning would require so much energy that few could afford to do so. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also: hawking radiation on a planet orbiting a black hole would likely be immense, so survival on the side facing said hole would be... questionable. But then, this is Doctor Who, where if you go far enough in the future, any and every magical effect is handwaved as sufficiently advanced technology). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that the planet\u0027s real purpose is \u0026lt;REDACTED\u0026gt;, then it makes more sense for the planet to sit inside the 1.5 radii distance for its orbit, at which point some form of near-magical technology would be needed to keep it from falling in. If the planet fit\u0027s the IAU\u0027s definition, however, it would likely be too big to say there for long before tidal forces tear it to pieces. Something smaller - a space station, maybe, or some kind of pod - would serve the same purpose and survive, again, given near-magical technology to keep it in orbit. Getting to - and escaping from - the planet reaches the realm of the physically impossible. Which serves it\u0027s real purpose of \u0026lt;REDACTED\u0026gt; just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose are my thoughts, based mostly on my 5-6 year old memories of the episode, and my memories of physics, so expect errors. A similar situation was dealt with in a short story published in the June 1994 \u003Cem\u003EAnalog Science Fiction and Fact\u003C/em\u003E, called \u0022In the Dazzle\u0022 by Robert R.

Circular orbits with r \u0026gt; 3r\u003Csub\u003Es\u003C/sub\u003E are stable. In other words, you can have an object orbiting a black hole just an event horizon\u0027s diameter away from the same.

There are also tidal forces to consider. There is going to be an equivalent of the Roche limit within which any planet would get torn up and become part of the accretion disc.
