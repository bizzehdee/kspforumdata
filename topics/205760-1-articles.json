this sort of thing does actually happen occasionally, but I have very little concern for this with KSP2. We might have some features dropped because they are considered too clunky for what KSP2 is trying to be, but it\u0027s not going to be a platform problem, but rather just general streamlining. And the attitude from Intercept on this is probably going to be, \u0022This is mods territory.\u0022 Which is fine, IMO. I\u0027m also sure the bar for this is way, way higher than it would be for Call of Duty or something. When you\u0027re building a rocket, some amount of complexity is just part of the game, and everyone involved seems to be aware of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn similar vein, I have encountered cases where we\u0027ve had to make changes to content based on contracts with Sony/Microsoft in terms of what can and cannot be supported. For example, if you are releasing a game on PS4, in the past, you had to support all iterations of the console. You couldn\u0027t release features that were available on PS4 Pro but not on base model. This has been relaxed somewhat in the recent years, but this has caused cut features in the past. But these rules\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enever\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0included parity with PC. So again, no reason for concern.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat parity engineers are usually responsible for is making sure all of the UI is accessible with controller/mouse, that performance is fine, etc. There\u0027s usually an entire laundry list of problems that have to be solved. And a lot of it is just having an engineer that works on the off-target platform and keeps track of things that are going in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224060281\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205760\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221638213447\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184845\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MechBFP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, MechBFP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA CPU heavy game is going to be screwed by them releasing the game on the old gen consoles, it\u2019s simply the reality of the situation.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot if they only release on PS5/XBSX.
