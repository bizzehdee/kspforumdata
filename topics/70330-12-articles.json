The manouevre is defined by the amount of delta-V and the direction it\u0027s applied in. The game has to have the node delta-V to work, even if it hid it from the user. By contrast the delta-V of a rocket, though hugely important, is a derived parameter from the engine specific impulse and ship mass ratio, and the game doesn\u0027t have to calculate the ship delta-V. That\u0027s why it\u0027s not unreasonable to have the current situation where you have manouevre node delta-V\u0027s but not ship delta-V\u0027s. Not that it means the game should \u003Cem\u003Estay\u003C/em\u003E that way, but it accounts for the behaviour.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually the deltaV that nodes \u0022contain\u0022 is a vector (as all velocity is strictly speaking) so this already includes the direction. The game has to do extra work to convert this vector into the value displayed on screen. The point he was making is that there is no point in this scalar value being displayed if there is no other part of the game that even mentions deltaV. It would be much more consistent if only the required burn time and direction were displayed as this is what you actually need to perform the burn (though making the burn time work properly would be a good idea too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022Don\u0027t use them\u0022 was not generally accepted as a counter-argument against the claim the ARM engines are overpowered.
