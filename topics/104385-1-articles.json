I found a reddit thread with just such a model and the poster made it clear he is ok with people making a KSP mod out of it. Im going to try my hand at converting the model. Should be easy as he already has UV unwrapped and textured it, just needs a collision mesh I think. I am familiar with the theory of using Unity and have read the tutorials. Ill start work on Monday ( if my schools lab is open, if not later). \n\nRenders: \n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
