Moho and Eve both have these discontinuities at specific times. I can only zoom in so far, but this pattern appears to continue to a point. What this means practically, is that launching before this moment, has high energy costs for getting there slightly faster than ideal (and less substantial costs for getting there slower); while after this moment, has high energy costs for getting there slightly slower (and less substantial costs for getting there faster). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo- is this an error in the utility, an error in ksp, or a real phenomenon? and if so- what is going on at that point? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RpOVteQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RpOVteQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T10:01:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you share the input parameters you used to get this result?

My guess is that the optimal transfer (for a given departure time and a time of flight) puts the periapsis slightly below the target. Fast transfers below the red line result in an encounter before reaching the periapsis, while slow transfers above the line have an encounter after the periapsis. To get an encounter at the periapsis, you have to make the transfer burn to a less than optimal direction, unless the timing is exactly right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T14:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe these only occur when you limit it to \u0022ballistic\u0022 trajectories, and arise because of difficulties with the inclination.

The reason for the higher dV in such cases is that to do this you must drop your periapsis down inside the target\u0027s orbit so that you get the crossing point with its orbit, otherwise you\u0027d be gaining altitude from your periapsis and moving further away from the target orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the early ejections to Eve, for example, will give you an intercept about 230ish degrees around from your ejection from Kerbin, and a periapsis quite a long way below Eve\u0027s orbit. You\u0027ll cross Eve\u0027s orbit twice, with the second crossing at the ascending node.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rousseau","CreatedById":98256,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-28T18:39:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, cantab you are correct, these points go away when set to optimal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERed Iron Crown these are the exact parameters i put in for the graph in the first post: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7nhYyN6.png\u0022 alt=\u00227nhYyN6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWonky orbital paths due to inclination seems reasonable.
