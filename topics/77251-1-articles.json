They\u0027re supposed to be the path of the future and, if we\u0027re ever to get out there into space, supposedly we\u0027ll need them as the stage between rockets and the space elevator, or at least, that appears to be the consensus in sci-fi. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve been playing around in KSP trying to build different versions of spaceplanes based on existing designs, to see how they would work and what\u0027s necessary to get a good spaceplane design. FAR has certainly made my life difficult, if instructive and I have decided that aerodynamics is officially evil. I\u0027ve been looking around the forums drawing a little bit of inspiration from other people\u0027s designs and I thought that I\u0027d post one that I haven\u0027t seen around the forums, which isn\u0027t to say it doesn\u0027t exist. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EEntente\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z35sEl0.png\u0022 alt=\u0022z35sEl0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HLZuotu.png\u0022 alt=\u0022HLZuotu.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EInspiration: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcorde: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe name comes from the squabble over Concorde\u0027s name.

Unfortunately, because fuel is very dense, the spaceplane wasn\u0027t long enough and the thing had not enough wing area, leading it to fall out of the sky at 10,000m, as well as not having enough mounting space for engines. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitially, I tried to compensate by adding in structural sections in between the fuel tanks, giving me a longer design than I was used to, so I could have bigger wings and more lift. So I went looking for inspiration and realised Concorde had the same long slender body, so I could use the same wing plan as an inspiration for my design. Unfortunately, I couldn\u0027t build the right wing plan using the traditional parts from B9, but then I discovered Procedural Wings. The tanker was too heavy to ever fly, but I realised if I replaced the tanks with cargo space, I\u0027d have an awesome cargo-lifter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003ECraft:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/pjkunifucj4b0k2/HL%20Entente%20V1_1%28Cargo%20Lifter%29.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/pjkunifucj4b0k2/HL%20Entente%20V1_1%28Cargo%20Lifter%29.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods required: B9 Spaceplane, Procedural Wings, MechJeb\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESlight warning: It\u0027s a bit big, so it might stress older machines.

Unfortunately, this is belied by the thing\u0027s absolutely dismal low-altitude handling. It bucks and it drops like crazy. Apparently, Concorde had the same problem and they fixed it by using a phenomenon with delta wings, which involves a vortex happening at high angle of attack. This is why Concorde has the really insanely high front landing gear. This effect does seem to be modelled in the game. This spaceplane takes off at about 40m/s less than a similar but much more stable design I tried, and will hold well if held at an angle of attack through the whole lower atmosphere. Otherwise, though, I have to use flaps to land the thing along with full engines, as the drag seems to make the thing more stable. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EIn space, it\u0027s not very manoeuvrable and expends a lot of monopropellant. It has enough to rendezvous with a station if you want it and then come down. However, it\u0027s not really meant to be manoeuvrable and it\u0027s easy enough to push its cargo into orbit and then let a tug push the cargo where it is supposed to be. I haven\u0027t checked what orbits it can achieve, but it gets to 360,000km pretty comfortably with fuel to spare. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight Profile:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake off: Take off speed is about 160m/s empty and it only goes up significantly if you really fill the cargo bay. It has a tendency to tail strike, so it\u0027s worth being careful on lift-off. If it\u0027s lightly loaded or empty, the engines are grossly over-powered, so be very careful of hitting high dynamic pressure. This happens almost immediately after take off, so the engines need to be throttled back, often to 30% if empty. 20-30 degrees lift is good for the first 10,000m, then reducing to 10 for the rest. Engines need to switch below 26,000 from air-breathing to rocket, although in practise it\u0027s rare to get the thing above 22,000m on air-breathing with any load, as the engines loose too much power and start to overheat. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpace: The big rocket engines cannot handle full rocket thrust for any length of time. Manually limiting them after take-off is a must whenever I\u0027ve done any MechJeb manoeuvres. 66.5 works well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding: The awesome high-altitude characteristics and it\u0027s sharp ballistic profile make re-entry a joy in this thing. The steeper the better, and use the flaps to bleed off velocity. Then pull up when you\u0027ve had enough plummeting through the atmosphere like a dropped stone. Unfortunately, this is balanced by it\u0027s absolutely dismal low-altitude handling. I could never get the whole thing to fly well at low altitude and the only way I can land the thing is by using the rear wing flaps (key 5), landing gear and the engines on full power. The increased drag seems to increase the stability of the flight and allows a successful coast over the runway. Adding the full flaps and bleeding off the power allows it to be brought in. I have landed it in one piece once using the keyboard, otherwise I tend to take the bottom engines out. I\u0027m sure that could be fixed with a few extra wheels, but meh. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EKeys:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - Switch Air-breathing/Rocket mode on the SABRE engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - Toggle cargo bay\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 - Toggle all flaps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4 - Toggle front flaps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 - Toggle read flaps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 - Toggle solar panels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7 - Toggle cargo bay lights\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-11T02:44:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAMAZING craft dude!

Unfortunately, it\u0027s the only way to spread the load enough. I wish there was some mod that created landing wheels in different sizes and shapes, but I haven\u0027t found one yet. However, if I went for a more traditional layout, this would create a lot of load on the runway. I know that KSP doesn\u0027t care about it, but I remember reading how the Skylon, a lighter craft with a traditional 3-gear system, has to have a reinforced runway to take off from with a 40 ton load. The Entente should not have this problem and should land and take-off on a commercial runway, which is good and important to me. I did experiment briefly, in another design, with playing with the steering on such a arrangement, getting the rear wheels to have their steering reversed and having the middle wheels respond to controls less than the front ones, much like lorries are designed to do and it was viable, although I don\u0027t know if it was practical. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERunning off the runway strangely doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem and it is one of the better craft I\u0027ve designed for travelling down and getting off the runway.

But I achieved my goal of topping out over a certain person.))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SP-409 is my current 100\u002B ton lifter, and it is going through its trial run right now, I am slowly tweaking, and fine tuning the design. It is currently experiencing a serrious case of \u0022Mach Tuck\u0022 at mach 1. I have mostly fixed the problem, but I am still working on it. I also added some new features to the SP-409 which has become standard on all my vessels, and that is a crew escape system, to save the crew of the vessel incase of emergancy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut feel free to ask me any questions, and I am highly honored that one of my designs inspired you to build this wonderful craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
