Is it yours? Since i am an astrophotographer and have many hours of astrophotography under my belt with various problems and challenges that an astrophotography has i can give you a few suggestions.\n\n1) bad calibration of the image, not likely since the picture would have many errors not one.\n\n2) bad preorcessing of the image (stacking of images and noise removal algorithms)\n\n3) something bad happened during the proccesing of the image\n\n4) The most likely scenario is that it is a geostationary sattelite track that did not go away during preprosseing/processing of the image. The area of orion\u0027s belt has many geostationary satellites and i have captured myself some in my early days of astrophotography at M42 and at the horsehead nembula (actually at the horsehead nebula there is a satelite that passes at the same time, good thing that i can get rid off it at preproccesing)\n\n5) if it is not yours someone may have painted a line at the image which is also very likely since the image is of high quality capture and proccesing and would not justify that error\n\nsaid image with satelite track at the right\n\n![7175bd20d32860b4482731671c330e1c.1824x0_q100_watermark_watermark_opacity-10_watermark_position-6_watermark_text-Copyright%20kookoo_gr.jpg](http://cdn.astrobin.com/images/thumbs/7175bd20d32860b4482731671c330e1c.1824x0_q100_watermark_watermark_opacity-10_watermark_position-6_watermark_text-Copyright%20kookoo_gr.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T09:52:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 09:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kookoo\\_gr**"},{"CreatedByName":"Albert VDS","CreatedById":74055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T12:44:34Z","Content":"It obviously has bee tampered with, just a strike of the pencil tool in any paint program.\n\nHere\u0027s the original from hubblesite.org:\n\n![hs-2006-01-a-large_web.jpg](http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/images/hs-2006-01-a-large_web.jpg)\n\nThis is a newer one from NASA\n\n![orion_hubble_960.jpg](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1207/orion_hubble_960.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-04T13:01:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/04/2015 01:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Albert VDS**"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T16:01:53Z","Content":"Latest information I\u0027ve been reading, is that the \u0027Pillars of Creation\u0027 would be more aptly named the \u0027Pillars of Destruction\u0027.
