If a shuttle is mounted on standard medium or heavy landing gear the ISRU stuff should be able to reach the ground (i.e. I\u0027m thinking about a shuttle that can fly to minmus or Laythe or the mun and drill there to refuel). It\u0027d be a useful way to haul cargo from there to kerbin and vice versa.
