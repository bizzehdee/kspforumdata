This contract pack itself may have some overlap in the type of contracts that MC2 provides, so I although I doubt anything will break if you have both, it may not be the \u0022ideal\u0022 play experience.\n\nAs far grand tour contracts, I\u0027ve never been aware of MC2 having them.

I\u0027m preparing a big update to a new system that should be bug free when it comes to contracts.

Since I\u0027ve done this with scripts, it should be fairly easy to generate a set of contracts for OPM. I\u0027ll also be doing a set of contracts for OPM with the UnmannedContracts (and Rover contracts, when that is finished).\n\nI haven\u0027t decided yet whether to simply include the contracts in the current mods, or to have two (or three, when the Rover missions are released) new ones.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What I worried about was that MC2 and this mod overwrite the same files, and that by getting this mod I would lose the MC2 contracts.
