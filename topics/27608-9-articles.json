For me, it has singlehandedly saved the spaceplane aspect of the game, which was beginning to feel stale after so many repetitions of the same design using stock wing parts. Especially with FAR, pWings has revolutionized spaceplane design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one, small cosmetic aspect that bugs me, however. When I change the root scale of a wing, it not only scales the wing lengthwise, but also thickness-wise, so that the wing keeps the same general cross-section. While this makes perfect sense (the root of a tapered wing will of course be thicker than the wingtip), if I\u0027m trying to create a delta-winged SSTO, with the wing root running the whole length of the aircraft, the wing root will sometimes be about a meter thick! The problem is exacerbated in the B9 pWing, which is already super-thick to begin with!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other words, could it be possible to make the wings scale only lengthwise, rather than length-and-height-wise?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrsinister","CreatedById":66816,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T23:21:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eamazing work!
