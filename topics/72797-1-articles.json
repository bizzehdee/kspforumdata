I sent a manned rescue ship and docked with a stranded manned command pod in orbit around the mun. I burned to a reentry trajectory while still docked, and then undocked as the ships were entering the atmosphere. I deployed my parachutes on both vessels successfully, but for some reason my second (rescued) ship seems to have disappeared. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some research, I heard ships will despawn if they\u0027re \u0026gt;2.5 km away from the ship you\u0027re focused on? If this is the case with my scenario, I don\u0027t understand why ships in orbit don\u0027t disappear. Is there anyway to change this threshold? I suppose I could try to leave ships docked during reentry, but I didn\u0027t think just the magnets would be able to withstand the stress. I guess I\u0027m just looking for confirmation of my hypothesis and ideas for how to prevent loss of ships like this in the future. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. I know rescue missions normally involve kerbals just transferring to rescue, but I wanted to save the vessel too in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sewerbird","CreatedById":62540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T12:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVessels that arrive on a point of their trajectory that passes below the surface (or the .1 pressure mark in an atmosphere, I believe) will be \u0027cleaned up\u0027 by KSP when they leave your physics range (which I think is 2.3km).

The full simulation and \u0027on rails\u0027. Whenever you are going at 4x timewarp or below you are in full simulation mode; Your ship and everything within ~2.2km is being fully simulated. Each part can exert forces on the other parts, parts can rotate, parts experience drag, engines and thrusters can fire, etc. When you timewarp to 5x or above you switch to on rails mode. On rails is a much faster type of simulation where it treats your ship as a single solid mass and simply calculates it\u0027s orbit. This is the reason you can\u0027t timewarp to 5x while your ship is in the atmosphere - it would stop simulating important things like drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnything outside of the 2.2km bubble is always \u0027on rails\u0027 regardless of timewarp. This way you can have dozens of ships in orbit without the game slowing down. When it comes to planets objects that are on rails follow much simplier rules - drag is not simulated and anything that passes below a certain altitude (set by planet) is assumed to have crashed and is deleted. This is generally considered a good trade off, since any object you leave unattended is usually either in a stable orbit or is on a collision course (discarded boosters or other things).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T12:53:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022InF3RNo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022InF3RNo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHello you talk about docking, how that works?
