All the code changes and testing is done. All that is left is MerlinsMaster is just finishing the textures on the new CRY-0300R part. I am planning to release it before the end of this week. At the end of this week I will be going on my annual vacation and there will be no further updates until 2016 when I return after New Year. \n\n**Proposed** Changelog at this stage:\n\n    V0.20.0.0 \u0022External Radial Pods\u0022\n    Added new Radial External Cryopod - The CRY-0300R. A single kerbal Cryopod part that can be radially attached. The CRY-0300R also has an attach point at the top of the pod.\n    Great for adding radial pods to your vessel or inside a SpacePlane CargoBay! Fits inside the Mk-2 \u0026 Mk-3 Cargo bays, the part does clip through the base of cargo bays as it is primarily designed to attach to the outside of a curved part. However, if you get creative you can fit it into a Cargo bay using girders or octaganol struts.\n    The CRY-0300R supports RasterPropMonitor transparent pods (yes it\u0027s transparent if you have RPM installed).\n    The CRY-0300R also has an external EVA hatch. The CRY-0300R only weighs 0.87t (the full CRY-0300 weights 2.62t) and appears in the TechTree at spaceExploration (same as the CRY-0300).\n    This now completes the set of all the originally planned DeepFreeze parts.\n    MerlinsMaster has re-textured more details into all the Cryopods.\n    Fixed Pod transparency for the CRY-0300 (and the CRY-0300R) based on RPM transparency setting in flight and also now works in the Editor (VAB/SPH). However, due to the complications of DeepFreeze parts transparency can either be ON or OFF (RPM AUTO setting is treated as Transparency OFF).\n    Fixed bug where the External Door Open/Close sound effect was not working for the CRY-0300.\n    Rationalis(z)ed all the part models and textures into one folder, as a lot of them are shared. This will save some memory. Thanks goes to khr15714n for kicking me into doing this as I have been meaning to for a while.\n    Due to this however, if you are upgrading from a previous version of DeepFreeze you MUST delete the /GameData/REPOSoftTech/DeepFreeze entirely BEFORE installing this version. If you want to save your DeepFreeze settings make a backup/copy of /GameData/REPOSoftTech/DeepFreeze/Plugins/Config.cfg file BEFORE deleting your DeepFreeze folder then copy you backup/copy of this file back into the /GameData/REPOSoftTech/DeepFreeze/Plugins folder once you have upgraded.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-07T06:28:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2015 06:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JPLRepo**"},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T10:00:28Z","Content":"V0.20.0.0 released.

Is there contracts that go beyond Kerbin\u0027s SOI that would make sense to do this? If this is a sought after feature I can investigate adding ability to freeze/thaw tourists.\n\u003E \n\nThe combination of LS and long distance contracts could make it interesting, however, if a tourist crosses a boundary whilst frozen, the game will not recognize the achievement. Let\u0027s say, solar orbit is on the list, freeze him in kerbin orbit, thaw in duna orbit, the whole solar orbit part will not be recognized. Not really an issue, since the tourist was a piece of ice at the time."},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T01:16:20Z","Content":"hey will there be a sort of timer function added? so you can have your kerbs frozen to a certain period of time, or to a certain number of minutes or second before a manuever node? because for some reason the RT status indicator underneath MET is N/A, and i cant access the flight control or whatever its called to time a thawing of my kerbals, which i havent yet frozen."},{"CreatedByName":"JPLRepo","CreatedById":114736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T03:13:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, 123nick said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E hey will there be a sort of timer function added? so you can have your kerbs frozen to a certain period of time, or to a certain number of minutes or second before a manuever node? because for some reason the RT status indicator underneath MET is N/A, and i cant access the flight control or whatever its called to time a thawing of my kerbals, which i havent yet frozen.\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m not following your entire query. Re: Timer function- you can add a KAC alarm based on whatever you like that KAC supports (time, SOI change, man node, etc) and then set freeze thaw commands that are attached to the KAC alarm (assuming you have KAC installed). Re: RT status. You cannot issue Deepfreeze commands to a vessel that has no RT connection or thawed kerbal on-board. N/A usually means you don\u0027t have RT installed?

With KAC installed you can attach freeze/thaw commands to any KAC alarm. These will execute regardless of your Remote Tech status. But you Must have a RT connection or active Kerbal when you create and attach the freeze /thaw commands to the alarm."},{"CreatedByName":"123nick","CreatedById":27488,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-24T04:00:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Just now, JPLRepo said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yes that is correct.
