I also know little about orbital mechanics.\n\nFor your first rendezvous I\\\u0027d suggest launching your target into a circular orbit of 350km with as close to zero inclination as possible (reason for the relatively high altitude is so you can use a higher time compression factor). Make sure your ships are easy to control in orbit with lots of RCS fuel. You\\\u0027ll need it.\n\nObviously you\\\u0027ll now need to launch your chase vessel into as close an orbit as your target. Once this is done do as follows:\n\n- [li]Go into Orbital Map view. Focus the camera on Kerbin[/li]  \n[li]Zoom the camera in as much as possible so that you can still see the relevant orbital tracks just \\\u0027in front\\\u0027 of the camera[/li]  \n[li]Now find one of the points where the two orbital tracks cross over each other (there will be two points 180 degrees apart)[/li]  \n[li]Orientate your ship so that it\\\u0027s locked Northwards (best done with the \\\u0027\u002B NML\\\u0027 button on MechJeb)[/li]  \n[li]When your ship reaches one of the \\\u0027crossover points\\\u0027 along its orbit make a small forwards RCS burn with fine controls **on** (\\\u0027Ctrl\\\u0027 key then \\\u0027h\\\u0027 key)[/li]\n\nIf you do the above while in the Orbital Map view you should notice that the orbital tracks begin to converge at the two points at **ninety** degrees of your orbital position. Simply keep firing forward with the RCS and you should be able to match up your orbital inclination with that of the target almost exactly. If you find burning Northward increases your separation, just burn your RCS in the opposite direction with the \\\u0027n\\\u0027 key to give you a Southward burn.\n\nOnce you\\\u0027ve got the inclinations synced nicely match up either Ap or Pe with your target. Leave the other at least 10km higher or lower. This will enable you to catch up the other ship (or the other ship to catch up to you). When you both eventually meet at your Ap/Pe then all you have to do is circularise and you\\\u0027ve got a nice easy rendezvous - no Rincomp required.\n\nSee this thread for some extremely close intercepts I\\\u0027ve achieved with this method: [http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10570.0](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=10570.0)\n\nP.S. I plan on doing a more in-depth guide on this subject in the near future...\n\nEDIT: Not tried it but I think the above method should also work for rendezvousing with other ships that themselves have an eccentric orbit.

Probably a good deal more difficult I should imagine though!\n\nI suspect (but am not math-worthy enough to prove) that what happens is that you\\\u0027re pivoting the orbit around a line between where you are and the focus of the orbit (yeah, yeah, an ellipse has two foci; what I mean here is the focus that holds the body around which you\\\u0027re orbiting.

The Pe is on the short end of a lever arm with the fulcrum at the center of mass, so a small change in Pe can make a \\*huge\\* change in Ap.\n\nIn my experience, the biggest problem is running out of patience, especially when the target gets close enough that you can see it.

I made an assumption that your target would have as perfect a circular orbit as possible (it\\\u0027s not difficult with fine RCS control). Then basically you make your chase ship\\\u0027s Ap or Pe coincide exactly with your target ship\\\u0027s altitude. Then within a few periods (depending on how elliptical the chase ship\\\u0027s orbit is) both chase and target ship should meet at the same point and you can circularise. I\\\u0027ve never had any trouble seeing Ap/Pe for both ships in these circumstances.\n\nYou mentioned in an earlier post you\\\u0027d not yet accomplished a rendezvous - did you mean target in elliptical orbit or circular? I assumed the latter so directed my advice that way. Apologies if I got the wrong end of the stick (and a little off topic!). =P\n\nMy edit referred to the fact that you should be able to invert this for chasing a target in an elliptical orbit. Instead of your chase ship using an elliptical \\\u0027chase\\\u0027 orbit, use a circular one with an altitude the same as the target\\\u0027s Pe.

I\\\u0027ve never had any trouble seeing Ap/Pe for both ships in these circumstances.\n\nWell, sure, for a circular orbit there\\\u0027s not much difference in Ap and Pe to begin with. Your Ap and Pe are marked on the map, but those of your target aren\\\u0027t. Doesn\\\u0027t matter much if you\\\u0027re both in circular orbits, since there\\\u0027s not much difference to begin with.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E You mentioned in an earlier post you\\\u0027d not yet accomplished a rendezvous - did you mean target in elliptical orbit or circular?\n\nI\\\u0027m not the original poster of the thread. I poked my head in here because the target I use is in a mildly elliptical orbit; it\\\u0027s something I put up there when I was still arguing with getting to circular orbits. I also have a much more elliptical target out there that I\\\u0027ll work on once I get it down with this mildly elliptical one.\n\nIt is the case that I have not yet succeeded. I can easily get within 20Km of the target. With more time and patience, I managed to get within 90m last night. At which point I got all enthused and tried to tweak the last little bit by sight. \n\nAs I said, my primary barrier is patience. I have no doubt that with sufficient patience I can succeed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The increased difficulty of rendezvous with a target in an elliptical orbit would probably be using the Orbital Map view to synchronise inclinations, especially if the target\\\u0027s Ap is *miiiillles* away.

With sufficient patience, you can approach that point then do the burn as you describe.\n\nAligning the major axes is a bit trickier. As I mentioned, the Ap and Pe of your orbit are marked on the map view, but those of your target are not. When you target Kerbin and zoom out enough to see the whole orbit, you can\\\u0027t see enough detail to see small misalignments. When you target your ship and zoom in to see the difference between close orbits, you can\\\u0027t see enough of the orbit to find the difference. And small differences in Pe position translate to large differences in Ap position.\n\nIt\\\u0027d be nice if you could scroll around the orbit while you were zoomed in really close to the ship.\n\nA rendezvous with debris in a highly elliptical orbit will be even trickier, as the orbits of debris aren\\\u0027t even displayed unless you mouse over the debris. It\\\u0027d be nice if there were some way to select a target and have its orbit displayed with Ap and Pe markers as long as it\\\u0027s selected."},{"CreatedByName":"Excalibur","CreatedById":12839,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-14T11:42:53Z","Content":"Posting after bed-time isn\\\u0027t a good idea for me, I seem to get a bit muddled. ;D\n\nYou\\\u0027re right about the main challenge of elliptical rendezvous being lining up the major axes.
