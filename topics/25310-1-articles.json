The energy to raise your AP and then lower it again will far outweigh the energy savings, but if you include it in your capture sequence, I think you can save quite a few m/s of delta-V, especially if you want to go from a 0 degree to 90 degree (or even 180) inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rockhem","CreatedById":57141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T19:57:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis 90 degree equatorial? if not i meant 90 degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hapaxLegomina","CreatedById":57082,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T20:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rockhem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rockhem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eugh, i am awful at this i still can\u0027t get it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/zCUqnUl\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDoes this help?\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rockhem","CreatedById":57141,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T20:03:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan i do a ejection burn without changing my orbit inclination?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"johnpoz","CreatedById":57155,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T20:14:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t get what - you don\u0027t know what normal \u002B or - is?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe this helps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/w/images/thumb/0/01/Orbit.svg/410px-Orbit.svg.png\u0022 alt=\u0022410px-Orbit.svg.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the arrow pointing up that says Orbit Normal next to it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo your flying around the edge of the orbit plane -- if your pointing UP then you would be normal \u002B if your - then your rocket would be pointing down...
