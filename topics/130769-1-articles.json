It might, might not.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a post on NOAA\u0027s own ENSO site (at climate.gov) regarding uncertainty in the temperature measurements within the area of the ocean in question. It\u0027s \u002B-0.3 \u00B0C. That\u0027s more than the claimed (not even observed, which is lower) average temperature anomaly\u00A0in a few decades. So you have an entirely reasonable ENSO event (a couple in the 80s and 90s were stronger), and the temperature measurements of the ocean involved cannot be said to be higher within uncertainty in any case. There is no link. Crying \u0022global warming\u0022 with each weather event doesn\u0027t make the point, it looks like hyperbole.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote also that the number of such sea temperature observations is currently twice the number of such observations 10 years ago (current approaches 35,000 measurements), and 3 times higher than the 1990s. Before 1990, such observations were effectively random (ships measuring water temperature that happened to be passing by the region, it\u0027s under 1000 in the 80s, and before that its below 100 per year back as far as there is any data at all. So basically you can talk about ENSO events before the \u002780s, but it could have been much stronger, or the sea temp much higher, and no one would really know well. That\u0027s the problem with comparing to any old climate data, there is not good data.
