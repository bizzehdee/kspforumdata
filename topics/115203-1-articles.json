However, aside from one thread, it doesn\u0027t appear to merit much mention. I\u0027m a little surprised, since High Frontier is all about building rockets, landing on sites to ISRU refuel and build factories and making Hohmann transfers. It also has one of the most amazing board game maps ever:\n\n![Oj5XfO5.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Oj5XfO5.jpg)\n\nI\u0027m the (unpaid) community manager for [the Kickstarter for the 3rd edition that is running at the moment](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/highfrontier/high-frontier-0) (the above map is from the 2nd edition) and the (unpaid) developer of the 3rd edition of High Frontier Interstellar game which has already been funded as a stretch goal.\n\nIf you want to know more about High Frontier, either pop over to the Kickstarter page or [the Boardgame Geek page](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/47055/high-frontier) or feel free to ask me a question below and I\u0027ll be more than happy to answer."},{"CreatedByName":"Falkon","CreatedById":133880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T20:39:59Z","Content":"I\u0027ve only watched videos of the gameplay for High Frontier - personally, I find it too complicated for a board game. I think it\u0027s a fantastic idea overcomplicated by too much rocket science."},{"CreatedByName":"andrewdoull","CreatedById":147573,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T21:46:17Z","Content":"It\u0027s a lot simpler than a lot of the video reviews make out because the 3rd edition goes a long way towards simplifying two complex parts of movement: the rocket diagram and take off and landing. The actual turn by turn mechanics are move and make an operation and operations are usually straight forward.\n\nThe complexity comes from mission planning but I expect Kerbal players to show no fear here."}]}
