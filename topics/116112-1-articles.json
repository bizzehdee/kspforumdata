That is close to 2% of the energy, and if we let it expand it will be 5% to 7% more, which is the energy needed to compress it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIgnoring inefficiencies with the system (as these don\u0027t destroy energy, just create heat), a 100% efficient electrolysis process under pressure must take more energy than a similar process at atmospheric pressure, otherwise \u0022free energy\u0022 would be possible. The electrolysis products have more energy when they are at high pressure, so they must take more energy to produce.\u003Cp\u003EI think what the link is talking about is the efficiency of the electrolysis process itself, and the ease of storage. At higher pressure, the bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen produced will be smaller for the same mass. this means that less of the surface of the cathode and anode will be covered by non-conducting bubbles, meaning the overall resistance of the system (and therefore the amount of energy that gets wasted as heat) is reduced. You get a lower theoretical efficiency, but you can achieve a much higher proportion of it, similar to how the Otto cycle used for petrol engines has a higher theoretical efficiency than diesel, but diesel engines usually have higher real-world efficiencies, because they run at higher compression ratios, meaning they get a lot closer to their theoretical efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, gases need to be compressed for storage, so if they are produced at high pressure, you save yourself compression work later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EYeah, is like you said, it just make the method more efficient by other means, but not sure how much improve we are talking about...\u003Cp\u003EIncluding compression vs other methods, maybe 3 or 5%? It would be great if we can get the heat from an hydrothermal vent, that would reduce the power needed by a lot, also all hydrothermal vent are pretty costant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure how the sea composition change with deep, this is on average:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Sea_salt-e-dp_hg.svg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sea_salt-e-dp_hg.svg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
