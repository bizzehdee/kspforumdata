Set prograde hold in stock aero, and a huge reduction in drag magically takes place.  If you can contrive enough lift while on prograde hold, you\u0027re golden.\n\nMy Panther /  Terrier \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E ships  end up fighting 30-40kn drag at mach 3 which means  I can\u0027t get away with such low rocket mode \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E as I can in stock aero or the grav losses kill me.\n\nAs a result I\u0027m trying for a TSTO vessel first,  which punches off the jet engine, intake and empty fuel tanks to get the dry mass down.    Unfortunately I need to increase vertical stabilizer area,   at very high speeds, best L/D ratio is around an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E of 9 degrees, but holding 9 degree \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E at mach 4-5 over 30km yaw stability is poor.      Also i\u0027d used the basic winglets to fill in bumps in the cross sectional area profile of the airplane,  it\u0027s the only suitably small part i have unlocked but unfortunately these started melting about now asymmetrically,   which didn\u0027t help much.\n\nTake off speed was over 150 m/s btw, which is ridiculous,  even though i normally obsess over low speed performance.
