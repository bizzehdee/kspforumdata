I would like to create a kind of \u0022rescue craft\u0022 (on kerbin).\n\nUsing KAS I would like to drag/drop things from/to the vessel (I would like to design it with stock parts only).\n\nAnother solution for my rescue missions would be to paradrop help from the sky.\n\nWhat is the usefull mod to \u0022drop\u0022 an item with chute and leave the zone ?\n\nThanks in advance !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T20:42:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Maukse**"},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T18:46:31Z","Content":"You want to put your vertical engines directly at the center of mass, however if you use two make sure they are equally distant from the VTOL. Secondly, your center of mass should slightly change as you run out of fuel, if not then you may encounter problems when you have low fuel. Restrict from using too many control surfaces because it often causes uneven distribution of aerodynamics. Lastly, use incline stabilizers they will significantly help. I made a VTOL myself here.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112868-VTOL-AeroSpace-F-35-MetalStorm?p=1785385](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/112868-VTOL-AeroSpace-F-35-MetalStorm?p=1785385)\n\nHope this helps"},{"CreatedByName":"FlipNascar","CreatedById":137605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T18:52:33Z","Content":"The one tool that will help you massively is [RCS Build Aid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35996-0-90-RCS-Build-Aid-v0-6-1-engine-gimbals).
