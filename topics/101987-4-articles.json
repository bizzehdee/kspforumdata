In the event of an emergency on orbit, assuming they don\u0027t immediately die, they can just get in the Soyuz and deorbit. Home in a few hours!\n\n How do you escape from a sinking submarine?\n\nMost U.S. Navy submarines have two escape routes-called \u0022escape trunks\u0022-that can be used to escape if ever needed. They work like an \u0022air lock\u0022 that you may have seen in a movie. The men climb into the escape trunk wearing a special life preserver that has a hood on it to provide a bubble of air to breathe. When the lower hatch is shut, the trunk is filled with water and pressurized to sea pressure. The trunk\u0027s outside hatch opens, and the men float to the surface.\n\n How are people rescued from a sunken submarine?\n\nThere are systems built into the submarine to assist the crew to escape safely, if required. The Navy has also developed two rescue submarines called Deep Submersible Rescue Vehicles (DSRV). You may have seen them in the movies, Hunt for Red October, or Gray Lady Down. They drive up to the damaged submarine, mate to the escape hatch and take the crew to safety. New technologies are planned for incorporation into the next generation rescue system called the \u0022Submarine Rescue Diving and Recompression System.\u0022\n\n[http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/faq.html](http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/faq.html)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T04:08:53Z","Content":"Not only are astronauts mentally prepared, but they have a lot of things to do.
