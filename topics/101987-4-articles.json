The men climb into the escape trunk wearing a special life preserver that has a hood on it to provide a bubble of air to breathe. When the lower hatch is shut, the trunk is filled with water and pressurized to sea pressure. The trunk\u0027s outside hatch opens, and the men float to the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E How are people rescued from a sunken submarine?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are systems built into the submarine to assist the crew to escape safely, if required. The Navy has also developed two rescue submarines called Deep Submersible Rescue Vehicles (DSRV). You may have seen them in the movies, Hunt for Red October, or Gray Lady Down. They drive up to the damaged submarine, mate to the escape hatch and take the crew to safety.

Death is just outside the hull when you\u0027re on a ship, too. Whether you know how to swim or not, falling off a boat at sea is about as lethal as falling off a cliff. You might survive but chances are you won\u0027t because your melon sized head is very difficult to spot. Ocean passages in the age of discovery would take months or years, the ships they used were tiny and cramped, and the statistical probability of reaching home again wasn\u0027t very good for the average crew member. Storms, disease, hostile natives, etc. all took their toll yet people still went. It may be difficult to understand for someone who\u0027s only ever known a comfortable urban life, but there are plenty of hardy people in the world who not only can survive harsh and isolated conditions; they thrive in them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a huge difference between a sea going vessel and a airtight spacecraft.
