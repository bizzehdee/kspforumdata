This direction affects the orientation of any part that connects to this node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESize is a number, from 0 to 5, that indicates the size of the attachment node. This is to later require use of adapters to connect larger parts to smaller ones (think Saturn 5 and it\u0027s cone sections)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the \u0027scale\u0027 parameter has an effect on the node definitions. It\u0027s used to convert the model-space coordinates in node and effect definitions to the proper scale. This depends on the scale you\u0027re working at. KSP uses 1 unit = 1 meter, so if your 3D scene is setup like that, leave scale at 1.0... if, for example, you\u0027re using 1 unit = 10cm, the scale parameter should be at 0.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is to make life easier when writing down positions for the nodes... this way, you can just get the node\u0027s scene position, and paste it directly (you only have to remember to swap Y and Z if your modelling program uses Z-up instead of Y-up, like 3Ds Ma does)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SDK will include a 3Ds Max script (made by Moach, modified by me) that automatically outputs the correct coordinates for any given node. So you can paste it directly to the cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps, I\u0027ll try to get that SDK up as soon as possible!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PeriapsisPrograde","CreatedById":33,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-06-28T19:47:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGrr.
