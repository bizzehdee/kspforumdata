I am making a crawler but it\u0027s currently immobile. KerbTown\u0027s support of animations is limited, which means it\u0027s not possible to have it actually crawling around (I\u0027ve been working on animations and just found the limitation. Disappointing.). It will probably be released just as a static initially (that can be launched off) and then at some point in the future, assuming I can get tracks to work, as parts.\u003Cp\u003EEDIT - Lack has managed to get around the limitations, I suspect by just \u0027hard-wiring\u0027 his animations from Blender to Unity. By that I mean he skips Unity\u0027s poor animation suite by simply doing them in another package and importing them and then he skips the KerbTown layer of the API and goes straight to KSP\u0027s native animation support. So KSP must actually load some stuff from static configs the same way it does parts.
