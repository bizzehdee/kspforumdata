But my problems is, on kethane scanner coordinates are like, -16.0 5.0 or similar on mechjeb I put in the same, but then there is this choice of North or South, West or East I think, and I cannot figure out which is which from the kethane scanner, and I constantly land on wrong coordinates because I didn\u0027t get the North or South part right, which is not displayed by the scanner. Can anyone help out?
