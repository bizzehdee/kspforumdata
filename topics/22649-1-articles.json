I wanted to find list of structured, tutorial esque missions to run in order to re-acquaint myself with KSP (and pull off a mun landing/docking, things I hadn\u0027t done before). I found an excellent set of historical missions over on the KSP wiki. I believe \u0022Crush\u0022 is the author.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have successfully completed a few of them, and am working on his Luna-9 mission. found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Luna_9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Luna_9\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue is that while I followed the build instructions to the letter, I can never seem to get the rocket into a circular orbit using only the first two stages as is instructed in the tutorial. I\u0027ve watched the \u0022Flight of the Munitar\u0022 to try to get pointers, but I think the difference in the rockets makes that video less useful for getting the Luna 9 up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried numerous combinations of speed, altitude, burn times and gravity turns, but regardless, I seem to run out of fuel in my stage 2 tanks prior to circularization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sovek","CreatedById":57251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T00:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIIRC things were re-balanced in .19, that is a tutorial for .18, hence why you are running out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T00:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe changes between .18 and .19 were pretty minor, all the components in that rocket should work exactly the same.

So looks like you\u0027re doing fine, but maybe the tutorial could use some rewording. It was also difficult for MechJeb to control that rocket (didn\u0027t try it manually) without using all the RCS fuel for the ascent, so perhaps fins or LV-T45\u0027s instead of LV-T30\u0027s would be a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jester238","CreatedById":39991,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T15:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, thank you.
