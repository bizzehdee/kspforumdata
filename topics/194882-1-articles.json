I haven\u0027t seen anything that can make a Kerbal talk. Sure, there\u0027s Chatterer and all, but you can\u0027t exactly control what the kerbals speak. So here\u0027s my request: a in-game Plugin that makes Kerbals talk (In Kerbalese, of course). Preferably connected to animations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow I think it might work:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, we all know Kerbals speak backward Spanish. So we could get 2 Spanish speaking volunteers (one male, one female), and record all the letters in 3 ways: Angry. Happy, and Neutral. Then we would need to process the sounds so each of the letters are backwards. That\u0027s the easy part. Then we need someone to write an plugin so that it would work in-game. There should be a volume slider. Then, the player types in what they want the kerbal to say, and it gets converted to Kerbalese. Of course, they should select angry, happy, or neutral, and gender should default to the gender fo the kerbal. Preferably, it might also interface with the Kerbal animations so it looks like the Kerbal is talking. Needless to say, this isn\u0027t easy, and we might need a translator plugin for it to work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I found this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u002258414\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed358443817\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/27187-how-to-speak-kerbal-with-translator/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-19T23:32:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut....why?
