Its perhaps one of the best Early Access I\u0027ve ever played). I\u0027ve had it for about a year now, but I\u0027ve only sunk about 43 hours into so far (I\u0027m mainly waiting for new campaign levels and features). Actually... Now that you mention it, I think its about time I checked in on the new community levels...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried the community levels yet? The level editor in Distance is really powerful and allows for a lot of crazy track designs. The quality of some of those community levels is absolutely stunning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-01T02:17:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI played Nictronic rush a long time ago, the fact that this came out is awesome!
