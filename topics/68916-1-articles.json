If a space ship is moving at high speeds hitting even the smallest of particles can cause massive damage. Most often this is not even noticed in sci fi, or it is explained that the ships have force fields. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came up with an idea for a shield that I believe might be a viable option for shielding a space ship from the threat. Since I know NASA is going to be all over this thing, I am going to name it the Othuyeg shield and they won\u0027t be able to pronounce it in their press release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea is to pump a large blob of ferrofluid on top of the space ship (for example the nose) and then to keep it there with a magnetic field. The liquid will absorbe the energy of an impact and then reform under the magnetic field.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscuss, admire and behold my magnificence.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SargeRho","CreatedById":25468,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T19:08:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ship would accumulate a cloud of particles ahead of itself if it has an erosion shield. I think the idea behind Project Daedalus\u0027 starship was that the beryllium erosion shield is initially erroded by impacts, creating a cloud of particles that act as primary shield. Another, way too expensive method, would be to create a bubble of antimatter around the ship that annihilates everything that comes in, while also acting as Explosive Reactive Armor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr you can wrap it in Graphene.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSaint","CreatedById":70033,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T19:22:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a solution in search of a problem.

Bearing in mind that real hard data on the interstellar medium is kinda sparse there is no way to know how much shielding you would need, so best load up for the worst possible case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Psycix","CreatedById":76916,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T21:46:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TheSaint\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TheSaint\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s a solution in search of a problem.
