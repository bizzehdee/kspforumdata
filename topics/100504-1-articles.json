Currently I am building this in sandbox mode, but when the time comes that it does not destroy itself (and the runway) as soon as I click Launch, the craft file will be transferred to a career mode, and constructed at a Minmus shipyard using EL and Karbonite.\n\nThat day may be some time in coming, however.\n\n![WPEgB8A.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WPEgB8A.jpg)\n\n(for scale)\n\n![5da4pys.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5da4pys.jpg)\n\n99% of my test efforts to merely get this thing to the pad structurally intact have resulted in horrible, spectacular failure and explosions. KSP physics absolutely *hates* this beast.\n\nI named it the Kraken for irony, though I don\u0027t suspect I\u0027d have any better luck if I called it something else. Still, it feels a bit like naming a ship \u0022The Unsinkable\u0022 - not so much tempting fate as inviting it home for dinner and a roll in the sheets.\n\nI will continue to log my progress here, in the hope that sometime this year, I come up with something functional.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nSo far, this bare-bones framework version has been the only one to survive the Launch button.\n\n![00fktim.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/00fktim.jpg)\n\nIt\u0027s even capable of taking off, although it lacks the dV required for attaining orbit (let alone any kind of interplanetary shenanigans).\n\n![USe11oH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/USe11oH.jpg)\n\nHowever, the COM and COT are horribly misaligned for VTOL use and the thing flies like a drunken brick (even with HX-scale SAS rings on each engine)\n\n![cCo0MaR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cCo0MaR.jpg)\n\nI suspect this may be my current \u0022best\u0022 approach however - create a stable, working engine system first, then worry about the landing strip.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T07:11:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 07:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kieve**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T08:23:44Z","Content":"Tonight\u0027s update/progress (of sorts) has mostly been theorycrafting. I\u0027ve continued to find B9 HX parts unreliable/unstable, even based on a reasonably solid framework. No pictures were taken of the subsequent explosions - they all start to look the same after a while. The flat structural plates have proven quite sturdy however, so I\u0027m beginning to think my best course of action is to make use of the nodes on those (or flat attachment, where possible). Sets of downward-facing engines are a must under any circumstance - the Laythe landing will require some form of vertical thrust to set down smoothly.\n\nStructural plates have always been part of the plan, due to their high impact tolerance (80m/s), but I\u0027m thinking I may give the welding mod a try and fashion a solid hull to build on. Reduced part count is a perk, although not a huge issue right now. However, this means at least roughly determining the center of mass (for engine thrust) first, since part of that plan was to incorporate the \u0022frame\u0022-type plates as impact guards for the HX engines (at 187.5% scale, the 8m 4-way frames match up quite well with a 4-pack of HX engines). Transform gizmo can be used to fine-tune positioning as needed, but building a solid hull and welding it together, *then finding engine frames are misaligned* is just not something I want to go through, and I can absolutely see myself doing it.\n\nOn a related topic, I went hunting for previous topics / pics of Laythe aircraft carriers and was surprised by how little I turned up. The carriers I saw were all stock-ish builds for Kerbin, using either the grey plates or structural wings. BoatParts deserves a mention too, but I\u0027ve found no indication anyone flew one of those carriers to Laythe either.\n\nI know it *must* have been done, somewhere, but for the time being I have very little to reference. Anyone out there know of some Laythe missions that put a carrier in the water? I\u0027m curious to see the results. Might give me some hints on how to continue assembling my sea-beastie here."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T16:23:21Z","Content":"Sorry, I saw this earlier and didn\u0027t comment simply because you blew my mind by your little project."},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T06:57:55Z","Content":"Well... welding is a non-starter unfortunately. Attempting to weld B9\u0027s structural parts causes *all* the panel types to exist simultaneously in the welded result. I imagine this will be true of any part with a \u0022part variant\u0022 feature. After tonight\u0027s tests, I\u0027m starting to think maybe the entire project is a futile endeavor as well.\n\n![lGGdlbo.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/lGGdlbo.jpg)\n\nI have constructed a box!\n\nThis sorry structure is intended to test water-landing ability. It houses a 4-pack of HX HPDs with the generator, tanks, and power to supply it for a short hop to the end of KSC\u0027s runway, and into the drink.\n\n![otwGrjr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/otwGrjr.jpg)\n\n![ndXhNjg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ndXhNjg.jpg)\n\nWhere it promptly sinks.\n\nIt landed at around 20m/s - not feather-delicate, but about as gentle as I can expect for something twenty times its size. Notably, none of the components except a battery survived immersion. And of course, let\u0027s not forget the sinking. That\u0027s kind of a problem too. (I really expected these structural bits to have buoyancy).\n\nLet\u0027s try again.\n\n![j4ksI3r.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/j4ksI3r.jpg)\n\nThis time I\u0027ve given it some extra panels, thinking maybe they\u0027d help it stay afloat.\n\nI engage the engines, briefly, testing the \u0022Plasma\u0022 hybrid thrust capacity - barely a quarter of the closed-cycle mode, but still enough to lift the cube.\n\n![m3IuSRP.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/m3IuSRP.jpg)\n\nIt then obliterated the landing strip. Apparently even bumping KSC\u0027s runway with this kind of mass causes total destruction. Also, the flat panels on the bottom got stuck in the debris.\n\n//Reload from Launch\n\nThe HPDs get us to the end of the runway on Plasma, but drain the battery much too fast - and more annoying, it\u0027s near impossible to hit that sweet spot between \u0022slowing down\u0022 and \u0022going up,\u0022 which results in wasted fuel, power, and time bobbing up and down somewhere around 1600 meters. Finally I just kill power and let it fall a ways, using closed-cycle mode to brake the descent.\n\nLight as a feather, my hapless Test Cube touches down.\n\n![Aibyu5z.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Aibyu5z.jpg)\n\nAnd still destroys everything but the panels, then sinks.\n\nEven for KSC, this level of failure is becoming discouraging."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T17:36:18Z","Content":"Don\u0027t give up!

I don\u0027t like that it obliterates the runway every time, but if that\u0027s *all* it does (and the craft stays intact) I can live with it, given that I plan on having it built on Minmus.\n\nRight now, I think what I\u0027ll do is look up some craft files for stock ships / naval craft (and even aircraft carriers, where I can find \u0027em) and try to sort out what works, what doesn\u0027t, and most importantly *why*.

Hi ho, off the end of the runway we go...\n\n![h88urjN.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/h88urjN.jpg)\n\n![bgkb10M.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bgkb10M.jpg)\n\n![KMW0jCm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/KMW0jCm.jpg)\n\nThe wing has an impact rating of 15m/s, which is significantly less than I\u0027d like, but the same as the HX parts - ergo, if the wing can survive, everything else hitting the water above it should as well.\n\nHowever, the radial decoupler is only rated at 9m/s. Oops.\n\n![qtIVj2I.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qtIVj2I.jpg)\n\n![O4LH6rZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O4LH6rZ.jpg)\n\nWell, ejection force doesn\u0027t really matter anyway. The wing goes skipping away into the waves.\n\nAnd slowly floats off.\n\n![ovyESXB.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ovyESXB.jpg)\n\nKeyword: floats! Buoyancy, score! /victory dance\n\nSo as a structural / hull element, at least they\u0027re viable. They can be welded. And they\u0027re versatile too - so many shapes means I can be a bit more elaborate with the outer hull.\n\nOf course, they also have aerodynamic / lift properties, so Ker knows what that\u0027ll do to Laythe reentry profiles. I may be begging for trouble on that point. But it\u0027s not like I haven\u0027t courting disaster from day 1 already.\n\nSpeaking of welding, this calls for further testing. Let\u0027s make an actual boat.\n\n* * *\n\nI stuck one of the little RCS balls on it as well - while welding the RCS *thruster* to it is a bad idea, the tank is safe enough. I want a little propulsion while in the water, if only to get the craft away from my carpenter ant. In fact, I think that\u0027s what I\u0027ll name the drone!\n\n![yL7Ptck.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yL7Ptck.jpg)\n\n... and my boat can withstand 40m/s impact? With just those few pieces? At this rate, I could have a hull survive orbital drop and not even need the HPDs for slowing descent, the thing would survive terminal velocity. But we\u0027re getting ahead of ourselves - let\u0027s see how a welded boat handles itself.\n\n![CYCJ2iz.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CYCJ2iz.jpg)\n\nIt\u0027s like a silly hat. I didn\u0027t think leaving it in front was a great idea, even if I could just shove it down the runway skidding on its bottom.\n\nSurprisingly, the aerodynamics have no effect while driving along. There\u0027s a reason for this, but for now I\u0027ll just be glad my rover isn\u0027t trying to fly away.\n\n![qxyai4H.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qxyai4H.jpg)\n\n![fYaf8Tj.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fYaf8Tj.jpg)\n\nQuicksave at the end of the runway. It\u0027s a little top-heavy and I don\u0027t want to flub this...\n\n![okvhwQV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/okvhwQV.jpg)\n\nOH COME ON!\n\n//reload\n\n![4oKYLbd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/4oKYLbd.jpg)\n\nThere we go.

Even the decoupler survives this time.\n\n![1cGCM0X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/1cGCM0X.jpg)\n\nAaaaand, there\u0027s our fail for the night. I knew things were going too smoothly.\n\nSo, did you note that small wing-piece in the center? That was what I used for the root part.\n\nAs I came to realize, the default orientation plays a key role in welding - technically I\u0027ve had the boat \u0022on its side\u0022 this whole time.\n\nAnd since that \u0022boat\u0022 is also considered an aerodynamic lifting surface, the lifting part was *also* on its side. Doing absolutely nothing.\n\nMeh. I\u0027m in the water anyway, may go for a little cruise. RCS away!\n\n![Ui62joI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ui62joI.jpg)\n\n\\*makes motorboat noises\\*\n\nOverall, I\u0027d call this a success, but it does present an interesting choice. If I construct the hull such that the wings are considered \u0022vertical\u0022 by the game, I can nullify any aerodynamic influence they have and let the HPDs do their work as intended. However, that presents the risk that the entire carrier will want to roll over sideways when it lands. Laying the root horizontal brings aeronautics into consideration, but leaves the Kraken far less likely to capsize when it touches down.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwlCzYzjYls?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n I suppose."},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tegu","CreatedById":76643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T08:35:32Z","Content":"You might be able to change the root part with the root tool, dunno if the welding will mess that up too though."},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T08:41:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E You might be able to change the root part with the root tool, dunno if the welding will mess that up too though.\n\nOh, I know about changing the root with the gizmo, but \u0022welded\u0022 bits are all one, single part.

You see, my attempt had been to weld the entire deck into one solid piece - the deck being composed of five 8m-square panels at 400% scale. And the result was that all the panels *welded to the root panel* flickered from being several different versions of themselves simultaneously. The root panel however, remained in its initial state.\n\nIt\u0027s a fine point, and I\u0027m not surprised to have overlooked it at first, but what it actually means is this: *as long as the root of the weld is the B9 panel, it will retain its variant as a welded piece.* Which means I *should* be able to staple fuel tanks, structural fuselage tubes, wing parts, and anything else with buoyancy to the panel, create the weld, and have a sort of compound sandwich-hull part I can use to assemble a full and proper hull for the carrier.\n\nOnly theory at the moment - I shall test it when I have the opportunity, along with some other plans.\n\nTest 1\n\n-Weld a \u0022sandwich\u0022 hull piece and confirm root B9 panel remains in static state. Flickering is bad.\n\nTest 2\n\n-Confirm buoyancy of welded piece. Note orientation, and material stats like impact and heat tolerance.\n\nTest 3\n\n-Will \u0022static-welded\u0022 B9 panels remain static if re-welded? If the panels are \u0022locked in\u0022 by welding, a single solid hull may be possible after all. Unlikely, but worth trying. The resulting impact / heat tolerances would likely be off the charts as well. Perhaps for my next trick, a flight into Kerbol!\n\nTest 4\n\n-Weld a \u0022shielded\u0022 HPD engine. This is an HX-HPD with the exhaust port protected by a B9 panel set as a frame (see earlier Cube experiment). The Kraken is no good to me if only the frame (/hull) survives the landing, and I\u0027ve already ruled out parachutes due to the scale and weight of the thing. (Note: not saying it *can\u0027t* be done, just that it\u0027d be hilariously inefficient to do.)\n\nTest #4 is particularly important to me, in the sense that if successful, it should also raise the engine\u0027s impact tolerance and make it less likely to disintegrate on splashdown. Trying to land a normal VTOL aircraft is tricky enough, trying to land an unbalanced super-carrier is just begging for trouble.\n\nBut then, I\u0027ve been tempting fate since the beginning, so why stop now?

Went skipping across the water like a flat stone, from the decoupler ejection force.\n\nSo let\u0027s try scaling things up a bit.\n\n![zxL9UF7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zxL9UF7.jpg)\n\n![hxbrdeD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/hxbrdeD.jpg)\n\n7m is the biggest TweakScale will go, but that\u0027s plenty big enough for anything I\u0027d use these for.\n\nRegular 1.25m size floats just fine, let\u0027s see how 7m works.\n\n![htTuvPc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/htTuvPc.jpg)\n\n![FDPPisV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FDPPisV.jpg)\n\n![nljAj5U.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nljAj5U.jpg)\n\nWell it\u0027s *technically* floating, but I had to clip below the waves to see it properly.\n\nThe standard-sized piece had no issue sitting nicely on top, so maybe my problem isn\u0027t with welding B9 plates, but with TweakScale - I\u0027m beginning to suspect buoyancy does not scale up with the weight / size.\n\nBut making assumptions is rarely a good idea and many of my theories have failed already, so let\u0027s run another test.\n\n![zxaSgrX.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zxaSgrX.jpg)\n\nI probably could\u0027ve used the Carpenter for this, but Goliath is actually slightly faster and can get further into the water thanks to the big tires.\n\n![NoVlgm7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NoVlgm7.jpg)\n\n![TwdRwvS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TwdRwvS.jpg)\n\nOh yeah. Scaling *definitely* plays a part in this damned buoyancy puzzle - the 9-piece weld bounces off the top of the water for a bit before settling down.\n\nSo while previous experiments concluded that B9 panels have zero flotation ability, perhaps there\u0027s still the possibility of adding buoyancy after all. For now though, I want to try a different test.\n\n* * *\n\n![WJdtVkh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/WJdtVkh.jpg)\n\nThe HPD and frame-panel, welded together. A small fuel tank, battery, SAS ring, and a box-probe sit on top, for control and fuel purposes.\n\nWelding the HPD did some funny things to it, most notably with the engine modes. For those who haven\u0027t used HPDs, they\u0027re like a RAPIER engine, but with ion dual-mode instead of intake air.\n\nPrimary (closed cycle) mode has more thrust, but chugs LFO like a frat boy at a keg party. Secondary mode uses substantially less fuel, but sucks down electrical power instead.\n\n![ivjKscZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ivjKscZ.jpg)\n\nThe welded part however? It\u0027s locked into \u0022primary\u0022 mode, which eats only Oxidizer and Electrical, leaving liquid fuel untouched. Strange.\n\nGood thrust though.\n\n![BuV6gdc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/BuV6gdc.jpg)\n\nWelding the panel to the bottom however, turns out to be a terrible idea. Firing up the engine destroys the panel - and, engine being rooted to it, the engine as well.\n\nKaboom.\n\nSo let\u0027s try reinforcing it a bit differently.\n\n![yzcM8um.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yzcM8um.jpg)\n\nGirders and grey panels ring the top, well out of the exhaust path. It\u0027s hardly a perfect solution, but it\u0027s made the engine nigh-indestructible, which is definitely a perk.\n\n![TFXSGqD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TFXSGqD.jpg)\n\nTest-firing the engine reveals another funny glitch - no exhaust plume / effect at all. Invisible thrust!\n\nThis is also when I realized the part about eating Oxidizer and battery only - and it gulps oxidizer like crazy, so that\u0027s not really an acceptable trade-off.\n\nLooks like welding the engines in any way is a no-go. While I love how sturdy it made them, I\u0027d prefer not to sacrifice basic functionality, and having the fuel-efficient Plasma mode available for interplanetary burn is a must."},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T12:26:43Z","Content":"Just noting that, while I haven\u0027t given up on this endeavor at all, I\u0027m done postponing my entire .90 career restart for the sake of one sandbox project.

When I originally welded them, they were end-to-end, but the welding did something wonky to their alignment and so they\u0027re side-by-side now. I\u0027m thinking this is a sign I should probably do welding in the VAB instead, apparently SPH alignments confuse it.\n\nOh well, let\u0027s get it out to the runway and take it for a swim.\n\n![Y7UebZv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Y7UebZv.jpg)\n\nBonus points if you spot the problem already, because I sure didn\u0027t.\n\n![8kIpdiM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8kIpdiM.jpg)\n\n![8kIpdiM.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8kIpdiM.jpg)\n\nSo we cruise on down to the end of the runway, quicksave, and prepare to head into the water. The deck becomes stuck on the end of the runway once the ground tips down, and refuses to go any further.\n\nI scoot the camera down under the thing to decouple some wheels, hoping to lower its center a bit for traction, and...\n\n![gs4d0oV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gs4d0oV.jpg)\n\nOh. That would explain it.\n\nI drove down the runway on PhysWarp 4, and assumed it must\u0027ve happened some point along the way.\n\n//Reload from launch\n\n![CFNHgUJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/CFNHgUJ.jpg)\n\nGreat. My center panel shrunk. And... the wheels are broken already? What the hell?\n\nSo I reload back to the hangar, thinking maybe more wheels will help. Now each panel has a rover strut across the middle as well as endpoints.\n\nThis actually goes worse - twice as many wheels break on physics launch (and this is with Ferram4\u0027s \u0022Joint Reinforcement\u0022 mod as well, which includes an \u0027easing\u0027 of physics load!)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Physics Easing\n\u003E  Slowly dials up external forces (gravity, centrifugal, coriolis) when on the surface of a planet, reducing the initial stress during loading\n\u003E \n\u003E  All parts and joints are strengthened heavily during physics loading (coming off of rails) to prevent Kraken attacks on ships\n\nApparently the Kraken *really* has it in for my Kraken.

Still no.\n\nWhile they *do* prevent the wheels from breaking instantly, two of the legs break on Physics start and refuse to retract. To compound that, once you pull the legs in, the wheels hit the ground... and break.\n\nClearly we need something with a higher tolerance for abuse. But what...? We still need motor function to get it down to the bay, and I am *not* trying to fly this brick yet.\n\nSolution?

And clearly the crawler was keeping it afloat so at least we know for a fact that they *will* stay buoyant under some circumstance!\n\nLet\u0027s add another row and try again.\n\n![E7jju6C.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/E7jju6C.jpg)\n\nVersion 2 runs into some trouble getting down the runway. While I enabled steering on the wheels, they *all* steer in the same direction, so it just kinda slides left or right and doesn\u0027t shift direction at all.\n\nBack to the hangar to fix that.\n\n![PXCbgBT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/PXCbgBT.jpg)\n\nHonestly, I could\u0027ve adjusted them from the runway, but for one stupid problem - the scaled-up I-beams interfered with clicking the wheels, so I couldn\u0027t actually get at them to change it.\n\nBesides, deleting the forward half of the crawler frame and cloning fixed wheels proved faster anyway.\n\n![Cgi1fTC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Cgi1fTC.jpg)\n\nI made the mistake of using \u0022revert to hangar\u0022 rather than \u0022recover\u0022 so it was night once again.
