I\u0027ve continued to find B9 HX parts unreliable/unstable, even based on a reasonably solid framework. No pictures were taken of the subsequent explosions - they all start to look the same after a while. The flat structural plates have proven quite sturdy however, so I\u0027m beginning to think my best course of action is to make use of the nodes on those (or flat attachment, where possible). Sets of downward-facing engines are a must under any circumstance - the Laythe landing will require some form of vertical thrust to set down smoothly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStructural plates have always been part of the plan, due to their high impact tolerance (80m/s), but I\u0027m thinking I may give the welding mod a try and fashion a solid hull to build on. Reduced part count is a perk, although not a huge issue right now. However, this means at least roughly determining the center of mass (for engine thrust) first, since part of that plan was to incorporate the \u0022frame\u0022-type plates as impact guards for the HX engines (at 187.5% scale, the 8m 4-way frames match up quite well with a 4-pack of HX engines). Transform gizmo can be used to fine-tune positioning as needed, but building a solid hull and welding it together, \u003Cem\u003Ethen finding engine frames are misaligned\u003C/em\u003E is just not something I want to go through, and I can absolutely see myself doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a related topic, I went hunting for previous topics / pics of Laythe aircraft carriers and was surprised by how little I turned up. The carriers I saw were all stock-ish builds for Kerbin, using either the grey plates or structural wings.

That was what I used for the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I came to realize, the default orientation plays a key role in welding - technically I\u0027ve had the boat \u0022on its side\u0022 this whole time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since that \u0022boat\u0022 is also considered an aerodynamic lifting surface, the lifting part was \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C/em\u003E on its side.

If I construct the hull such that the wings are considered \u0022vertical\u0022 by the game, I can nullify any aerodynamic influence they have and let the HPDs do their work as intended. However, that presents the risk that the entire carrier will want to roll over sideways when it lands. Laying the root horizontal brings aeronautics into consideration, but leaves the Kraken far less likely to capsize when it touches down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwlCzYzjYls?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E I suppose.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Tegu","CreatedById":76643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T08:35:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might be able to change the root part with the root tool, dunno if the welding will mess that up too though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kieve","CreatedById":98713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T08:41:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mr Tegu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mr Tegu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou might be able to change the root part with the root tool, dunno if the welding will mess that up too though.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, I know about changing the root with the gizmo, but \u0022welded\u0022 bits are all one, single part.
