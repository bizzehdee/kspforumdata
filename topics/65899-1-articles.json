The kerbonaut would after decelerating to subsonic speeds disembark and open a personal parachute from the Vanguard plugin or have the seat attached to a parachute that is detached later; or for sea landings maybe have the heat shield have parachutes so that it will function as a boat until rescue arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo more kerbonauts entering the atmosphere just in their EVA suits!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically; you deorbit; then you orient for reentry; then you enter the atmosphere and relax while watching the flames; when you are under 300 meters per second the kerbonaut jumps off and lands using a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts on this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T19:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I have seen people doing this using KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I haven\u0027t looked at the Vanguard plugin in a while.

Anyways; electricity is not needed anymore as soon as you orient correctly for reentry (unless there are control problems and ASAS is needed). Also, you might attach control surfaces to the edge of the heat shield so that it follows your orders with less resistance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hjrrockies","CreatedById":106027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T22:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EODSK: Orbital Drop Shock Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T01:37:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m entertaining the idea making something like a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.astronautix.com/craft/moose.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMOOSE\u003C/a\u003E mod, so we\u0027ll see if someone beats me to it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cheeseit","CreatedById":71142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T08:15:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve played around with it a few times.
