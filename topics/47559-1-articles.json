On the ground it has a full set of rugged rover wheels and can go for a fair distance before needing to recharge its on-board batteries. In space it has a docking port and effective RCS with a small supply of monoprop; the Aerospike engine gives it fair delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPropulsion is via a single Aerospike rocket and two Turbojet engines. Start the jets (staging or hotkey 1 for subsequent launches) and ascend with a steady ~45 degree climb to 15,000 metres, then slowly taper down to level flight, reducing the throttle slowly as air intake drops below 0.20; ceiling is roughly 30,000 metres doing about 1400-1500 ms-1 depending on fuel load and whether there\u0027s an \u0027R\u0027 in the month. On reaching the ceiling, switch to the rocket engine (staging or hotkey 2), whack the throttle to full and point at ~30 degrees; get your desired orbit height plus a little for air resistance, throttle down then circularise.
