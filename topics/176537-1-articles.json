It can however, in addition to its two flight crew carry personnel to and from orbital installations in its crew can. Its initial ascent is powered by two WarpJet engines, which do not require expendable fuel, but instead heat intake air to plasma, which is then expelled out of the back of the engines. The power required for this comes from a SINR nuclear reactor. Once at near orbital velocity, the plane switches from the WarpJets to a SupraLox aerospike, which augments the traditional aerospike by \u0022injecting electric charge\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unknown.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022713\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/409435221977595924/462603643045150733/unknown.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Daedalus Medium Shuttle\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Daedalus class medium shuttle extends on the proven technology of the Scimitar class. It is powered again by a SINR nuclear reactor. Atmospheric propulsion is provided by WarpJets, orbital propulsion by a pair of SupraLOX aerospikes. Instead of a crew can, this plan has a roomy cargobay, in which a couple of tons can be carried to orbit.
