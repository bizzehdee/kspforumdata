They just generate a force while in the atmosphere, a bit like RCS generates a force to push your craft around.. This generates the infiniglide bug and this also means that those pesky control surfaces don\u0027t actually always turn in the way you would expect to make your plane turn for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo matter their orientation, no matter which way they are pointing, the control surfaces will make you turn in the way you\u0027re asking them to turn according to the direction you\u0027re going and where you\u0027re controlling from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour problem here is that controls in the game are relative to the CoM. Those wings are probably in front of the CoM, so the game inverts in which direction the control surfaces are pointing, but it still orders them to generate an upward force. It\u0027s weird I know, but that\u0027s what we get for adding plane physics to a game based off rocket physics. When we get proper aerodynamics, this will get fixed for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flowz0r","CreatedById":9387,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T07:47:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely working as intended. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t quite recall if the game considers center of lift or mass for this, but control surfaces get inverted if they\u0027re behind either one of those.
