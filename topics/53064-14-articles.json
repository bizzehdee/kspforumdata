Although i see no reason why both couldnt be included, but i would hate to see interstellar go from the mod package, the only issure i could see is a conflict/confusion having the many types reactors/radiators. If we need to pick one to be used in the tech tree my vote goes to interstellar for its much deeper inclusion of real technologies (but currently unattainable at \u0022real lifes\u0022 current energy generation capabilities) and more realistic thoughts on heat buildup/dissipation. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also adds a more realistic science equip to be used \u0026amp; a \u0022real way\u0022 of gaining science from long term study facilities using the science lab/computer cores, not just flying by the moon and taking a gravity and temp reading suddenly being \u0022done\u0022 with studying it, its science lab allows for more cool \u0022sky lab/mir\u0022 stations that really \u0022do something\u0022 that can be extended out to venus, mars or even pluto as you continue to advance (if you can get the lab there and keep crews alive or have it run on pure AI), it would really work better with MCE also for setting up skylab like mission goals with a \u0022put a science lab at such \u0026amp; such orbit hight, have it maintain a positive power charge and be crewed by 2 kerbals (via MCE\u0027s crew # report) continuously for XX years (via MCE\u0027s \u0022timer\u0022) or until it generates XX amount of science, with atleast 1 crew rotation and/or resupply mission (via MCE\u0027s \u0022docked\u0022 indicator)\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if the aim is at realism: interstellar, IMHO, is slightly better just due to the number of things it would allow midevalnerd to do with MCE/custom missions\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@ midevalnerd: \u003C/strong\u003E: do you suggest i remove \u0022all\u0022 the non-size adapting normal \u0022non-stretchy\u0022 fuel tanks (including xenon/mono tanks) to save on load time, memory use and \u0022parts clutter\u0022. I was also wondering if there is a stretchy version of the jet fuselages like the mk2/mk3 jet \u0022body\u0022 fuselages as currently the stretchy tanks force me to use \u0022cylinder\u0022 body jets or stock mk2/mk3 \u0022body\u0022 tanks. As my tech levels go up it has left me wondering \u0022how am i going to glide land a huge rounded shuttle?\u0022 as the mk2/mk3 \u0022bodies\u0022 seem to have higher impact tolerance for landing and slightly better shapes for placing landing gear bays. (yikes as i post this i\u0027m now thinking...how will my shuttle body/landing gear bays survive DRE heat effects lol, mk2/mk3 jet \u0022bodies\u0022 \u0026amp; landing gear bays should have a small \u0022ablative shielding\u0022 rating for shuttle use if they dont already other wise there will be now real way to return them to the surface making them kinda pointless). This has come to mind as i start trying to design rockets/shuttles that MCE reports all dropped stages as \u0022recovered\u0022, as i feel once MCE is in this will become a must to make proper use of our allotted budgets, why \u0022throw away\u0022 a stage you paid for when you can recover 66% to 75% its parts value by timing its drop hight/speed \u0026amp; adding X number of parachutes to it?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-04T08:23:36Z\u0022 title=\u002212/04/2013 08:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funfight22","CreatedById":22861,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T12:30:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat I meant was that all the stock science experiments would give overall a higher output, and be done without diminishing returns three times.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BelgarionNL","CreatedById":95432,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T12:53:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enice mod! tried it but for my serious game it needs a bit more work!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-04T13:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf earths circumference is aprox 40,075Km and semi-synchronous orbit is aprox 20,200km, could 3x comms sats a communitron 16 each remain in contact with eachother \u0026amp; mission control (seeing as they have a range of 20,000km) constantly, if placed just under semi-synchronous orbit hight (if there were say at 19,999km circular orbits)? i am unsure how to find the distance they would be from eachother if placed 120 degrees apart.

The altitude from center of the planet is simply the altitude of the orbit \u002B the radius of the planet (6371km for earth, I think this is the same for Kearth in RSS). This would give 26,371km for your altitude from center. Also assuming that the angle between them is exactly 120 degrees (though in reality it is easier to go for longer-range antennas than to get EXACT positioning on your geosynch sat network \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec^2 = a^2 \u002B b^2 - 2ab cos\u00A9\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ec is the length you want to find - the distance between the two sats. a^2 and b^2 will be identical in this case (26,371^2=695,429,641).

However, you CAN do it with the C16 still just by using more satellites. To compensate for inaccuracies in exact separation angles, and make positioning simplest, I generally use 8 small satellites separated by roughly 45 degrees each if I\u0027m putting up a \u0022quick and dirty\u0022 comsat network using only short-range antennas. I also don\u0027t generally bother to put them all the way up to 20Mm, usually about half of that, but they would still have the range to do so if you wanted to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@MedievalNerd - Sorry for the lack of posting re: the aviation side of things I said I would work on. Lost net access shortly after my last post and just got it back today (dunno if I\u0027ve mentioned it before, but I live on a 30\u0027 sailboat - had a storm come through here which took out power on the island, and trashed the wifi connection at the marina, I just got it all fixed for them this afternoon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). Good news is that now I\u0027ve also got the new computer to use as well. I\u0027m currently in the process of doing a fresh install of KSP and the mods as listed in the first post (I\u0027ll be sticking with TAC instead of ECLSS though - I like the constant tracking of power in ECLSS, but I like the versatility and performance of TAC and the integration it has with some other mods better). Couple of things to note that I saw mentioned over the past couple of pages: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lack of the tree staying saved when using Treeedit is a problem with how it handles the F5 saving of the tech tree. It never STOPS listening for F5 input...even when you leave the tech screen. So if, for example, you use F5 to quicksave in flight, it will save all of the \u0022current nodes\u0022 to your tree.cfg file. And since you are in flight, not at the tech center, there aren\u0027t any \u0022current nodes\u0022, thus resulting in a blank tree.cfg file, thus reverting it back to stock until you reload the tree again. Hopefully this will be fixed if TreeEdit actually starts getting updates again, but in the meantime there is a work around for it: Create your new campaign save and select RPL from the TreeEdit menu as normal. Hit F5 in the tech screen to save it to the current savegame. EXIT KSP without doing anything else. Now you have a \u0022stock RPL\u0022 tree.cfg file in that campaign save folder. Copy that tree.cfg file into whatever save you want to play (or leave it where it is if this is the first save for you...). Now REMOVE TreeEdit.dll and use TreeLoader.dll instead (this does not have the editing/saving functionality, so does not have the F5 bug of course. It also keeps the tech screen cleaner without having the edit window to have to move out of the way...). Since TreeLoader will not search for a new tech tree online if a tree.cfg file already exists for that save, it will load the existing tree.cfg just fine (and can even be used offline since it doesn\u0027t need to connect to get the list of tech trees \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). This can also be used to \u0022publish\u0022 your tech tree \u0022publicly\u0022 by the way, without needing the user to have TreeEdit - it just requires the user to have TreeLoader installed, and to manually move the tree.cfg file (supplied by you, downloaded by them in the distribution package) into their savegame folder prior to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbes/Science: I assume that this was what you were talking about with the v18a issues on probes, but I\u0027ll point it out here in case it was not - your custom experiments in v18a (I\u0027ve not downloaded v18b yet since the last copy I had before losing net access was v18a) are missing TargetSituation masks for the Mun and all later experiments (they just have the target body specified). This is what causes the calibration error reading showing that the experiment is calibrated for \u0022, ,\u0022, and prevents the proper execution of the experiments. Also, the Duna and Eve experiments had the target bodies set incorrectly, but I don\u0027t remember how they were messed up right now...I already fixed them in my copy. Might want to double check those as well (or I\u0027ll check after I finish getting the new install done on the new computer \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral Aviation Tree Stuff: The suggested node separation that was made above was basically how I was planning to divide up the parts myself as well. Basic flight would be a node off of the start node which would give access to the MkI bodies and cockpit, the most basic stock wing, the small control surface, and the AV-T1 fin/winglet. I planned on using 2 stock/jet engine nodes, 3 nodes for FireSpitter and B9 special engines (props, electric engines, and the SABRE engine which could also include other mods late-tech multipurpose atmospheric engines), and only 4 aerodynamics nodes (basic lifting surfaces, which would include all fins that don\u0027t have control surfaces \u002B the basic wings; basic control surfaces, which would include all of the fins with built in control surfaces (like the Delta-Deluxe) as well as the stock large control surface and the simplest of the add-on control surfaces; advanced aerodynamic surfaces, which would include all of the remaining fins and control surfaces that are wholly moveable (like the AV-R8) as well as the various canards and the more advanced control surfaces from the add-ons, plus all remaining general wings; and the last node would include any special-purpose or advanced wing/lifting/control surfaces (like the extra-heavy lifter wing, or procedural wings, or the slotted fighter wing from Firespitter). Finally, the fuselage section would have a node chain with nodes for each successively larger \u0022size\u0022 category (each node would include the associated cockpits, cargo bays, adapters, etc. appropriate for that size - except that adapters would be placed with the LARGEST size that they could adapt to - like the MkII tail piece that has two 1.25m engine mounting points would be placed in the same node as the fuselages that are roughly 2.5m size. Alternatively, these various fuselages/adapters/etc could just be fit into your existing rocketry scheme without being part of a separate aviation tree section, but that might cause balance issues, especially for the cockpits...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: One other general suggestion that I had for the mod as a whole - It would be really helpful to have the units of measure which are displayed on various things with ranges or power and the like to be standardized. It\u0027s pretty simple math to do the conversions ourselves but picking one standard multiple and displaying the appropriate decimal values in the description would make things a lot easier when - for example - creating comm sats...rather than having to take the pod energy usage in per minute or sometimes per hour values, the panel outputs in per minute, the antennas energy usage in per second, and so on and converting them all to a single base unit to figure out how many panels I need to power 2 pods and 4 different antennas...and then converting that to sat usage per hour to determine how much battery capacity I need to carry with me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.

Alternatively, these various fuselages/adapters/etc could just be fit into your existing rocketry scheme without being part of a separate aviation tree section, but that might cause balance issues, especially for the cockpits...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, I might touch aviation in MS19, but for 20 i\u0027ll give it at least an overview with your feedback.

It\u0027s pretty simple math to do the conversions ourselves but picking one standard multiple and displaying the appropriate decimal values in the description would make things a lot easier when - for example - creating comm sats...rather than having to take the pod energy usage in per minute or sometimes per hour values, the panel outputs in per minute, the antennas energy usage in per second, and so on and converting them all to a single base unit to figure out how many panels I need to power 2 pods and 4 different antennas...and then converting that to sat usage per hour to determine how much battery capacity I need to carry with me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.

Your pitch on the first page reads like a list of my favourite mods put into RSS and with a decent tech tree and revamped, more realistic science added on (the stock science and tech tree are bizarre).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, the tech tree and science scheme is like a tutorial: at each step you provide some more parts to use and some new goals to achieve. In a good tech tree, the goals should have a logical progression, each building on the ones before, and the part unlocks should provide the parts you need for the next goals. At the moment your tech tree does that well up to orbital flight (though the first QBE with the \u0027orbital\u0027 experiment is easy to do sub-orbitally), but I think having \u0027orbit the moon\u0027 as the last tier 1 task is more than a little too hard with the current set of engines. I spent the last 5 days (maybe 20 hours) trying to get the right balance of delta-v (easy to get) and TWR (very hard to get) as the tier 1 lower stage engines all seem to have too weak thrust for a moon rocket (I just succeeded, pics below), so it is a very good thing you are adding more low-level experiments in v19 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. I also found a problem where the tooltip for the engines consistently shows a thrust that is two to three times bigger than what you get when you go to the launch pad, which didn\u0027t help things along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing that bugs me is the selection of parts in tier one seems a little off: you get 0.5m/0.625m fairings and separators (apart from the DRE ones) but engines and tanks up to something like 2.5m. It makes procedural fairings an essential mod if you want properly faired rockets. I also have version 3 of FASA installed and that has some Mercury parts that aren\u0027t in the right places in the tech tree (the capsule is in the starting node!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the science gathering idea; it is a neat mechanic that significantly improves the science aspect of the game by giving a concrete and realistic set of goals. I would like to see a difference between sub-orbital and orbital tasks (i.e. so I can\u0027t cheat and do the higher space orbital task with a sub-orbital flight), simply extending the data logging time to an hour (so long as it works with time acceleration) would do the trick. It would also be nice to have the ability to sample/take reading from that data when not in the target situation but having recorded data while in that situation (i.e. I want to be able to record the low moon orbit data while out of comms range, then transmit the sample when back in comms range but no longer in low orbit. At the moment I think it tries to take a high orbit reading).
