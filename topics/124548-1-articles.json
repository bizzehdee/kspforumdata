They are more like managers at the big-picture level that direct teams of engineers underneath them to do the design work. In my experience, they typically have advanced degrees in a technical field (usually some sort of engineering), often PhDs, and this is a position you have to work up to over the span of your career. I also find that in the aerospace industry at least, they frequently were officers in the military - the leadership experience they gain in the service helps.
