When a part is inside a cargo bay, it\u0027s considered dragless.\n\nIf so, what \u0027MODULE\u0027 or other .cfg key determines this?\n\nI\u0027ve looked over the stock cargo bay .cfg files and nothing seems to stand out. \n\nHere\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to accomplish:\n\nWhen a part with mass is on the water and below the water line, it creates huge drag dependent upon it\u0027s mass. If it\u0027s above the water line, it\u0027s drag is atmospheric, which is much less. I\u0027m attempting to put a part inside another part (a ballast) and make it water dragless. Is this even possible?\n\nThanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Gristle","CreatedById":60589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T15:48:54Z","Content":"I believe the aero drag reduction of parts inside cargo bays/fairings is determined by the parts drag cube definition.

I read the dev blog on the \u0027sphere\u0027 that is created by the partmodule. Do you or anyone else know of a list of the key = value pairs that can be used in that partmodule. Since mine won\u0027t be animated I\u0027m not seeing much that I need to do other than specify that it is a cargobay."}]}
