Currently, the only multimonitor setups I\u0027ve seen are either a single view spanning multiple screens (nice, but not overly useful) or use external applications or another instance of KSP to make multiple views possible, which is a bit clunky. In a perfect world, we\u0027d be able to have multiple views simultaneously (e.g. normal view, IVA, and map mode on three different screens). Not sure if that\u0027s possible with the current game engine, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENations are something I\u0027m not interested it. I \u003Cem\u003Elike\u003C/em\u003E that KSP is not a game of competition, that the only obstacles are physics and your ingenuity in working within them determines your success. I\u0027d imagine there will be some competition once multiplayer comes out, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
