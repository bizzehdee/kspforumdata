It was a Huuble-like space telescope. So I decided I would launch a new space telescope. I also thought to myself, \u0022What do I have to do to get a probe into a geostationary orbit?\u0022 I did some research online (looked at the KSP \u00A0wiki) and found out that a geostationary orbit around Kerbin would have to have a perfectly circular 2,863.33 km orbit. I spent some time launching it and getting it into the correct orbit, and it worked! I put this on the forums just in case someone is wondering the same thing about a geostationary orbit.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a picture of the space telescope:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rd6ZI94.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rd6ZI94.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T20:02:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCongrats m8 with your geo-stationary orb8.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-30T22:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved over to Mission Reports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Readerty2007","CreatedById":166837,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-31T00:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmartly done!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should probably boost one of these things and go into timewarp just to watch how it moves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Raging Sandwich","CreatedById":164377,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-31T02:45:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222697954\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022144898\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221469923683\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166837\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Readerty2007\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Readerty2007 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSmartly done!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should probably boost one of these things and go into timewarp just to watch how it moves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI didn\u0027t really do a lot of timing work with this, so it always stays over that desert area.
