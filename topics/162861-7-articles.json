Hurriedly, she jotted down some notes for the article before looking back up at the fight. She saw a fighter dive down to intercept something, and cleared when it leveled out. Ball of smoke and flame.. Gotta add that. She cheered as the 4 other planes formed up on the diving plane, watching them fly off into the night sky.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell that was fun,\u201D She aid to no one, brushing off her legs and taking the notepad inside.

Just as she was about to check her computer, 4 F-22 Raptors blazed overhead, making everything in the house rattle a bit as they blasted by at 0.9 mach speed. She recognized the insignia on one of the cockpits as Val\u2019s. \u003Cem\u003ETark was with them\u2026\u003C/em\u003E She was about to do a face chat, but then remembered that if that was the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E squad, then they wouldn\u2019t get back for 3 or 4 hours.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0She sat down on the couch, and waited..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nTime: 12:30am; Technically the next day\u003Cbr\u003E\nLocation: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Val was still sniffling as she went upstairs to Tarkin\u2019s room. This was the worst thing about the job of Squad Leader. The pay was great, but the responsibility\u2026 of this\u2026 With a sudden realization, it hit Val. This is the first time I\u2019ve had to do this. She\u2019d almost done it when Jeb was shot down in the First Great War. But she\u2019d never done it fully before. Wiping a few tears out of her eyes, she walked in and took in everything at once.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0On the walls, there were posters of famous musical artists, River FC (A famous sports team in River City over in Kruola\u2019s Celrepan state), and numerous pictures of him and Christina. Over on his desk, there was a laptop with its screensaver running quietly; clouds billowing past as if he was flying in a plane. Next to his bed was a guitar, with a stack of papers laying disorganized all over the quilt.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201COkay. Get the personal items, get out. That\u2019s it.\u201D Val exhaled and waved her arms in a circle, her heart rate speeding up. As the was about to grab the guitar, the laptop began freaking out. Val went over, and waved her finger around on the trackpad. The screen came to life, and she was temporarily blinded by a blue screen of an incoming Kype call. She read the caller name and\u2026 \u003Cem\u003EOh no\u2026.. No. I can\u2019t do this.. \u003C/em\u003EChristina\u2019s name and picture was right in the center of the screen. \u003Cem\u003EShe\u2019s got to know!\u003C/em\u003E She argued with herself. Nervously, she tapped the \u201CAccept\u201D button. A couple seconds later (which had felt like an eternity), Christina\u2019s face came through the screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CTar- Oh\u2026. Val? Uh.. Hi, I guess. What..?\u201D Christina cocked her head in confusion. \u201CHey C.. Uh.. Listen.. I\u2019ve got some.. news.\u201D Val wrung her hands nervously. \u201CDid you see that explosion?!\u201D Christina asked. \u201CThat was massive!

I\u2019m sorry.\u201D Christina sat there, stunned. \u201CWhat\u2026 What do you mean, \u2018\u003Cem\u003EHe didn\u2019t make it\u003C/em\u003E?\u2019\u201D She asked. \u201CEAARS alerted us a rogue bomber was going to hit Bahmuto. Me, Jim, Thompberry, Triop, and Tarkin all volunteered. We.. We shot the bomber down, and\u2026. Jim caught the bomb. He was going to sacrifice himself to save us, but..\u201D Val sighed and looked up to keep the tears from falling down her face. \u201CTarkin took it from him. He sacrificed himself to save everyone. He\u2019s a hero.\u201D Christina remained silent. Her face went from stunned, to devastated.. And then, quicker than Val could blink her eyes, she snapped; her expression furious.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYou\u2026. You promised.\u201D She kept her voice calm, though it was shaky with a barely-controlled rage in it. \u201CYou. You said you would keep him safe!\u201D She clenched her fist, and slammed it on the table, shaking the cup that was on it and making the screen go blurry for a moment as the camera tried to re-orientate itself. \u003Cem\u003EUh oh..\u003C/em\u003E Val prepared for the outburst.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYOU PROMISED ME YOU\u2019D KEEP HIM SAFE!

Val felt a wave of emotion, and tried to calm her down. \u201CThere wasn\u2019t anything I could do!\u201D Val protested, but Christina was hearing none of it. \u201C\u003Cem\u003ELIAR! FILTHY, STINKING, \u003Cstrong\u003ELIAR\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E!!!\u201D Christina slammed the computer shut, and severed the connection.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Val sat in the chair for a moment, shocked.

By the end of it, it looked like her apartment had been hit by a drone strike. Anger and adrenaline gone, she fell to the ground and cried. Then, she thought something. \u003Cem\u003EIf he\u2019s gone.. I\u2019m gone too.\u003C/em\u003E She hurriedly finished the article she was writing before, and then made a new document. Then, she quickly typed up another note, and printed both of them off.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Setting the two papers down and putting them under her computer, she went out onto the balcony. The night was clear; the nuclear blast had already dissipated, and by now, the city was back to its bustling self. Taxis honked in the traffic below, supercars revved their engines to grab attention (Not that they need it of course), and a couple pedestrians were either going to work on the night shift, or checking the shops for any last-minute deals. Christina leaned on the railing, and savored the cool air 35 stories above the ground.

Thunder rumbled a bit in the distance, which basically summed up what everyone was feeling.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0After everyone had arrived, the entire occasion was somber at best. Off to the right was Tarkin\u2019s family, while Christina\u2019s was just behind them. A few whispered, but most just sat in the chairs, dabbing their eyes occasionally. A couple of musicians sat off to the side, and finally a pastor came up. He said a few words, and then invited everyone a chance to speak if they who wanted to. Val was the first to go up. As soon as she walked up, she saw a picture of Tarkin and Christina, together on a beach boardwalk. \u003Cem\u003EOh why did I do this..\u003C/em\u003E She mentally pushed down the fear, and went on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CTarkin.. Tark was one heck of a kid. He never shied away from the dangers.. Always volunteering when no-one else would; even if he had just come off a mission or a 5 hour sim session. But as a kerbal.. he was 10 times better. Kind.. Sweet.. He was what all of us strived to be, and more. And the same goes for Christina. Even though I didn\u2019t get as much of a chance to get to know her, every moment was a special one. Caring.. Wonderful.. She was the best pilot I\u2019ve ever had the privilege of training, and watching her rise up. The world lost two great kerbals, and two even greater friends. I know I\u2019m going to remember them for a long time.\u201D Val stepped down, and sat down, trying to keep her emotions from exploding out. Jim walked up to the podium next.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CTarkin was one of a kind. He was selfless, caring, and a great friend; and one hell of a pilot to boot. Even when the going got tough as nails, he got tougher than all of us ever could. He was one of my biggest fans.. Amazing kid. He\u2019s a hero. He sacrificed himself for me\u2026 And that\u2019s a debt I\u2019ll never be able to repay.\u201D Jim looked down at the photo. \u201CSo long, buddy.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Everyone started speaking, and about an hour later, everyone felt thoroughly cried out. As the pastor began giving the final goodbyes, 4 kerbals skittered into the area. \u201CAre we late?\u201D Emiko asked, bending over and panting to get air. \u201CJust.. Whew! Just wanted to say.. bye..\u201D Piper added, flopping into a chair.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0After the minor interruption, and the final goodbyes said, the coffins were slowly lowered into the ground, side-by-side. As the ceremony ended, everyone went up to the head stones to place objects. Val put a fighter helmet on both stones first. Then, Jim gave a miniature guitar for Tarkin, and a flower for Christina. Piper went to Tarkin\u2019s headstones, and placed an autographed photo. Bryson and Triop both gave a small diecast of a fighter jet. And finally, as if Mother Nature could feel the mood, thunder rumbled, before rain began sprinkling down.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWe should get going..\u201D Haydi said, grabbing an umbrella. \u201CSame for us. I would ask if you guys want to come with us, but we\u2019d prefer to be meeting under.. Happier conditions.\u201D Piper shivered a bit as some wind made the rain extra-cold, and she walked over to Val. \u201CYou messed up the brakes,\u201D Piper whispered. It took a while for the statement to register with Val. \u201CWhat?\u201D She asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSome knucklehead messed with the brake wires. Every time I brake, the horn goes off.\u201D While the two tried to figure out what was happening, Angelo was off quietly laughing, bent over. Then, Piper looked at him. Her face switched from confused to absolutely furious. \u201CANGELO!!!\u201D She shrieked, running after him; forgetting the rain. Realizing the dangers associated with sticking around and chatting, he sprinted for the parking lot; skidding and sending up gravel as he sprinted around corners and almost flattening a priest.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell that was exciting,\u201D Jim commented, walking up. \u201CYeah..

You know why?\u201D Thomas again shook his head. \u201CLast week, my biggest fan in the whole world and one of my best friends saved me. He killed himself so that I could live.\u201D Jim felt his throat closing up a bit. \u201CDaang man.\u201D Thomas\u2019s eyes began to tear up a bit. \u201CBut you know how I\u2019m getting through it?\u201D Jim began inching closer.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI think of all the good that\u2019s left in this world. Now there\u2019s not that much now days mind, but I dig deep, deep down. I think of my parents. My friends. And I remember that they need me. Just like your friends and family need you.\u201D Thomas began crying, and Jim was at the point where he could put his hand on Thomas\u2019s shoulder. \u201CNow I know you might think life\u2019s not worth it. You might think that there\u2019s nothing good left for you. But if I know anything, it\u2019s that anyone who can run 9 miles without breaking a sweat has a gift.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNow, there are 2 ways this is going to end. One, You come over here with me and we talk where I\u2019m not scared. Or two, you end up jumping.\u201D Thomas\u2019s sobs continued to shake him. \u201CNow if you jump, there\u2019s a pretty good chance you\u2019ll live; it\u2019s not that far down. But there\u2019s no chance you\u2019re ever going to run again. And right now, I think ruling\u2019s all you\u2019ve got left.\u201D Thomas didn\u2019t respond, but instead continued his crying. \u201CSo let\u2019s get over on this side.\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Jim started to lift Thomas up, but that did it. Thomas, with reactions like lightning, latched his foot to the gap between the railing, and clung on. Jim kicked Thomas\u2019s foot as hard as he could, and the foot unlatched itself and the two tumbled to the ground, thankfully on the right side of the rails. Just then, a police car and an ambulance pulled up, red and blue lights illuminating the scene. The other pilots ran over to Jim, who was hugging Thomas and gently rubbing his back. \u201CThere there,\u201D Jim whispered in a soothing tone. \u201CIt\u2019s okay..

Isn\u2019t that the place where-\u201C She started, before Gene cut her off. \u201CSush. Just\u2026. No. Bad memories.\u201D Gene smiled a bit, but Val could tell he was nervous about the whole thing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGet ready.

I wouldn\u2019t have won if he wasn\u2019t so desperate to keep me from scoring.\u201D The two talked for a bit more- as did everyone else in the room- and finally Gene was ready. \u201CAlright everyone, so you all know why we\u2019re here. HQ has us escorting 10 bombers with 10,000 pounds of ordinance each to Blackheart City. We\u2019re going to need as many as we can get. Volunteers?\u201D Everyone raised their hand, including Jim. Gene counted off, but paused before getting to Jim. Then, he just skipped him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CEleven should be enough. We\u2019ll be flying the K-1\u0027s for this one; nothing too fancy. Anything that they\u2019ll put up shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Suit up. We take off in an hour.\u201D The pilots dispersed, and Jim stomped over to Gene, fuming. \u201CHow. Dare. You,\u201D He hissed. \u201CYou know I can do this. I\u2019ve got to avenge Tar-\u201C\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThat\u2019s why I dropped you. Look. You\u2019re a great pilot; everyone knows that. But your mind\u2019s got to be in this! You can\u2019t be thinking about Tark every second you\u2019re up there!\u201D The statement, which was supposed to calm Jim down, only made him angrier. \u201CMY MIND IS FINE,\u201D He spat. \u201CI can focus just as well as you, just as well as Val, just as well as Ben. I can do this!\u201D Gene looked down at his shoes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2019m sorry buddy. But I can\u2019t take that risk. If you\u2019re not up to it, you\u2019d get someone hurt or maybe even killed. I\u2019ll see you after the mission.\u201D Gene trudged out of the room, and Jim stood still, in the center of the room, alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTime: 11:00am\u003Cbr\u003E\nLocation: Deep in the heart of Klathu; About 10km away from Blackheart City\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHow far out are we?\u201D Ben asked as they flew along. \u201CLess than 20 minutes. Probably 15 or 16.\u201D The fleet of fairly well-aged fighters seemed to float through the sky, where wings just a couple away from those of much larger bombers. \u201CI think-\u201C Meg was about to say, before a spark pinged off her cockpit. \u201CGround fire?!\u201D She exclaimed diving down and performing evasive maneuvers. \u201CI think we\u2019ve been spotted,\u201D Val noted as they continued on, getting back into formation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAttention all pilots. We\u2019re preparing to begin the bombing run. Please stand clear of the bomb bay doors.\u201D The fighter pilots watched in awe as 200 bombs released from the planes, falling down at over mach speed. \u201CContacts below,\u201D Thompberry called out, and 11 fighters spun over and dove down to intercept the other planes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Val immediately caught onto the rear of one fighter. It was a 11 v 9 fight, but with the skill of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E pilots it might as well have been 111 v 9. Instantly, a missile had incinerated an enemy fighter, and one foolish enough to engage the bombers was shredded by the 3 .50 cal turrets. \u201CCome here you\u2026\u201D Val aimed the gun, and the plane dove in evasive maneuvers. \u003Cem\u003EHere we go again.. \u003C/em\u003EVal caught up, and dove down to strike it like a falcon catching prey. She fired off a brief burst from the 20mm cannons, and the right wing was shredded off in a glorious shattering of bits and pieces on the fighter. It rolled over, and slammed into the ground, sending up a massive smoke cloud and fiery explosion.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Meanwhile, Meg and Hans were teaming up on another in a fight that was now 11-6. Hans had fired off a quick burst and shattered an elevon, but Meg had done the critical damage; destroying an air intake and destroying most of the plane\u2019s speed advantages. Closing in, Meg fired off a missile to quickly end it, and it severed the cockpit from the remaining fuselage.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The rest of the fight had turned into a stalemate with the remaining 5 pilots proving an equal match to the K-1\u2019s. 15 minutes into the standoff, Gene started taking some heavy fire. \u201CI\u2019m hit!\u201D He spiraled away, assessing the damage. Just as things were looking hopeless for the team, a single plane stormed in at well over Mach speed. It descended on the lead fighter, spraying bullets and ripping off a wing. It fell to the ground in a massive, chest-rattling explosion almost a hundred meters high. Then, it blew out the second fighter with a missile; slicing it into bits, sending the enemy plane into the ground in two crumpled messes. Performing loop and dive and much more acrobatics, it ripped the remaining 3 apart; slugging them again and again without any fear.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYEEEEEEAAAAAAHHOOOOOO!!!!!\u201D Jim shouted, spiraling down to deliver the final blow. \u201CJim!\u201D Gene shouted over the radio from about a kilometer above them. \u201CI told you to stay back!\u201D The pilots formed up, and turned back home. \u201CUh.. Gene?\u201D Val asked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYou\u2019re kinda leaking fuel. Bad, actually. My windshield wipers can\u2019t hardly keep up.\u201D Val pulled away and instead climbed 5 meters above Gene\u2019s newly ventilated plane. \u201CYou\u2019re kidding me!\u201D He shouted. \u201CUgh. I\u2019m not going to make it. Actually\u2026 I can\u2019t make it at all. I\u2019ve got to ditch! Goddangit!\u201D Gene handled down and aimed for a field. \u201CWe\u2019ll send a chopper for you and the plane,\u201D Meg said as they continued on. \u201CGood luck, pal,\u201D Hans added as the planes shot away. \u201CHey bud, I\u2019m really sorry. But it just didn\u2019t feel right.. you know?\u201D Jim tried to apologize. \u201CAh it\u2019s fine. You did a great job. Now get out of here before reinforcements show up.\u201D Gene was about a hundred meters above the ground now, and preparing for landing. At 50 meters above the ground, he deployed the landing gear.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0But the plane refused to cooperate. Unbeknownst to Gene, the bullets from the enemy fighter had not only ruptured the fuel tanks, but it had also ruptured the Hydraulics Canister, which controlled landing gear, the RME system, control; everything. As soon as Gene touched the gear button, the last of the hydraulic fluid dripped out of the plane and without any of its control systems, the plane dropped to the ground. It dug into the ground; shooting up dirt and mud clods. Then, just because it was Gene\u2019s luck, the plane went straight into a barbed-wire fence. The air intakes gobbled it up, and, of course, the rear of the plane erupted into flame as the final drops of remaining fuel and fluid ignited in a massive ball of flame. Flames shot out of the RME \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports, and the engine itself. Flames trailed out of the plane, looking like a car that had blown up and sending up a fairly massive smoke cloud. Gene activated the Engine Extinguisher, and black smoke was replaced by a white cloud trailing out of the engine and RME \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports. Finally, the plane finally slid to a smokey halt. \u003Cem\u003EAnother happy landing\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0Gene thought as he popped open the canopy, and clambered out, stumbling over the lip of the cockpit. As he fell, a cow let out a loud \u201CMOO!!\u201D And bolted away through the jet-sized hole in the fence. \u201CSorry!\u201D Gene called out, but the cow was long gone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0The exterior was a mess. Almost every square inch of the fuselage\u2019s bottom half was covered in mud. The RME ports were emitting a light black smoke, as were the air intakes. As Gene looked around, the battery canister fell out with a loud crash, which made Gene jump. As he spun around, he saw a small child. She couldn\u2019t have been more than 10 or 12, and her mouth was open in shock. \u201CHi,\u201D Gene said, putting his hand up in a wave. She stood there for a second, and turned around, screaming \u201CMOOOOOOOOOMMM!!!\u201D At the top of her lungs as she ran. 10 minutes later, while Gene was getting everything checked over and shutting down the cockpit systems, the kid came back with a kerbal about Gene\u2019s age. \u201CI told you he was real!\u201D The child exclaimed, pointing at Gene. The older kerbal looked at him.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI swear to Kerbol, you again?!\u201D She sighed in an exasperated tone. Gene turned, and hit his helmet on the canopy. As he was taking off the helmet (And associated radio cables), he had a mega flashback to his days in the NSKAC so many years ago. \u201CAmanda?!\u201D He gasped. He was smiling, but her face looked like he had punched her grandma.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D She demanded. \u201CWell if I had a choice I\u2019d be up there.\u201D Gene was definitely getting a \u201CI hate your guts,\u201D vibe instead of a happy, \u201COh, come in you might be hurt,\u201D from Amanda. \u201CLook, a chopper\u2019s coming in about 45 minutes. Could I hang out in your place until it gets here?\u201D Amanda seemed to juggle the thought in her head, and finally sighed. \u201CFine. But keep your head down.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nTime: 11:45am\u003Cbr\u003E\nLocation: Outside Blackheart City, Klathu\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Gene opened the door, and skillfully avoided a flying metal pan. \u201CCapitalist dog!\u201D A kerbal shouted at him, grabbing another pan. She looked to be about Val\u2019s age.. Maybe Haydi\u2019s. She had a striking resemblance to Amanda. Except for the fact she looked madder than a hornet with serious anger management issues. Just as she warmed up for another throw, Amanda stepped in.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWould you stop that?!\u201D She shouted as she grabbed the pan. \u201CHe\u2019s.. You know.. One of \u003Cem\u003Ethem\u003C/em\u003E.\u201D The other kerbal said \u201Cthem\u201D like you would \u201CThe Kraken,\u201D or \u201CThe Plague\u201D; as if it was this horrible thing you could catch and spread.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHe\u2019s also a friend. And no daughter of mine is about to cave in my friend\u2019s head with a SuperCook Pan.\u201D Amanda set the pan down on the counter, and sighed. \u201CGene, this is Lilly, my daughter. Lilly, General Gene Kerman- head of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and crashing extraordinaire.\u201D Gene waved, and hoped Lilly wouldn\u2019t throw another Copper pan at his face. \u201CI\u2019m Daisy,\u201D The kid said in a matter-of-factly tone.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWe can\u2019t let him stay here!\u201D Lilly exclaimed, already peeking out the window. \u201CThey\u2019ll find him, and they\u2019ll find us!\u201D Amanda sighed. \u201CHe\u2019ll be gone in 30 minutes. Just-\u201C Lilly interrupted. \u201CHe\u2019s a POW! If we turn him in, we won\u2019t get arrested! I\u2019m trying to save u-\u201C Amanda snapped, \u201CJUST \u003Cem\u003ESHUT UP\u003C/em\u003E! Okay?! His ride\u2019s going to be here soon. So just\u2026 quiet. Please.\u201D Lilly huffed and stomped out of the house, muttering something about \u201CFeeding the pigs.\u201D Before she went out, her foot went up and kicked Gene in the shin, making him hobble over to a chair. With a triumphant smile, she closed the door.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSo what\u2019s the idea, wrecking our field?\u201D 2 sets of eyes stared at Gene. \u201CLong story..\u201D Gene blushed a bit. \u201CBasically, a fighter shot out most of my fuel. When I tried to land, I ran out of Hydraulic Fluid and the gear just stopped. So\u2026 yeah.\u201D Daisy\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201CYou mean that\u2019s got retractable landing gear? Awesome!\u201D Gene smiled a bit. \u201COh it\u2019s got way more than that! Have you ever heard of the \u2018M\u2019 Program? Or the K-1?\u201D\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CShe loves anything that flies, drives, floats, or basically moves. She knows more about the NSK\u2019s planes than most adults do,\u201D Amanda said with a happy smile. \u201CMy little engineer.\u201D Gene looked down at Daisy. \u201CYou want to see the plane?\u201D He asked. Daisy\u2019s face lit up like a neon sign. \u201CReally?!\u201D She asked, bouncing up and down in excitement. \u201CAh sure, why not? I mean there\u2019s not much of it left, but if you want..\u201D Amanda nodded. \u201CGo ahead. Nothing better to do around here anyways.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSo this is the main wing right here,\u201D Gene said, pointing to the fairly damaged, singed, beat-up wing. The RME ports were still slightly smoking. \u201CSo this is a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E port. Now we\u2019ve contacted a company called Quiztech, and they\u2019ve supplied us with these ports. Now usually, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports use monopropellant as fuel. However, these ports use the air. If you look up at the front..\u201D Gene walked over and put his hand on the intake attached to the cockpit, which was pretty shredded by the barbed wire. \u201CSo the air comes in here.\u201D Gene began running his hand over the side of the plane. \u201CAnd then, inside the plane, the air is channeled through different passageways. Now if we don\u2019t need the system, the air goes straight to the engine back there. But when we do need it, channels open and close, pushing the air to the ports. Then the air pushes the port down, which helps our control.\u201D Daisy nodded, and asked \u201CSo why didn\u2019t it work when you were landing?\u201D Gene took her to the middle of the plane, where the hydraulic control box was. The side was shredded, and the box was visibly showing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CSo normally, this box is full of fluid, which controls the wings, canards, elevators, the landing gear, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E system. Now in a battle a few minutes ago, this box got shot, and it leaked. By the time I had gotten to landing, I was out of fuel. The gear didn\u2019t deploy, RME stopped working; everything. Basically, without this fluid, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201D Daisy accepted the explanation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYou know, I get that everyone likes the K-1 and M-13 and everything, but I\u2019ve heard that the guns and missiles like to jam something awful during High-G turns. Also, due to the huge amount of ammo, it\u2019s super heavy; kinda similar to the A-11. And, due to the single-engine configuration, it\u2019s really easy to cripple. Meanwhile, with double-engine fighters like the F-22, or the F/A-18, the planes have a backup in case of engine failure.\u201D Gene smiled.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0As the two talked about different fighters and their pro/con list, a dull, loud thumping noise came in over the forest tree-tops. Gene looked up, and a massive CH109 helicopter burst up out of the forest like a majestic flying whale of a vehicle. The plane had 4 ginormous rotors, used almost all Mark 3 parts, and Daisy looked like she would pass out from surprise.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat is \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E thing?!\u201D She exclaimed, her hair blowing around in the downwash. \u201CThat\u2019s my ticket home,\u201D Gene smiled, watching the thing larger than the Astronaut Complex extended the gear and touched down in the field, pushing down every blade of wheat and grass in a 500 meter radius. The rotors shut down, and the cargo hold opened up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAfternoon, General,\u201D the cargo manager waved, looking at the plane. \u201CEverything alright?\u201D He looked at Amanda and Daisy, and then over to the plane. \u201CA bit dinged up, but I\u2019ve been worse. Back in the Civil War, we had to ride it out all the way. I had my fair share of head troubles. I guess it speaks to the safety of these things..\u201D They chatted some more, and a winch began pulling the plane into the massive bay. Then, without any warning at all, a frying pan flew inches over their heads.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhoah!\u201D A mechanic yelped as the pan rolled to a stop inside the bay. \u201CI swear to kerb,\u201D Amanda muttered, before shouting \u201CLILLY!!\u201D At the top of her lungs. \u201CDie Capitalists!!!\u201D She yelled, flinging pans all over. Gene dodged them all, but the manager bought one to the foot, making him limp behind cover. After Lilly was out of pans, Amanda went over. \u201CYou better now?\u201D Amanda asked in a sarcastic tone. Daisy was trying really hard not to laugh.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlright guys, let\u2019s get this going..\u201D After 10 minutes, the crumpled plane had been folded up into the bay, and the chopper was ready for departure. \u201CWell.. I guess this is it..\u201D Gene said, feeling like he had so long ago. \u201COh no.. Not this time.\u201D Amanda appeared to pull a bag out of nowhere. \u201CI\u2019m coming with you this time.\u201D Gene felt stunned, and then Daisy said \u201CYaay!!\u201D And clapped. \u201CLet me get my things.\u201D Lilly looked absolutely livid.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWe can\u2019t go with them!\u201D She protested, looking like she would give anything in the world to have an infinite supply of steel pans. Daisy had now run back, and was carrying a small duffel bag. Quick as a flash, she had zipped into the passenger compartment and was strapping in. \u201CThey\u2019re the \u003Cem\u003Eenemy\u003C/em\u003E. You know, the side that\u2019s been bombing the daylights out of our country?\u201D Amanda rolled her eyes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGet in the thing,\u201D She demanded. After much struggling, yelling, scuffling, and some major improvisation, the group had managed to Duck Tape Lilly to the seat. However, just as the final cargo checks were being made, she began shouting out Klathu propaganda. \u201CTape please?\u201D Amanda asked in a fairly peeved tone. Daisy handed her the roll, and Amanda began pulling.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYOU\u2019LL NEVER WIN!!!\u201D Lilly shouted. \u201CTHE GLORIOUS FORCES OF TW- MMMM! \u003Cem\u003EMUHHHMMM!!! \u003Cstrong\u003EMMMMMMM!!\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u201D Her voice muffled as the tape covered her mouth. The pilot walked back and made sure everyone was ready. \u201CEveryone good here?\u201D He asked after looking around to make sure there weren\u2019t any issues in the cargo bay. Lilly shook her head so hard it looked like it might come off, but when everyone said yes, the pilot went back to the cockpit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0He stopped before opening the door. Then, he heard a noise. It sounded like a soft whimper. Then, Daisy\u2019s package wiggled. She immediately covered the opening of the box with her hands, and put on her best innocent smile. The pilot shook his head, and went into the cockpit. The engines fired, and began spinning. As the blades reached maximum velocity, the building-sized machine throttled up, and began lifting up. \u201CThis is so cool!\u201D Daisy exclaimed as the craft turned towards home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\nTime: 1:00pm (1300 Hours)\u003Cbr\u003E\nLocation: About 20km south of the Klathu Border; UK\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0Gene looked down at the trees and rocks slowly passing underneath them. There was something special about flying at mach speed, but there\u2019s definitely something to be said about flying slow and steady. Kinda like driving actually. Days was holding a package tightly, trying not to let it slip open. Then, it \u003Cem\u003Ebarked\u003C/em\u003E. Gene jumped back in surprise, and Amanda looked equally shocked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHoney,\u201D Amanda said in a sweet tone. \u201CWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201D Daisy looked like she had just been caught sneaking cookies from the jar. \u201CUh\u2026 Clothes?\u201D She offered. Just then, a spot of turbulence rattled the chopper, and Daisy dropped the box. It burst open, and a small brown puppy leaped out, yipping and bouncing around. Amanda glared.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI couldn\u2019t just leave him!\u201D Daisy said, blushing a bit. Gene tried to look back out the window, but then he was bombarded by a soft, brown ball of happy, slobbery energy. 10 minutes later, the pilot came over the intercom. \u201CAlright everyone, we\u2019re going to be landing at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E shortly. Please buckle in, and prepare for touchdown.\u201D Daisy wrangled in the puppy, and Gene smiled. \u201CSo what\u2019s going to happen to us?\u201D Amanda asked as all horizontal velocity was stopped. \u201CWell isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201D Gene smirked. \u201CWelcome to the Kerbal Space Center.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
