It locks in radial. And I also have to keep it in single part mode until I make sure it\u0027s touching the underbody below(There is a space where the fuselage below is esposed) the intakes or it gets stuck in 8x mode also! If I keep it in single mode then move it to where I want I can then move it to double but only with radial. It will not allow mirror. This lets me put it so it\u0027s on both sides of the plane lined up with the wing sections angle. The problem is because it\u0027s in radial(I assume) when I go to rotate it to make it level with the middle wing, the one side levels out but the other side rotates up in the opposite direction. Is this a bug? If not will this be addressed eventually so the logic to apply beyond one layer parts fully is present in the coding? Currently it seems the game can only account for one layer of items and afterwords it\u0027s limited to virtually no addition afterwords besides the type already accounted for on the parts previously placed. This limits functionality of the editor severely!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, I can keep it in mirror mode if the symmetry is in single part. But the moment I change it to two pieces it changes to radial. and once it changes it cannot go back without deleting the part and getting a new one or duplicating a new one. This type of things happens similarly if it goes to 8x if I run it over a part that was already in 8x radial already. And I have to do more drastic things to get anything but 8x radial again. This does not seem like it is how the editor should function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on Linux Fedora x64.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: And to add more insult to injury, now when I try to slide the engine blocks around they aren\u0027t even sinked on both sides anymore.
