I\u0027ve recently started doing some 3D modeling and thought it would be really fun to model a Kerbal ship. The first time we printed it we tried it vertically. It was the first time we\u0027d tried to print anything that tall the first print fell over about half way through (lesson learned, moar legs!). Second time we printed it horizontally. Consequently, the model suffered some detail loss and isn\u0027t quite as clean of a print as it could be, but it\u0027s still nice to be holding it in my hands. It\u0027s not a perfect model, but I may get another go at printing it; at which time it could get some revisions. It was modeled in 123D Design from Autodesk (free app), in 4 parts (engine, fuel tank, decoupler, command pod/parachute), all parts were imported and snapped together, and then printed in one piece. It now lives in the office as example for visitors (and my viewing pleasure). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/rzvGG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
