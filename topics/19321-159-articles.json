Manual PCM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I deorbited, transitioned to hypersonic flight, realized I was over the ocean past the space center heading away, did about a 220 degree turn starting at mach 5.5 at 26km or so (ended up at mach 2.2 at 13km by the time I finished turning), descended and landed without any significant problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did get \u0027high dynamic pressure\u0027 warning during a fair portion of the descent to the space center, and my Multiwheels Flat-4 Monoprop engine (contained entirely within the fuselage!) broke off without damaging anything else, but it\u0027s for taxiing and I\u0027m out of monoprop anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am kinda curious as to why that of all things broke off first, (not being terribly aerodynamic probably contributed, but it shouldn\u0027t\u0027ve been taking any substantial force I wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve thought?) and may try to find a way to keep that from happening again. If anything, the deployed B9 speedbrakes should\u0027ve broken off rather than the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-28T19:17:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2014 07:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
