This works good enough, but now i\u0027m building rockets with TWR of ~1.3 to 1.7 and time to orbit decreased by at least a good minute. Of course having a lower TWR saves a little fuel by not punching your way though Kerban\u0027s atmosphere, but with that extra fuel tank I\u0027m still carrying the dry mass to space (or orbit depending on the setup). Once in orbit however a TWR doesn\u0027t really matter as much because your not counteracting any notable gravity but I\u0027m not a big fan of long burns to get more delta V.

One of the big reason for this is cost was not a factor. Back then there was no career mode and all parts prices were only place holder and for academic interest only, Reliant (or rather LV-T30, as it didn\u0027t have its nickname then) and Mainsail had the same cost.

The lower acceleration reduces aerodynamic forces so is easier on rockets with dodgy centre of pressure. But more importantly career mode is now a thing and parts prices actually matter. As with real rockets engines are expensive while fuel and fuel tanks are relatively cheap. So nowadays for career mode rockets cost per ton to orbit is much more important than payload fraction. And since engines are expensive you want to hang onto them for longer and get more bang out of the bucks you paid for them. Increase the fuel load for the first stage is a simple way to achieve this. By adding fuel to the first stage you decrease cost per ton to orbit (because your first stage is now doing more work for the same amount of engine) as well as payload fraction (because your rocket now suffers more gravity loss from low TWR first stage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor transfer stages I like to keep the TWR above 0.3g, for landing I prefer 1.5g-2.0g of local gravity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-25T12:26:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell...

For aerodynamic payloads\u00A0this\u00A0usually\u00A0means making a 1st\u00A0stage with a TWR of ~0.9 (before SRBs)\u00A0and several solid boosters on the side.

Airbreathing launch vehicles usually don\u0027t cost as much but they cost a hell of a lot more time to re-use and they\u00A0usually don\u0027t lift large or clumsy payloads. Reuseable LFO rockets are a bit harder to use (than expendables)\u00A0but with some mod support (mechjeb\u0027s landing module\u00A0or the\u00A0trajectories mod) you can get \u0026gt;96% re-useability reliably.
