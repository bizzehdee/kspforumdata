The way things are explained and done here are the way i\u0027d teach somebody.

I\u0027ll have to consider adding this to the Drawing Board. Have you thought about putting it into PDF format so people can print it out easily?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T02:06:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice idea, but needs polishing a little. Quite a few spelling mistakes in there, and the diagram at the top trying to show prograde and retrograde with the rocket might have people mistakenly believing that prograde is the direction the rocket is facing rather than the direction it is travelling. If you are going to include semi-major axis and orbit normal, perhaps you should also include semi-minor axis and anti-normal. Maybe you could include a manoeuvre node with labels on each of the handles, which would also allow you to include radial and anti-radial. Overall it\u0027s a good effort and I\u0027m sure it will help some people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshiewowa","CreatedById":74879,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T15:52:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is absolutely amazing. It could use some work, like the person above said, but other than that, this should be put somewhere where everyone can see it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
