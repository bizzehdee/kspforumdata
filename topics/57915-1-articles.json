I put a radial parachute on 5 probes that I sent in one package to Minmus, so I could land them each in a biome, then return to Kerbin with the science for full credit. The probes were so small that the parachutes pulled their COM way from the COT, and the 30kN thrust from the 48-7S was enough to send them spinning. I found that 1.5kN was about all I could accomplish. So, I thrust-limited the engine to 5 percent (5.5 actually, I couldn\u0027t get it to 5 for some reason) and then used it like a really tiny regular engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankfully this mission was to Minmus and not Mun.
