The original are stageable too - what I was talking about NOT being stageable (and not containing a decoupler at all) were the structural fairings, not the base, which I didn\u0027t see any of in your pack (though it\u0027s not that important to add a separate part for that anymore, but it\u0027d be nice to have tweakable staging included in your fairings now that it is supported \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E). I love having additional base and fairing styles, textures, etc. for PF - right now I think I have the originals, yours, the ones from KOSMOS, and a couple of old custom retextures from a source that I don\u0027t even know anymore (they all have e-dog as the part author still, but no idea where the textures came from...).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T09:43:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elol.
