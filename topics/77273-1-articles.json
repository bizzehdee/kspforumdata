Before I go EVA in space I line up my rocket upwards, towards 12 o\u0027clock. But when I click the EVA button, the camera changes and the rocket dips to some other random direction, like 9 o\u0027clock, 5 o\u0027clock or whatever. Why is it so? I\u0027m having a very hard time making just basic EVA maneuvers because of this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI follow Scott Manley\u0027s Career Mode tutorials, and he doesn\u0027t have this problem.

You don\u0027t have to be lined up with the ship to do anything, you can collect science from equipment and repack chutes and grab the ladder from any angle (build your ship with additional ladders to make it a bit easier). EVA is quite challenging but once you get the hang of it you will find yourself wishing that it had more purpose... which is where Kerbal Attachment System comes in handy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-11T18:08:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2014 06:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
