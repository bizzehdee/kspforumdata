Alas, I got stuck again! I\u0027m not sure where else to turn so I hope you guys are able to help:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m building a stock spaceship with a rotating turret. I\u0027ve gotten the turret to work quite nicely, but whenever I leave and re-enter the session on the ship with the turret, the turret goes flying as soon as I undock it from the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe axle of the turret is created by two rings of Cubic Octagonal Struts around Z-200 Rechargeable Battery banks with an FL-T100 in between to stop the axle from sliding up or down (see screenshot below). It uses an Advanced Grabbing unit to dock the turret with the ship for flight and time-warping. The grabbing unit works perfectly if I don\u0027t dock the turret to the ship when leaving a session and load straight back in. The problem with this is the turret then drifts from the ship if I timewarp in another session. Docking the two together prior to leaving the session results in the aforementioned kraken-like disintegration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to see what I\u0027m talking about, you can get the craft file at: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/u947i804lhyt8aa/AABrxuIIYthtM4u1m4NsmFaxa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/u947i804lhyt8aa/AABrxuIIYthtM4u1m4NsmFaxa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll find the turret slot in the middle of the ship. There\u0027s a decoupler along the side of the turret (which is currently just Remote Guidance Unit) that initially connects it to the ship that you\u0027ll need to detach once in flight (you can see the decoupler on the right side of the screenshot below). You\u0027ll find the grabbing unit below the turret which you can arm to connect the turret to the ship. I then usually timewarp to get the decoupler to float out from inside the ship. You\u0027ll obviously need to cheat the ship to orbit to test this as I haven\u0027t included a launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227RDPmxl.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7RDPmxl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also tried a variation with a Clamp-o-tron Shielded Docking Port instead of the grabbing unit, but with this I can only seem to dock and undock it once, then it refuses to reconnect the turret.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for reading, looking very much forward to your responses! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022105.88\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022 width=\u002217\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-13T01:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the only solution (for what people call \u0027kraken-tech\u0027 bearings)\u00A0is to make the re-joining so easy that you can do it anytime you switch craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI built a similar bearing for \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/OHara/Tough-Twin-Electro-Prop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/OHara/Tough-Twin-Electro-Prop\u003C/a\u003E, with the spherical collider of the grabbing unit serving as part of the bearing.\u00A0 \u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image ipsAttachLink_right\u0022 data-ratio=\u002276.47\u0022 height=\u0022704\u0022 style=\u0022width:306px;height:auto;float:right;\u0022 width=\u0022918\u0022 alt=\u0022bearing.jpg\u0022 src=\u0022http://k-ohara.oco.net/KSP/bearing.jpg\u0022\u003EThere is a mod \u0027Collide-o-scope\u0027 (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149706-13-collide-o-scope-v116/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Elink\u003C/a\u003E) that outlines the shapes used as colliders by the physics engine, which helps line things up correctly.\u00A0 On one end of the moving part, a\u00A0cage of thermometers surrounds the grabbing unit;
