There are a ton of things I want in KSP stock, but one of them would be a sort of \u0022soon in the future\u0022 space parts pack that includes parts that emulate NASA\u0027s current plan to take humans back to the Moon and eventually on to Mars: Orion and the Deep-space Gateway. I think we have parts already analogous to the SLS, but I am not 100% positive. There are also concept crew landers that NASA is considering that could be included as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, I\u0027d love to see this in game in this \u0022soon in the future\u0022 parts pack. There are a million other things I want in KSP as well, but I figured I\u0027d suggest this one for now!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee below for Lockheed Martin\u0027s concept image of all the new spacecraft required for us to begin a sustainable presence around the moon:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022LunarEconomy.jpg.png.pc-adaptive.1920.me\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022498\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/space/photo/feature/ahead/LunarEconomy.jpg.png.pc-adaptive.1920.medium.\u0022 width=\u0022638\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know there are likely mods that add this into the game and I am probably not interested.
