I aerobraked around jool, circulized myself, went out to Laythe and ended up in a polar orbit. I probably spent 1k delta v screwing with my orbit around laythe. At this point i was down to around 3900 DV and doing some calc\u0027s i figured i might be able to get one more fly by of one of Jool\u0027s other moons. After screwing with maneuver nodes i got an intercept with Tylo, that happened to be a fly by. Then i was going to circulize around jool and hope i had enough DV in the tank to get my guys back to kerbin. But on my way to Tylo i started playing with nodes and managed to get an encounter with kerbin, and it cost me only an extra 450 ish delta v to get it. I\u0027m rather pleased with myself for getting a gravity assist off tylo without even really intending it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuestion though is when coming into jool system, is it best to intercept laythe if that\u0027s where you intend to go? or get into jool orbit first then go up to laythe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Kerbal%20Space%20SS/screenshot8.png?w=AABy4h4dNUqo-xY1o1alFFVCHaeKWzcA_QuPWhWZRdZRCw\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot8.png?w=AABy4h4dNUqo-xY1o1alFFVCHaeKWzcA_QuPWhWZRdZRCw\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/Kerbal%20Space%20SS/screenshot9.png?w=AADf2GbBeODSvS7D7LYgnr-aepXU9W2_Fxa0rrQIHVW4Yg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot9.png?w=AADf2GbBeODSvS7D7LYgnr-aepXU9W2_Fxa0rrQIHVW4Yg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-28T04:54:18Z\u0022 title=\u002211/28/2013 04:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Turvok\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EBroken Picture links\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"turkwinif","CreatedById":84592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-28T04:53:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry to aim for Laythe if your intended targets are going to be Laythe, Vall, and/or Tylo.
