The master branch for my repos is always the released code, any dev work is done on a separate branch or fork.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: I just checked by accepting some CC contracts then deleting the pack, the latest dev branch version of CapCom seems to handle it fine. It spits out a bunch of nasty looking log spam, but the other contracts continue loading and window remains functional.\n\nSorry, could have been clearer (and I didn\u0027t check - many github projects don\u0027t seem to actually do dev/master branches) - looks like I grabbed master, rev d0e477c683d616fbfda8f28dd509a4ed68532be8 \u0022fix sub-parameters\u0022 - sounds like its all dealt with already anyway, and deleting the completed contracts from unrecognized agencies stopped the stock contracts applauncher app wigging out, so all good.\n\nthanks for the mod, very useful.\n\ntimmers"},{"CreatedByName":"Mokmo","CreatedById":62363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T02:32:25Z","Content":"I have a memory leak condition since i updated to 1.1, the only other plugin update i did in the past 5 days was your Orbital Sciences\u0027. \n\nTaking out Capcom stopped it all, but the logs don\u0027t show much, only a timestamp of when the contracts were loaded."},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T01:00:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I have a memory leak condition since i updated to 1.1, the only other plugin update i did in the past 5 days was your Orbital Sciences\u0027. \n\u003E Taking out Capcom stopped it all, but the logs don\u0027t show much, only a timestamp of when the contracts were loaded.\n\nI\u0027ve never had problems with CapCom and memory usage.
