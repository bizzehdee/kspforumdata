I don\u0027t know if this is something that you can fix or if it\u0027s just a KSP problem.. but it has cost me a lot of funds and science because it does not give the reward either and can\u0027t do that contract again later.\u003Cp\u003EI have now uninstalled this mod to avoid losing more contracts but the idea of it is very interesting\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you mean you accepted the contract through CapCom and it disappeared immediately, or that you accepted it, completed it later, and it disappeared?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is nothing special that CapCom does to contracts, it has the same effect as accepting a contract from the debug menu. As soon as a contract is accepted it is handled by the stock contract system.
