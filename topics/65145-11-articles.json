Real life has kind of been a thing lately, so I haven\u0027t had a chance to put the Triskelion or KSP in general at the top of my list. The framerate of space near the Triskelion is heartbreaking, and I\u0027ve kind of lost my interest in giant generation ships. I will be starting a new project in the same universe as the Triskelion, focusing on ultra-light, single-purpose, single-launch vehicles. Hexaflexagon Station will make an appearance as a refueling platform. It may be a while before my first mission report, so bear with me. I will make a new thread about it when I do. As for now, the Triskelion project is closed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
