Try a mk-I pit with a nose mounted intake, rear mounted liquid fuel tank and pushed by a rapier. Then canards, delta wings (with or without elevons), a tail, gear, and either drogues or air brakes. Alternatively, the pointy mk-ii with a fuel tank, bicoupler, two preschoolers, and a couple of rapiers can also make a pretty good sausage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn take off, hold the brakes and spool up your motors. With a high thrust to weight ratio, you might somersault if you hold it too long. If you want to hold it long, launch clamps are required. The single engine outputting 40kN or the the twin engines each at 30 kN will provide a nice brisk launch. But if you let them get up to 80\u002B, you\u0027ll be through the sound barrier before you pass the tower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I like to to get up to 300\u002B m/s relatively level then ease up to 45 deg. If I get heating effects below 10000m, I throttle down. Getting past 800-900m/s at this phase can be deadly. Ease the nose down to be able to reinitiate full throttle at 10-12 km alt. Then use pitch controls to accelerate as much as possible while keeping speed in m/s less than 1/10 the altitude in m. (That is, getting above 1300m/s below 13000m for example is dangerous). Over about 16000m it doesn\u0027t matter so much anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Optimal cruising is usually around 21-24 km for rapiers. Coming home, stay high and fast until ksp is on the horizon. Set SAS prograde and when altitude is around 20km, cut engines either set SAS to hold attitude or off.if you have airbrakes, use them. If not, lower your gear. Goal is similar to ascent, keep speed below 1/10 altitude. Below 10000mm, 1000m/s is safe down to sea level. If you\u0027ve timed things well, you should be in about a 45 deg dive to the landing strip. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELine up and get ready for a very dicey landing. Hold as much speed as you can as long as you can. Use pitch controls or airbrakes below 1000 m to slow to around 400. Try to flare down to 200-300 a few meters off the strip and airbrake and or deploy chutes when you\u0027re low and level enough for them and hopefully you to survive. If you have any piloting sense, you will not get used to landing this way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.

I tried to use wing pitch to correct the AOA on a few designs but never had much success.

Like how Buran ended up looking so much like STS. Believe me when I say I tried a LOT of sizes and shapes to pull that flight off and would not be one bit surprised if anyone else trying the same ended up with a very similar craft. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve realized that going that distance requires more than just a well designed craft. It will test your skills as a flight captain as well. And it will be ever so rewarding when you finally touch down. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-07T22:41:51Z\u0022 title=\u002210/07/2015 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ExaltedDuck\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
