The anomalies would lead the Kerbals across the system, and the ultimate mission could be a manned return mission to an extremely difficult to reach anomaly (possibly on a randomly generated planetoid just for this contract) that unlocks technology that allows the building of sci-fi style vessels that can quickly travel the solar system and land anywhere with ease, or if that\u0027s outside the scope of the game, have it be some kind of groundbreaking discovery (i.e. it reveals the origin of life on Kerbin), and have a fancy video cutscene followed by credits (not the rambling weirdness that minecraft had). In this career, science points would be a means to an end, where you have to gather science points to unlock parts and possibly to reveal new anomalies, but the player still has the freedom to choose to pursue the anomalies at their own pace (or ignore them entirely). The random placement would ensure replayability where you have to find the anomalies each time instead of just always going to the same coordinates.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T02:38:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T02:55:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dodgey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dodgey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELooking forward to my fresh start with 1.0.\u003Cp\u003EHonestly I would like to see either Etho or Bruce Willikers pick up KSP, even for just one video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember Etho mentioning KSP a while back, but no video....\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"daniel l.","CreatedById":57763,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T03:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI only wish the devs would make planets more alive first (Clouds, Volcanoes, Ocean waves (Interstellar anyone?), Geysers, Wind, ACTUAL COLLISION MESH FOR GROUND SCATTER!!!, Larger asteroids, More asteroids, Asteroid moons for planets, Aurorae, Special music tracks for each planet ( For example a sleepy twinkly one for Eeloo.), Small scale procedural terrain for planets (Little details that are generated by the computer) to make surfaces look cooler,Volumetric rings, Procedural asteroid fields ( It would look like several asteroids but they would really all be attached by part joints making it so the computer only has to calculate one orbit instead of 200.), Dust fog that would fill the asteroid fields,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you guys wanna see what i am thinking of ksp becoming check out Limit Theory an upcoming space sim with GORGEOUS graphics!.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T04:05:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like prettier planets and other FX too, but by sounds of it the house is still being built.

The anomalies would lead the Kerbals across the system, and the ultimate mission could be a manned return mission to an extremely difficult to reach anomaly (possibly on a randomly generated planetoid just for this contract) that unlocks technology that allows the building of sci-fi style vessels that can quickly travel the solar system and land anywhere with ease, or if that\u0027s outside the scope of the game, have it be some kind of groundbreaking discovery (i.e. it reveals the origin of life on Kerbin), and have a fancy video cutscene followed by credits (not the rambling weirdness that minecraft had). In this career, science points would be a means to an end, where you have to gather science points to unlock parts and possibly to reveal new anomalies, but the player still has the freedom to choose to pursue the anomalies at their own pace (or ignore them entirely). The random placement would ensure replayability where you have to find the anomalies each time instead of just always going to the same coordinates.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds a lot like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/3vvjushy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENovaSilsko\u0027s original plan\u003C/a\u003E for the storyline involving the easter eggs and a hidden planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thinking about that, quite a few of the [THREAD=60551]easter eggs need to be fixed[/THREAD].\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe SSTV Mountain went silent a long time ago.
