For example these Goal Contracts could be to:\n\nEstablish a manned base on Minmus that produces x amount of Ore, that also has x,y,z science experiments on it. \n\nYou\u0027ll need to run the experiments to complete the contract then that would open up a tranche of parts in the tech tree that players (with a good amount of skill and understanding of the game) would be able to use to get to Duna.\n\nIt doesn\u0027t have to even be one mission per body. Each body (or indeed particular biomes) could have 1,2,3 or more specific mission goals and once they are achieved then the next level of tech tree unlocks are made available.\n\nE.g. Minmus could have:\n\n1) Construct one base with a particular set of science experiments\n\n2) Return Ore from the Flatlands to help R\u0026D with research for the nuclear engine\n\n3) Create a 3 satellite network in a particular orbit\n\n4)\n\nThese are in addition to the the regular contacts that pop up. The regular contracts would be to raise funds, whilst the Goal Contracts would allow unique narratives to be created by each player as they expand their space program.\n\nIt would take some time and thought with regards to balancing the gameplay, both from a narrative and sets of parts unlocked viewpoint but I think it would be great and would put the \u0022Program\u0022 into KSP!\n\nIt would of course work alongside the OP too."},{"CreatedByName":"sapienza","CreatedById":141805,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T13:07:20Z","Content":"Best idea I\u0027ve read on this forum in ages.
