I have a settings page, on which there is a radio-button which enables/disables the Blizzy toolbar.\n\nWhat I want to happen is, if you open the settings from the stock toolbar, and enable the Blizy toolbar, to have the stock toolbar button go away and a button added to Blizzy\u0027s toolbar.\n\nThis works.\n\nI also want it to go the other way, meaning, if you open the settings from Blizzy\u0027s toolbar, and unset thebutton, that the blizzy toolbar button goes away and the stock toolbar button appears.\n\nThis works about 75%. \n\nWhat happens, is that the Blizzy toolbar button does go away. But the stock toolbar button doesn\u0027t appear until I do a scene change.\n\nMy guess is that I need to tell the stock toolbar to update, but don\u0027t know how. Is there a simple way?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nLGG"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T14:27:27Z","Content":"I found my problem, wasn\u0027t setting a local variable properly."}]}
