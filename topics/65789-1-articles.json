When nearing the point of ascent where you normally tip the ship over to angle it at 10k m I turn off the throttle, allowing the rest of the boosters to take it the rest of the way saving fuel, since at this point it\u0027ll still gain speed. (Tipping it isn\u0027t recommended until the 3 solid boosters have been jettisoned or the ship will go all haywire on you). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the Solid boosters are jettisoned, turn the throttle back up too 100% and tip it too the proper angle ( 90 degree\u0027s I believe), and let it continue too burn the rest of the fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you jettison the first stage completely, turn throttle back down too 0% and ignite the second stage, allowing the small boosters to do their job, since you are now out of the atmosphere of kerbal your speed will go from 300-500m/s and be boosted too around 1.5-2.5k m/s depending. Once the boosters are depleted jettison them, and allow yourself too travel at 0 throttle too the AP. At this point you should only need a few hundred extra m/s to achieve orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe initial launch is a little wonky in my opinion since there are points where you turn the throttle off, but essentially I found putting solid rockets at the mid stage is a great fuel saver.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-14T20:24:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2014 08:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LadyAthena\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Force21","CreatedById":14852,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T19:11:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave any pictures of the rocket you built for this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T19:21:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMathematically speaking, it\u0027s impossible for your ship to be captured into Mun orbit with no fuel.

Instead the statement \u0022it\u0027s impossible to get into an orbit without thrust\u0022 is about KSP\u0027s patched conics physics system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore specifically, you can\u0027t get into a closed orbit (that is, an orbit without an escape) around a satellite in KSP without thrust. To reach a body\u0027s sphere of influence in a patched conics system, you have to exceed it\u0027s escape velocity in relation to the body. So when you first enter a satellite\u0027s SoI from it\u0027s primary\u0027s SoI, it will always be a hyperbolic orbit with an escape. Basically, if you do nothing, you\u0027ll exit the SoI at the same speedyou entered the SoI, just in a different direction. You will ALWAYS have to change your velocity/orbital energy to get captured by a satellite. This is usually done by burning retrograde or aerobraking if you have a convenient atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess there could be corner cases where if you just barely got into an SoI, and mucked around with time warp (which causes some ... twitchy... changes in orbits and positions due to floating point errors), you could get a closed orbit without thrust... but thats closer to a software bug than space flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn reality, asteroids can get capture and become orbiting satellites due to gravity interactions with other satellites. For example, the Galilean moons of Jupiter stabilize each other\u0027s orbits in due to orbital resonance. However, since we have 1 body patched conic physics in KSP, this isn\u0027t possible. Also, the asteroid capture/birth of the universe/big bang orbits you\u0027re talking about don\u0027t occur in time frames measurable in kerbal, or even human, life-spans so they\u0027re not really useful for spaceflight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, everything that wasmic said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Congrats on the breakthru!

First, let\u0027s assume I have a 10 ton ship powered by an LV-T45. I do not have enough delta-v to complete my mission, so I add reaction mass to my orbital stage. For this specific scenario, I have two options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Add two Rockomax BACC Solid Fuel Boosters on TT-38K radial decouplers or,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Add two liquid fuel and oxidizer boosters consisting of an FL-T800, an FL-T400, and an FL-T200 on TT-38Ks.
