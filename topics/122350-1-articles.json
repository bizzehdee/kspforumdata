But perhaps that\u0027s exactly the point. Of all the things that should be stock with the game, it should be this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding new functionality is more difficult because new modded parts or physics could affect gameplay in a big way. But graphics enhancements should always be there. And they should be stock because every update brings a risk of the mods no longer working, and the devs of those mods could stop updating them at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest selling points of flight sims has always been the imagery. And while KSP\u0027s universe is a marvel to look at, there\u0027s still the potential to make it far more stunning. Even the \u0022distant object\u0022 mod, which makes far away bodies look like planets do in our own night sky, is such a simple concept but does so much to enhance the visuals. Some of the other mods, such as the Interstellar one (for high-detail planet textures, clouds etc) or the quirky atmospheric scatterer, bring the game close to photo-realistic. But getting them to work can be a chore, and as I said before, support for them could end at any time. These are the kinds of things that should ALWAYS be available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xWxMu2al.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xWxMu2al.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2MWwNXWl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222MWwNXWl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NYTgsEcl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NYTgsEcl.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m6ICltWl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022m6ICltWl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/56xbBAhl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002256xbBAhl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-06T16:15:17Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2015 04:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-05T03:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76972-0-90-KSPRC-Renaissance-Compilation-artworks-remake-V-0-2-(18-04-15)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProots Renaissance Compilation\u003C/a\u003E to be stock.

Sorry, it\u0027s not blue. I mean, it depends. It actually looks right for where that picture is taken because lower orbit of the planet does look lighter in color due to the proximity to the atmosphere\u0027s effects. It\u0027s at higher orbits where it really shows how bad scatterer makes the planet look. That effect should fade away as you further from it and the planet should look darker blue like the picture I posted, but in scattered, it doesn\u0027t. Quite frankly, I\u0027d rather go without it than have it look so bad in space where I see it the most. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompare \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7knNaPy.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis picture\u003C/a\u003E to the NASA picture I liked above of Earth.
