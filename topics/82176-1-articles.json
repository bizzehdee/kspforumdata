They took out one of their standard planes, the Hermes II, a plane commonly referred to as Old Reliable. The Hermes II was a small, but efficient plane. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wXHncJC.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wXHncJC.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Hermes II could go up to about 300 m/s, and could fly very far without using much fuel. But it\u0027s primary selling point was a cargo bay, holding small to medium sized packages that could easily be dropped from high above, allowing easy transport of many things.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PRy4tkc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022PRy4tkc.png\u0022\u003E The Hermes II, devoloped during a war to drop bombs, is now widely used for dropping bombs, to research stations, to care packages, for the wounded. After they got it out of the hanger, they went to the astronaut complex and picked out two eager young men, itching for their first flight.The two recuits were Hudvey and Jorvey Kerman.\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ni9N66w.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ni9N66w.png\u0022\u003E After getting everything ready, and doing a quick pre-flight review of how to grab the tether and the parachute, Jorvey and Hudvey were on their ways. Hudvey, having more experience as a pilot, flew the plane, and Jorvey, more daring, was the one in the cargo bay testing the tether line. They heard mission control say on the radio,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMission Control: Alright boys, we\u0027ve decided that since today is a quite day, you\u0027ll get to be filmed live on KSC-TV. Don\u0027t worry, on boring days like today, nobody will be watching. Whenever your ready, fire up the engines.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHudvery: Roger that.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plane began to climb forward. After only a little bit, it was off the ground. They soared high above the ground, climbing closer to the clouds. Everything was going well. Both of them were feeling the thrill of flying for the Kerbal Space Program. Hudvery looked up to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, and wondered, hoped, dreamed, of one day reaching it. Jorvey watched as the cargo bay slowly opened. He climbed out of his command pod, hooked his tether up, and got ready for the first jump. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XT3pgcz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XT3pgcz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, he was lowered down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MsnSJzx.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MsnSJzx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe felt the fresh wind blowing against his face, he felt the thrill of being so up, he felt the fear of falling, and had the bravery to over come it. After a few minutes, he was pulled back into the plane. He put the tether back on the ceiling hook, and climbed into his pod for a quick break and a bag of crisps. But then, it began. First he got out of the pod. He tried to grab a parachute from the wall. But it shook violently, throwing Jorvey to the bottom of the pod. At this point, more viewers began to pick up on the channel, reaching 300,000 viewers from 1,000 in just a few minutes. Hudvery devised a plan. He would shut off the engines to allow a few seconds of decreased gravity so Jorvey could become unstuck. A few seconds later, Mission Control confirmed the plan was a go. Suddenly, the engines shut down. Jorvey wiggled as much as he could but he couldnt become unstuck. Realizing the altitude meter had dropped dangerously low, going from 10,000 meters to 3,000. Hudvery turned on the engines again. The plan had failed. Jorvey was now more stuck, sitting in a tiny pocket behind the pod. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lQCkUG3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022lQCkUG3.png\u0022\u003E Slowly, Jorvey heard the engines whistle as they worked hard to level out the plane. Soon, they were back above the clouds. At this time, over a million people had been watching the station live. There was only one final last ditch plan. Hudvery would have to point the plane straight up, then shut off the engines. Afterwords, the cargo bay doors would have to be opened, with Jorvey untethered so he could try to use his few seconds of zero-gravity to get back into the pod. It was dangerous and risky, but it was the only option. Suddenly, Jorvey heard the engines shut off. He saw the cargo bay begin to open. Jorvey felt the adrenaline rush through is body. Finally, he slid out. Immediately, he activated his jet pack. But it was too late. He started drifting away from the plane faster than he could thrust towards it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tAwGc7G.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tAwGc7G.png\u0022\u003E In a desprate panic, Hudvery released the crane from the plane, hoping Jorvey could grab on in time. But he couldn\u0027t. A picture was taken of him falling as the crane tether dropped in an attempt to save him. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5cfIWa3.png\u0022 alt=\u00225cfIWa3.png\u0022\u003E Jorvey was doomed. All Mission Control could do now is tell Hudvery to save himself, and stay in contact with Jorvey until the end. The nation sat watching, in panic, as Jorvey descended from the clouds, \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YGKz3sH.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YGKz3sH.png\u0022\u003E For Jorvey Kerman, had met his fate. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bGJFAxS.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bGJFAxS.png\u0022\u003E He uttered his last words to mission control as he fell. \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RJcVHMq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RJcVHMq.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u0022Though I may be leaving Kerbin now, I am going to the stars. All of us will one day reach them, for it is only a matter of time. So do not think of my death as a tragedy, but as the end of the first stage of my journey, my journey to explore the universe an all of its wonders, is just beginning.\u0022 \u003C/strong\u003E Afterwards, one final splash was heard, and the nation fell silent.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-21T03:37:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/21/2014 03:37  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Tommy99534\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Codey737","CreatedById":76942,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-21T23:32:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E*tear* *sniff* *tear* So sad...Poor Jorvey\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommy99534","CreatedById":6162,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-24T00:27:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother story soon probably.
