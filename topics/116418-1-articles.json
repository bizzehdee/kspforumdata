It features a fuel cell engine, and must be turned on with action group 1 and off with action group 2. Lights are toggled with action group 3. \n\nThis is part of my WWII Replica Project (see signature)\n\nEnjoy!"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T17:51:35Z","Content":"Hey man. I haven\u0027t seen a car like this built before. It\u0027s a nice build man. Could be cleaner though. \n\n I always hold a very back a day or two to go over every inch with the offset tools. And Im not sure about the rear end.\n\n Apart from that it\u0027s really cool looking. And sits amazingly next to the old timey aircraft. Rep for you good man.\n\n I\u0027ve given out too much.. I will rep ya later."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T19:54:02Z","Content":"Nice work! I love how it looks with the planes.
