That Eeloo2 is every bit as good (or bad, depending on your opinion) a planet as Eeloo. I just shifted its orbit around so they wouldn\u0027t interfere, but other than that I haven\u0027t done much on this since. The same could be done for Jool, but you would have to take care to copy all of its moons as well. You can also delete planets/moons if you like as well.

This practically guarantees that only one body has its terrain system and objects on the terrain active at any one time. You\u0027re then only limited by the CPU cost of updating orbits for extra bodies (which is not much - it\u0027s the same as the cost for all the debris you have in orbit, and think how much of that you can have) and the rendering cost of all the \u0022distant\u0022 models. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much in the way of a LOD or culling system for these distant models (aka ScaledSpace models), not even for the ones that take up less than the size of a pixel (which is the case for nearly everything), but I think it\u0027s possible to implement such a system on top of what\u0027s already available to keep performance at a suitable level even with maybe 1000s of bodies (e.g. with upwards of 50 moons per gas giant and a moderate asteroid belt).

Implementing such scales on the current system directly would not end well due to floating point precision. If a modder was ever to attempt having multiple planetary systems light years apart it may be best to treat interstellar travel as unloading the system you\u0027re leaving and loading the destination system as necessary, dealing with all the setting up and tearing down along the way. There would also need to be a new super-map view for visualising space at the per-system level. The tricky part is making sure that unloading/loading systems cleanly deals with the persistence of the state of things on and orbiting bodies in those systems, and figuring out how to deal with vessels in interstellar space in the best way. The feasibility of all of this hinges on how much of the internals the API exposes. The more feasible alternative is to just have multiple systems that the user can pick between per save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad would probably take a different route to implementing interstellar travel given that they actually have control over how the core code works directly. They would probably make a new \u0022super\u0022 scaled space environment which each system\u0027s scaled space resides in. That would end up being a lot more seamless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T21:18:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I was careful not to suggest travel between systems.
