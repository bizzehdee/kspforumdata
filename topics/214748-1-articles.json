I talk about some of the major challenges that had to be tackled by the dev team - which caused the delays and are the main reason for the current state of the game at EA release.

As you can imagine, after announcing delays, the developers probably wanted to do something more ambitious than just an improved version of KSP1.

It\u0027s meant to be a realistic simulation of space travel and a lot of other things. This is kind of a trap for game design because it means avoiding instancing and other tricks. Blame Descartes for making us think about space as it\u0027s own thing (Cartesian system) instead of relationships between object. If spaceships were teleported from one star system to another we wouldn\u0027t have all the issues people complain about. But...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u0022...we\u0027re enabling players to travel from planet A orbiting star B to planet C orbiting star D, \u003Cstrong\u003Econtinuously, without any loading screens, pauses, faked out transitions, \u0022warp drives\u0022, or other trickery\u003C/strong\u003E.

They tackled something that is generally only done using supercomputers. We\u0027re talking about distances that are just incomprehensibly large for the human mind. It\u0027s a HARD problem and solving it is groundbreaking for gaming. Add the need for a trajectory solver that takes acceleration into account and it all gets very complicated.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMultiplayer - solving the time-warp\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Eproblem and delivery routes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs many of you know, I\u0027ve written about my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/207618-ksp2-multiplayer-a-competitive-space-race-team-based-mmo-with-trade-and-contracts/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ewishes, dreams and theories related to multiplayer\u003C/a\u003E. I might be wrong, I might be right. After thinking about it .. a lot .. I have come to the conclusion that asynchronous multiplayer that allows time-warp in space (and other features like delivery routes) requires an innovative and complex system of recording events and placing them on a common timeline. If the devs chose this route, it is/was very hard to implement and I\u0027m sure it took a lot of time. Actually, because it\u0027s built on top of the previously mentioned simulation system.. it\u0027s even more complicated.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEarly Access - stripping down the game for EA\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMO this was done in a hurry and has generated the most bugs because you have to work around a lot of issues caused by the way fundamental systems interact in the game. Why was it done in a hurry? Your guess is as good as mine. But certainly the game would have benefited from another 2 months of testing and debugging. Is this reason enough to be disappointed or hostile? Of course not, bugs will be fixed.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAnd then we also have:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCreating the teams, processes and development pipeline\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCreating the new PQS system for celestial bodies (the textures and details are there in the internal builds, but there\u0027s not enough performance budget to use them for now)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nParts mechanics for vehicles and colonies\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPhysics (aero, liquid etc.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCreating / iterating the user interface (which seems to have been left to the last moment - which has generated bugs)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPerformance optimizations (this is usually done at the end of development and I don\u0027t think is the biggest issue for now)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scale of the project is GIGANTIC from a software development point of view.

There are two possible scenarios that I can think of:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. They knew what a poor state the game was in and decided to release it at near full price anyways in an \u0027early access\u0027 status. Now, why they would do this is a bit more complicated and unknown. Pushing the game out forces the development of the game to go from pre-release to post-release, and forces any hidden issues into the light of day. KSP 1 was pretty much entirely developed post-release once the core of the game was stable (pre-1.0 build), so it makes sense that KSP 2 could be done the same way. It provides free game testers and all important feedback to fix their problems. However, there is also the possibility of financial issues and a money grab. KSP has a niche but devoted user base. They knew that we would buy the game regardless of the state of it. So its possible that they chose to exploit the user base for some cash. Why they needed that cash so bad I dont know. But as you said, this game took much longer than it was supposed to, for many different reasons, which all means that it cost much more than they expected to make it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. They DIDNT know that a poor state the game was in. I cant decided if this scenario would be better or worse. On the one hand, now that they are aware, they could divert their resources to fixing all the problems that they were somehow unaware of. However it would also indicate extreme ignorance and point to serious flaws in the company that might or might not be easily or quickly fixed. I cant really imagine that this is the case. Which means they must have known what they were releasing to the world.

I have no issue playing an early access game. I don\u0027t mind dealing with bugs, and I like to play games as they mature and grow, especially one as near and dear to my heart as KSP 2. However, as has already been played out countless times on this forum, there is simply no framing that makes it okay to charge $50 for the game in its current state. I suppose I wouldn\u0027t be complaining if the game was, say, $30. It\u0027s certainly not worth $50 now, and even if they intend to release for $70, $50 is too much for what is effectively an alpha build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say the current build is worth MAYBE $15-20 in CURRENT VALUE- that means the pricing is mostly speculative. Considering how technologically ambitious KSP 2 is as a project, and the other circumstances around the game... this simply doesn\u0027t make sense. The game should be priced according to its current value, plus at MOST a small markup (50%???) for the fact that one day in the future it may get finished. In fact, as was pointed out on another thread long ago, the Steam early access rules specifically state: \u0022Do not ask your customers to bet on the future of your game. Customers should be buying your game \u003Cstrong\u003Ebased on its current state, not on promises of a future that may or may not be realized.\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/earlyaccess\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/earlyaccess\u003C/a\u003E). I\u0027m not suggesting that we should petition Steam to get KSP 2 kicked off of the platform, as many (most?) early access titles on Steam don\u0027t truly live up to this rule.
