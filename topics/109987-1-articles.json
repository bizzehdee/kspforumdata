Some big control fins (delta wings and elevons) on the bottom got it through the first stage burn. When I staged, I also activated TCA (press \u0027y\u0027), RCS, and the Twitch engines.

Below is the first example, where I launched the lab module, habitat module, and tug all at once. This one is notable just because its a very long and draggy fairing with relatively light weight components inside, which is why I wanted to launch all three components together. The key here is mostly 20 AV-R8 control fins placed as low and outside as possible (along with the 5 mainsail gimbles in the rocket SSTO launcher). Also note that all struts are as aligned with the airflow as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YiGI27x.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YiGI27x.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Qax1Wbm.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Qax1Wbm.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is another station, and the hardest thing I\u0027ve had to launch. First of all, I didn\u0027t have low tech like no fairing that could hold it and only modular girders for structure. Secondly, most of the connections use docking port juniors, which are all that I had but are VERY wobbly. Here aligning the struts with the airflow was key. When the struts were in an X configuration they wobbled until it all exploded, but switching to the vertical airflow aligned configuration below eliminated the wobble. I also using 20 low and outside control fins here. Notably I tried wings here, but they did not help nearly as much as just adding more control fins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tzjJ4OF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022tzjJ4OF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k9cWrSc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k9cWrSc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, a different class of problems comes when hauling things with their own lift to orbit. Here I am lifting my standard nuclear tug. I like this configuration with 2 wide nukes, because they are stackable (need more TWR, just add more tugs), *limited by wobble. However, the wide arrangement doesn\u0027t fit in a fairing, so I had to overcome the lift generated by the radiators fins. Here I used 4 delta wings generated enough lift below the CoM to offset the lift in the upper stage. The launcher is my medium 3 mainsail rcoket SSTO. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mQuRvIN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mQuRvIN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECyberSoul\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirrus","CreatedById":145623,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T12:58:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kuzzter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks, this is an important point that hasn\u0027t been raised before on the thread--sometimes turning a control surface off is better than keeping it on, because they like to fight each other!
