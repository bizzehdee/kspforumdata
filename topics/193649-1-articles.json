I had a good sandbox game going and I was planning a mission to Duna. To test out my lander I used the cheat menu and hacked gravity to that of around Duna\u2019s surface. After I was done testing I tried to reset the gravity to normal but it did not work. I returned to the menu and went back in, I quit and relaunched my game and that did not work. So I looked for solutions, I saw the only way to fix this was to start a new game, i\u00A0did this. When I went to launch my first rocket in my new game I noticed the gravity was the same as the gravity from my last game. How could this be and does anybody have any\u00A0solutions on how to get the gravity back to normal in my new game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you in advance for your answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-06T00:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve also had this problem\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kid Yeti","CreatedById":191954,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-21T16:27:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny solutions to this issue yet?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I ask is that I have NOT had the problem but don\u0027t want to temp it by messing with the gravity as you have. \u00A0Although I really want to!\u00A0\u00A0I only play on PS4 but have seen folks use add-ons that do this for PC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am intrigued by the idea, but do not know where the \u0022cheat menu\u0022 you describe is? \u00A0Only getting back to the game after many months away. \u00A0Have not been able to see it described in Enhanced Edition\u00A0Update Patch Notes. \u00A0When was this added?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think I\u0027ve seen reference to a method (on console) to \u003Cu\u003Emove or launch a craft in orbit around a planet/moon\u003C/u\u003E. \u00A0Similar to what mods are able to do on PC. \u00A0Is this really an option? \u00A0If so, how do I access it? \u00A0I\u0027ve looked around and not been able to find it in any of the menus or controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal110802","CreatedById":205092,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-04T08:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/191954-kid-yeti/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022191954\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/191954-kid-yeti/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Kid Yeti\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Not sure if this is the same for PS4 but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Xbox, after you paused the game you had to press \u003Cb\u003EUp, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0on the D-pad of the controller to get to the cheat menu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like the developers would use the same cheat code for the PS4 pause menu but using the buttons on the upper-left of the controller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I could be wrong but give it a shot)\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204453-cmdr-joshj/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022204453\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/204453-cmdr-joshj/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Cmdr joshj\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Have\u00A0you tried restarting the console?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
