The SRB\u0027s should ignite first, get the rocket off of the ground and then seperate before the main stage ignites, the way I set it up (I used the AB Launchers \u0022Seal\u0022 engine) it lasted for a rather long time. I used an ascent profile of nearly on the top hemisphere of the navball\u0027s line at 100m/s, if you know what I mean by that.

I think you\u0026#39;ve got a lot of potential going with UL, and I just wanted to offer up some suggestions, rather than be nitpicky (or plain picky) about anything ^^; I\u0026#39;m much more interested in helping to tune UL to be the best it can, rather than grumbling about it :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]First impressions\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/B]UL is very pretty. Kerbin looks really interesting in the map view, with rings, and an extra moon (hi potato, are you less lonely now?), so I grabbed a test plane and went for a ride.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Launch site[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nVisually, Kerbin overall looks great, and I like the long coastline around the equator, but I would question the placement of KSC. There\u0026#39;s a lot of ocean to both sides, and it\u0026#39;s not got much for players to ogle along the way up and down. One range of mountains [I]if[/I] you fly spaceplanes, nothing for rocketeers. Some hills, a mountain to south/north, an island or two to the east, and a bit more land in general, would do better to show off the new look of Kerbin. Alternatively, another equatorial site with an ocean to the east might work out better, even on exactly the same terrain. Current spot just seems to waste what\u0026#39;s available out there, and isn\u0026#39;t very amenable to letting players find it by sensible-range plane contracts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also kinda wish it was nearer the coast. New water physics encourage submarine development for Laythe/Eve, but it\u0026#39;s quite a trundle to the shoreline vs stock. Not a biggie, just one to consider maybe :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd... is KSC meant to be on a diagonal? It\u0026#39;s kind of a downer for plane guys, since there\u0026#39;s no visual alignment markers for the runway when coming in. I can imagine a lot of crashes because of last minute course adjustments. I for one would definitely prefer a straight east/west runway.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/pKmjek2.jpg[/IMG]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Atmo\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/B]I am a big spaceplane fan - you may remember this from my NH adventures :) UL Kerbin has 1.2 atm densities, and 77km height. I think the radius of the planet is also a tad larger? Anyway, it turns out that spaceplanes work pretty well, but my 2p is that I personally would be inclined to match stock\u0026#39;s atmosphere and planetary radius because you\u0026#39;re opening the pack up to...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n- heating issues may be more severe due to a longer drop from a higher speed. Atmo balancing seems like a real can of worms. Heck, stock hasn\u0026#39;t got it right yet!\u003Cbr\u003E\n- all engines deliver less thrust at higher pressures. Getting things off the pad might be unexpectedly awkward now...\u003Cbr\u003E\n- craft designed for stock and shared on the forums might simply not make orbit in UL, since the pressure hit will get them all the way through the ascent.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- upgrading to UL while having a vehicle under ~105km orbit currently puts them into the atmosphere. That\u0026#39;s kind of a barrier for anyone who has a low altitude station going on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- increasing cost to orbit in ways that might alter game balance. Engines are all balanced for 1atm and 70km launchers... again, can of worms here.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMy 2p, anyway, you are of course free to disregard it :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Rings[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese look great in map view! I only wish there was call for more polar flights so we could see them more often xD I wonder if letting them have a 9-10 degree inclination might not produce some better visuals from KSC?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Moons[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nI like the Minmus thing, that\u0026#39;s cute. Not been there, but it\u0026#39;s certainly different. It looks like it could be even more useful for a refuelling base, if it\u0026#39;s still got some ore on it and anywhere flat enough to land?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Bugs?[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe funny orbit lines above are probably due to the Win-64 hack; which might not be as important under new Kopernicus anyway. Leaving that out, all I spotted was some odd biome labels, like frozen plains, at the equatorial desert.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-20T22:34:06Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2015 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by eddiew\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KillAshley","CreatedById":128696,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T08:13:06Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027eddiew\u0027]*snip*[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\ncheers for the feedback dude, theres been a lot of work going on behind the scenes and feedback like this is critical in these early days of the pack :wink:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Launch site[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nto be honest I couldn\u0026#39;t find any place i was really happy with. I understand what you mean, the visuals definitely need to improve for it....I\u0026#39;ll get back looking for a new spot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Atmosphere of Kerbin[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt first I increased the scale of the atmo by 10% and left the pressure ASL the same. 1atm ASL and a 84km height made it a new change from stock, however i got quite a few complaints about it so i ended up trying out increasing the pressure slightly to compensate for bringing it back down. I\u0026#39;m still not happy with it though, and trying to figure out how exactly it should be. I don\u0026#39;t want it the same as stock, the whole point of changing everything is to make players change their thinking too. I\u0026#39;m still digging away at it though, you know I\u0026#39;m pretty obsessive when it comes to polishing my packs lol\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Rings[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have an idea on how to help, however it\u0026#39;s too early of a though to say anything yet (I\u0026#39;m not going to get people\u0026#39;s hopes up in case it gets scrapped), but I put them into a 0 inclination to make it easier to match them to Minmus, as it can be tricky eye-balling the LAN of orbits to get them perfect.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Moons[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll the stock resources still spawn fine AFAIK, but i still need to test a bit more. Despite its tiny size, there are some (relatively) flat areas to land on Minmus....not many though! The hard part is the encounter, which due to it\u0026#39;s tiny SOI needs to be treated more like a rendezvous. I didn\u0026#39;t want it to be smooth and flat like in stock, as a rougher more jagged surface fitted the \u0022shepherding body\u0022 kind of lore UL uses. I just need to do the ground textures for it now....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[B]Bugs[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E\nYeah most likely thats the 64 bit hack, haven\u0026#39;t spotted anything like that during my extensive testing runs...but keep me in th loop if you spot anything else. As for the Biomes, it\u0026#39;s something I\u0026#39;m aware of and am going to look into when i get time. Biomes are set by ground color and i think that the colors are just too similar for Kopernicus to get the difference.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-21T08:15:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2015 08:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KillAshley\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-21T10:00:50Z","Content":"\nMmkay, that\u0026#39;s fair.
