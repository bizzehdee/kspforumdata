My first design was too fragile. The second was too inefficient. Once I realized I only needed a TWR of 1.3 to slowly push through the soupy atmosphere instead of trying to blast out with a TWR of 2.0, I had enough weight savings to make my final design work. Note the transfer craft has way too much delta-V because kerbal engineer froze up on me without me realizing it and it was stuck using atmospheric ISP for the nuclear engines. That caused the initial launch weight to be enormous (2.5 Gg) but it still launched fine. Better to have way too much delta-V than not enough anyways. It allowed me do direct to eve and back burns to save time anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/TkMVn\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
