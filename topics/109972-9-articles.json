IT is important to note that all parts in the path must be passable.  You can look at the part descriptions in the Editor to see if it is passable.  If there is no CLS entry in the right click details, it is not passable.  If so, you have a choice.  You can enable custom passability in the settings menu (and maybe the part is added to the list of optional parts to allow it to become passable), or you can create a custom config for that part, so module manager picks it up.  This is explained in the CLS WIki shown in my Signature line.\n\nAlso note from a realism point of view we do not set all parts passable by default.   Only those where it is realistic to believe a kerbal could pass are by default. You can however create any custom part modules you want.  It is YOUR game after all.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-16T19:29:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2016 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Papa\\_Joe**"},{"CreatedByName":"jordanjay29","CreatedById":62787,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-16T20:08:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 40 minutes ago, Papa\\_Joe said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If there is no CLS entry in the right click details, it is not passable.
