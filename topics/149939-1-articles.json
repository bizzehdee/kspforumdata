in higher atmosphere environments as they realized travel was potentially more efficient. \u00A0Quickly though, the technology Kiu had developed on his own started to reach limits, he needed more historical technology recovered to develop his own work. \u00A0So Kiu left \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E on his longest flight, in search of the Ancient Pyramids and the Old \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E Launch Facility that Val had spoken of. \u00A0Surely relics could be discovered that would advance his efforts at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dgkr8Sx.png\u0022

able to disassemble some of the old parts at the original \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E and was gaining a greater understanding of the principles of solid kombustion and jet engines. \u00A0With this greater knowledge, Kiu set back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with an aim to get more contracts for work and hopefully start to develop some of the technologies that he uncovered. \u00A0The immediate next step though was to upgrade the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E research facilities and begin working with Bill and Bob to help revitalize R\u0026amp;D. \u00A0One technology he was ready to fully implement though was the basic \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E, he would call it the Flea. \u00A0Bigger than his commercial off the shelf kEstes rockets, but still small enough to easily mobilize and test at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0Time to reach greater
