The apoapsis represents the highest point of your orbital path. If that point is behind you, you\u0027re on your way down, if it\u0027s in front then you\u0027re climbing towards it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make your apoapsis higher by thrusting vertically upwards, but this will just mean you go steeply up and then steeply down. To reach orbit, you need to fly along the ground until you\u0027re travelling so fast across that when you fall, you miss the ground and just keep falling. So, apoapsis is important to be sure that you\u0027ll be high enough at some point to be in orbit, but much more important is to raise your \u003Cem\u003Eperiapsis\u003C/em\u003E to a similar altitude. To do this, thrusting up won\u0027t help at all, and you have to thrust sideways, usually along the equator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the problem is that you\u0027re unable to reach these speeds before you pass the apoapsis, the issue is probably either that you\u0027re not following a very good flight profile, or that you simply don\u0027t have enough thrust. The thrust issue is solved by using more engines or using bigger engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ascent profile is more complicated. You need to be ascending quickly enough to get out of the draggy atmosphere, but at the same time you want to build up as much horizontal speed as possible as soon as you can. I usually start by tilting 5 degrees straight off the launch pad, and switch my speed display to \u0027orbital\u0027 instead of \u0027surface\u0027. Watching the prograde marker on the navball, I steer gently to meet it at an attitude of about 60 degrees. Then it\u0027s a case of steering to bring the prograde marker down to about 10 degrees climb by the time the craft reaches about 25,000m. Then I switch to map view and try to bring my apoapsis up to orbit altitude (usually 75km to give a safe margin to atmo). Once the craft is in space, I boost the apoapsis back up to 75km (it will have dropped due to atmo drag), and then make another burn around the apoapsis to circularise, i.e. bring the periapsis up to the same altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is almost certainly not the most foolproof or efficient burn to orbit, but it\u0027s the seat-of-my-pants technique that I\u0027ve settled into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this is no help at all, try to give us some more details of where the ascent is going wrong, what altitude you\u0027re meeting the apoapsis, whether you\u0027re reaching space, what your craft looks like, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T23:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelp, if you\u0027re passing up your apoapsis, then the problem is likely a combo of your rocket and your ascent path. Your rocket is likely too weak (or just plain not big enough) and your ascent path is likely too shallow to properly get up into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know you don\u0027t want MechJEB, so what I recommend instead is to get VOID or KER. The reason being that they\u0027ll give you more readouts of what your rocket is doing, how fast its going, how high it is, etc etc. Using one of those mods will tell you what your apoapsis is only the fly without having fly in the map view or even switch views at all. Also tells you your Delta V and TWR both during construction and in flight, which will pretty much determine if your rocket can even get to orbit at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, lets start with the ascent path. The way I generally fly my rockets has served me well, as it pretty much applies to any rocket that should reasonably be able to fly, so presuming you\u0027ve put together a good rocket, you can go to orbit using this sort of path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is to gradually go from straight up to lying on your side by the time you\u0027re ready to establish your orbit. As for how fast you do this, that largely depends on your rocket. Weaker rockets with a low TWR (Thrust to weight) will want to go more slowly and start the turn a bit higher than 100m/s. The reason for this is because weaker rockets will have to gather more vertical speed during the early portions of the flight compared to a more powerful rocket, and by the time you\u0027ve gathered enough to not just fall back down into the atmosphere, your TWR will have raised enough to easily build up the horizontal speed needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA stronger rocket, ones that might have a TWR above 1.8 or so, will want to keep a slightly faster turn going, as they\u0027ll be building up a lot of vertical speed which can easily eat too much into your horizontal gains. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what does all that gobbledygook mean to you, the beginner? Well, presuming your rocket can in fact make it to orbit if flown right, all you have to do is launch, wait till around 100m/s, and start turning left slowly. Good standard goals to hit is to have your rocket pointed at around 45 degrees (IE, halfway to fully horizontal) at about 30km up. For a beginner, once you hit this mark you can actually just stop turning and only continue pushing your rocket more horizontal if your prograde marker (The green circle) starts to get away from where your rocket is pointed. Doing this will continue pushing your apoapsis up until it hits whatever height your orbit you want to be. From there, you can cut your engines and coast to apoapsis, at which point you can burn to raise your periapsis, and thus establish orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the rocket itself, we\u0027d need to see what your rocket looks like. From there we can start suggesting things that\u0027ll help out. However, installing VOID or KER will ultimately prove more beneficial (both to you and us) as it will tell us exactly how powerful your rocket actually is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the current version of KSP, the amount of delta V needed to establish orbit is somewhere around 3500km/s. If the total delta V of your rocket doesn\u0027t go over this number you\u0027ll never to to orbit unless you run into some physics shenanigans. You\u0027ll also want each stage of your rocket to be over 1.0, and the first stage definitely needs to be at least 1.4. If your rocket has these stats, then your problem is how you fly. If it doesn\u0027t, its the rocket (and possibly how you fly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"match","CreatedById":91708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T23:29:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce you are launched, started your turn and confidence is high, switch to map mode and mouseover your apoapsis marker and it will show you \u0022Time to Apoapsis\u0022.

Whenever an engine isn\u0027t firing it\u0027s dead weight. And the staging apparatus is also unnecessary weight. Delete the engines and decouplers from stages 6 and 7. Merge the tanks that remain with stage 8 by attaching the lower tanks and engines to them. Each of those engines is easily capable of lifting two tanks with sufficient thrust left over to boost the central stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. That central engine needs to be doing some work earlier or it\u0027s just dead weight. Select it within stage 4 and drag it into stage 8.

At present you have a fairly long delay between an engine burning out, staging, and then re-igniting the engine of the next stage. This is because there\u0027s an enforced delay between staging to protect against accidental activation of a later stage. You also lose the control authority of the engine gimbal whilst it\u0027s deactivated and you lose speed. If you drag the engine from stage 2 into stage 3 it\u0027ll activate the engine immediately on staging, controlled by the throttle position. Other unnecessary delays have been removed by the other alterations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.

I saw a video where someone\u0027s burn time was 4 seconds. But you don\u0027t need to aim for that now. You\u0027re just trying to get into orbit and you can do it inefficiently. My burn times are usually between 30 seconds and 2 minutes depending on what sort of monstrously heavy ridiculous thing I\u0027ve built.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour rocket looks like a it is carrying a lot of dead weight. Although creating massive rockets is the Kerbal Way, one lesson I learned recently is that sometimes less is more. Sometimes if a rocket doesn\u0027t seem to get to orbit, it\u0027s because it has too much fuel, not too little. The rocket I usually take up to orbit (with plenty of fuel to spare these days) looks like your long center one, with only two solid boosters (the mid-size ones). Here\u0027s a picture:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://41.media.tumblr.com/fd0bca9b97015ecf9ff8b350285f6687/tumblr_nvh2ijCvi71r54661o1_540.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tumblr_nvh2ijCvi71r54661o1_540.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah it\u0027s not the world\u0027s fanciest or best designed. I can see a lot of things I\u0027d do differently. But it gets me there. My fuel tanks are 4 FL-T400s, 3 on the initial stage and the 4th up above. The solid boosters and the \u0022swivel\u0022 engine fire on the same stage. My upper stage engine is a \u0022terrier\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically what I do is enable SAS, throttle to max with Z, then fly up, tilting over gradually with an aim to be at 45 degrees when I\u0027m at about 10km. After that I do keep turning over gently, but not too much. Dump those solid rocket boosters as soon as they are empty (it will happen fast). When I\u0027m around 30km I switch up to map view and look for my apoapsis. Mouse over it, and just keep staring at it until it is above 70km (I usually go for about 80km) and then cut the engines with X. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027ve cut the engines, then I set up the maneuver mode at apoapsis. You need to do this kind of quickly! Just click at apoapsis and pull your prograde marker (the green one without the X through it) until the apoapsis and the periapsis switch. You should then have a time to apoapsis and an estimated burn time. You\u0027ll also have that blue marker on the nav ball telling you which way to burn. Once you are above 70km, turn towards that blue marker, even if you have some time before your burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you want to do half your burn before apoapsis and half afterwards. If you have some time before then, zoom out and you\u0027ll notice that your orbit probably isn\u0027t perfectly circular. I always overshoot a bit! You can pull the retrograde marker a bit to bring yourself closer to a circle. Then burn when your time to apoapsis is half of your total burn time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI almost always run out of fuel on my launch stage during this burn, so if that stage is almost out of fuel, give yourself some more time because the terrier engine is less powerful but more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this is not the best way to get into orbit but even noobs can do it! You don\u0027t have to be perfect.

Use a very simple rocket with far more fuel than you would really need : when learning, you are going to waste a lot of fuel. It\u0027s a normal thing.
