I showed the NASA plans using both NTR and chemical rockets can achieve the same travel time to Mars. Either one will require life support for almost 2 years while the astronauts do their science and wait for a launch window. So in that case, NTRs won\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you think NTRs are the limiting factor for a Mars mission, and chemical rockets can perform the exact same mission (with more launches and costing more), then we are not limited by today\u0027s propulsive technologies.
