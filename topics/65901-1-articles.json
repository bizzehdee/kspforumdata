Being real NASA doesnt make the most interesting games and they also dont market them very well if at all. i really hope that both parties will decide to team up and work together to develop the game with maybe a like official game of NASA stamp or there endorsement on it. what are your guys thoughts on it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-15T20:14:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see KSP officially endorsed by NASA one day.
