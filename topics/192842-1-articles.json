You should also try to find C:/users/your_username/appdata/locallow/squad/kerbal space program/player.log and look for exceptions, errors and the point at which it crashes. If you find any, upload the files to a file sharing website and link to them in a reply, do NOT paste the logs directly into the reply as it is really hard to read and can cause problems for people visiting the page on a mobile or tablet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan you also tell me where you got KSP from e.g. steam, and if you are using any mods what they are. What\u2019s the last thing that gets shown on the screen before it crashes?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Harry Rhodan","CreatedById":119953,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-26T09:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most obvious reason for a lot of crashes is old and outdated mods. Especially if people come back to the game after a long time or uninstalled the game through Steam they don\u0027t remember or realize that all of their old mods will still be around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
