I made some tests using maneuver nodes on the orbital map and I found that the navball doesn\u0027t take into account which engine(s) is/are running. For example, is this tutorial, you start with the bigger engine running. If you add a maneuver node, align the ship with the maneuver prograde on the navball and then shut down the bigger engine and start the smaller ones, the maneuver prograde doesn\u0027t move. Yet, if you start your burn, you will appy a thrust in the opposite direction of your maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAm I missing something ?

With it, you will be able to see just what your ship is doing as it comes in for landing. You use the WSAD keys to tilt the ship in response to what shows on the retrograde marker in order to cancel drift. That is far easier then trying to cancel drift by observing what the ship is doing in exterior view which will result in you tipping over just about every time. With using the Navball and the radar altimeter in the interior view, you can safely land at night on any fairly level surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the example below, if you can get the drift that low while almost hovering, you will land safely even on a fairly steep slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kvNuDvT.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022kvNuDvT.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile Mun is harder to land on due to its uneven surface, the same method for landing applies.
