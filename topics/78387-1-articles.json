Playing an ironman style game with no save/reloads or mission restarts. To give that some real teeth I\u0027ve also decided to use only mortal Kerbals! Currently I have 3 (sorta 4?) experienced Kerbonauts as I\u0027m prepping for a Mun landing. Normally I would hit Minmus first, pillage it for SCIENCE! and then do the Mun but I\u0027ve also decided to let the order that Missions come up direct my playthrough - it\u0027s been a lot more challenging!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETIME FOR SOME NEW HEROS. Anyone else feel like tracking missions for other than Jeb/Bob/Bill?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShelbro 1 mission, 2 failures - First launch in a ship, first above 5,000m, first orbit, tested R10 SSB. Had two attempts to test components after that which went cockeyed and disassembled, which he barely survived (Oh FAR. You\u0027re a cruel mistress!) With him being my first real Kerbonaut I decided to sideline him for a bit until I\u0027ve got some better tech. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuuki - 4 test flights, 1 orbital mission (science test), 9 near-death catastrophies. Successfully tested: Rockomax Decoupler, TT45 Decoupler,TR18 Decoupler, TT70 Decoupler, LV45, LV909, LV48-7S, Rockomax Poodle engine, BACC Booster, Mk2 Radial chutes, Mk16 chutes. Lots and lots of chute tests. He has survived a stunning \u003Cstrong\u003E9\u003C/strong\u003E catastrophic mission failures, though currently refuses to launch without a Mk16 on top and 2 radial Mk2s on his command pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdmin - 1 mission, 1 test flight - rescued Mittberry, science in orbit, first extended EVA (5 EVA data collections total), ran a test flight that simply tested the Rockomax Skipper in splash-down. Currently in debate if this makes him Kerbins first naval officer, as he puttered around in a rocket-boat for a while. He has also spent almost a full orbit bopping around outside the command pod, collecting EVA data on biomes below. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMittberry - ? He appears to have somehow ended up in orbit on his own in a stable orbit at ~118,000m without a ship - just in his suit, EVA pack, 2 empty cans of Schlittz and a bent hole punch of unknown origin. Currently in confinement for suspicion of appropriating KSP vessels for \u0027a wild, drunken blowout\u0027. Conspiracy theorists suspect aliens. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA \u0027mission log\u0027 feature for tracking accomplishments of individual Kerbals would be awesome. If such a mod exists I\u0027d love to hear about it. For everyone else though, who are your new heros for 0.24?
