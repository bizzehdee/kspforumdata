The budgets of the Space Agencies all over the world dedicated to mantain or expand the human presence on space are lowering slowly. In 60\u0027s we sent a man to the moon. In 2020\u0027s we\u0027re going to send an human with a technology years-light of distance to Apollo to Moon Orbit to retrieve a little asteroid. How embarrasing! \n\nThe ARM is only an excuse to keep SLS alive, because it\u0027s a rocket that hasn\u0027t sense. It was desgined, and now, they have to search a mission for him. It isn\u0027t the way to make a giant rocket like SLS (i think that a launch of this monster costs many millions dollars, not 6 or 17, im talking about 600 milliosn at least (i dont rememeber the exact cost)). The ARM Mission is a mission that scientist don\u0027t want, it will be more cheaper send the asteroide to the moon, refuel the probe and put it near ISS, where a normal ship like Dragon v2, CST 100, Soyuz or PTK-NP can reach it. \n\nBut Russia isn\u0027t better. The giant rocket of Russia has been cancelled (another like SLS). I think that this is a godd idea. Instead, they will do a 35 tonnes-to-orbit rocket. With two of them, they will sent a new PTK-NP to Moon orbit. The Number of Russian cargo ships delivered to ISS is going to be reduced due to the arrive of new commercial ships like dragon or CST-100.\n\nESA is another history. They haven\u0027t a manned program with their own space ship. They pay seats on other ships.\n\nAnd China... I put my hopes on China. Because they can reach moon on 7-10 years with their actual technology, if they use their resources properly.\n\nUnmanned exploration is another story, but it isnt enough. I don\u0027t feel comfortable knowing that today, only 6-8 humans are outside Earth\u0027s atmosphere.\n\nWhat do you think? post your comments.\n\nAlso, if you understand a bit of spanish, i highly recommend you this web: [www.danielmarin.naukas.com](www.danielmarin.naukas.com)"},{"CreatedByName":"billbobjebkirk","CreatedById":104713,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T19:10:53Z","Content":"ARM is intended to be a technology demonstration for SEP, Orion, and SLS, while still being able to achieve a scientific benefit.

But you need to present a solid and complete plan of how to do it.. not just.. \u0022this may work\u0022, you need to show them confidence.\n\nThe falcon heavy 1st stage reusability will need to be mature for that time.\n\nA coperative mission between countries may help for the mars case because you need at least 4 or 5 astronauts there.. In the venus case where you can sent just 2 astronauts it will not help much.. because each country would want to sent their own astronauts. \n\nRight now countries needs to stop making new weapons or keep putting money in army research, because is completely pointless today.\n\nI know that war is a business and they get some profits with that, but that is ending due globalization, media and public opinion, it generates big country loses against few profits that only receive some people in power.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbuUW9i-mHs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nSo they will need to cut with all that sooner or later, and the only way to show superiority after that is with big achievements.\n\nAnd how countries can not get gain new lands or resources out of their limits.. the only way is to get those in space.\n\nNobody can \u0022conquer\u0022 other planets.. but anyone who arrives will be able to exploit them.\n\nExploit a planet is not just extract resources... There is development and new science.. you put some infrastructure that can be used for other countries later, etc. Also being in the edge of exploration and knowledge, that country becomes a magnet for the people more capable and intelligent from earth, which they will generate more profits.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T14:28:06Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AngelLestat**"},{"CreatedByName":"Firwen","CreatedById":140631,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:26:46Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Robots can do a lot already, saying that there are complex things that only humans can do is mostly an argument from ignorance. Dismissing someone by an equivalent of \u0022that\u0027s just your oppinion\u0022 is a pretty bad behaviour in a discussion.\n\nI apologize if I offended you. Far from being what I looked for.\n\nI simply do not see the point to discuss manned vs unmanned space exploration again, this has been reviewed and documented countless number of times in the literature. And a simple scholar.google.com query would give you as many information as you want.\n\nMost of the reasons are obvious. The reason we do today unmanned mission is mainly because of cost and simplicity.... NASA does not have unlimited budget and the Apollo missions and the ISS are a brilliant example of how costly human flight is.\n\nHowever, a bunch of humans on Mars in a ISS-sized landed laboratory would open experiments possibilities that you would not even dream of ( bio/botanical experiments, life development under Mars gravity, Terraformation experiments, long range explorations, advanced chemical analysis.... ).\n\nI think I\u0027m pretty well informed on what Robots can do and can not. Simply because it\u0027s part of my job.\n\nAs cool as Robots are and as performant as they tend to be, they are not magic and they are still far from human flexibility. They are good to do simple, repetitive task, in well defined environments, in space like every-where else.\n\nOr you should ask yourself, why we have the ISS today and why we do not have replaced everything by Robots on Earth\n\nWhat we name today robots, are not robots, but mainly remote controlled un-brained \u0022bot\u0022 trying to do pre-programmed defined job. \n\nThis has a lot of limitations. Speed of light being what it is, you will and will always have ultra-high latency in remote space operations which limit a lot what you can do and what you cannot. This is not KSP, in real world latency matter.\n\nA Mars round-trip-time is around 20min, this is awfully long. If Curiosity has between 2012 and 2014 done **only** 8.4km (which is already amazing), it is mainly due to the complexity to operate with precision any unmanned probe over such high latency. Each little movement need to be verified carefully after a 20 min delay....\n\nWithout even mentioning that if space radioactivity impacts living creature already badly, it is even worst with Electronic. Any Electronic designed for space need to be specially designed, tend to be unreliable, and is millions time less powerful than common available Earth-Chinese-electronic nowadays. \n\nAdvanced AI could theoretically solve this, but they come with their own set of problems, are not adapted to today embedded systems, even less to space ones."}]}
