The budgets of the Space Agencies all over the world dedicated to mantain or expand the human presence on space are lowering slowly. In 60\u0027s we sent a man to the moon. In 2020\u0027s we\u0027re going to send an human with a technology years-light of distance to Apollo to Moon Orbit to retrieve a little asteroid. How embarrasing! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ARM is only an excuse to keep SLS alive, because it\u0027s a rocket that hasn\u0027t sense. It was desgined, and now, they have to search a mission for him. It isn\u0027t the way to make a giant rocket like SLS (i think that a launch of this monster costs many millions dollars, not 6 or 17, im talking about 600 milliosn at least (i dont rememeber the exact cost)). The ARM Mission is a mission that scientist don\u0027t want, it will be more cheaper send the asteroide to the moon, refuel the probe and put it near ISS, where a normal ship like Dragon v2, CST 100, Soyuz or PTK-NP can reach it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Russia isn\u0027t better. The giant rocket of Russia has been cancelled (another like SLS). I think that this is a godd idea. Instead, they will do a 35 tonnes-to-orbit rocket. With two of them, they will sent a new PTK-NP to Moon orbit. The Number of Russian cargo ships delivered to ISS is going to be reduced due to the arrive of new commercial ships like dragon or CST-100.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EESA is another history. They haven\u0027t a manned program with their own space ship. They pay seats on other ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd China... I put my hopes on China.
