I generally hit V2 (liftoff speed) and then climb at 35\u00BA - 40\u00BA until 18km - 19km. Then, I nose down to about 20\u00BA or a bit lower and accelerate until the jets flame out (or the Rapier switches modes to closed-cycle) and then nose up again to 30\u00BA\u002B until I have an apoapsis of 75km.
