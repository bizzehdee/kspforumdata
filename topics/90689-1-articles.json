Seeing as it has snowed a lot where I live (and the community around here apparently hates mud animations), I am going to restart my animation series, which culminated in the episode 10 finale of season 1, link at the bottom. However, instead of mud stuff involving Frozen characters, it is going to involve stuff more keeping to the original Frozen style. At least, that\u0027s the plan. May I present to you, the long text involving Anna-Mations Season 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ERegarding Anna-Mations Season 2\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am going to make A.M. Season 2 (A.M. = Anna-Mations) starting in either February or March 2015. The difference? Less mud, more Frozen-themed stuff. For example, Elsa ends up re-freezing everything while sleeping, and then IDK what happens after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, there\u0027s my current plan for A.M. S2 in a nutshell. Haven\u0027t really thought it through yet, but I just know that I want it to have less mud content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, for that aforementioned link to A.M.
