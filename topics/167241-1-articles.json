The interstage part has 2 attachment nodes. One for decouplers and the payload attachement and one for the top of the interstage. The top node needs to be connected to something in order for the game to recognize parts connected to the bottom node as shielded. If you leave the top node open the game will think there is nothing inside the fairing. The interstage part originally is meant for ships which stack payloades on top of each other and to shield them properly they are not meant for engine covers since you can not use them for that not in the stock game at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game thinks in nodes and in part metadata when putting together how a vessel should handle aerodynamically.
