The ver. 1.2 (addon version) was compatible with ver. 0.16 of KSP and the last version of the addon was v. 1.3.7, which is compatible with a newer version of KSP, ver. 0.21.1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question for addon developers is :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the addon works with the KSP ver. 0.21.1, but i will use KSP ver. 0.16, the addon will work for me ? Because in the change log it said that it did. Of course Nostromo_1_3_7.rar archive is the last ver. for KSP ver. 0.21.1. It is backward compatible or must have its old ver. in archive (beside the new one) for the old KSP ver. 0.16 ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12477-0-21-1-Alien-Nostromo-%28ver-1-3-7%29?highlight=0.15\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/12477-0-21-1-Alien-Nostromo-%28ver-1-3-7%29?highlight=0.15\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Faark","CreatedById":69775,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T00:15:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, new mods will most likely not work on old KSP versions. They are build for the new version and usually use some kind of feature, even if its just internal stuff or something that does the same is done differently, now. You might be able to get it compatible yourself, but that will likely require extensive modding skills that you might lack, since you are asking this way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe version history of this particular mod states that version 1.2 was made for KSP 0.16, so your best bet is try finding that old version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, modder won\u0027t provide \u0026amp; support outdated mod versions for outdated KSP version, since they usually don\u0027t have the time to spare for those few players who would actually use them.
