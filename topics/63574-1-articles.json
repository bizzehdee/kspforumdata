As-is, you may go to space today, but you won\u0027t be coming back - alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/v4tykNax\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/v4tykNax\u003C/a\u003E Note that the Skipper and decoupler on the upper stage should be moved in the staging before sending Kerbals on a suicide mission, or modifying the ship for actual use. This is *not* a flying rocket, it is intended as a test of the TT-70 radial decouplers (due to total failure to hold together with KJR 2.0). Do not kill some Kerbals with it then complain to Alan Aerospace Recycling and Packaging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only non-stock parts are the big Thundermax 64 tank in the middle, the large adapter on top of it, and the 8 big tanks around the sides. The design originated as a way to get a lot of fuel to orbit, while drastically reducing the number of parts, especially fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn flying form it had two rings of 8 ReStock 5-way RCS blocks around the big tank, and one each on the outside ends of the side boosters. It also had a ring of 8 OX-STAT panels on the big tank. There was also a large inline reaction wheel on top of the cone shaped adapter/fuel tank. That plus all the RCS made it very quick turning, even when full of fuel - it makes a pretty good tanker, easily capable of ferrying quite a bit to Mun or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is in the link above, the asparagus staging is set up to work but the solar panels and RCS and other pieces have been removed and the engine and decoupler in the stage stuck on top are in the wrong stage due to it being stripped down for debugging why the TT-70\u0027s fail with KJR 2.0 but not 1.7.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFit it out as you like, but don\u0027t try using it with KJR 2.0. Moar Struts didn\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft actually does not need KJR to hold together, I tested it without any KJR and it had *less* flex and bounce on the pad as physics kicked in. So I launched it and nothing failed! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027ve used this to lift much heavier payloads than an orange tank with a command pod and a Skipper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor even heavier payloads, replace the center Mainsail ReStock Bigger Badder Quad Coupler plus four Mainsails and brace it to the big tank with quantum struts. (IIRC, this version may have come before the posted version with \u0027only\u0027 nine Mainsails.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a piccy of the big tank after lofting a heavy rover.
