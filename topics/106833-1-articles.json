You will have the same situation as before (= need to switch between display modes), but the screen will be extended to an ultra wide-screen version across all monitors. With 2 monitors, the \u0022logical\u0022 middle is right at the monitor frames. Then you have a huge blank space in the center of your setup. This gets enjoyable with 3 monitors, but then again this needs further optimization than \u0022rendering the game in (3*1920)*1200\u0022, because the HUD should stay in the center screen. The constant headshaking caused by having the staging on the left, the navball in the middle and the ressources on the right screen may cause others to think you might not like this game. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- allow KSP to open new windows and render to them, e.g. putting map view into one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhether the player has both on one screen, stretches the vessel view over three, or puts the map on one side and moves the vessel to the other, is then entirely their decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the question is whether Unity can render to multiple windows simultaneously... which may well be a big no, since most engines assume a single rendering canvas of WxH pixels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats the \u0022more correct\u0022 solution. 2 logical seperated spaces/windows with differerent sets of information on 2 different screens.
