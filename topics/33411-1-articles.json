I got the piece into place, but now I can\u0027t get the tug boat to disconnect from the piece that I\u0027ve added to the station. If I try to disconnect the tub boat\u002Bsolar array from the station, then it works just fine. But it won\u0027t allow me to simply remove the tug boat from the solar array. Clicking on the Undock button does nothing. Pic included.
