The gist is that instead of having to pick from tens of different but similar-looking fuel tanks, you just pick any fuel tank, right click on it, pick the length and radial size, and the part changes accordingly. Kind of like tweakscale, but the part actually switches to another part\u00A0instead of simply altering the size of part. It\u0027s also not procedural parts, because it uses the parts already in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that part variants are a thing, I think this is not too far off. It could be like that, but with size instead of color. This could really save some time when designing a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-10T15:57:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting, but while you\u0027re simplifying your parts bin, you\u0027re adding extra steps / clicks to place each tank. Each time you place a tank you\u0027ll have to go into the right-click menu for that part and change it to the correct size.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, there are graphical / texture issues. If you want nice, high quality parts textures you need them to be created with a particular size in mind. Simply grabbing a part and stretching it will result in all kinds of texture issues and the only way to solve it would be to use really (REALLY) simple textures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-10T15:58:08Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2018 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Tyko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-10T16:17:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think what he means is that if you drag the slider up it suddenly changes from one existing model of tank to the next largest existing model of tank, if you know what I mean?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike jumping from a FL-T100 to a FL-T200 to a FL-T400 etc...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, I\u0027m not a fan of the idea for the stock game, sounds more complicated than just picking the tank I want from the list personally.

The filters work fine but you need to be able to filter by multiple category\u2019s. Right now if you filter by profile you end up with command pods and everything else in that profile. You can also filter by fuel type but then you end up with all size tanks of that type. you need to be able to select multiple filter fields. select tanks then 1.25 size then fuel type and get only mono or whatever you chose 1.25 m tanks.
