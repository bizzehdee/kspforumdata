Kerbals will last 2 hours without power.. And power is not generated as far as TAC is concerned when unfocused and also I think in high warp too? 5-6 orbits will most likely be over 2 hours of time as mine are usually in the 25-30 min\u002B range depending on altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if kerbals die when focused or ship loaded while doing orbits then most likely your craft does not have enough power generation to sustain what sas consumes or anything else you may be using that draws power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is dying while orbiting while the craft is not focused or unloaded then what is happening is TAC LS \u0022thinks\u0022 the power has run out and then kills kerbals after 2 hours.. Generally you have to watch the timer on the LS window for power and simply reload the ship when that timer gets low. So if you\u0027re warping time this is usually why they die..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither add some Rtg\u0027s or solar for issues when focused, or Add extra batteries to give more EC storage which will give you a longer timer for TAC to \u0022think\u0022 there is power when unfocused. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epower requirement is used as a way to put the whole capsule climate issue into TAC without adding more resources or things like temp etc. To worry about.. So if I remember right how taraniselu explained it. Think of power as what makes air circulation, and temperature work in the capsule, without actually having to monitor or worry about specific temperatures or oxygen levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E300 days of supplies if way more than enough for the mun trip. In fact if you are efficient in your travel vectors you can go to the mun, orbit once or twice and make it back to kerbin in time with just the supplies on the capsule. Though depending on flight efficiency you will generally be cutting it close on oxygen by the time you get back to kerbin.
