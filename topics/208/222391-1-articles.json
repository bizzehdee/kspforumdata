While there may be a reason to hold on to a large volume of quick saves during the Early Access build so users can help analyze bugs by comparing data across time in a game session, there needs to be a better solution by the final build for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLimiting the quick save pool to a smaller number like the autosaves are is one idea, but I had another. Compression. These save files are lengthy text files that can easily be compressed. While running compression during a game may take longer and slow it down during a quick save, there is time to complete compression on these files while sitting in the opening menu or upon closing of the game (menu close, not Alt F4 close, as this can be coded to be different).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea here is that a limit of maybe five of the most recent quick saves remain uncompressed while older ones are managed by the system to be placed into a single file (per game) save archive compatible with ZIP or 7Z (preferred) compression so the user can still access the files outside of the game for sharing or archiving but doesn\u0027t have to manage these files all the time. A game setting may also be set to put a user defined expiration on quick saves for the archive so when archive management kicks in while in the main menu or on exit, expired saves are removed. The numbering sequence can continue upwards on quick save file names just as they do now and not revert to lower numbers should those saves later be deleted. This gives the user an accurate assessment of just how often they perform quick saves in a single game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the same time, being user friendly is key here and many users don\u0027t want to hassle with any sort of file management in a game. So a default archive setting should be in place to hold quick saves up to one month. Additionally, a Minimum to keep value may also be kept in settings with a default set to keep a minimum of 10 quick saves in the archive. This figure is independent of the number of uncompressed saves allowed to remain before management occurs. So with this idea, there are only two settings a user may see related to save game management. The maximum length in the archive, and the minimum kept (regardless of expiration).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe UI for loading a save should list the archive as a file such that when you choose to view it, a new listing shows of it\u0027s contents and allows pulling a load from an archived file without removing it from the archives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"emerald","CreatedById":161231,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-05T17:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust let people specify how many quick saves they like to have and rotate them accordingly, then everything is fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"krbvax","CreatedById":231742,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-05T23:29:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224355896\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022222391\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221704474435\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022161231\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022emerald\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, emerald said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust let people specify how many quick saves they like to have and rotate them accordingly, then everything is fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd just for the record, the game already does this with autosaves (3 slots) so the framework is already there.
