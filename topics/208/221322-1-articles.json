The user should understand that solar panels are subject to day / night restrictions and expect there to be periods of lost power. They don\u0027t need to be told every time this happens on every craft. Should the loss of power interrupt thrust on EC driven engines, that would make sense, but not for everything else. Maybe only the active craft should produce these warnings, including when you are in the tracking station while remaining under control of a craft (when you switch to the tracking station from the flight screen).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the future, many things will be driven by power and face interruptions. Fuel generation in KSP1 would run when there was power, and pause when there wasn\u0027t. Because resuming required you to not be in time warp, you had to monitor it and restart it manually each cycle. While you were not in control of the vehicle and not within the \u0022physics bubble\u0022 of that vehicle, you would receive continuous production at a reduced rate, I think because it slowed up in time warp. I understand that KSP2 strives to track solar exposure for all craft all the time, and I\u0027m down with that but it should not come at a cost of message spam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this instance, I have craft that either landed or crashed near a monument (mostly drones, but one with a pilot), that I leave in place so that I can go back and view the monument at any time since they are not kept in the tracking station under a special category. I can see why we can\u0027t \u0022take control\u0022 of flags from the tracking station and thus there is no reason to list them but now they are like debris and we can\u0027t even target them to land near them and read them. So leaving a controllable drone is the only way we have currently to contently keep an eye on a monument. Static screen shots don\u0027t capture how it looks from all angles of sunlight exposure or from all angles around the monument.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile one workaround might be to close expandable solar panels to stop the notifications, there are some that don\u0027t collapse or never could expand in the first place and we may not want to totally cut off all power, especially if we know the craft has sufficient battery life to get through the night. A warning about EC running out may be a better solution than notifications that solar exposure was missing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-06T11:35:32Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2024 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 6\u0022\u003EJanuary 6\u003C/time\u003E by jclovis3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded context and suggestions.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RalphKerman","CreatedById":229516,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-06T11:58:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have had this issue from the very beginning of KSP 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease consider an option to turn off these warnings (maybe make them part of the \u0022new player experience\u0022 so you don\u0027t even have to implement a new option switch ?).
