But when \u0022Max persistant debris\u0022 in settings\u00A0 was reduced to 0 from 50, the issue was resolved and i could load into the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNOTE: Although I am not sure which specific piece of debris made the save unloadable, i might have a hunch. I was doing an eve mission roughly two weeks ago when i wanted to send a rover to eve where due to me not having large enough heat shields, i thought i could use a fairing to protect from interplanetary transfer speeds. Long story short, i could not and the fairing would always burn up. However, the decoupler that i had planned to use to seperate the fairing base from the rover when it was time to land would sometimes burn up before the fairing (due to the fairing not protecting the things inside it bug) and when that happend, the fairing would dissapear and the \u0022base\u0022 would seperate from the rest of the craft (the rover) but the rover would not experience any drag or thermal pressure and would just sail deeper into Eve\u0027s atmosphere no problem. (This is another bug, but i did not report it here when it happend as i did not have an account here yet).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow it would just crash into the ground going 3000\u002B m/s, but since i wanted\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esomething\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eout of the mission, i messed around and realized that when i opened a cargo bay on the rover, drag and thermal simulation resumed. But, well, having drag applied suddenly to a craft going 3000\u002B m/s in Eve\u0027s lower atmosphere does mean a bunch of physics stuff had to be done immidiatly and caused a lot of the craft to disintegrate suddently. But enough parts remained to land something, which i managed to do and i got some science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever a ton of debris was created when the \u0022disintegration\u0022 occured that shot out of the solar system at extreme speeds.\u00A0 Now i deleted all of them (they were causing MAJOR performance issues, the fps increased by like 400% when i deleted them(20 -\u0026gt; 80 at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E)) exept the one that was going the fastest since i thought it would be a fun little thing to have around (it had left Kerbols \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) but in retrospect i believe that it was this piece of debris that was probably going somewhere in the range of 50-100% the speed of light that had left Kerbols \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that the game could not load. And since i had been on vacation for awhile since when i did the Eve mission, i had not played the game again since now,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApologies for having this text be so long, but i thought being descriptive would be a good idea.
