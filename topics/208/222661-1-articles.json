Specifically a craft would fully survive re-entry if I didn\u0027t save\u002Bload, but after saving \u002B loading it would not survive subsequent attempts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter repeated testing and playing around the only way I was able to get it to occur was if the inflatable heat shield was used and the save was made after the decoupler under it fired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFull reproduction steps:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCreate a craft that\u0027s a Mk3-L wanderer, inflatable heat shield, medium decoupler, medium lox tank, and poodle engine.

Consistently I saw it start visual effects around 35-37k, and the heat bar at 25k that went away at 15-20k. Craft will eventually crash into Kerbin (RIP Kerbals)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLoad \u0027after decouple\u0027 save\u00A0and let craft follow identical path into atmosphere. It should consistently show a heating bar in the mid 60ks and blow up in the 60-61k range.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can load \u0027before burn\u0027 and \u0027before decouple\u0027 saves and continue steps from there to see the craft behave as initially and make it through atmosphere without blowing up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned I played around with a number of different combos. The specific pod didn\u0027t seem to matter to the behavior changing, but specific behavior was different with each pod (heat points, etc.) and the specific decoupler used had similar results, although a decoupler had to be present to cause the issue. When I tried with ablative heat shields it appeared that they ablated the same amount in both scenarios although I also didn\u0027t do 100% testing on this so may be wrong which is another thing leading me to believe there\u0027s potentially a weird interaction between the inflatable heatshield and the decoupler that does away when a save is loaded after the decoupling has taken place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIncluded Attachments:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot2024-01-05185602.png.9016450e4c6c12fb56322e1425ff6834.png\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/uploads/monthly_2024_01/Screenshot2024-01-05185602.png.9016450e4c6c12fb56322e1425ff6834.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-06T16:28:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2024 04:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 6\u0022\u003EJanuary 6\u003C/time\u003E by DibzNr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jclovis3","CreatedById":188635,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-08T15:00:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe inflatable heat shield exploding has got to be a bug.
