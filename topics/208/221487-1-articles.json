I wondered yesterday why my engines won\u0027t start even though I have more than enough air intakes. Still the engine choked each time, but apart from that nothing else was particularly weird. When I switched to map view and looked at kerbin the atmosphere was missing... After a quicksave in orbit it was back again. I don\u0027t think this was a coincidence, but maybe there is a possibility that I made some other mistake when building the craft, I can\u0027t rule that out completely. In some other rare cases the atmosphere renders for the reentry, but there is no drag. This is fixed by quickloading enough times. Of course, this may be a different issue\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
