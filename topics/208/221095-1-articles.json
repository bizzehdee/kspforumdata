IDK if this is just a kerbal issue or if it happens with vessels too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo recreate try and manuever the camera to look at where a kerbal is standing from up close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-05T03:06:21Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2023 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 5\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by The Space Peacock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mushylog","CreatedById":227298,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-06T01:17:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this seems to be related to the fix of camera collision with terrain. Back when there was no collision with the terrain, in early versions of the game, it would not happen. It\u0027s a frustrating bug that happens when you try to move the camera close to the vessel (or kerbal), zoom in, move it around and the camera will jerk upward at the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
