Place a pair on a rover in mirror symmetry and add the toggle to an action group such as custom group 1. Add both of the solar panels to toggle on this action group. Launch your vehicle on the runway and test the action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat happens: Because they are connected in symmetry, manually toggling one of them will toggle them both together. Using the action group to toggle them will toggle them both one way, and then the other resulting in a net no change. For now, we can work around this by only putting one in the action group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is expected: Either you can only place one of them in the action group which represents commands for them both, or you can put them both in the action group without each command acting on both of them together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-21T15:32:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2023 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 21\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by The Space Peacock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jclovis3","CreatedById":188635,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-23T20:54:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel this may be related to problems we\u0027re seeing with decouplers when they are connected in symmetry. They are each listed in the staging but perhaps each one being staged tries to trigger them all multiple times or something. I am already finding it necessary to reset the default settings on lights just in case since only one of a set actually needs to be in the action group for them all to toggle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
