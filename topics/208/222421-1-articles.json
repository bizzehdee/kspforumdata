Shores on Kerbin or Shallows on Eve are just two examples. The Starlab retracts all probes and booms every time it pauses and time warp doesn\u0027t speed this animation up either. When you finally do get to continue your scan as you pass by the same type of biome you started it on, you have to wait for these parts to extend before the timer can continue and often, you exit the biome before it can make any more progress. It took me over three hours to scan just the shallows biome on Eve because of this nonsense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn contrast, KSP1 allowed us to extend science parts and leave them out to perform their functions whenever we were ready to. The only reason to retract said parts is for atmospheric reentry, or when they present a hazard to docking or maneuvering close to other vessels. Mechanically, this doesn\u0027t make sense to keep moving them back and forth for every use as this should increase the wear and tear on these pieces and ideally, even cost EC to move them in and out. I actually wouldn\u0027t mind if we had to spend EC to extend, retract things like landing legs or solar panels either as they do use motors to enact motion and engage/disengage locks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may just be a bug that the Starlab even collects biome specific science at all since it needs 6 minutes to perform this. If this is intended, please add to the part status in the parts manager an indication of the biome it is working on when it is paused, or allow it to run scans on each biome without restarting on others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther options are to decrease the time it takes to perform a scan, or make the parts extend/retract faster, but I\u0027d much rather just make us have to extend/retract them manually or only leave them extended during pauses in science but let them retract after the collection is complete.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: The same problem with the OSCM-01 \u0022Mini-Lab\u0022, which is the unmanned equivalent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-03T15:45:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2024 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 3\u0022\u003EJanuary 3\u003C/time\u003E by jclovis3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded OSCM-01 \u0026quot;Mini-Lab\u0026quot;.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Augie","CreatedById":231651,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-03T02:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEncountered the same and wanted to just echo this entirely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeems to either be a bug that Starlab collects biome specific at low orbit or that the research timer should progress during the extension\u002Bretraction.
