I agree with most here that signal occlusion is a really important feature. At the risk of sounding reductionist, there do seem to have been a few decisions made to dumb down KSP. It\u0027s fine, but this ought to be a setting, because I know a lot of folks who play this game, myself included, who really enjoy the little realism challenges that come with features such as signal occlusion and CommNet in general. These are features which add to the game, not detract from it. They add a very real depth to the game and increase its replayability by a significant margin.
