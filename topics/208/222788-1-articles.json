So instead of deleting it, I wanted to wait and see it crash and disappear from the list. But as I watched, I noticed that the reported altitude kept fluctuating; reducing and gaining hundreds of meters of height, till it eventually went into the negatives. I also noticed that the debris was reported to be in orbit, even though it was said to be less than 1000 meters from the surface, and had a velocity of 0 m/s. I\u0027m about 90% sure the debris was the small solid fuel boosters I used to get me off the ground. There was 8 pieces, 3 of which were deleted before the video starts, and that corresponds with the amount of boosters used. I used that many boosters, and even more stages, because the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDv\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E calculator told me I needed over 10k for a round trip to the Mun. Which I found out later was way off. But that\u0027s for a different bug report.
