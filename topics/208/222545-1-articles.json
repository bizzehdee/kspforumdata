A ship headed to Moho had spherical hydrogen tanks docked around it across six different docking ports. I was manually draining the docked tanks in opposing pairs into the main ship and then undocking them. One pair, I managed to undock while paused and they seemed to just disappear, but I moved the camera and found them aft of the ship a ways. While resuming time to continue the burn and the parts were well beyond reach of the bracket keys to switch craft, they somehow came together and docked with one another. This then triggered the new debris to take focus and I had to pause to asses what was going on. They looked like two bacteria cells bonding together because I had them covered in little lights. Anyway, I was able to use map view and take control of my ship again, then resume the burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#e67e22;\u0022\u003EWhat was expected:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFocus should never jump automatically to any craft without an automatic pause. Focus should never jump to debris as you can\u0027t even use brackets to cycle between ships and surrounding debris. When parts are decoupled or undocked from a vessel having control and the newly released parts have no probe or kerbal control, focus should remain with the departed vessel, regardless of which docking port was activated. It seems if the outer docking port is used to undock, focus stays with the debris having that docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-03T14:20:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2024 02:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 3\u0022\u003EJanuary 3\u003C/time\u003E by The Space Peacock\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
