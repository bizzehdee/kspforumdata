I was getting extremely low framerates on launch and transfer, but I expected this given the part count. At Jool I split the craft into seven sub-craft, and moved them all away from each other. While this did reduce the lag somewhat, it did not reduce it to the extent I would expect for just one of the sub-craft on its own. I later staged off roughly half the mass of one of the craft, turning it into a fairly small low-partcount station, and was still getting slideshow frames.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon saving and reloading to the same craft in the same situation, the framerate seemed to near double, so I think there may be some issue going on here with decoupled craft staying partially loaded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-13T14:11:38Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2024 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 13\u0022\u003EJanuary 13\u003C/time\u003E by DibzNr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DibzNr","CreatedById":212219,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-13T14:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/79668-blackholeks/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002279668\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/79668-blackholeks/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@BlackholeKS\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0Yeah you\u0027re right, sorry I was a bit tired when I did your report, I\u0027ve resplit it back into its own post\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
