It has PLENTY of fuel to get up into orbit, and plenty to get you to the Mun. I plan on trimming off some fat in Opul 2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral: For takeoff, I accelerated up to 50m/s and then cut back to 66% throttle (second big notch). First stage will get you to ~10km, I start my orbital turn about the same time I jettison it and power up to 100%. Second stage will get you into orbit, easily. Third stage is plenty to carry you to the Mun and back. You\\\u0027ll have to do a parachute-assisted powered descent coming back in, but you\\\u0027ll make it just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027d HIGHLY recommend this craft for beginners, it\\\u0027s very stable on all axes of rotation, the joints are strong, and it\\\u0027s VERY easy to control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
