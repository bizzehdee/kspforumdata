Used the time to bring Burlong, Malfurt and Miglas down from the New Horizons space station. Realized as I was hitting atmo that they weren\u0027t flying in any generic Raven 7 spaceplane - they were in \u003Cem\u003EFree Bird\u003C/em\u003E, which I had decided not to land on account of the fact that it only had Small Gear Bays (the little gear caused many a crash of the Raven prototypes). Of course, by that point it was too late, so I went ahead and rode it on in. Re-entry and landing were un-eventful; the plane managed to land safely at the KSC Runway without reverts, and suddenly I had three more Kerbals joining the two-star club. Of my current KSC staff of 17, that\u0027s now six in the \u0022official\u0022 two-star club - Jeb, Bob, Valentina, Burlong, Miglas and Malfurt. Berris and Bill are also rated two stars at the moment but their logs don\u0027t show flag-planting activity on one of the moons and so I\u0027m not counting them just yet, and then I\u0027ve got five more Kerbals on their way back to Kerbin at the moment who are likely to join the club upon return to KSC. The big plan is to send them all up at once for a mission into Kerbol orbit, thus earning them all three-star ratings prior to the planned mission to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeantime, since \u003Cem\u003EFree Bird\u003C/em\u003E is landed (for \u0022refitting\u0022 I guess), I need to add a new craft to my reusable space fleet. The plan is to send up a Raven tonight in order to collect a couple of rescue contracts, retreive a tourist from the Kerbinport station and return Bill to the surface. Bob (still at Minmus) might also pick up a couple of scientists needing rescuing over Minmus in the Minmusport space station\u0027s Mun Buggy. I need the kash at this point - I went ahead and upgraded my Tracking Station to Level 3, which completes all my KSC upgrades - but has only left me with about \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1150k.

Well, I play with RemoteTech and have a ok network setup, but it really only works in the Kerbin SOI. I thought that I was covered to Eve, but I am not actually. So I launched the Sentinel satellite and got it with a proper Periapsis. I do have the proper dishes on it to connect to Kerbin, but nothing strong enough to contact it back. As I am preparing the maneuver node, I realize I have No Connection to the satellite and cannot control it at all. Fortunately, I had already powered up the dish and pointed it at Kerbin, so with 70 days till my maneuver burn, I knew I needed to upgrade my Kerbin coms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI design a Satellite launcher that will launch my 3 Medium Range ComSats in a polar orbit around 2870 km.

As I switch back to the first sat, it starts spinning out of control even though the engine and RCS is off. My first bout with the KRAKEN!! Needless to say, I have to abort the mission and land (read: crash) the remaining 2 satellites. Apparently, the design I used, despite looking fine at the beginning, had some 1 x 6 solar panels clipping. From reading on the forums, turns out coming out of warp can cause them to function wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign flaw has been fixed and I will hopefully upgrade my network tonight and complete the Sentinel mission as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T14:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Landwalker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Landwalker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EVery fancy.
