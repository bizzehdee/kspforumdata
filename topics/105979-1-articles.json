I have made a space hanger and a Mun mining craft to dock inside the hanger. \n\nThe mining craft has everything you need to mine . It can carry 1200 ore and also has an IRSU converter. It has 2441 m/s of delta-v so it is plenty to go from LKO to the surface of the Mun and back if you re-fuel on the surface.\n\nThe action groups 1 and 2 toggle between the vertical and horizontal thrusters. The thrusters are balanced for full tanks but the centre of mass doesn\u0027t shift much any way and it has SAS to compensate.\n\nHere are some pictures of the mining craft.\n\n![yWAgVri.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yWAgVri.jpg)\n\n![YaLp4Fb.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/YaLp4Fb.jpg)\n\nThe mining vehicle can fit inside the hanger so it is useful to attach to a re-fueling station so you can transport ore back and forth. The Mining craft itself is self sufficient if it is re-fueled using the ore and it also has surplus ore for other re-fueling missions.\n\nHere are some pictures of the hanger.\n\n![nTxzgXD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nTxzgXD.jpg)\n\n![EHjdpqH.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/EHjdpqH.jpg)\n\nHere are some images of my attempts to launch the hanger and dock to my already in orbit station.\n\n[http://imgur.com/a/N1Jnk](http://imgur.com/a/N1Jnk)\n\nHere are the 100% stock craft. The hanger is more of an extra but feel free to take one.
