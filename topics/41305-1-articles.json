Since the latest beta drivers, 3dconnexion gear supports emulating a HID joystick device, which in theory should work fine with all games supporting joystick axis binding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there\u0027s a slight incompatibility (or maybe not so slight) that will have the keen observer notice that all axises bound to a 3d mouse will immediately jump to the left, and stay there, which does not actually help with flying spacecrafts as much as my enthusiasm about my new equipment led me to believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the help of the 3dconnexion forums, I found out that newer HID Joystick devices have signed values for axises with a center point at 0 (and this applies to the 3d mouse also); whereas old joysticks used to go from 0 to 255 only with a center of 127/8. The change was presumably made to support greater precision than 8 bit. (I\u0027ve actually tested KSP with the HOTAS Warthog from TM and it displays the same issues)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI assume that KSP joystick axises start at 0 as well with a axis range of 255. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s Unity itself that is doing the joystick parsing/mapping, or KSP that is not taking newer devices into consideration, but the fix should be fairly simple.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW, under OSX at least you can use ControllerMate to adjust axis values (which I\u0027ve verified to work awesomely fine), but I don\u0027t know of any Windows tools that will do that for me, so I\u0027m stuck with using keyboard emulation ..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully this bit of research helps the devs should they be so inclined to support these awesome devices (and other joysticks). Even just a simple calibration offset configurable in settings.cfg would do fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, I guess one could use the 3DConnexion SDK to natively implement support for the 3d mouse. I suspect it would be really awesome in the SPH or VAB. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E - but I doubt that\u0027s possible with a plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReference: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.3dconnexion.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=36\u0026amp;t=7305\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.3dconnexion.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=36\u0026amp;t=7305\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ghost Leviathan","CreatedById":81855,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T21:03:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just bought the space navigator. any chance you could get some help in setting it up?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainBullet","CreatedById":84676,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-11T08:01:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have one of those things as well, and encounterd the same problems.

The exhaust plume is 3x as large as the kerbal itself - quite funny, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Unimportant feature request: Phyiscal buttons cannot be mapped natively (by setting them to \u0022application defined\u0022 in the driver).

It\u0027s as if the 3D mouse is de-synchronising the camera\u0027s understanding of the scene from the 2D mouse\u0027s reference frame. Perhaps the 3D mouse needs to tell the 2D mouse that despite the 2D mouse not moving, the scene has.
