For example, if I were to post a thread called \u0027Resource mining\u0027 and attach a poll to that asking people if they think Squad should add it, I can predict that 90% of people would probably agree with this, and this goes for any topic. The reason here is that people who aren\u0027t interested in the topic of resource mining will probably not open the thread, much less vote on the poll, which means you\u0027ll end up with the aforementioned skewed results. Because at some point last year this thing was happening a lot, together with all sorts of comments such as: \u0022Squad, look at the poll, 85% of the people want this feature! You need to implement it!\u0022 it was decided to disable polls for this forum.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story short: the polls really don\u0027t represent the general interest fairly, and a good discussion gives a lot more insight into what people want than a quick poll. The thread you linked is of limited use in any case, since Squad plans the updates a long time in advance. In fact, I think most things up until 0.25 at least were planned last year during Kerbalkon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-08T13:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you for the response. makes sense. enjoy your sunday.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
