I had to land there again, it needed to be re-explored. I also think that Eve was improved as well, however I haven\u0027t landed there just yet. I would like to offer the suggestion of a prominent mountain rage on Duna. I\u0027d like to see something like Olympus Mons. It could have a caldera at it\u0027s peak and lava flows at the base. Also the features should be so elevated that you have to land directly inside the caldera or on the mountain to explore it. Having real geography that suggests the natural forces that formed it would be a great way to indicate where resources are on all the planets. Real geography would also be an imputes to explore more of that planet. From the standpoint of the developers I think it would be possible to modify real geologic features by stretching, squashing, masking, and overlaying to create realistic looking extraterrestrial places. I\u0027d also like the ability to name features that I have discovered within my copy of the game. I have provided a topographic map of Olympus Mons to illustrate what I mean. I don\u0027t think we should forget that we paid for these images with out tax dollars, so why not use them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will take you to Wikipedia\u0027s Olympus Mons page. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Olympus_Mons_Topography.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Olympus_Mons_Topography.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-27T01:38:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2013 01:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by edallison655321\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cashen","CreatedById":71281,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T01:48:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDuna and Moho also got new terrain in the last update.

It\u0027s really just a matter of developping those tools and getting things to work, just as the procedural crater generator for the Mun. It will come down the line, although I doubt we will see such a thing as the Olymous Mons. Needless to say that Mars is totally geologically inactive, so there is no Lava or Caldera anymore at the top of that volcano.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-27T04:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou forgot the \u003Cimg src=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003E tag. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"edallison655321","CreatedById":72095,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T01:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI should go check those places out.
