Ok. Apparently not having Blizzy\u0027s tool bar is not an isolated incident for such incidents; I just recently had a similar incident [here](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/95076-1-0-4-FreeEVA-0-5-2?p=2087210\u0026viewfull=1#post2087210) as well.

Thanks!\n\nIs [x] Science cheating? No, I don\u0027t think so. Before I discovered [x] Science, I used to keep track of all bodies/biomes/science gathered in a spreadsheet... which provided me a good at-a-glance view of where I was at, but was a pain in the arse to keep updated. [x] Science does the same thing, for the most part, which makes it easier for me to keep track of such stuff.\n\nDifficulty mode? Well I can\u0027t speak for everyone. I play a Science game. As far as \u0027filters\u0027, I don\u0027t need to see experiments for instruments I don\u0027t yet have ... that just makes clutter in the list, so I hide the unresearched stuff. I find the existing word filter sufficient, where, for example, I can easily review my standing on a selected body like - everything having to do with \u0022Mun\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Z-Key Aerospace","CreatedById":138926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T19:14:32Z","Content":"**[x] Science!

Also both SolarScience experiments.\n\nThe new filter file is called \u0022science.cfg\u0022 and by default it looks like this\n\n    ScienceChecklist{    CelestialBodyFilters    {        dmbiodrillscan = NeedsAtmosphere        HMI = NeedsStar        STEREO = NeedsStar    }}\n\nThe LHS is the \u0022id\u0022 field from the \u0022EXPERIMENT\\_DEFINITION\u0022\n\nThe RHS is the filter.\n\nYou can actually stack filters by adding several separated by commas eg \u0022dmbiodrillscan = NeedsAtmosphere, NeedsOxygen\u0022\n\nFilters can only restrict the scope of experiments, they can\u0027t add extra situations.\n\nThe filters I have provided are\n\n    NeedsAll, AvoidAllNeedsOxygen, AvoidOxygen, NeedsAtmosphere, AvoidAtmosphereNeedsPlanet, AvoidPlanet, NeedsMoon, AvoidMoon, NeedsStar, AvoidStar, NeedsGasGiant, AvoidGasGiantNeedsOcean, AvoidOcean, NeedsSurface, AvoidSurfaceNeedsHomeWorld, AvoidHomeWorld\n\nSo the first 5 letters of each filter are either Needs or Avoid. All the filters come in pairs. I\u0027m hoping this will provide enough flexibility to be going on with.\n\nAny how I\u0027ll test it and hopefully release a new version in a few days.
