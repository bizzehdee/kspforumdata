I have tried to install scatterer , distant object enhancement , and e.v.e.(claimed to work on ksp 1.0.2) and i failed terribly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI install the mods by dragging the gamedata\u0026gt;scatterer folder into the gamedata folder of the ksp directory.

If that is the case, then try installing only one of the mods at a time, and see if they work individually. There might be a conflict between the mods, although I don\u0027t know of conflicts between those 3 mods. If they still don\u0027t work individually, try a fresh KSP install, there might be something wrong with the install you\u0027re using.
