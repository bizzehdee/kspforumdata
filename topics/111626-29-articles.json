You should bring your landers with you and also make sure that no ships already at Dres give your ship fuel or parts.  You can even drop off stuff at Dres if you want but you can\u0027t pick anything up.  Your ship can mine at Dres or the asteroids if it has its own equipment.\n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-30T00:43:43Z","Content":"[@JacobJHC](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/152333-jacobjhc/) [@Thalamask](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/152732-thalamask/) Added a clarification to the grand tour award in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er).
