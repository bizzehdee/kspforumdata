The game was made far more difficult due to the fact that you couldn\u0027t always make the precision adjustments that were needed to stay on course and to preserve precious delta V. Aside from that, the controls were just extremely awkward and difficult to learn in the first place (I put many, many hours into this game and I never felt fully comfortable with the controller). So here is my plea for star theory to please support mouse and keyboard for console ksp 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lewie","CreatedById":203745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-11T22:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuh.
