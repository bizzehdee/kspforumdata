The various ejection settings I\u0027ve tried have usually only imparted spin to the panels, rather than fling them away the way I want.

Since most of the parts in SpaceY are bigger or more advanced parts, it makes sense to have them in 1000-point tech-tree nodes, after the nodes for the 3.75m parts. Prior to 1.0, the stock game had a whole tier of \u0022hidden\u0022 nodes at that level, which would only appear if parts were added to them. This was to help modders put things in sensible places, since the tech tree was hard-coded and couldn\u0027t easily be modified. Though some mods did rewrite the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad touted this new config-driven tech tree as being mod-friendly, but they excluded several of these older experimental/advanced tech nodes, and also made it so that the tree appears to only load once. It\u0027s not flexible like the \u0022agencies\u0022 system that was added, where each mod can add new companies for contracts, new flags, and so on. No, when you try to add additional tech nodes using the new format, it\u0027s ignored. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently ModuleManager can\u0027t make changes to the tech tree either, at least not yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think rather than hold up the entire mod on something that may or may not get fixed, the best choice will probably be to move all of higher-end parts into lower nodes in the tech tree, and at least let people use it. I can always re-assign them later, and thankfully that\u0027s not save-breaking. It just means it\u0027ll be a little silly that the 3.75m and 5m parts all unlock at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I have both SpaceY and MRS starting to look pretty good, but I\u0027m not comfortable releasing them tonight. I had to touch every single part config in these mods, changing attachment nodes (now that they enforce node orientation and all bottom nodes got flipped), adding the parts to cross-section profile groups, adjusting cost, mass, ISP curves, and recalculating thrust on engines since they changed the numbers in the config to represent sea-level thrust instead of vacuum thrust. Maximum temperatures all changed, as well as the heat generation rate of the engines (which I\u0027m just going by stock engines here, I have no idea how fast they\u0027ll actually heat up in practice under various conditions). Some also get custom heat radiating emission values (particularly engines). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s amazing how much the configs changed in this update compared to previous versions. I\u0027m glad I wrote a program to parse the configs and compare the versions, so I could see at a glance what changed. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill the SpaceY parts appear in a new \u0022Size 4\u0022 category?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"billkerbinsky","CreatedById":136995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T02:15:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NecroBones\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NecroBones\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think rather than hold up the entire mod on something that may or may not get fixed, the best choice will probably be to move all of higher-end parts into lower nodes in the tech tree, and at least let people use it.
