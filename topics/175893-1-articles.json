We have, for instance, 64-bit versions of the program, which means RAM limits are less of a problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, what are the problems?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t recommend having less than 8GB RAM. This old machine I bought as an upgrade had 6GB, for arcane reasons,\u00A0 and that didn\u0027t need to Swap to HDD, but I have upgraded. 4GB may still be enough for an un-modded install, but\u00A08GB gives you a margin. Remember the OS and whether you might need to run a web browser to look something up. KSP isn\u0027t bad for memory use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is also pretty light on graphics. I\u0027m still way behind the curve, but hardware prices are still dropping. I am using an nVidia 750 which is fine, but good luck finding a real one. Prices have dropped enough that the current nVidia 1050 is a plausible option for me. For what else I do the 750 is marginal, but it\u0027s OK\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I have seen is that KSP does a huge amount of floating-point math in the CPU for the orbits. And a big craft with a lot of parts is the problem. The old data on this is that Unity didn\u0027t take advantage of multiple cores, it\u00A0just maxed out a single core, and that was the bottleneck\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo can Unity genuinely use multiple CPU cores? If it doesn\u0027t, it makes current benchmark tests rather misleading.(Multiple cores was the answer, I remember being told, but some software still doesn\u0027t take advantage of it, and I know it\u0027s not always easy.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(Arcane reasons: most computers arrange RAM in two channels. This machine uses three, but works with two.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lisias","CreatedById":187168,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-14T11:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe limit is Unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(more) seriously now:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have a embedded GPU, you need to account the KSP needs and the GPU needs. So, in order to support a installment that would run on a 4GB RAM using a discrete 2GB RAM VideoCard, your mainboard needs to have 6GB of RAM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4GB is barely \u00A0enough on a vanilla installment on 1.4.3. Add to it the Mission Builder, and things start to get ugly. My best guess is that KSP 1.4.3 with mission builder should need about 6GB of dedicated RAM for the CPU (so, 8GB of mainboard RAM if your GPU is embedded).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the multicore thing... KSP multithreading model is adequate for the \u0022vanilla\u0022 installment. But once you install mods, they start to \u0022eat\u0022 cpu cycles while building each frame, and this slows down everything. Unity\u0027s Garbage Collector is far from top notch also, and this is the reason of the \u0022stuttering\u0022 that plagues our installments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, KSP spawns a thread/core to each spawned vessel on your universe, so the bottleneck are your biggest vessels. If you have a 1000 parts vessel and 100 vessels with 10 parts, that 100 vessels will be calculated across your multiple cores, but the core handling that\u00A01000 parts beast will delay everything - so, it\u0027s usually better to have fewer really fast cores than many slower ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour GPU is the next bottleneck, but this can be settle up trimming your graphics settings and careful choice of visual enhancements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-14T11:36:01Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2018 11:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Lisias\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E(sigh). typos.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
