I was using the engine thrust tweaks to keep my TWR at around 2 for my lifter stage, but I can\u0027t figure out if there\u0027s any benefit to doing this after your ascent stage? During ascent it\u0027s useful, since high-TWR ascents will just lose out to atmospheric and gravitational drag, but is there any real benefit once you\u0027re in space? Unless I\u0027ve misunderstood how engines work, limiting the thrust isn\u0027t actually going to change the ISP or dV available to you, right? As far as I can tell, the only reasons you\u0027d want to limit thrust is for a more efficient ascent stage, and keeping the CoT in asymmetric rockets in the right place. Is there anything I\u0027m missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, also, something I\u0027ve been meaning to ask for months.. is there any way to make the dark... darker?

I use RemoTech2, and thus have an orbital communications constellation, and the birds in the constellation need their orbits fine tuned now-and-again. Before tweakables, you either needed a very fine hand on the throttle, or RCS, or ion engines. RCS means hauling an additional tank along, and it\u0027s harder to make gross corrections. Ion engines appear late in the tech tree, they mean hauling an additional tank along, and it\u0027s also much harder to make gross corrections. My current design uses a LV-909 and two LV-1R\u0027s. The -909 is used to boost into orbit, and for gross corrections (lowering the peri or raising the apo to \u0027walk\u0027 the bird a large distance to the east or west), and is disabled via right click when not needed. The -1R\u0027s are thrust limited to 10%, and are used for fine tuning the orbits (in the sub meter per second range or correcting their orbital period to the exact second). Both draw from the same pool of fuel, simplifying the vehicle\u0027s design, and both are available fairly low in the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, a special purpose need, but a need none-the-less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T19:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA1: Its useful for balancing rockets; ever tried to build a shuttle?
