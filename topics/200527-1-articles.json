Anyway since KSP2 is still at least a year away and they claim to want to keep supporting KSP1 even after that point I think it\u0027s still highly relevant to request improvements and provide feedback on things that really get on players nerves. Not to say I\u0027ll ever waste another second on KSP1 after KSP2 finally drops but some players still will, not everyone is after the futuristic stuff and not everyone painlessly spends money on games so there will surely be some that stick around for years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m tempted to dump the penalty as well, though it would pain me since I couldn\u0027t then claim to be strictly sticking to the difficulty setting I\u0027ve chosen, there should be some way to take a one time massive reputation penalty for blocking any specific contract type instead. Alternatively just offer a lot more contracts (about 100-200 of them split into multiple tabs) or maybe do a PR campaign through the strategy interface to explosively increase generation of specific contracts while taking a penalty to their profitability.

Personally I like to do tourism contracts and a few more types but it\u0027s not even profitable to send a rocket with just the tourists from a single contract so of course I try to get more of them... I\u0027ve had instances where I spent more time declining other contracts than acually flying the tourists. Not even kidding. This was after trying as hard as possible to drop the recurrence of verything else to rock bottom and raising the tourism contracts as high as possible by never declining any contracts (except the 1% that gets bugged) and I still got dozens of identical \u0022plant a flag on Bill\u0027s\u00A0forehead and take 86000 temperature measurements for each micrometer as he falls from an altitude of 3000 above that one speck of dirt to the left of a tree up the mountan in the distance\u0022 and it\u0027s absolutely maddening.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok, for the part that some contracts never go away, do you mean that you keep getting contracts of the same type, or that the very same contract stays there? in the second case, it could very well be a bug. i read some other bug reports from contracts in the last version. in the first case, ok, we have pinned on something you\u0027d want that would be ok with other players: a possibility to switch off completely some kind of contracts. yes, i agree it would be a good thing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyway, you can also use the alt-f12 debug menu to delete contracts or create new contracts. but it\u0027s harder work, and some may consider it cheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think, though, that you\u0027re using the wrong options for this game: you say that there are very few types of contracts that you like, yet you want to keep playing career. well, the moment i was in a similar situation as you, getting bored by most regular contracts, was the moment i stopped playing career and went looking for more stimulating stuff. career is great to gradually introduce new players to gradual complexity, but once one is experienced, it\u0027s basically the same old stuff over and over. perhaps it is time for you too to make the transition to challenges?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal game lover","CreatedById":210261,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-22T23:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi, I have a problem with the world record breaking contracts.
