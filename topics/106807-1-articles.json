It just does not respect most of the settings.cfg. Audio is at full blast (well, 50%, but it is a loud game to begin with) and scatters are disabled. Interestingly, it runs at the right resolution (and that 1536x1024 resolution is awesome for those like me who like to play windowed on an UXGA monitor), but if I change audio in-game, it plops back to 720p and locks up the UI.\n\nAlso unmodded, also nVidia, also Steam, but Windows 7."},{"CreatedByName":"H2O.","CreatedById":92782,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T06:57:05Z","Content":"Ok, so it is actually weirder than that.
