To know how much, use one of the dV maps. Otherwise, interplanetary flight introduces only a couple of new wrinkles to the transfer burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1st of these is the transfer window (often mistakenly called \u0022launch window\u0022). This one really isn\u0027t \u0022new\u0022 because if you\u0027ve been going to Mun, you\u0027re already familiar with the idea of \u0022burn prograde at Munrise\u0022 to intercept Mun. Same thing here, except because the other planet isn\u0027t orbiting Kerbin, you can\u0027t just go there any day you want. The transfer window is the point in time when Kerbin and the planet you\u0027re going to are aligned so that you need the least dV for the transfer burn. Technically, you can leave any time you want, but most of the time the dV cost is prohibitive so you want to leave on or about the date of the window. Besides, the dV maps assume you\u0027re leaving in the window. Being a few days off either way is no biggie, though, so don\u0027t sweat exactitude on this too much. There are all sorts of tutorials, websites, and mods out there to tell you when transfer windows to the various planets (and from there back to Kerbin) will come around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 2nd new concept is the ejection angle. This is the point on your parking orbit at Kerbin where you place the maneuver node for the transfer burn. Even when you place the node on the transfer window day and give it the right amount of dV, you won\u0027t hit the target unless you put the node in the right place, which is what actually aims you at the other planet. The same resources that tell you when transfer windows come around will also tell you the ejection angle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s pretty much it in a nutshell. Give a look at the various resources other have mentioned and give it a go. It\u0027s not really any harder than going to Mun (and going to Duna requires barely any more dV than going to Minmus).

It cab easily overlooked just how much info they give you. To get a feel for how your position and timing affect your potential encounters, set up a node as a transfer to the altitude of mun or minmus then move the node and note how much the orbit changes and how the prograde/retrograde and radial/anti-radial inputs can change things both in terms of dv input and angles. It starts to make intuitive sense as to when and how to do most things. Then, plan transfers between mun and minmus.

I use 24-hr because otherwise the numbers just get friggin\u0027 huge sometimes \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E. Besides, my brain is wired for 24-hr days and 365-day years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK, then just fill in the boxes. For this example...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* 24-hr days (so we\u0027re speaking the same language)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Origin: Kerbin (leave at default)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Initial Orbit: 100 km (this is your parking orbit at Kerbin, where you wait for the window).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Destination: Duna (leave at default)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Final Orbit: 25km (This is the altitude of the Pe you want when you arrive. 25km is good for aerocapture, maybe... Anyway, this determines how close you come to Duna and will no doubt need to be tweaked a few times en route so don\u0027t worry about it too much).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Check the \u0022No insertion burn\u0022 box because you\u0027ll be aerocapturing. If you don\u0027t check this, the web page will also show you how much dV it will cost to circularize at the destination. Useful for airless places or if you don\u0027t want to risk aerocapture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Earliest Departure: Put in the current game date of your game (here, we\u0027ll use Year 1, Day 250 as an example). This tells the calcaltor where the planets currently are relative to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Transfer Type: Ballistic (default). This means you combine the inclination change with the main burn. If you do it right, this means you don\u0027t have to do a mid-course plane change, which saves a bit of fuel. However, this also complicates setting up the maneuver node manually (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow hit the PLOT IT! button. After a while, you\u0027ll see a graph with lots of colors on it. This is a \u0022porkchop plot\u0022. The horizontal axis is gametime in the future marked in days from the earliest departure date you entered. The vertical axis is time of flight. The areas of colors represent relative amounts of dV required for the transfer burn, which shows the effects of not leaving during a window. Dark blue is the least dV, then on down the ROYGBIV spectrum so that red is the most dV. NOTE: You can click on any spot on the plot to use that point instead of what it picks for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou will see that thin black lines cross near the lower left of the plot in a dark blue area. That is the point of lowest dV coming up in the near future. The text to the right of the plot explains what all this means, as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Departure: Y1 D289 (don\u0027t sweat the time of day), so 39 days from today (which we\u0027re saying is day 250).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Arrival: Y1 D354, when you get to Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Time of Flight: 64 (24-hr) days. Useful if you need to pack life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Phase Angle: This is a function of the departure date. It just says that on that date, the angle between a tangent to Kerbin\u0027s orbit and a line drawn from Kerbin to Dune will be 36.06^. This really isn\u0027t important to know as long as you have the departure date and the dV, but be sure to look at it in the map view when the departure date arrives so you know what it looks like. This will help you eyeball transfer windows in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Ejection Angle: VERY IMPORTANT. This is where you put your maneuver node for the transfer burn. It\u0027s measured from a tangent to Kerbin\u0027s orbit in the direction of its travel around the sun (aka Prograde) clockwise around the night side of Kerbin. In this case, it\u0027s 151^, You\u0027ll have to eyeball this if you don\u0027t have the Protractor or Precise Node mods or some such (MJ\u0027s Maneuver Node Editor). NOTE: Going to Duna, Dres, Jool, and Eeloo, this angle is clockwise around the night side of Kerbin. For trips to Eve and Moho, the angle is counterclockwise around the day side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Ejection dV: VERY IMPORTANT. This is the total dV for the transfer burn, 1064m/s in this case. But remember, we said we\u0027d do this ballistic, so to set up the node, you have to break this down into prograde and vertical components. Fortunately, the web page does this for you if you hit the blue \u0022i\u0022 button here, which shows 1058.7m/s prograde and 105.6m/s normal up. Now, when you create a node, it only shows the total amount of dV for all components so unless you have a mod like Precise Node that lets you enter in values for each component seperately, you\u0027ll have to do this in 2 steps. First pull the prograde handle until you have the 1058.7m/s showing, then carefully nudge the normal up until the total dV shows 1064. If you have placed the node at the correct ejection angle on the correct calendar day, then you should have the Duna encounter you want. But probably you won\u0027t quite have it, so you can slide the node a bit forwards and backwards on your orbit, and/or tweak the node handles until you get the encounter. Or you can just get close enough for government work and do a mid-course tweak later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that, you just do the burn. And if that\u0027s all the fuel you\u0027ll take, you\u0027ll stay there. If you\u0027re interested in coming back, you can repeat the process but start at Duna and head to Kerbin, set for a date after your arrival date. In this case, I\u0027d leave Duna on Y2 D136 and arrive back at Kerbin Y2 D211, for a total time away of 287 (24-hr) days, which matters if you use life support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that\u0027s how to set up an interplanetary transfer node but there are a few difficulties with actually doing it, unless you use mods. The biggest issue is having to warp ahead and stop before passing the window. This is where Kerbal Alarm Clock is wonderful. So you put your ship in the 100km parking orbit, set an alarm for about 15 minutes before you want to leave, go into the tracking center, and warp full blast until the alarm stops the warp. Now your ship is about 3/4 of an orbit from when it will burn, which gives you plenty of time to create the node by hand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now you\u0027re at the right calendar day to do the burn, but you have to make the node, and the biggest problem there is eyeballing the ejection angle. Protractor will take the guesswork out of that, as will (IIRC) Precise Node, and certainly MJ\u0027s Maneuver Node Editor. Then add the dV to match what you got from the web page. Again, being able to enter exact numbers for each component via Precise Node or MJ is a big help compared to pulling and scrolling node handles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to set up the node, however, is to use MJ\u0027s \u0022Advanced Transfer to Another Planet\u0022 function. The cool thing here is that it lets you create the node at exactly the right ejection angle months in advance of actually using it, so there\u0027s no last-minute pressure to get the node set up in the 15 minutes you have before your ship gets to it if you do it all manually as above. First, set your target planet, then open MJ\u0027s ATTAP function. It will display the same porkchop plot you see on the webpage. Zoom in and pick the darkest blue spot you can find, click there, and hit the \u0022Create Node\u0022 button. Voila, you now have a node set for the correct date and time, at the correct ejection angle, and with the correct dV in both components. You can now create an alarm for this in Kerbal Alarm Clock (say 15 minutes prior to the burn) and warp there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: In this case, you\u0027re just using MJ to create the node. You still have the option of doing the burn manually or letting MJ\u0027s autopilot do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when you create the node so far in advance, it won\u0027t still be perfectly accurate come the actual departure day. So you can now use the 15 minutes you have to tweak the node\u0027s handles manually to get it back where you want it. And if you notice it says \u0022Burn Time: N/A\u0022, you\u0027ll have to run the engines briefly so KSP can remember your TWR. If you need to do that, do it before tweaking the node because that will also screw it up slightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, that\u0027s about all there is to it.

You may need to do a few orbits for a better phase match, but in case of interplanetary transfers orbits are not under an hour, but of order of a year.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, my mission to Eve has the trajectory to capture by Eve all drafted, except it will happen in about 1,5 Kerbin years. The extra burn was really nothing much. Now if I wanted the same without waiting that long, the burn would be huge. (and in this case two things help: 1. Placing \u0022dummy\u0022 (no speed change) maneuver nodes far ahead in your path to see where you will be in relation to the planet one orbit from now, and 2. getting\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lYrTuLYtiQE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.

Your burn time isn\u0027t instantaneous, so your ejection angle isn\u0027t going to be exact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The easy way to do it is to set a maneuver node approximately correctly and just slide it around until you get an intercept solution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Once you\u0027ve completed the ejection burn, you can fine-tune your prograde/ retrograde for a tighter solution. You can save the normal and radial burns for when you\u0027re halfway there (what we call the midcourse correction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Personally, I think getting the phase angle right is far more important. I do that by keeping a small probe just outside Kerbin\u0027s SoI and using it\u0027s maneuver nodes to generate an intercept.
