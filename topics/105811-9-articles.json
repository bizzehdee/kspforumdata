It\u0027s entirely possible to cheat, as the game makes absolutely zero effort to actively prevent cheating, which is the correct implementation for this type of game. The game does enforce certain things, but that is never primarily to prevent cheating, it is all about making the game mechanics work for those who are not actively seeking to cheat. It is entirely your responsibility to avoid cheating if you want to honestly claim that anything you have done is \u0022no cheats involved\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s actually nothing wrong with cheating in this type of game. There is absolutely no competitive element, no reward (other than satisfaction), no advantage gained. Cheating in the real world is wrong and dishonest most of the time, and very often shows poor ethical and moral character traits. Cheating in virtual worlds, where you are gaining nothing of substance from another participant in the virtual world, it\u0027s neither ethically or morally wrong, but it is still cheating. Cheating in a virtual world, then denying that you have cheated, that is either delusional or dishonest (and if it\u0027s dishonest, then it\u0027s basically as bad in terms of character flaws as cheating in the real world, as the dishonesty is in the real world and not in the virtual world).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am proud to say that I routinely cheat in all games of this type, when I feel like it. I always openly admit when I have cheated, which entirely satisfies my morals and ethics. I reckon that probably more than 90% of people playing this game probably cheat on a regular basis (the nature and extent will vary), and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that (just don\u0027t ever deny it). Equally, I enforce rules on myself and avoid cheats when I want to actually enjoy the feeling of satisfaction from having truly achieved something. Even when enforcing rules, there can still be entirely acceptable cheats (which are still cheats, despite being quite acceptable), such as to deal with broken or flawed game mechanics. There are grey areas on the boundary between cheating and not cheating, but many other things are clearly cheating or clearly not cheating.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T11:36:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 11:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DuoDex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T10:47:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow.

Hopefully Squad can see the issue, and the complete UI rewrite in 1.1 for Unity 5 will improve it significantly.
