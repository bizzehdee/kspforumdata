It\u0027s entirely possible to cheat, as the game makes absolutely zero effort to actively prevent cheating, which is the correct implementation for this type of game. The game does enforce certain things, but that is never primarily to prevent cheating, it is all about making the game mechanics work for those who are not actively seeking to cheat. It is entirely your responsibility to avoid cheating if you want to honestly claim that anything you have done is \u0022no cheats involved\u0022.\n\nThere\u0027s actually nothing wrong with cheating in this type of game. There is absolutely no competitive element, no reward (other than satisfaction), no advantage gained. Cheating in the real world is wrong and dishonest most of the time, and very often shows poor ethical and moral character traits. Cheating in virtual worlds, where you are gaining nothing of substance from another participant in the virtual world, it\u0027s neither ethically or morally wrong, but it is still cheating. Cheating in a virtual world, then denying that you have cheated, that is either delusional or dishonest (and if it\u0027s dishonest, then it\u0027s basically as bad in terms of character flaws as cheating in the real world, as the dishonesty is in the real world and not in the virtual world).\n\nI am proud to say that I routinely cheat in all games of this type, when I feel like it. I always openly admit when I have cheated, which entirely satisfies my morals and ethics. I reckon that probably more than 90% of people playing this game probably cheat on a regular basis (the nature and extent will vary), and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that (just don\u0027t ever deny it). Equally, I enforce rules on myself and avoid cheats when I want to actually enjoy the feeling of satisfaction from having truly achieved something. Even when enforcing rules, there can still be entirely acceptable cheats (which are still cheats, despite being quite acceptable), such as to deal with broken or flawed game mechanics. There are grey areas on the boundary between cheating and not cheating, but many other things are clearly cheating or clearly not cheating.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T11:36:16Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 11:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DuoDex**"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T10:47:12Z","Content":"Wow.

It is not a negative thing at all, only denying it is negative.

Is it possible?\n\nNo, it\u0027s not possible right now, at least not in stock. The experiment results UI is really the problem, it\u0027s no longer fit for purpose in the new context of labs taking possibly game years to get through their work. Hopefully Squad can see the issue, and the complete UI rewrite in 1.1 for Unity 5 will improve it significantly. In a nutshell, the problem is a mix of the slow rate of the lab research combined with the reasonable expectation to have something like an orbital lab which processes experiments from that orbit and the surface below, before the experiments are returned to Kerbin. There\u0027s just no way to extract already processed experiment results for return to Kerbin. It\u0027s also impossible to actually properly see what you\u0027ve got stored there, once there\u0027s more than about 10 results, as it\u0027s too difficult a memory exercise while paging through them to answer questions such as \u0022which biome(s) is/are missing?\u0022 or \u0022how much unprocessed science do I have left?\u0022.\n\nWe strongly need a list type UI that lets us see at a glance the complete set of experiment results stored there, with indicators for which have been processed, which have return-to-Kerbin science available, which have transmit science available, etc. That list type UI would be the obvious thing for \u0022take individual result\u0022, \u0022take all processed results\u0022, \u0022take all results with return value\u0022, \u0022transmit all results with transmit value\u0022, etc."},{"CreatedByName":"DarkGravity","CreatedById":143383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T15:56:48Z","Content":"I\u0027d settle for \u0022Take this one result?

Any more than about 10 results, and a forced one click per result and one result per \u0022page\u0022 is a dreadful interface. So, even if you happened to think that 50 is unreasonable (I don\u0027t, but someone might), it\u0027s the same problem with 20 results (and I struggle to see how anyone would think of 20 as being unreasonable)."},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:13:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d settle for \u0022Take this one result?
