I wonder if anyone has thought of using the output of a fuel cell for the propellant of an ion engine. Interesting discussion.\n\nThat depends on how good fuel cells are for supplying power to electric drives IRL. Water is a bad propellant for electric drives, so it only makes sense if fuel cells are so mass efficient that your total dV with fuel cells \u002B bad propellant is better than \u003Cother power=\u0022\u0022 source=\u0022\u0022\u003E \u002B good propellant.\u003C/other\u003E\n\nMy gut feeling says: this is several orders of magnitude away from making sense. Googling power to weight ratios, it would seem like space grade solar panels are in the neighborhood of 100 W/kg right now, whereas fuel cells are around 1000 - 1500 W/kg. That sounds favorable until you realize that that is the fuel cell without any fuel, which would add extra mass (both from the fuel itself, as well as from the tankage required). And the weight of the fuel generally dominates the weight of the cell by a significant margin. Also, the power production equipment is only one part of a spacecraft\u0027s total mass, but the engine Isp matters for the entire craft."},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T14:36:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That depends on how good fuel cells are for supplying power to electric drives IRL.
