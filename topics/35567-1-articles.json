Start with a really freakin\u0027 heavy booster stage that can push that thing most of the way to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. Add a landing stage to your base with either engines with a \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E far vectoring range, or with a decent amount of attitude RCS (no real need to translation though). I\u0027ve got a ludicrously inefficient heavy booster stage that has still served me well. My base was really heavy, so I had to bring my fuel tug from my Kerbin/M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn halfway station to top it off a bit to get it landed successfully, but it still got to high orbit just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the key points were:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Have fuel lines from the outside tanks replenishing the middle tank, so you use up the heavy outer boosters down low in Kerbin\u0027s gravity when you need it most, and then ditch them, but continue on a completely full central tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Some separation motors aren\u0027t necessary, but helped. I don\u0027t lose tail fins or knock engines loose anymore, ever since I added those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Small tanks in between the big orange Rockmax tank and the Mainsail, for better heat dissipation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * Struts between the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E * And the most recent change that worked amazingly: Bind the outer boosters to an action group that toggles the engine gimballing. Keep the outer boosters\u0027 gimbals locked unless you really need it, and you\u0027ll wobble a lot less.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can send you the craft file if that appeals at all.
