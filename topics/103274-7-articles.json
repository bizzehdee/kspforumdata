One is that the only thing happening within these HypeTrains is people expressing their excitement, mostly with either very large images or with spam-like posts. Most of the reason the KSP forums are so great is \u003Cem\u003Eprecisely because so few people \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enormally\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E leave spam-like posts, gratuitous large images, or other wastes of bandwidth\u003C/em\u003E. Thus, the HypeTrain is both worrisome and a bit unwholesome for the Forum as a whole. (Not even to mention the many, many times that the Forums have crashed as a result of this behavior.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second reason is that I\u0027m not very happy about this next release being called \u00271.0.\u0027 I personally am of the opinion that another beta version would have been extremely nice, and that 1.0 will be unpleasantly buggy. This will not only be negative for long-time KSP players, but it will also be downright painful for new players who are unaccustomed to the bugs and who want a better game. I kinda wanted this update to be a sort of 0.99 update that allowed the community to iron out bugs, but alas, it was not to be. So that takes a lot of the excitement (and adds a lot of worry) to the coming update. I really can\u0027t get hyped about 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this HypeTrain isn\u0027t for me.

What I\u0027m not fine with, however, is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I think that no matter how excited someone is, there are far, \u003Cem\u003Efar\u003C/em\u003E better ways of expressing excitement than this. If it was done on any other thread, it would be removed by a moderator. It really shouldn\u0027t be tolerated here, either. And while I know that a fair fraction of the posts here aren\u0027t this way, there are also an embarrassing number of them that look \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, to re-iterate:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m not grumpy that you guys are excited.\u003C/strong\u003E I do want to see 1.0 come out too, and I\u0027ll probably be up late into the night trying to download it when it first comes out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m grumpy because I feel like this thread is the Forum equivalent of a \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Elot\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E of graffiti sprayed near my house.\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s not actually dangerous and it doesn\u0027t do much harm, but it\u0027s unpleasant to be around for all of the people who don\u0027t want to spread graffiti. Which, in this case, is actually a surprising amount of people! You just don\u0027t hear from them as much, because they\u0027re not posting once every thirty seconds to \u0027spread Hype.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...oh, and in case you\u0027re saying, \u0022Well, then just don\u0027t look at it! The Forum is a big place, and there are many other threads to look at.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to remind people that for up to a week before the update comes out, the HypeTrain has caused the Forum to overload and stopped anyone from viewing or posting anything, in all parts of the Forum. Sure, these outages haven\u0027t been so bad, but it does annoy me that they are more-or-less entirely pointless, and could easily be avoided if people were even \u003Cem\u003Eslightly\u003C/em\u003E more restrained. And I know for a fact that it\u0027s possible to breathe in and out a few times and control your excitement (or other emotions) before posting. This is a far better way to \u0027vent your excitement\u0027 than creating a Hype Train, both for yourself and for the KSP community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this is just my two cents. If you\u0027re wondering why I\u0027m posting this here, it\u0027s because I\u0027m hoping that people actually read it and maybe even approach this thread in a slightly different way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading through this.
