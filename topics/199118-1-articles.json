I believe he is lying to conceal some form of mental illness. Since I know of no song\u00A0where any human loudly says \u0022Beep!\u0022 or \u0022Whoa!\u0022 on a regular basis...though I am sure Kerbaloid will try find it if one even exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI almost think for him it\u0027s a way to announce his presence so people can acknowledge him or speak to him when he walks past, since he once said \u0022Beep!\u0022 And then my name. After that was when I asked him why, to which he gave a lame excuse as far as I am concerned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe also does not seem to understand social hints. Like if someone is curt with him on the regular, he will still seek them out and try to engage in conversation when it is obvious they do not wish to be bothered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone diagnose his apparent illness so I can understand how better to deal with him as opposed to me just seeing him as annoying.

that (unintentionally) annoys B.\u00A0 B wants to make it clear he\u0027s not happy about that, so he \u0022acts annoyed\u0022 with A (facial expression, body language, tone of voice, etc.), and assumes that A will \u0022get the message\u0022 and knock it off.\u00A0 A, on the other hand, totally doesn\u0027t pick up on any of the \u0022I\u0027m annoyed\u0022 signals, and keeps on doing whatever-it-is, under the mistaken impression that they\u0027re having a normal friendly interaction and that B is interested.\u00A0 This goes on until B can\u0027t stand it any longer and then blows up angrily at A.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn such a situation, what\u0027s going on in B\u0027s head is probably something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen A starts the behavior:\u00A0 \u0022Gosh, that\u0027s obnoxious.\u00A0 He must know that would be annoying to anyone, but he clearly doesn\u0027t care, so he must be a rude jerk.\u00A0 I\u0027m annoyed

doesn\u0027t say anything:\u00A0 \u0022Oh hey, he\u0027s listening!\u00A0 I should keep talking, this is great!\u00A0 We\u0027re having a nice discussion.\u0022\u00A0 (Totally misses B\u0027s

he\u0027s exploding at me for no reason!\u00A0 What a rude, obnoxious jerk!\u0022\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd afterwards... if someone tried to explain to B that A just didn\u0027t realize he was annoyed, B might react with disbelief-- \u0022Oh come on, I was being \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eso\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E obvious about it, no one could possibly miss\u00A0 that signal.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if someone explained to A that B had been annoyed all along and was somehow \u0022sending secret signals\u0022 that he was annoyed, A\u0027s reaction might be frustration, along the lines of \u0022Well, if he didn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elike\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it, why the heck didn\u0027t he

the most part, \u0022just take it in stride\u0022 would be my advice.\u00A0 Presumably he is the way he is because he likely can\u0027t help it.\u00A0 If he does this kind of thing routinely, I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if he is on the receiving end of social ostracism, which I could easily imagine causing a lot of unhappiness and anxiety-- which, in turn, might express itself in stimulating such behavior.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo \u0022just cope and don\u0027t make a big deal of it\u0022 would be my suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf he

is to be \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Every verbally explicit\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Folks on the autism spectrum tend to miss nonverbal cues, and they tend to interpret what you say \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Every literally\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 For example, if something bad happens and you say with exaggerated sarcasm \u0022Oh, great!\u0022 ... they might think you\u0027re expressing \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eapproval\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, since being \u0022great\u0022 is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egood\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E thing, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, just be very literal, and say things in literal words.\u00A0 If he\u0027s annoying you about something, just come right out and say \u0022I really don\u0027t
