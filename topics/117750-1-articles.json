It\u0027s important to have something real to show for your hard work. \n\n Or, sit down and try to plan a complex mission in sandbox. Have you visited every planet and returned? If not, try it.

Personally, I have been on and off this game more than a couple of times these last 4 years, and each time I come back and get thoroughly entertained for many tens of hours. \n\nA couple of suggestions that might help. \n\n**1.** Remove most mods you have/use and focus on a particular one that has an overarching theme. Two strong contenders for that are imo the USI mods and BTSM respectively. I have found out that after some time playing around with the game modded, I tend to NOT play the game but just browse/update/change/look at different mods to \\*start a new game session\\*. Which never starts really at that point. You talk about the game, you engage in discussions about it, you watch/read other people playing it and you...don\u0027t play it. \n\n**2.** Another example would be to change your gameworld significantly (by playing RSS or installing the OTM mod), but still keep your number of mods (especially part mods) down to a minimum. \n\n**3.** Go play something else. There are tons of very entertaining games out there, there is really no reason to keep playing a single one (especially if you are bored doing it atm). \n\n**4.** Take a break from gaming and do something else. Pretty straightforward really, the best way to change a situation that does not make you content is to...simply change it. \n\nHope that helps, cheers..C:\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-06T22:04:16Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2015 10:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dante80**"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-06T22:02:42Z","Content":"200p hours is a lot of time.
