Even with no connection to the space center and with hibernation on, I can still fully control probes; additionally, I can control a capsule with no crew aboard. This really annoys me, and I\u0027ve even set the difficulty so that partial control of probes is impossible without a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E connection. Alas, the glitch persists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a list of the mods I\u0027ve got installed.
