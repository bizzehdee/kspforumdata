I was wondering. Considering there is a lot of strut heads (broken struts between stages from the launches), would that help alleviate the lag, if I used KAS to remove them one by one?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-08T16:51:48Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2014 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sokar408\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T16:41:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImpressive structure\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T18:04:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m curious to see the launchers and how you constructed it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sokar408","CreatedById":75557,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-09T02:36:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m curious to see the launchers and how you constructed it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey were really quite simple, with the new 3.75m parts. Basically the payload would sit on a Procedural Fairing base, and under that i\u0027d put a single mid sized 3.75m tank with that glorious single nozzle 3.75m engine. Under that I\u0027d put 2 large 3.75m tanks and the \u0022new\u0022 3.75 Mainsail. On the sides I\u0027d add 6 SRB\u0027s from KW rocketry, the largest ones, and that would pretty much get any payload into LKO.
