My fps drop dramatically (down to 2fps) when flying large ships. I am now building a modular Duna mothership (with 6 landers), 180t vessel made of 200 parts. It is unflyable, even in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running KSP on Lenovo Z500 laptop. I know laptops aren\u0027t great, and that having multiple cores instead of one powerful core isn\u0027t good for KSP too, but still, what can be done about it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, you\u0027d say 1) buy better pc; 2) reduce part count;, but I already made this vessel of as few parts as possible. Better computer is not an option at this time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI already edited config to do that physics-fps trick, and reduced orbit debris to a minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat else can be done?
