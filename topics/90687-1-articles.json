We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve now got interiors for each new level of the SPH and VAB, and I got the game to load the correct interior scene for the correct level of the correct editor. The decision to merge the editor scenes into one and split the scenery into other scenes that are loaded additively was a very good one, indeed. This was only done at first to not require us to maintain two mostly identical scenes updated through the overhaul, but when it was time to implement loading different interior sceneries for each level of the SPH or VAB, the merged scene implementation made life a LOT easier. What more, because each interior lives in its own scene, memory usage is very efficient. We only need to load the data for the interior we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to display. The rest is sitting pretty on file until called for (and unneeded data is unloaded also). The scenery setup is also done in such a way that any facilities you can see out the door of the construction buildings is also updated, so it shows up at the right level and correct state of repair. If you smash your level 1 mission control building and then move into the SPH, you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll get to see the smashed up level 1.MC building from the open doorway, regardless of the level of the SPH or any other external factors. Unless of course, the SPH is also destroyed, in which case you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even enter it, let alone view anything out of a doorway that no longer exists\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Apart from interior scenes and their scenery, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also got the interior backdrops for the not-so-3D facilities working and switching based on facility level. The Astronaut Complex, Administration, R\u0026amp;D (archives) and Mission Control facilities now each have multiple interior images, which are used depending on the level of the facility. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also done a few tweaks to the VAB and SPH cameras, to make them respect the bounds set up by the interiors. A small VAB or SPH doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t give you as much room to scroll about as the larger levels do, so we needed a way to have the cameras stay within the bounds of each interior. That\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s taken care of as well.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Next up is the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153business end\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 of the whole system, and hopefully one of the last big steps required on it: Actually implementing the gameplay effects of facility upgrades. So far, we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got a nice and functional system where facilities can be upgraded, destroyed, saved and loaded and see their internal and external meshes change as a function of that, plus the UI to perform the upgrades and all that, but all this would be for naught if there were no gameplay effect in upgrading facilities. This was something we gave a LOT of thought to. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s one of the oldest planned features, so there were mentions of possible upgrade effects even in the earliest design notes, from almost 4 years ago. I went through all of those, remembering the best ideas from back then, and sorting out the good ones from those that became obsolete as the game evolved. We now have a list of several effects for upgrading facilities, which affect many different aspects of the game, IMO, in very significant ways. More on this as it develops though.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Alex (aLeXmOrA):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Last week I discovered and fixed an internal issue with our KSP Store website. I also dealt with some accounting transactions here at Squad HQ. Now, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m going to update my local project of the game, so I can catch up with the development. .\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Mike (Mu):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; I have been working on the kerbal experience traits and effects.

First of all, it has to make sense. Things shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t just blow up \u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A0 la Michael Bay, i.e. just because. There has to be a reason why something blows up. Based on that reason, it exerts the amount of fire, smoke and overall awesomeness we can expect from it. One more technical requirement for these FX is that they must serve as a curtain to perform the old switcharoo with the building models. There is a transition between the normal building and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s wrecked counterpart. One that is\u2026er\u2026quite obvious, so we have to create a literal smoke screen in order to make it less notorious.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;As of today I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m back with the building markers.

Basically it works like this: When you have set up one or more custom categories in the toolbar, a \u2018\u002B\u2019 button will appear on each part icon. Click it to open a popup where you can select which custom category to drop it in. The feature has not been tested out yet but I\u2019m pretty sure it will become more popular than the previously implemented feature, which works much the same as subassemblies.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;In other news, I got the new computer delivered late last week and I\u2019ve been spending some time getting everything set up on it.

A notable one is that the Mk3 fuselage parts are named \u201CRocket Fuel\u201D instead of \u201CLF\u002BO\u201D, so I\u2019ve renamed the Mk2 parts to align with that and the Mk1 Fuselage is also renamed to Mk1 Liquid Fuel Fuselage.

I went through all of those, remembering the best ideas from back then, and sorting out the good ones from those that became obsolete as the game evolved. We now have a list of several effects for upgrading facilities, which affect many different aspects of the game, IMO, in very significant ways.
