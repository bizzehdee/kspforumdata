It has some issues with desktop integration, but the outstanding performance, the stability, and the fact that it eats pretty much any shader code, no matter how wrong it is, make up for this easily. The lack of desktop integration can get annoying if one switches monitor configuration (I mean: number of active screens, relative position of screens,...) frequently, as it requires you to restart the X11 server, but for a static screen configuration it really doesn\u0027t matter, as one only configures the screens once. It\u0027s the driver with the biggest number of working games.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe second rank goes to the open source drivers for AMD and Intel. They are reasonably stable and have excellent desktop integration. Nevertheless both drivers are less performant than proprietary drivers for the same hardware (for Intel that means: less performant than the Windows drivers, as there are no proprietary drivers available for Linux). In the case of AMD the performance difference depends on the game being run, but an educated guess would be, that the open source drivers give about 2/3 of the proprietary driver performance. Also, the open source drivers are at the moment only OpenGL 3.3 compatible, what means that some games will not run with them yet. Furthermore, they are quite a bit more strict regarding proper shader code than the proprietary nVidia drivers. As many developers use nVidia (for obvious reasons), it happens rather frequently, that games ship with incorrect (meaning: not conforming to the GLSL standard) shader code which will fail to run on any but the nVidia drivers.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThen there\u0027s a long empty space...\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe second last rank goes to the (edit: legacy) proprietary AMD drivers. While there have been many improvements, and there are a lot of improvements planned, they are (still) a piece of *beep* and should in my opinion be killed with fire. Honestly: They might meanwhile have good (aka. comparable to nVidia) performance, but there are many, many bugs regarding desktop integration. Where the lack of desktop integration with nVidia means that you might have to restart your session if you plug a second monitor, with AMD it means that if there\u0027s a discrepancy between the screen configuration as set in the cataclyst control center and the desktops screen configuration: BOOM. Not immediately though, that would be to easy. No, everything will seem to be running fine. Until a few days later you\u0027ll try to play a certain game, and suddenly strange shapes will start to appear everywhere. Or, you might want to watch a video, that for strange reasons causes flickering colours somewhere outside of the video player window... Such issues can afaik only be fixed by deleting the /etc/ati folder and reinstalling the driver... Also, while this driver is a little bit more tolerant regarding errors in shader code than the open source drivers, it\u0027s not as tolerant as nVidia, so basically it can lead to the same problems as the open source drivers.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLast rank in this list goes to the open source drivers for nVidia. While they still are much more stable than the proprietary AMD drivers (what\u0027s not very difficult), simply performance is somewhere between very low and nonexistent. They are good enough to display a GUI for installing the proprietary nVidia drivers, but sadly that\u0027s basically all they are good for at the moment.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EUpdate, 2017-02-19\u003C/strong\u003E: Some things have changed meanwhile, and I\u0027d like to give a short update.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFirst of all, the old, proprietary AMD drivers (fglrx) are no longer relevant, except for really old hardware and exotic use cases.

For those who need OpenGL compatibility contexts or OpenCL 2.0 (if you don\u0027t know what that means, you don\u0027t need it), AMD has published a new semi-proprietary driver called \u003Ca href=\u0022https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Radeon-GPU-PRO-Linux-Beta-Driver%E2%80%93Release-Notes.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAMD GPU-Pro\u003C/a\u003E (not to be confused with AMDGPU, what is the name for the kernel module used by all AMD drivers for GCN 1.2 hardware and newer), which offers those APIs, but typically (with a few exceptions, I only know of Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and Bioshock Infinite) delivers lower performance than the current AMD open source driver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyhow, nVidia proprietary drivers are still definitely the fastest, but the AMD open source drivers are quickly catching up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s Vulkan, a new low level graphics API that might become important in the future. The proprietary nVidia drivers and AMD GPU-Pro both ship a well working Vulkan implementation, and Intel released an open source Vulkan driver as well. While AMD promised to release an open source Vulkan driver at some point, that has not happened yet. Luckily, the community (mostly Bas Nieuwenhuizen and Dave Airlie) stepped in, and now there also is a quite functional (but not yet complete, and also not yet as fast as it should be) open source AMD Vulkan driver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-19T13:25:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/19/2017 01:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 19, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by soulsource\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EUpdate some information\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-23T15:24:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed.
