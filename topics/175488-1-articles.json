The videos move too quickly for me to determine what mods he is using...and how he is doing things, like putting fuel tanks inside the girders he is using. It\u0027s obviously not stock parts.\u00A0I have messaged him for info but no reply, as yet. Is anyone familiar with these video tutorials?

I have \u0022near future construction\u0022 as a mod but I think I need more \u0022stuff\u0022. I\u0027m not seeing how he adds fuel tanks inside the girders, as a start? I can\u0027t tell if I need more \u0022near future\u0022 mods to do what he is doing. I realize why he does the video at X2.5 speed...but it makes it hard for me to see what exactly he\u0027s doing as he constructs this station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny guidance is, as always, greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-31T00:03:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHis modlist is in the description of the video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-31T00:19:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHMMmmm...\u003Cu\u003EWAY\u003C/u\u003E too many mods for me, in that list. \u003Cs\u003ENever mind, I\u0027ll build mine some other way.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-02T22:53:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2018 10:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by strider3\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-02T22:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about I narrow down what I want to be able to do?
