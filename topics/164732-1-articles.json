I have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, and it works greats, but it\u0027s boring on places without atmospheres, and scatterer destroys my computer. Astronomer\u0027s visual pack turns my computer into lava, and pretty much there isn\u0027t a good visual mod that I can run well besides \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E. Stock looks fine, but it just isn\u0027t that beautiful compared to with visual mods. So is there a good visual mod that a mid-end computer can run well, that also provides a good amount of visuals?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-23T22:38:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/151190-13sci-fi-visual-enchancements-v-13-high-performance-alt-to-sve/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003ESci-Fi Visual Enhancements\u003C/a\u003E or \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150386-12-para-sci-high-performance-atmosphere-pack-v11-27-october-2016/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EPara-Sci High-Performance Atmosphere Pack\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrChumley","CreatedById":58555,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-28T19:59:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy must have visual mod that takes up the least memory award goes to:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/89214-130-distant-object-enhancement-bis-v191-8-july-2017/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EDistant object enhancement bis\u003C/a\u003E it adds dots of light to see planets from far far away.
