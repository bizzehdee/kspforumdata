It seems if you test moving parts that are attached to other parts, sometimes the parts get out of alignment.\u00A0 Notice the big gaps between the feet and legs of my crawler, as well as the big gaps between sections.\u00A0 I\u0027ve snapped those back into place half a dozen times already and they get discombobulated when I do a test playthrough on the controller.\u00A0 It seems KSP is trying and not always succeeding in trying to figure out where parts that have moved should now go once things have stopped moving.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, has anyone else notice that sometimes\u00A0parts you have put into the controller seem to suddenly vanish out of the controller?\u00A0 You may have set up the controller to run 5 pistons, and suddenly 2 are missing.\u00A0 This might be only an issue in Making History.
