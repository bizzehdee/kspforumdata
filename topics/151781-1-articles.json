I\u0027ve made a model in Blender, UV-mapped it with textures, imported into Unity editor and it seems more or less reasonable there. The way it is textured is far from perfect but I\u0027d rather leave it for later. But when I attach this part in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E editor, it looks weird - lower part of flap has texture only when looked from below. Sides and upper surface\u00A0are transparent. I tried to recreate faces and re-texture them and it has no effect.

But if the face is inverted shouldn\u0027t it be seen from inside? This is not the case either. I know about flipped faces and they are being highlighted like that that has correct texture, but what is flipped UV?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whale_2","CreatedById":167015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-10T12:28:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I learned how to drop UV-map and redone it from scratch, now it looks like it should.
