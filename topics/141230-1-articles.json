If I start up a new sandbox game, everything works fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027ve been working on a save and I\u0027ve got a remote-tech network up and everything and I don\u0027t want to lose it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe issue is that when I load the save, it goes to the KSC view, and I can\u0027t enter the VAB, SPH, or tracking center. I CAN enter the research or astronaut screens, but can NOT exit them via the top right red button. I CAN open the menu using the escape key, but I CANNOT quit to main menu or save the game.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s super weird. I know it\u0027s not input lock. I can\u0027t figure out what could have broken it either. I had installed the kerbal R\u0026amp;D mod, but I tried removing it and my save was still broken. I have no idea what happened or how I can fix it and I am super sad because I had just brought back a huge haul of science from the Mun.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy game is heavily modded with 60\u002B mods, so I\u0027m really just shooting for the Mun here and hoping someone else has had this issue and already knows how I can fix it, because it\u0027s probably not worth the trouble of doing a full-investigation into the logs \u0026amp; mods. I can provide logs if anyone thinks it will help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
