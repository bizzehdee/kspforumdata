Now you need an intercept. Unless you are already close enough for direct burns to be useful (5 km or lower) you need to use orbital mechanics to get closer. Orbital mechanics are a little counter intuitive for a neophyte.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs your target ahead of you? You need to slow down. Slowing down will lower your Pe (low point of orbit).

You need to speed up. Accelerating will raise your Ap (high point of orbit).

The more you change the orbit, the more you close/open distance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t stress how important it is to learn the jargon. Once you start understanding the concepts you can do really fun stuff. For example, I never need to match orbits before rendezvous. From any orbit, I can crash my ship into another with just two burns in one orbit! With a third, I can rendezvous instead of crash.
