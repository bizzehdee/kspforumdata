Sorry to hear that. Not much you can do to get the game back to the way it was. A few people have posted some \u0022workarounds,\u0022 but they haven\u0027t worked for me.\u00A0The game probably never should have been released in it\u0027s current state, and they are scrambling to find a fix. It is\u00A0two months after release and we are still pretty clueless as to when a fix is actually coming.
