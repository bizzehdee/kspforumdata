But if \u003Cem\u003Ethree \u003C/em\u003Esource masses are allowed (and one test mass) then the principle could be tested. Simply arrange the three sources in an equilateral triangle that rotates in its plane just enough to maintain stability. Then \u201Cdrop\u201D the test mass from any height over (or under) the triangle\u2019s plane, perpendicular to its center.

Plan A is simply that the idea of doing the experiment has been on the books at least since Galileo proposed it in 1632. It is routinely discussed in hundreds or thousands of modern articles, books, and physics classrooms, as though the result were \u201Cwell-known.\u201D Yet no empirical back-up is ever given.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuman beings have never observed gravity-induced radial motion through the centers of massive bodies. The empirical ideals of science have, in this case, been sacrificed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObservations of trajectories in the Solar System do not suffice as a substitute because the directions of the force vectors are completely different. Inside a solid sphere with a hole through its diameter, Newton says the force \u003Cem\u003Etoward the center\u003C/em\u003E gets stronger as one moves away from the center to the surface. In the case pointed out by Stratoroc, for example, moving outward from the point of force cancelation between the Earth and Moon, the force gets stronger\u003Cem\u003E toward the Earth and Moon\u003C/em\u003E. The circumstances are therefore not at all analogous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn response to Otis, p1t1o defended his standard stance by asking whether Otis has \u201Clooked at the claims,\u201D i.e., things written on or linked to my website.

I stand to be corrected. I yearn to be corrected\u2014not by vaguely connected allusions to \u003Cem\u003Eother \u003C/em\u003Epredictions of Newton and Einstein, but by direct empirical evidence involving gravity-induced radial motion through the centers of massive bodies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T15:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222673737\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143053\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468383083\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166467\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RichardBenish\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 hours ago, RichardBenish said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn response to Otis, p1t1o defended his standard stance by asking whether Otis has \u201Clooked at the claims,\u201D i.e., things written on or linked to my website.

The shell theorem tells us that as the ball falls through the Earth-spanning tunnel, at each point it feels a gravitational pull proportional to all the mass at a lower \u0022altitude\u0022 than itself, as if from a point source located at the center of mass. This means that at the exact core, where there is no such mass at a lower altitude, the net force is zero, so if the object has any momentum at that point, it simply coasts through without interruption. The force increases with altitude, always toward the center, until back up at the surface, it\u0027s proportional to the entire mass of the Earth.\u00A0This gives exactly the conventional sine-wave outcome that your web site pooh-poohs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, RichardBenish said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe question is, what exactly\u00A0does the inverse-square law refer to. According to Newton\u0027s theory (and also Einstein\u0027s, although expressed in different terms) it refers to a force of attraction. According to the model discussed on my website, it refers to the generation of space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where I regrettably have to agree with earlier commenters that your rhetoric start to sound like pseudoscience. Whether we\u0027re talking about \u0022a force of attraction\u0022 or \u0022generation of space,\u0022 if they both follow an inverse square law, then the shell theorem still applies equally in either case, and we should expect sine wave oscillations as a direct consequence. So if you accept the shell theorem, then where does the extra upward force come from that would be needed to stop the ball at the center?\u00A0(I realize that you offered many links to papers, but at this point they don\u0027t rise above my minimum threshold level of apparent credibility to spend the time to read them.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s various physicists proposed doing a small-scale version, to be launched into Earth orbit to measure G. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19750014902\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19750014902\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0 Their reasons to not go ahead and build any of these devices were not about feasibility, but about the poor cost/benefit ratio. Technology available at the time would have resulted in little or any improvement in measurements of G over those that had already been conducted in Earth-based laboratories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore recently, George Herold of Teachspin (Buffalo, NY) has conceived of building an Earth-based laboratory version using a modified Cavendish balance. Apparently he is currently either underfunded, under-motivated or both. So we may have to wait (a few years?) till Feldman et al get their device launched and on the way to deep space before we discover whether their apparatus functions as a clock or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy website does not \u201Cpooh-pooh\u201D the standard oscillation prediction. It simply presents another possibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom the Newtonian perspective, your description is accurate. But I question what it means to \u201Cfeel a gravitational pull.\u201D Do we or anything else ever feel a gravitational pull? The answer is yes only in such cases as being suspended from above, as an apple being pulled upward by the branch of a tree. While seemingly \u201Cat rest\u201D on Earth, we actually feel gravity pushing us upward. All of these circumstances correspond to clear-cut accelerometer readings. All accelerometers attached to Earth give readings indicating that they are accelerating upward. Accelerometers that fall (as in a tunnel) all give zero readings. They feel no pull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the Newtonian framework one learns to disbelieve accelerometer readings by, for example, invoking a \u201Cnormal\u201D upward force that supposedly neutralizes the unfelt downward pull, leaving an accelerometer attached to Earth in a state of \u201Crest.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWithout any intent to \u201Cdazzle\u201D anybody, it should be pointed out that one of the founding principles of Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity, the Equivalence Principle, recognizes in the above facts that our experience of gravity is exactly \u201Cas though\u201D the ground were accelerating upward. One thus finds in the standard literature remarks like the one by Lewis C. Epstein: \u201CEinstein\u2019s view of gravity is that things don\u2019t fall; the floor comes up!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idea that this fact of our gravitational experience ought to be interpreted more literally than it typically is, has arisen several times in the last 120 years or so. Superficially, the idea seems like preposterous pseudo-science. In its most na\u00EFve sense of suggesting the \u201Caccelerated expansion of matter,\u201D many objections may be adduced to refute it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving about reached the end of an acceptably-lengthed blog comment, I cannot here defend against these objections or ones that I expect may be forthcoming. The defense exists in the form of papers cited earlier and one more: Rethinking Einstein\u2019s Rotation Analogy ( \u003Ca href=\u0022http://fqxi.org/data/essay-contest-files/Benish_Rethinking_Rotation.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://fqxi.org/data/essay-contest-files/Benish_Rethinking_Rotation.pdf\u003C/a\u003E ). The latter paper adopts the perspective of an alien civilization (Rotonians) who evolved in a distant rotating cylindrical world where matter-produced gravity is unknown and everyone learns to believe accelerometer readings as meaning what they say.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen they disembark from a long voyage and encounter a gravitating planet for the first time, they too adopt the initial idea that \u201Cthe floor comes up\u201D (because they instinctively believe their accelerometers). Being conscientious scientists, they then plan to discover empirically whether or not this idea is true by conducting Galileo\u2019s experiment. If accelerometers always tell the truth, then an object falling into the center of a massive body will not pass the center because nothing ever pulled it downward. Whereas accelerometers attached to the tunnel walls all indicate upward acceleration, as though the material body were an inexhaustible source of space, and an inexhaustible source of perpetual propulsion. Rotonians suspect this is what gravity is. But they refrain from concluding before hearing Nature\u2019s testimony on the matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
