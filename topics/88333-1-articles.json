I\u0027m new here, and as an avid Kerbonaut and mod user (\u003Cem\u003EGameData, exceeding 4 GB and violating access since 0.20. #thestruggle\u003C/em\u003E), I\u0027ve decided that I want to make my own mod. Thing is, I don\u0027t know where to start. I don\u0027t necessarily want to make parts, though that would be nice, I just want to make something more script based. The tutorials I\u0027ve found seem to only talk about making parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the thing: I\u0027m already quite familiar with modeling, having used 3DS Max for about two years, the skills of which I\u0027m sure I could transfer to Blender. The thing I have jack squat knowledge about is coding. I was really hoping I could get some experience in this by making a mod for a game. After playing KSP, I\u0027ve chosen it for my first mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027m really hoping to get some useful experience in this. Any tips would be nice, any points in the right direction, any recommendations to which languages to learn, etc etc. Perhaps, as a starter project, you could teach me how to make a specific script/plugin, like say for instance a plugin that programs a rocket to burn in a certain direction. Like I said, anything to help get me started would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-23T22:38:15Z\u0022 title=\u002210/23/2014 10:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Capt.
