I believe that the problem is because the sheilded docking ports are not correctly handled by CLS. Looking into it I believe that the lateral ones are also not handled correctly, and that this issue will also be related to the Porkjet Flathab. Let me explain:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen two parts are docked, they are not \u0022conected\u0022 in the wayn that other parts are, and so the CLS code that walks the part tree does not work for docked connections. However that does nat matter, because I have handed docked connections as a special case, which works for the dock-o-tron / junior / large. It does this by taking acount of the referenceAttachNode in the config for the ModuleDockingNode on the part. However for the shielded and lateral docking parts, there is no referenceAttachNode, hence CLS barfs!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to figure out how I can detect a docked connection in the scenario where referenceAttachNode is not set, but for now I am struggling a little. If anyone knows more about this that I do (perhaps Porkjet or whoever do the work with him on getting his flathab docking ports docking) might be able to assist me with this.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S4qFBxkFFg","CreatedById":83727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T19:30:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecodepoet: Firstly, the config file for the KSOS I sent isn\u0027t correct - I\u0027ve sent the better version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027m struggling with a particular part in that mod - I can\u0027t seem to set the bottom node of the SST (the space station construction tug) as passable while also making the middle node impassable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it be something to do with the fact that they have very similar names?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe relevant code from the tug\u0027s config file is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom01 = 0, 0.0, -0.6525, 0, 1, 0, 1\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_top = 0, 1.332, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1\u003Cbr\u003Enode_stack_bottom = 0, -1.332, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(note that the node in the middle is the first in the list, bottom and top appear to be named as would be obvious when viewing in the VAB)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I have in the CLS config is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E@PART[KSO_SST]:HAS[!MODULE[ModuleConnectedLivingSpace]] \u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tname = ModuleConnectedLivingSpace\u003Cbr\u003E\t\timpassablenodes = node_stack_bottom01\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever this makes \u003Cem\u003Eboth\u003C/em\u003E the middle and bottom nodes impassable and I\u0027m not sure where to go from here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Just using \u0022passable = true\u0022 makes every node passable, as expected, but that\u0027s not perfectly desirable behaviour either.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"codepoet","CreatedById":73449,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-28T19:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple of thoughts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) the names of the nodes are \u0022top\u0022 , \u0022bottom\u0022 etc. the \u0022node_stack\u0022 bit gets stripped off when the game reads the config.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) the have you tried setting \u0022passablenodes\u0022?
