This is a legit no-kidding honest to goodness actual in-game event generated by the asteroid system (currently being managed by the Custom Asteroids mod). Thanks to the KSPTOT program, I also know its exact trajectory through the atmosphere, modeled with FAR. I\u0027m interested in discussing with anyone who is willing to offer insight how this event would affect Kerbin. Right now I\u0027m thinking the massive shockwave would plow a wide swath of destruction - tearing up surface ground, flattening everything beneath it and setting fire to forests on the edge of the super-heated air column. Any time spent over oceans would likely flash boil a good portion of the surface water. The asteroid, being a huge Class E, won\u0027t break up entirely but lots of pieces, some still large, will break off and rain down as well along a path longer than that of the main asteroid\u0027s travel through the atmosphere, maybe some going into highly eccentric orbits to rain down days later. Long-term effects will include massive rain storms from all the extra moisture in the air leading to large scale flooding, and smoke from all the wildfires spreading around the globe, potentially kicking off a small-scale cooling trend. The swath of destruction should even be visible from space, although how I\u0027m going to do that in the game I\u0027ve not yet figured out - might just have to do some post image editing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, additional thoughts and comments are welcome.

Real life Physics: For starters, the asteroid isn\u0027t hitting the planet directly, but rather skimming through the higher atmosphere and then falling as a result of lost velocity. This means the asteroid is going to lose a lot of its energy, and its also more likely for it to burn up. The problem is in KSP the asteroids and planets are small compared to real life, and also the asteroids generated are in similar orbits to Kerbin and will also be travelling more slowly. Overall, there\u0027s going to be less mass and less speed behind the impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Made up Physics: Lets ignore the boring stuff and say that this asteroid had enough energy behind it to deal some serious damage. An asteroid impact wouldn\u0027t cause many fires, (They would probably be contained to within a 5-30 km radius depending on the size of asteroid) however it would launch a lot of debris into the atmosphere and space as well as create great shock waves that cause tsunamis, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions (assuming Kerbin has all of those). The material released by these events would enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and block out the sun, causing mass extinction to lots of living things. Since Kerbin is way smaller than the Earth, this event would be felt all over the planet and would have a devastating impact on all species. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are lots of other things that could be covered here like different types of asteroids with different composition however this is the best explanation I could give and I am by no means an expert.

Within that radius, you would see damage to infrastructure (bridges, railways, dams, etc) closer to the impact area, as well as loss of life much closer. The majority of life lost would be in the immediate impact area and near the shockwave. Biologically, the shockwave, should it be strong enough, could cause major trauma that decreases in severity with increasing distance from the impact area. However, just like with an earthquake, the majority of injuries would be from building collapse and falling objects.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EIf it impacts the ocean, it would cause practically no damage in the impact radius, but I couldn\u0027t say the same for the fish. The damage it would do, however, is in a tsunami, coming from the impact\u0027s tremors. However, unlike a tsunami formed from a earthquake or underwater landslide, this tsunami would be one single wave, rather than three that bunch up, and it would have done less serious damage than a tsunami. Depending upon the distance from the coastline, coastline infrastructure and geography, and time of day, the tsunami would have varying degrees of damage. If it hits full force, it would wipe out coastal residential neighborhoods, old structures, and tall, unsupported structures (specifically buildings with weak foundations or buildings without pylons that are driven into the foundation to prevent lateral movement). Meteorologically, however it would be interesting to see if any storms come from this impact. It would be an interesting proof of concept to see a hurricane come from the impact (the impact evaporates a considerable amount of water in the surrounding area and this forms into a storm, the largest of which, could be a hurricane; it\u0027s a hypothesis that one of these was formed during the cretaceous extinction, a massive one, and punched a hole in the ozone layer by throwing enough water up there).\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ELooking at it from an emergency manager\u0027s point of view, the main concern would be in immediate emergency services. In a mainland collision, seeing how power lines and telecommunications would be cut, it would be up to the local populous to take care of immediate threats for the first day or so. Once emergency supplies start flowing, emergency services would have a very limited time to pull people from the rubble of collapsed buildings and establish medical centers to take care of the wounded. The concern with this is the infrastructure; damaged bridges, cut powerlines, and broken gas lines would pose a serious threat to any rescue attempts, even preventing supplies from being ferried to the proper locations. After the first five or so days, most of the search and rescue effort would have been concentrated on body recovery (those poor Kerbals). Meanwhile, the first engineers arrive to help repair critical infrastructure and get more supplies flowing. Food would be scarce without this, since most of the food before the disaster would be gone and without much supplies coming in to supplement, and people would go hungry. Following that, is the recovery to individual property. This is the longest phase, since most individuals would not have the liquid capital to begin repairs on the houses and businesses; I hope they had asteroid insurance.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003EShould the asteroid impact the ocean, the main concern would be getting the word out before the tsunami hits.
