(And are you sure the brand\u0027s not iOptron? They\u0027re reasonably well known for their funky and reasonably good mounts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot seeing anything at all generally means the scope isn\u0027t aimed at the target. Scopes give a narrow true field of view - you\u0027re looking at a small part of the sky at a time - so it only takes a small error to miss the target altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMagnification is given by telescope focal length divided by eyepiece focal length. Assuming your scope has a 1200 mm focal length, the K25 will give 48x and the K10 120x. That means the K25 will show a view about twice as wide as the Moon, which if you look at it is only a small bit of the sky, while the K10 probably won\u0027t even show the whole Moon at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your scope has a finder, align it to the main scope on a distant object during the day (being sure to point the scope away from the sun). The way to do this is to first find something in the main scope, then lock the main scope down and adjust the finder to show the same object. Repeat with the higher magnification eyepiece if you want. If you must align at night, the Moon\u0027s good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also usually need to go through a setup process for the GoTo, where it will slew to some stars and you manually centre them in the eyepiece. Also, make sure you have the latitude and longitude the right way round, it\u0027s easy to switch them by mistake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the lens cap, take the whole thing off. The smaller holes used to be for use with eyepiece solar filters, but those filters are DANGEROUS, don\u0027t use one. Use a filter that fits on the front of the scope if you want to observe the Sun, and make sure it won\u0027t fall off. For some reason lens caps still have the small holes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sparky412","CreatedById":111771,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T06:07:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it could be that the lens need to be in focus it might be out of focus at times I will have to focus the lens again in order to see the stars.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing it could be is the mirrors might be out of line and need to be adjusted.

If you\u0027re severely out of focus and not looking at a very bright object you may well see nothing, the light from faint stars getting blurred out so much it\u0027s invisible.

See the mirror. Geek out, just a little bit: \u003Cem\u003ETelescopes are pretty sweet, right?\u003C/em\u003E Proceed to look through the eyepiece at something sufficiently far away during the daytime (like a telephone pole or a distant tree). If your eyepiece is bright but shows no detail, try to focus it using that little focus knob. If your image is still dark, you may want to call iProton.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad focus can really knock a telescope out of whack. With poor enough focus, not only are faint stars rendered invisible, but even brighter stars are much more difficult to see. I would recommend pointing the telescope at the moon manually (it\u0027s not too difficult to find) using your lowest-magnification eyepiece. If you see a bright blob or a bright circle, focus until you can see the craters very crisply. Now, go and look at other things out there! Again, because your telescope\u0027s GoTo function is not absolutely perfect, try first viewing from your lowest magnification eyepiece (which is, perhaps paradoxically, the K25), and finding whatever you want to find in your eyepiece, manually adjust until it\u0027s at the center of the eyepiece. For more detail, you can use the K10. Just switch back to the K25 before moving on to your next target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen the smallest lens covering if you want to get less light into your telescope. (This often helps when viewing the Moon or some of the brighter planets.) You can also fit a smaller (and cheaper) solar filter onto the smaller lens covering, with no loss of detail. Just don\u0027t use eyepiece solar filters. They will make you blind, it\u0027s a question of when not if.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
