I\u0027ll investigate. Though the game ran fine in version .90 - so I\u0027ll be bummed out if I can\u0027t get it to work.\n\nUpdate - Turning off Anti-Aliasing worked! Can now play the game. Very grateful for the help. (Not sure what anti-aliasing actually is, mind, assume I can live without it.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T18:36:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 06:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BinaryBad**"}]}
