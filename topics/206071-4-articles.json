I assume, methods will have advanced from that quite a bit, but unless we build a spacecraft hardy enough to put into an autoclave, there\u0027s probably nothing we can do on Earth that\u0027s worse than exposing the stowaways to space/the Martian surface for a couple of months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd even if we do manage to kill 100% of viable germs, we will probably leave enough organic debris to interfere with our attempts to detect native life, so killing them is actually only half the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what my conclusions are, but I guess there\u0027s very little we can do to avoid contamination entirely and we\u0027ll just have to design our experiments around this constraint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlcohol is nice for disinfect, as in its nice for killing bacteria who is harmful for us, other benefit is that its cheap and safe to use.
