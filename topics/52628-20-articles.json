As much as I like my SLS Block III, rockets with RP1/LOX lower stages can be more fun to fly. As such, I created by own Nova rocket. In the 1960s, NASA was seeking designs for extremely heavy lifters, in order to launch a mission to Mars. These lifters were submitted under the Nova program. The following is my submission. The bottom stages are 12.2m wide and the top stage is 8.4m wide. The bottom stage is powered by 9 F-1 engines. The second stage is powered by 2 M-1 engines. The third stage is powered by 2 J-2x engines; it is the same as the second stage that was planned for the SLS Block II. The bottom stage hauls ass, so it might be a good idea to disable throttle down near engine cutoff, otherwise you\u0027ll be going near 5 Gs towards the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/3Quwe\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

It lifts 70T into orbit, weighing 1700T on the pad with payload. The first stage has 3 F-1 engines, and the second stage has two J-2 engines. It gets into orbit pretty quickly, exhausting its fuel supply in around 7 minutes. It\u0027s 6.6m wide, so if you wanted to replace the upper stage with the S-IVb you\u0027d get similar performance, but it\u0027d be very slow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/Jf7GO\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

You can do a lot with 70T to orbit, including launch a probe to anywhere without gravity assists.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
