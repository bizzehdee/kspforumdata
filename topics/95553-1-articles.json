There used to be a logical pivot inheritance between modules placed on weird angles (shift wasdqe) but now I cant figure out how it works at all, makes building things really tedious. Now you cant even get things to even angles sometimes and where the original rotation comes from is beyond me. Its not like the old system was great, I\u0027ve mumbled quite a few curse words because of it, but at least it was workable. plz fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-03T21:04:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/03/2015 09:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hazarada\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T21:22:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShift\u002BWASDQE still works as before.
