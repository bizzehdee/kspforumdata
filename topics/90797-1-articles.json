Loble is found orbiting the earth without a vehicle. I sent up a rescue craft with Jeb, but I don\u0027t know how to get Loble on board. I cannot use the Loble character to get him to fly towards my craft. I went to my Space Center but have no option to \u0027fly\u0027 Loble Kerman. All I can do is track him. I have tried an EVA with Jeb, but even 0.1M away, but I have no action menu. I\u0027m just wondering how I can save my helpless, comatose Kerbal friend. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny advice would be appreciated so I can progress.
