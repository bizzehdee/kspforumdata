It was very hard to notice, and I couldn\u0027t believe it when I stumbled across it while randomly scanning the sky. It was so dim compared to the blue sky that it took about 30 seconds to re-locate it after I looked away. I grabbed my camera and took this picture:\n\n[https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipP2oWGDEC_4F7lNRsL1I-dDY6r9YOkDXu7gDYHu](https://photos.google.com/photo/AF1QipP2oWGDEC_4F7lNRsL1I-dDY6r9YOkDXu7gDYHu)\n\nI thought it was very interesting to see a bright point in the sky in broad daylight, and Minmus actually flashed through my mind! (I may be playing too much KSP...) Have you ever seen Venus during the daytime, or even Jupiter or Saturn?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T22:34:38Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 10:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by livefree75**\n  \nFixed picture"},{"CreatedByName":"A35K","CreatedById":145429,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T16:03:06Z","Content":"Cool!

The sky needs to be very clear and you basically need some help with a nearby tree or a pole, and an optical device to establish the first position. To catch it with a naked eye, just like that, is extremely difficult."},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T12:59:06Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen it in the daytime with a telescope, it was really cool because I could see it\u0027s coloration and curvature, but the background was blue."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T13:09:37Z","Content":"The pic isn\u0027t showing, can you re-host it on Imgur or smth."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T14:21:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cool!

They are like little friends that say *Hi* every night. Sometimes the Moon drops in too."}]}
