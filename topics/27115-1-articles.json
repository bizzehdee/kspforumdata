It all works fine, and I managed to stumble across the Armstrong Memorial by accident. But I decided that my next project needs to be faster, and needs to be manned; after a bit of experimentation, I came up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/595877960902644967/A471DFC024501A7929ABC299EF856BD97733143A/\u0022 alt=\u0022A471DFC024501A7929ABC299EF856BD97733143A\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve driven it around Kerbin a bit, it\u0027s mostly stable, it can manage bumps and slopes without too much trouble, caps at around 22m/s (I imagine it\u0027ll do more on the Mun), and can last a decent amount of time in the dark. My primary problem is this: how on earth am I going to get this to the Mun? I think it\u0027s a bit too big to practically attach to a lander, and I\u0027m not sure how I\u0027d go about building a skycrane for this. Getting Jeb back home isn\u0027t a worry, my plan was to get the car onto the mun, do a bit of exploring, and drop a lander down to pick him up later on. He\u0027s got a packed lunch, he\u0027ll be fine. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore to the point, I don\u0027t see any way of porting this into the VAB, since it was designed in the Spaceplane Hangar.

You need to have at least one free point to connect something to the first part you chose for the rover (I assume that\u0027s the cockpit in the middle). To get around this, just take one end of the rover, starting from those circular battery packs, and temporarily move it to the other end, so that you have a free connection on the cockpit.

The first way to combat that is to try and make it balanced, keep the center of mass as close to the middle as possible. You can also try draining any fuel you have from the rover to keep it from being top heavy. You can play around with having an bigger-than-necessary fuel tank and draining fuel at different stages to do this without leaving your final stages with not enough fuel. And also, struts. The rover in my picture is just connected with a single docking port to that tri-connector piece. But there are several struts holding the whole thing together, they are just hard to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other thing about landing it horizontally. It can be really tricky without some kind of properly oriented control point. The cockpit and any docking ports will make your navball orient the wrong way. Pointing directly up, at the center of the blue side of the navball, will make your rover come in vertically. You need to stick a probe core on there somewhere so that it orients correctly or else your pro/retrograde markers won\u0027t be aligned properly and you\u0027ll have a hell of a time getting down safely. And mechjeb will be of no help here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a not-totally-clear picture of what I\u0027m talking about.
