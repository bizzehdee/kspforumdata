So now, ladies and gents, may I present to you: the Highlander, named after the Munar biome I touched down on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/SjzZN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis actually represents my first attempt at a Munar landing without MechJeb. I\u0027m proud to report that the mission, after a certain amount of F9 holding (don\u0027t trust the KER suicide burn info!), was a success, due in most part to the incredible fuel margins this design possesses, as well as its rock-solid atmospheric stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPertinent information:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAscent profile: I kind of eyeballed this one. Start at the usual 10Km, then tip over by rapidly tapping the D key.... you know the drill. If you\u0027re either skilled or lucky, you\u0027ll have almost all of the Munar transfer burn in the tank once you finish circularizing. (Fun fact: I normally suck at conventional lifters, so making one that didn\u0027t tip over was a pleasant surprise.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERange: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETESTED, BADLY: One Munar biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESUSPECTED IF FLOWN SKILLFULLY: Two Munar biomes or most of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry profile: I dumped all of my remaining fuel into a retro-burn as soon as the flames started. This might not be required, but nothing blew up under 1.0.3 heating. Your results may vary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETech level: This one\u0027s part of Rockomax\u0027s TL90 line- ships so easy, you don\u0027t need any tech beyond the 90-science level to create them. (A Tier 2 launchpad and VAB is required, however.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/vk644bvhmqy3r01/RML-03%20Highlander.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
