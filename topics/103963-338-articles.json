My personal explanation is it has something to do with the lighting effecting the sphere more.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 hours ago, cpthornman said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyone else getting this bug with RTB\u0027s latest build? Every celestial body but Kerbin and Jool do this. This is Laythe. Once I remove scatterer from the game it no longer does it. Running on Windows 10.

That is certainly not right and I\u0027m curious what\u0027s causing it.\n\nCan I get a KSP log file from you, kindly?  EDIT:  nvm, I fixed it, heh.  See below.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 2 hours ago, Aniruddh said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Yeah could be, I don\u0027t really mind if it looks like that, was just curious if scatterer affected colours, since a few pages back in this thread, some people were saying how kerbin has a frozen world look because of it.\n\u003E \n\nI think I now understand why Laythe is looking weird then...  it doesn\u0027t have a new \u0022ultra\u0022 shader!  It\u0027s only the \u0022Ultra\u0022 shader worlds that are working then, and everything else is borked?\n\nThat sounds reasonable, and would be easy to fix.  Is that correct?  Can someone test?  I\u0027m presently working but will have time to make a build in a little less than an hour.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-27T20:43:08Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2020 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by R-T-B**"},{"CreatedByName":"R-T-B","CreatedById":200868,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-27T20:39:34Z","Content":"Ok everyone,\n\nRC10 is out with the following changes:\n\n1.)
