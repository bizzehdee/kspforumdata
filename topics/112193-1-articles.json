I have read a lot of threads surrounding this topic but none that explain clearly the differences since the Aerodynamics were updated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... After getting to the stage where I felt comfortable building rockets of all shapes and sizes, and landing them on various bodies in Sandbox mode, (at that time the only option), I moved onto SSTO spaceplanes design. After MANY hours of trial and error and inevitable explosions, (YAY KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E), I finally became comfortable with designing those too. Anything - from a Plane/Rover 1 man Hybrid (drone control optional), through a 10 man \u0022Ker-bus\u0022 with space for a deployable probe, to a SSTO/nuclear hybrid which could not only reach orbit but get all the way to Laythe, all with the ability to get into orbit without ejecting any fuel tanks - were the norm for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I have now hit a major snag in my SP designs. For some reason since the Aerodynamics model was updated, (a great move imho), I have struggled to reach orbit. I usually design my SSTO Spaceplanes around a RAPIER Engine or 2, for their multi-purpose functionality, but have designed many without (Using rockets when the Turbo RAMJETs run out of altitude). However using either method I have currently not been able to replicate my previous success, and I am at a loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem seems to be the \u0022jump\u0022 from traveling anywhere between 850-1400 m/s up to the beyond 2000 m/s required for orbit, whilst retaining enough fuel, and if I add tanks, that only increases weight/drag, lowering the speed I can get up to on the jet engines, and increasing the time taken getting there. I just seem to be running out of fuel too quickly, and cannot find the right balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI feel like I have gone from knowing exactly what a design will do before I fly it, to expecting some unknown failure to befall me... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be MUCH appreciated (and I apologise if this is in the wrong section!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany thanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKTTK\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T19:30:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExact right place.

You will need to get what you can get from the air breathers, and then switch to rockets sooner and get out of there.

Each strut adds weight and drag but if the wings flex and deform too much your craft is going to have phantom yaw, roll and pitch, loss speed from snaking, worming and dolphining, even if you get MJ to try to make the thing stable enough to fly parts are going to break or overheat, and generally your craft will never make it to orbit, so trade offs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T10:50:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Chaos_Klaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Chaos_Klaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, I think he meant that the rapier is the third part in the succession of engines.

I did however have a chance to test a few of my older designs with the recommended flight changes, and WOW what a difference it makes. As far as I can tell, the only real limiting factor on my previous attempts was stupidly ignoring how much effect the transonic would have on flight, which is actually a huge amount! On my first flight (in a single RAPIER craft making the dive at about 18km) I got a 72km apoapsis and a 56km periapsis (which of course is not quite a stable orbit due to licking the atmosphere and orbital degradation), and I wasn\u0027t really paying much attention to fuel consumption or angle of attack (apart from the dive), I was just experimenting with punching through the transonic.

So really, breaking the sound barrier seemed to be the main withholding factor in getting a Spaceplane into orbit.
