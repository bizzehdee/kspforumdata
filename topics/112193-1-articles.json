I have read a lot of threads surrounding this topic but none that explain clearly the differences since the Aerodynamics were updated.\n\nSo... After getting to the stage where I felt comfortable building rockets of all shapes and sizes, and landing them on various bodies in Sandbox mode, (at that time the only option), I moved onto SSTO spaceplanes design. After MANY hours of trial and error and inevitable explosions, (YAY KSP ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)), I finally became comfortable with designing those too. Anything - from a Plane/Rover 1 man Hybrid (drone control optional), through a 10 man \u0022Ker-bus\u0022 with space for a deployable probe, to a SSTO/nuclear hybrid which could not only reach orbit but get all the way to Laythe, all with the ability to get into orbit without ejecting any fuel tanks - were the norm for me.\n\nHowever I have now hit a major snag in my SP designs. For some reason since the Aerodynamics model was updated, (a great move imho), I have struggled to reach orbit. I usually design my SSTO Spaceplanes around a RAPIER Engine or 2, for their multi-purpose functionality, but have designed many without (Using rockets when the Turbo RAMJETs run out of altitude). However using either method I have currently not been able to replicate my previous success, and I am at a loss.\n\nThe main problem seems to be the \u0022jump\u0022 from traveling anywhere between 850-1400 m/s up to the beyond 2000 m/s required for orbit, whilst retaining enough fuel, and if I add tanks, that only increases weight/drag, lowering the speed I can get up to on the jet engines, and increasing the time taken getting there. I just seem to be running out of fuel too quickly, and cannot find the right balance.\n\nI feel like I have gone from knowing exactly what a design will do before I fly it, to expecting some unknown failure to befall me... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nAny help would be MUCH appreciated (and I apologise if this is in the wrong section!)\n\nMany thanks,\n\nKTTK"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T19:30:03Z","Content":"Exact right place.

Wings, pre-coolers and Mk1 Jet fuel tanks wick heat nicely from intakes and engines.\n\n![oty3Wwol.png](http://i.imgur.com/oty3Wwol.png)\n\n2. Turbojets help: Rapiers perform poorly at low altitudes. Turbojets can make up for that. \n\n3. Dive! When lifting heavy loads I go 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to 10 km, then gently dive at 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to break though the sound barrier, once past 600 m/s I begin climbing back up to 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 pitch. \n\n4. Close intakes, I close the per-coolers until speed exceeds 1 km/s, I think this improves performance but honestly I have not noticed, other though live by opening and closing intakes at the right times. \n\n5. Make the wings the right way! Because of the size of the Xylol the wings needed to be made out of multiple parts and assembled in a particular way to maximize stability. The Xylol\u0027s wings are made out of 4 sets of wings, each one attached to a different segment of fuselage, I call these sub-wings. The sub-wings are strutted together such that every part of a sub-wing has at least one strut connecting it to another sub-wing. \n\nI learned the hard way that if I made a single wing with just one part connected to the fuselage and all the other parts connected to it, even with equal numbers of struts connecting the wing to ever segment of fuselage it is unstable. Each strut adds weight and drag but if the wings flex and deform too much your craft is going to have phantom yaw, roll and pitch, loss speed from snaking, worming and dolphining, even if you get MJ to try to make the thing stable enough to fly parts are going to break or overheat, and generally your craft will never make it to orbit, so trade offs."},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-07T10:50:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No, I think he meant that the rapier is the third part in the succession of engines.

I did however have a chance to test a few of my older designs with the recommended flight changes, and WOW what a difference it makes. As far as I can tell, the only real limiting factor on my previous attempts was stupidly ignoring how much effect the transonic would have on flight, which is actually a huge amount! On my first flight (in a single RAPIER craft making the dive at about 18km) I got a 72km apoapsis and a 56km periapsis (which of course is not quite a stable orbit due to licking the atmosphere and orbital degradation), and I wasn\u0027t really paying much attention to fuel consumption or angle of attack (apart from the dive), I was just experimenting with punching through the transonic. I\u0027m sure if I actually try to improve my flight profile on the way up I\u0027d easily make it to a stable orbit with fuel to spare.\n\nAlso, the way drag is now implemented makes a massive difference, as I had some vertical fuel tanks attached to one design (for VTOL purposes), and there\u0027s almost no way I can see that getting into orbit without severely overbuilding (and probably losing the VTOL capability as the plane would be too heavy to lift by then). So really, breaking the sound barrier seemed to be the main withholding factor in getting a Spaceplane into orbit. I am going to experiment more with newer builds though as this is what I gleaned from about an hour of testing 3 or 4 designs which is not enough for conclusive evidence.\n\nFYI I don\u0027t use any mods at the moment (I used to but my game broke in one update and I have stayed with stock since) though I think some of them are amazing.

In summary: only attachment nodes and cargo bays occlude. Everything else is independently calculated and summed. That\u0027s why radial attachments make drag skyrocket.\n\nI saw a \u0022Sir\u0022 Scott Manley video where he used attachment nodes to make a VTOL (structural hardpoints), but it was several versions ago, and every time I\u0027ve tried It won\u0027t let me attach to one side of it. Did they fix it or am I missing something?\n\nAs for cargo bays, in that case they need a MK1 cargo bay to fill the gap imho ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) I\u0027ve used the MkII cargo bay for VTOL but not SSTO capable (yet) with the Aero update.\n\nI hear what you\u0027re saying about suspension of disbelief, just to clarify though, I\u0027m not talking about overlapping wings \u0022inside\u0022 each other, just making them so that they come to a point at the end. Not sure if that was clear, it\u0027s hard to explain without visual reference (which I don\u0027t have privelages for yet)\n\nAgreed about hiding wings in a cargo bay, that would be \u0022cheating\u0022. IRL they wouldn\u0027t get the flow of air to make them aerodynamic in the 1st place. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit : Oh wait, surely it\u0027s just the foremost component(s) that drag is calculated for, as would be IRL?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T21:31:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 09:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kicked to the Kerb**"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T00:09:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I hear what you\u0027re saying about suspension of disbelief, just to clarify though, I\u0027m not talking about overlapping wings \u0022inside\u0022 each other, just making them so that they come to a point at the end.
