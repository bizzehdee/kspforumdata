Either these work weird in KSP or KSP does something weird where it moves objects but doesn\u0027t update their transforms where you rotate the camera (this is unlikely).\n\nAnyway, my question is, how do I recreate that amtrix by myself using the camera\u0027s transform? I know you need the camera\u0027s transform but this is where math fails me (a snippet of code instead of an analytical explanation would be highly appreciated).\n\nEdited: Ignore this thread, I found the problem and it\u0027s somehting so much simpler.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T21:26:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack**"}]}
