I have a row of Mk3 tanks where the nuke clusters were in a certain position, and fuel lines leading from the medial and lateral tanks to the tanks where they were connected. Anyway, at some point I had to move the engines to the outer tanks, and I forgot to switch the fuel lines, so they can only use the outer tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything is almost ready to go after much effort, and I really don\u0027t want to re-launch all the pieces. I have enough for a decent burn in the outer tanks,(650 dv when full) but possibly not enough. Can I transfer fuel while burning the engines, or will that cause problems?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T03:23:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.

Your engine is burning the content of D, and you\u0027re selecting A\u002BB\u002BC\u002BD, and you select IN on D. Now, A\u002BB\u002BC will equally transfer their content* to D, which is probably good to keep your craft balanced. However, once D is full, the transfer will stop for all tanks but one. You\u0027ll then have only one tank (say \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E filling-in for the content of D that is being burned (to keep D full). This will probably unbalance your craft. That\u0027s something to keep in mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*This is tank flow dependent, but assuming same tank model.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T08:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWait, you can have transfers with more than two tanks selected now?
