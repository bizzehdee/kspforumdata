I have a row of Mk3 tanks where the nuke clusters were in a certain position, and fuel lines leading from the medial and lateral tanks to the tanks where they were connected. Anyway, at some point I had to move the engines to the outer tanks, and I forgot to switch the fuel lines, so they can only use the outer tanks.\n\nEverything is almost ready to go after much effort, and I really don\u0027t want to re-launch all the pieces. I have enough for a decent burn in the outer tanks,(650 dv when full) but possibly not enough. Can I transfer fuel while burning the engines, or will that cause problems?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T03:23:19Z","Content":"Yes.

Or more precisely, you can, but the engines will only burn with power corresponding to the fuel output of the ISRU, disregarding whatever they have in attached tanks. With random exceptions too. I was wondering why the poor thrust of my last tug, some 160kN. Switched the ISRU off, and got full 4000kN immediately."},{"CreatedByName":"Captain H@dock","CreatedById":139017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T08:01:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Can I transfer fuel while burning the engines, or will that cause problems?\n\nThe only problem you can run into (and I can\u0027t remember if this is still in 1.0.x) is when the transfer has finished and you\u0027ve got more than two tanks involved.\n\nAssuming you\u0027re got 4 tanks (A to D). Your engine is burning the content of D, and you\u0027re selecting A\u002BB\u002BC\u002BD, and you select IN on D. Now, A\u002BB\u002BC will equally transfer their content\\* to D, which is probably good to keep your craft balanced. However, once D is full, the transfer will stop for all tanks but one. You\u0027ll then have only one tank (say ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) filling-in for the content of D that is being burned (to keep D full). This will probably unbalance your craft. That\u0027s something to keep in mind.\n\n\\*This is tank flow dependent, but assuming same tank model."},{"CreatedByName":"tomf","CreatedById":57809,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T08:54:07Z","Content":"Wait, you can have transfers with more than two tanks selected now? Does it take/add equally to all the tanks that weren\u0027t the one you started the transfer on?"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T09:11:15Z","Content":"Yes. Rightclick the first, alt-rightclick the rest. You can either draw from all into one with \u0022IN\u0022 or dispatch from one into all with \u0022OUT\u0022. The drain/push isn\u0027t equal - depends on tank size (filling Oscar-B from a Kerbodyne tank takes just as long as filling another Kerbodyne tank).\n\nProblem starts with \u0022many to many\u0022. With six external nukes, each on its own (small) tank and three big tanks in the central tug/miner, the transfer was looking like whack-a-mole on each of the three big tanks - as one would be depleted, 80% of the fuel would land in the remaining two."},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T10:42:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Interestingly, while you can transfer fuel while burning just fine (done this a number of times, even in my previous asteroid tug where I\u0027d transfer fuel through the asteroid to external engines clawed to the surface, and at such a rate that about three tanks worth of fuel were burned by the time the tanks of the external engines were filled), you can\u0027t manufacture fuel while burning.

Lots of very good information has been passed to the devs recently relating to this bug (and various others caused by the same underlying issue) and I have high hopes that this will be fixed in the next version."}]}
