Some of the right-click options don\u0027t show up unless you launch a craft, return to space center, and the re-load the craft, also, turning on the fuel cell, turning it off, then time warping x amount of time and restarting the fuel cell results in the fuel cell losing an amount of hydrogen and oxygen as if it had been running the entire time you were time warping. not sure what\u0027s going.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T15:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs stated in the other thread... clear your module manager cache.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T17:20:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t even know there exists something like a MM cache ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Paul\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, when I wanted to filter all your parts, I couldn\u0027t find them via the usual 0.90 method, not with company nor function or module.

I think it may be because I\u0027m packing three of those 400 electric charge each batteries into the the science wedge and theres probably a bunch of part clipping.
