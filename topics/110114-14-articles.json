He spent the next three years learning to talk and walk again.  He finished his project at the age of 20, and got his Eagle.    He finished college, and now runs a golf course.   Of course, he can\u0027t hit the ball worth a damn.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) \n\nJust to check in, 25 yrs or so involved, I still get out to the local camp for workdays every now and then, I am part of an RC sailing club that sails there regularly and we are constantly working on the waterfront.   Got my Eagle in \u002794, Philmont 714s in \u002793 and about a week or so later, left for the Jamboree as QM of troop 332 from the NEO conference.  Did some adult work in my 20\u0027s, and I\u0027d still be involved if I had kids.  When my nephew gets a bit older, I\u0027ll start back into it for him. \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-11T06:11:46Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2018 06:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Gargamel**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-11T06:15:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 minutes ago, Gargamel said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Philmont 714s in \u002793\n\u003E \n\n692C3 \u002715.
