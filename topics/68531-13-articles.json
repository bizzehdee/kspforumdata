Tylo, on the other hand, is only a relatively small moon, and building landers for it is not that different from building rockets to launch stuff to LKO. In fact, as long as you don\u0027t use serial staging, any reasonably efficient lifter could probably work as a Tylo lander for 1/3 the normal payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s try it. We have a big lander can, landing struts, and some science stuff, for a total of 4 tonnes. With 15% payload fraction, the total size of the LKO rocket should be around 80 tonnes. With Kerbin TWR 1.6 at liftoff, we\u0027ll need around 1250 kN of thrust, or 6 LV-T30 engines. This suggests using four asparagus boosters. If we leave some mass for structural elements, we have about 60 tonnes left for the fuel tanks. Let\u0027s put an X200-16 fuel tank and an X200-8 fuel tank in the core, and an X200-16 fuel tank and an FL-T400 fuel tank in each of the boosters.

The core has 20 tonnes of mass with the payload, 3326 m/s of delta-v, and initial TWR 2.74, making it suitable for the ascent. With one pair of boosters, the mass goes down from 45.1 tonnes to 25.1 tonnes, giving 2127 m/s of delta-v, with TWR ranging from 2.43 to 4.36. With both pairs of boosters, we are burning fuel from 70.2 tonnes to 50.2 tonnes, producing 1217 m/s of delta-v with TWR from 2.34 to 3.27. This means that we have over 3300 m/s of delta-v for the descent with TWR \u0026gt; 2, so we should be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T02:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E6 LV-T30 engines\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrong.
