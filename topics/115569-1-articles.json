I don\u0027t know what the specific triggers are anymore, but I think you have to get above ~100m to complete the \u0022Launch our first vessel!\u0022 contract. In the past, you could complete that contract by going EVA, so I\u0027m guessing it was changed to fix that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to double check, I started a new career and was able to complete the \u0022Launch our first vessel!\u0022 contract in a new save with a Mk-1 capsule, parachute, and RT-10 (after collecting some science from the launch pad). Perhaps if you could give some steps for what you\u0027re clicking on, that might help us figure out what\u0027s going on. Or maybe a screenshot of your mission archive. Also, are you using any add-ons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiron0224","CreatedById":147812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T22:52:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright, I put it back to unanswered until I get a chance to try some of your suggestions and give you a full breakdown of my mods and things. Basically what I do when I start a career is I give myself a bunch of money and science so I can get past the early stuff and go right to putting my first ship into orbit. When I accept the first four contracts and throw a vessel right into orbit they all clear accept for \u0022launch our first vessel\u0022. That one will just sit there in accepted contracts and never fulfill no matter what else I go on to accomplish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T02:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinding bugs for reasonable actions is easy ... the hard bugs are the ones for the stuff you never think to do, then somebody DOES...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glaran K\u0026#039;erman","CreatedById":146334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T03:13:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI actually experienced this myself the other day when I started a new career. I am sorry to to say I forget how it resolved itself but I do the same thing as you sometimes and start with extra funds and science, perhaps try launching a vessel without upgrading or advancing the tech tree first?
