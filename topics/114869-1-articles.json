Granted that doesn\u0027t include the necessary fuel tanks, RCS thrusters, and engines to get to LKO. And I\u0027m only really trying to get enough delta v to get to orbit and dock with a refueling station. Then from there be able to get to at least Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess this could have been put in one of the questions sub-forums, I posted here though because I\u0027m hoping to see screenshots of large SSTOs that may give me ideas or maybe even push me in a completely new direction in my designs.
