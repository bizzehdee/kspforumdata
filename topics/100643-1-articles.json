I even got to visit three biomes! I had to tap into a little impactor probe (for Interstellar), draining it, but ended up being able to fling it into the air using a procedural part hybrid rocket (really awesome mod, i\u0027ll put link here: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104236-0-90-Hybrid-Rocket-Booster?p=1753982](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104236-0-90-Hybrid-Rocket-Booster?p=1753982) its not a download, so you\u0027ll have to copy the text into a .txt document and rename it as a .cfg for MM) and ended up getting two explosions out of it! in total raking up 300 science from the one impactor. After lining up Kerbin and the probe, I launched, using all five rockets, the lifter attached to the inner tank, the two SRB\u0027s used to push it up fast and quick, and the two hybrid SRB\u0027s (super high thrust and ISP, and controllable thrust .o. ) putting myself onto a collision course with Kerbin. I\u0027m glad that it worked, having it set up so I could ditch the lifting part of the rocket, including the Hybrid rockets, leaving just the probe core and Sepitrons attached as it gracefully and slowly glided down through the atmosphere and touched the ground ever so gracefully smacked the atmosphere at nearly 4000m/s, breaking off the hybrid rockets, leaving me with the lifter and sepitrons and parashoots, thankefully I was able to slow down to a blistering gentle 800m/s before I ditched the lower stage, slowing me down enough to safely deploy the parashoots and land. All of that was made possible due to another mod called Science Containers (look it up... freeking life savor, literally!), pulling all the science into the probe core, so I could return it with as little as possible :3"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T13:15:45Z","Content":"[something]\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T04:05:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 04:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jack Wolfe**"},{"CreatedByName":"blacsky33","CreatedById":129435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T13:20:15Z","Content":"MBI v0.03 : [https://www.dropbox.com/s/72meq92tialak2j/MBIv0.02.rar?dl=0I](https://www.dropbox.com/s/72meq92tialak2j/MBIv0.02.rar?dl=0I)"},{"CreatedByName":"Drakoflame","CreatedById":125253,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T06:18:03Z","Content":"Blacsky, can you give us a changelog?
