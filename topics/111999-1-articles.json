Stage icons usually represents only the \u0022activate\u0022 action of a part. You\u0027ll probably want more than only \u0022activate\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo instead of stage icons I suggest to auto-generate an action-group for every stage there is and show it in the action groups tab. But that approach also have some weak points, for example what to do if you create, remove or rearrange your stages or the parts in them. Especially rearranging stages will lead to comfort problems as you usually want to rearrange all actions too. This means tediously removing every action from one group and adding it again to another group without forgetting one in the process. And when you rearrange your stages while in flight it\u0027s all a mess.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T22:33:06Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 10:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by *Aqua*\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T07:43:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESee \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121006\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/121006\u003C/a\u003E - the AGX guy is thinking about doing something similar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ShakeNBake","CreatedById":104031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T16:57:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENifty.
