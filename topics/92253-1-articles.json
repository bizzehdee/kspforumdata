You can theoretically transfer from Kerbin to Ike\u0027s SOI \u0027directly\u0027 without first establishing an orbit around Duna, but you will be carrying a lot of speed at Duna-and-Ike SOI entry that you will have to negate by burning retrograde. Since Ike has such a small mass, this burn will be pretty lengthy. By using Duna to aerobrake to the correct apoapsis, you won\u0027t have to burn retrograde as much to capture around Ike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConveniently, Ike is pretty much on the same plane as Duna, so you don\u0027t have to worry about a large inclination change like with Gilly or Bop.

Use brute force instead of intelligence, you know?
