I haven\u0027t done that in an in-game decade or three.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecently by pairing down my standard rescue craft design to a single use rocket with a Klaw and a few parachutes attached to it, I\u0027ve found the one-star Kerbin orbit rescue missions to be surprisingly lucrative. The trick, it turns out, is to not leave the shipwrecks/derelicts the new Kerbals are stuck in in orbit. Rather than sending up a craft with a habitation or cockpit module, you send up a rocket with a klaw to grab and deorbit the shipwreck with the Kerbal still inside. Once you\u0027ve grabbed the wreck, make sure to switch the control point to your rocket\u0027s controller or the klaw, burn just long enough to dip into the atmosphere, then autowarp to atmospheric interface \u003Cem\u003E(when the game automatically stops autowarping)\u003C/em\u003E. Then as your rocket is starting reentry, perform a retrograde burn until you\u0027ve consumed all of your remaining fuel; this will slow you to a much safer velocity before you dip into the thicker levels of the atmosphere, and reduce the strain on your parachutes when its time to deploy them. Most importantly to someone in the early stages of their career like you, my standard rescue craft is mostly constructed of lower tier parts. I don\u0027t remember what tier the klaw itself is in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy current standard rescue craft for Kerbin orbit costs about 34,000 kredits, with more than 25,000 of that cost in the\u00A0upper stage with the klaw on it, and therefore said 25,000\u002B is fully recoverable. In addition I make an extra thousand or so kredits from turning in the salvaged shipwreck i brought down from orbit \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(FREE MONEY!)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. And that is not counting the contract\u0027s advance \u003Cem\u003E(~10,000 kredits)\u003C/em\u003E and the reward money for the rescue\u003Cem\u003E (30,000-55,000 kredits)\u003C/em\u003E. So on average (one hell of an average I admit) I stand to lose about 9000 kredits in nonrecoverable parts and fuel, but I get around a 10,000 kredit advance, plus a 43,000 \u003Cem\u003E(average)\u003C/em\u003E reward, and a salvage payout around 1,000 kredits. So on a one-star low orbit rescue, I stand to make a profit of around \u003Cstrong\u003E45,000 kredits\u003C/strong\u003E. A recent rescue mission yielded a 10,000 kredit salvage bonus because the shipwreck was a space shuttle cockpit. I\u0027ve also tried to decrease the money lost by trying to recover the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s\u003Cem\u003E (solid rocket boosters)\u003C/em\u003E by adding parachutes staged with the separators, but the chutes usually get destroyed by the aerodynamic forces or heat. When the next of these rescue contracts comes up \u003Cem\u003E(I\u0027ve been playing in the same in-game day for about a week and a half now while working on a sea plane base for Laythe).\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027m going to try not switching the parachutes deploy conditions setting to \u0022When Risky\u0022 and leave them set to \u0022When Safe\u0022, my instincts as a real astronautics engineer made me think that might be the problem. But if this doesn\u0027t work out it will certainly be cheaper just to write off the SRBs than to attach costly parachutes to them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you get a new Kerbal to torture...I mean help gain experience...out of the deal. But a word of warning, the vast majority Kerbals left stranded in Kerbin orbit by the in-game companies are pilots and engineers, with only about 1/6 being the more useful scientists. I do 3 or 4 of these rescues a week, whenever one of these contracts pops up, so I often have a lot of zero or one star pilots and engineers in my roster. I currently have about 13, and just 3 low level scientists from recent rescues, most of whom will be sent out on during a coming series of missions to the Jool system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother strategy for making money is to always have at least three contracts in the vicinity of a planet or moon before launching a a rocket to it. My personal record was I think 10 contracts fulfilled by a single craft (four of which I accepted after launch,\u00A0two of which\u00A0after the craft had been on station for years). It was a space station contract in orbit of Vall. I had a three star contract to place a space station in orbit and attach it a D-class asteroid, two three star contracts to move a D-class asteroid into orbit of Jool and Vall respectively \u003Cem\u003E(I fullfilled the Jool contract just by flying the asteroid into Jool\u0027s orbit on the way to Vall;\u00A0I thought that was a good catch on my part)\u003C/em\u003E, a rescue mission in orbit of Vall \u003Cem\u003E(the station included a tiny NERV propelled \u0022parasite\u0022 craft to return the rescued Kerbal to Kerbin)\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0a mission to place a \u0022satellite\u0022 in orbit of Vall \u003Cem\u003E(so I just added the required science instruments to the station and eventually parked it in the required orbit), \u003C/em\u003Eand a three star \u0022get science\u0022 contract in orbit of Vall\u003Cem\u003E. \u003C/em\u003EThis was a very large\u003Cem\u003E (for the pre-1.4 parts catalog) (and it was built before I discovered the trick of clustering smaller/cheaper engines using the\u003Cstrong\u003E offset tool\u003C/strong\u003E)\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0space station, and therefore required require a lot of of\u00A0S3-14400 tanks and Mammoth engines to get it into orbit, so the final craft cost came to around \u003Cstrong\u003E3 million kredits \u003C/strong\u003Eand another\u003Cstrong\u003E 1.5 million \u003C/strong\u003Efor the brand new at the time reusable asteroid mover;\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eit would have cost a lot more had I discovered the joys of clustering NUKs at that time. Now that was a significant portion of my war chest, about a quarter I think. But the 6 contracts I had at Vall before the launch had a total payout in the neighborhood of \u003Cstrong\u003E12 million kredits\u003C/strong\u003E. I should admit that this density of contracts was created through use of the debug menu.\u00A0I don\u0027t consider actively trying to get the contracts you want cheating; call it \u0022executive decision making\u0022. Anyway while the station was in transit to Jool, two more \u0022get science\u0022 contracts popped up; one in solar orbit and one in Jool orbit. These added another half million kredits to my war chest. And finally during two subsequent Jool launch windows I sent expansions built to contract requirements out to the station, for another 300,000 kredits combined (\u003Cem\u003Eone of them was a lowly one star contract)\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E. So this station eventually made me a profit of around \u003Cstrong\u003E11 million kredits\u003C/strong\u003E. It might have made me more, but then the asteroid shape definition bug emerged, and the station ended up encased in its asteroid about 20 in-game years after its initial launch. After the bug was fixed around 1.4.1, I deorbited the station and let it crash into Vall\u0027s surface. unfortunately\u00A0couldn\u0027t get the four 5 star scientists who were in the station\u0027s labs out. All the airlocks were covered by the rock and I couldn\u0027t get the camera to focus on the labs (also engulfed by the asteroid), so transferring crew was not possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy last tip is a cost saving measure I discovered a few years ago: Kerbals don\u0027t have to be inside of a cockpit or crew compartment during transit. They can stay in their space suits indefinitely, and only need to be protected from the heat and wind of reentry. So, rather than using a more realistic spacecraft to move them, particularly to return them to Kerbin after being rescued or completing their missions, simply seat them in External Command Seats mounted inside of cargo containers or service bays, and add a heat shield and parachutes to it. Lets say you have 16 Kerbals you need to return to Kerbin, and for the sake of this argument they\u0027re all coming from the same craft\u003Cem\u003E (Two real-time years ago I had a return\u00A0craft visit every moon of Jool to pickup Kerbals)\u003C/em\u003E. Now to move them the normal way, you\u0027d need either a MK-3 passenger cabin or some combination of other crew compartments. Lets say you opted to use the MK3, at a cost of \u003Cstrong\u003E30,000 kredits\u003C/strong\u003E. You would need to use a lot of fuel to move it, use the largest\u00A0sized heat shields \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(900 kredits)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, or the inflatable heat shield\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E (2400 kredits)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0a lot of other MK3 and larger diameter rocket parts, and a lot of parachutes. Your rocket is going to be jolly expensive. But if you use my \u0022sardine can\u0022 approach, you can get 16 external command seats \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(16*200 kredits = 3,200 kredits)\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Einto a 2.5 meter service bay\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E (500 kredits)\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E, use a\u00A0RC-L01 probe core for guidance \u003Cem\u003E(\u003Cstrong\u003E3,400 kredits\u003C/strong\u003E: The probe core is an absolute necessity; otherwise you\u0027d have a Kerbal sitting at some weird angle inside the bay trying to control the ship, making maneuvering impossible),\u003C/em\u003E a 2.5 meter battery\u003Cem\u003E (\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(248,249,250);\u0022\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E4,500 kredits) and either a bunch of solar panels or a NUK for power\u003C/font\u003E\u003Cem style=\u0022color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E (I prefer the NUK, they\u0027re expensive but you get the money back from recovering it) \u003Cstrong\u003E(23,300 kredits \u003Cu\u003EFULLY RECOVERABLE)\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003E, a 2.5 meter heat shield \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(600 kredits)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, four of the radially mounted parachutes placed around the circumference\u00A0of the crew portion \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E(4*400 kredits = 1,600 kredits)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and some fuel tanks an engines that probably won\u0027t be recovered but you will need far fewer than if you built the rocket around the MK3 passenger cabin. By treating Kerbals like fish fillets in olive oil, your entire return craft can cost less than the cost of the MK3 passenger cabin; especially if you use solar panels instead of a NUK. The trick is building the \u0022crew container\u0022: You start with the 2.5 meter service bay, then set the editor to place 8 radially positioned command seats on both the top and bottom inside surfaces of the service bay. Rotate the seats so the Kerbal\u0027s backs will be against the surface their seat is attached to and crown of heads facing out, and use the offset tool to place the seats completely inside the container. For best results, you\u0027ll want the advanced tweakables rigid connection and autostruct to the root part\u003Cem\u003E (the service bay) engaged\u003C/em\u003E. There are four downsides to this strategy: (1) You have to spacewalk the Kerbals in one at a time, (2) it increases your rocket\u0027s part count which can slow performance \u003Cem\u003E(especially\u00A0since the Kerbals count as a part when not inside something\u003C/em\u003E), (3) If you have one of the Kerbals leave their seat they\u0027ll be shot out like a bat out of hell and you\u0027ll have the devils own time getting them back there, and (4) you have to be really careful of the G-load during reentry, because if it goes too high the kerbals can be ejected from the contain.\u003C/font\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn summation: Moving asteroids and ferrying tourists are good reliable income sources that either don\u0027t require much upfront investment or can reuse the same craft. Low level rescue missions can turn comparably small by frequent profits, and a constant stream of new green guinea pigs to play with \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E*insert evil laugh*\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E. You can save money by treating Kerbals like sardines in a can. And recoup the cost of expensive missions by fulfilling multiple contracts with one craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
