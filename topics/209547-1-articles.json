I\u0027ve been able to do it manually and with MechJeb\u0027s land somewhere by aiming for an end of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E runway and considering anywhere on the runway \u0022on target\u0022, but I\u0027d like to do this a bit more precisely.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried MechJeb and TCA for this. MechJeb doesn\u0027t seem to handle the atmosphere with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, so lands short, and TCA descends at -10 m/s before slowing to a stop on touchdown, rather than doing a suicide burn (this takes too much fuel/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs this possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
