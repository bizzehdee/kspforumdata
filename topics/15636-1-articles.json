Proper as in having all buildings as 3d renders. Instead you will get some buildings on a city map texture. I doubt you will see 1 mill\u002B Kerbals walking round either. If you have programatically generated hamlets, you can get real buildings and Kerbals walking around like you see in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* A decent size village is still big enough to have visible Kerbal made landmarks and a runway to land at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Cities are serious... from an art direction it just does not fit well in my mind.
