Find where your ship will be 90 degrees ahead of the survey point, and place a maneuver node there. Mess with normal and anti normal to get the orbit passing directly over the point, and then once you hit 180 degrees from the point, lower your periapsis to just below 70km.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Elower your periapsis to just below 70km.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI Don\u0027t want to land, I need the craft to stay in orbit to do several surveys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:50:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not averse to using mechjeb\u0027s autopilots, my general \u0022quicjkand-dirty\u0022 approach was to use the Landing Guidance to attempt to land on the spot, and cancel its action after it made the plane change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T00:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022adinfinitum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022adinfinitum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Elower your periapsis to just below 70km.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tontow\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tontow\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI Don\u0027t want to land, I need the craft to stay in orbit to do several surveys.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can orbit dozens of times with your periapsis in the high 60s.
