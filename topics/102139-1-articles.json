It appears as if the main menu options are grayed out and unclickable since the last update. I run the game on windows 7 with no mods and I have also Tried to run the game in windowed mode, as administrator, compatibility mode (windows Vista, windows 7) Since I read online these would fix my problem but I had no luck with them. I even ran up to another thread in this forum in which a user had the same problem as me but his fix did not work for me.\n\nI run the **64**-bit version of the game but the problem **also** occurs on the **32**-bit version.\n\nI run version v0.90.0.705 Beta\n\nbuild id = 00705\n\n2014-12-15\\_13-42-05\n\nBranch: master\n\n My output\\_log.txt file is here: [https://www./?3czj97l4ao9x7ox](https://www./?3czj97l4ao9x7ox)\n\n![TaSvhLf.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/TaSvhLf.jpg)\n\nAnyone can help me with this matter?
