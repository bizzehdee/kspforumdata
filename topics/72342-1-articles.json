Is it possible to stack fuel tanks into each other with the parts clipping cheat and still having them distribute the fuel normally ? That way they wouldn\u0027t occupy much space and could be placed right at the center of mass. Or is there any other way to maintain the center of mass at the same place during the flight?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do you have tips for VTOL? Do they work better if they are perfectly vertical or should they have some sort of angle?
