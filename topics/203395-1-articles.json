This also means you can easily copy the Squad and SquadExpansion folders to your modded saves if you accidentally delete them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you considered using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to manage your mods?
