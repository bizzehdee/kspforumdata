They\u0027re constantly deciding what to add and what to omit. Tiers were already on the agenda so if it wasn\u0027t a barn it was going to be something else and the time spent on it would be essentially the same. It\u0027s all personal preference though. I prefer the barn to a military installation and others would like the opposite. In the end the devs have to do what they think would be best. I trust them. They\u0027ve made a pretty awesome game so far.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-12T17:41:35Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2015 05:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by bdito\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-12T16:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Daze\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Daze\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnother time, people will say: \u0022heeeeey it\u0027s ksp style funny!11\u0022\u003Cp\u003ETalking serious the game absolutely need a graphic overhaul and i REALLY hope that Squad use the collaboration with PorkJet to make this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not really saying that the realism style is better, (although IMO it is), I\u0027m saying that having a \u003Cem\u003Esingle \u003C/em\u003Esignature art style would be better than the current mix of high-mid-low-weird-LOLEXPLOSIONS graphical style.
