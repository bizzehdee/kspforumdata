I mean fully stationary?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I need to send the intended vehicle to a altitude of 2,868,750meters above the Kerbin surface at a speed of 1009m/s - 1009,1m/s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is correct right? ^^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway if it is correct then I have done this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever I tend to play within the same save file creating my own space programs universe over the course of Years, I said [Years]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the launch of my geostationary sattelites I spend 6 years into the simulation of my save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have 4 geostationary sattelites in what I thought would be geostationary orbits since these 6 years \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img560.imageshack.us/img560/6118/e7pk.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClick\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut these sattelites have taken distance towards each other. The sattelites whom I thought where stationary are moving closer to each other. Meaning that either 1,2,3 of them are moving towards each other since they all repositioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr all 4 of them did (probably that \u0026lt;\u0026lt;)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr away from each other making themselves closing in. They do not remain stationary from each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy my wishes they should each fullfill a quarter section of the orbiting space they rotate (if you know what I mean)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike a sliced pie in 4 quarters. Without one of the four sattelites overtaking one of the other geostationary sattelites. That is exactly how I launched them. Each of the 4 sattelites was intended to fullfill 45degrees of orbital space. But as you can see by the picture I posted none of them really fullfills that role anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is another picture with explanation in it \u003Ca href=\u0022http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/1513/0dls.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EClick\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis 4 sattelites GEO stationary system is to simulate earths geostationary sattelites to simulate a sattelite system that enables global communication. Other then that it really doesnt serve anything in case you were wondering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn simple terms I dont know what causes the instability. But I do suspect it has something to do with the fact that even although the sattelites are at the correct speed and at the correct height they are in fact\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enot following Kerbins equator evenly. Or in other words they have a slight 0.0.1.1.1.1.1 [fill in] difference in the orbiting plane that\u0027s causing them to reposition themselves disorderly closer to each other over the course of years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs that the case? might that be the case?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is the case how do I ensure optimal equatorial alignment? Can you guys give me the exact math involved up to the last decimal that KSP can process or give other parameters that ensures that my geostationary sattelites remain stationary for over 100 perhaps thousands\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof Kerbin years (if that\u0027s possible)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s not the case that equatorial alignment is the cause of the problem which I do suspect then what is the fix of this happening?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T00:33:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re aiming at synchronous orbits, I strongly recommend placing a very weak engine on the satellite and installing Kerbal Engineer Redux. KER gives a readout of your orbital position to within 0.1 of a second. If you\u0027re doing synchronous orbits, that means that they\u0027re in a 6 hour orbit, which would drift at most 146 seconds out of position (0.7%) in a terestrial year. Don\u0027t focus on your perapsis or apoapsis or orbital velocity other than getting them close. Then use the weak engine to fine tune the orbit to something close enough to a 6 hour orbit that KER doesn\u0027t report the difference. MechJeb can also be used, but the last time I checked, only reported orbital periods to a resolution of one second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Depending on the precision you can adjust it to, the variable max thrust part of tweakables may render the need to put a weak engine on the craft unnecessary, as you will be able to make any engine weak. But be aware that even 1 m/s will have a very significant effect (for these purposes) on the orbital period, so you\u0027ll still want to get as accurate an orbital period as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-17T00:36:12Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2013 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Eric S\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T00:47:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/62012-Cant-make-accurate-Geostationary-orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESomehow this one got through the filter twice.\u003C/a\u003E Locking this one, since it\u0027s the newer one.
