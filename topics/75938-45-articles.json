As long as the raycast hit something, it worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for steering, I\u0027m still experimenting with solutions for that. As we know, the repulsors create a zero-friction connection with the ground so if there\u0027s any slight slope to the surface you\u0027re on, gravity will take over and you will slip sideways. Turning the craft requires something similar to orbital maneuvers. You gotta not only thrust in the new direction, but also thrust in an opposite directly to the one you were previously moving in order to turn effectively. If we could slow the craft down during these maneuvers then we would reduce the amount of retro-thrust required. I\u0027ve experimented with using air-brakes (provided by a few of the aircraft expanding mods out there) to create this sort of effect, but in many cases I found that I had to fix air-brakes pointing in all directions so I could still turn the craft while trying to arrest my momentum. I\u0027ve also begun experimenting with RCS and a few mods that have a \u0022kill horizontal velocity\u0022 function to make it happen. The trouble is that all of these maneuvers require a lot of different modules to work in order to simply change your direction of movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end, I\u0027ve been spending much more time using wheels than repulsors.
