What does this mean for us who have already purchased? As more then likely stated in the e-mail, nothing. If you have already purchased KSP you own it and you will not be required to repay at any time with updates. When you purchase the game for how ever much you paid you essentially own KSP and with that free updates for the life of the product development. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those of you on the fence about purchasing Kerbal Space Program and are wondering why you seen the price all of a sudden sky rocket up to a new digit, as stated on the about page \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/about.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E, the team behind Kerbal Space Program have put into place a plan of action which allows you to invest in the development of the game as well as pre-order it. You can donate any amount towards the development but you have to pay a certain amount or above to officially own the game. At the current time of this message the game is currently going at $15.00 (USD), which means if you \\\u0027donate\\\u0027 $15.00 you automatically \\\u0027pre-order\\\u0027 the game, and with that you receive the current version available (At the time of this message it is 15.2). With the next update in the pipeline they are expecting the total amount to be $18.00 (USD). So, if you do not currently own Kerbal Space Program and you would like to save about $3.00 (USD) it would be to your best advantage to purchase the game now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the development of KSP the price will gradually increase so if you are on the fence about purchasing the game but enjoy it, I suggest that you purchase it now so you may get a discount off of the final product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027Is it worth it?\u0027 - That question can only truly be answered by yourself. At this current time the Demo version is 13.X and it only includes a handful of components to build with and it only supports certain modifications which are limited in function. If and when you purchase Kerbal Space Program you are granted access to which ever version that is available, which at the time of this message is 0.15.2, and with that version comes more components, celestial bodies, and factories. At this current time there is the \\\u0027Vehicle Assembly Building\u0027 (VAB) which is available in the Demo but there is also the \\\u0027Space Plane Hangar\\\u0027 (SPH) and the \\\u0027Tracking Center\\\u0027. With that you can run multiple missions at the same time. With the added components you are allowed access to an increased amount of mods ranging from Parts to Plug-ins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion it is highly worth it and it is possibly one of the best investments I have made, and to boot it only costed me $15.00 when the final product may cost $100.00.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not sure if there are any threads out there with the sole intention to supply information, just questions. I thought it might be best to make a thread that can hopefully be kept up to the top to answer some questions. If this doesn\\\u0027t really answer any questions, my apologies.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-13T09:02:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=15925.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=15925.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got no problem with a price increase. As the game gets deeper into development with higher requirements for more specific details, it grows a bit more important to bring on more staff and keep them around longer per day. I\\\u0027m pretty sure Nova and C7 who joined up with Squad recently aren\\\u0027t working for juice and cookies, though that would be an awesome bonus package, IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E$18 is still an awesome price considering the content we have already seen and are going to get with 0.16. That pays for everything included in the initial download, along with zero obligation to pay more for future updates and any mods provided by the community to expand the game even more for your experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have friends who are tight on cash, now is the time to encourage and aid them along in getting the game. If they say they don\\\u0027t have the time to play now, that\\\u0027s just a silly argument. Buy the game now, play later. Buying it now helps guarantee we can play later with fresh content yet to come. Yes, you still have to go through Paypal, but you don\\\u0027t have to deposit money in Paypal to do it. You can just use it as an intermediary and you don\\\u0027t have to worry about anything sitting in their barrels that they could just lock away from you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd most likely KSP will only be $30 at most for release. So even procrastinating that long won\\\u0027t hurt your wallet all that much. It\\\u0027s cheaper than a full tank of gas and gets you to places much further away than your car can go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"freibuis","CreatedById":17204,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-13T10:37:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebest DLC ever \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"freibuis","CreatedById":17204,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-13T10:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh crap I may have broken section 5 of the rules of this forum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8950.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8950.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-13T14:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022freibuis\u0022 data-cite=\u0022freibuis\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh crap I may have broken section 5 of the rules of this forum \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8950.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=8950.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can delete your posts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the topic, I do believe that once you have bought the game, you have bought the game.
