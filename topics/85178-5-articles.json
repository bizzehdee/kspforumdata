I don\u0027t have FAR or DRE installed at the moment. I\u0027ve got a bunch of other mods, however, but I\u0027ve been able to isolate these problems to Zero Point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E1. REALLY Long Ships\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens is, when you drop the booster that takes the fairing base with it, KSP still thinks the 2 elements (booster and payload) are connected. Thus, as the booster falls behind, the ship\u0027s effective length can quickly become many kilometers. Because the camera always locks on the CoM, as the booster falls behind the payload, the payload quickly disappears off the edge of the screen, and there\u0027s no way to see it again until the booster dies. If the booster isn\u0027t going to reenter, you have to go to the TC and terminate it before you can get the camera back on the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few updates ago, DRE had this same problem.

Fairings Destroying Payload\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one here seems related to the ongoing decoupler issues introduced in 0.24 I think. What happens is when I decouple the fairing, the top ends of the side pieces tip inboard and wipe off all small, fragile, protruding parts on the sides of the payload. Solar panels, SCANsat antenna, etc. This happens whether or not the rocket is under thrust at the time. And because the fairing parts are stock engine fairings, they don\u0027t all you to radially attack Sepratrons or whatever to them to make them fly away cleanly. This is IMHO the more serious problem of the 2 because.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I totally understand. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor #1: Wow, I never saw that in any of the testing.

The fairings would at least need the ModuleCargoBay module added, but I don\u0027t think that will be enough, since the current fairing panels and open ends don\u0027t have colliders for it to detect a threshold for whether an object is contained or not.

To have something similar for the future, it would almost be better to start over, and design the fairings to come apart in halves, rather than quarters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the VAB/SPH menu bug that was keeping us from having more than two lengths per base was still there as of 0.90.
