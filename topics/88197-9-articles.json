The particles would have to remain virtual, and be destroyed once again - then imparting their momentum onto space-time. Given space-time can stretch and be distorted, and move, this doesn\u0027t sound like a total impossibility, it simply raises the question then of what happens to space-time with momentum, and where does that momentum go? Is it absorbed by the nearest large space-time distortion, such as the earth, and if that\u0027s the case, how does motion and distance affect the power, and thus feasibility, of the drive?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK^2 clearly does have the right that it cannot be creating matter for free energy, and thus far, no matter of negative energy has been observed, even in the largest particle colliders, so it\u0027s not maintaining zero mass-energy exchange that way, which means it\u0027s not creating matter.

If there is independent verification by an outside reputable source, and we start seeing some peer-reviewed journal papers, minds will change.

A proper scientific mindset removes your desire from the results, because the greatest desire should always be the TRUTH. And the truth is, as awesome as a reactionless drive would be, it conflicts with centuries of science. I may not be an expert in the field, but when confronted with the \u0022explanation\u0022 on how these EM drives work, my understanding is that the real experts in quantum mechanics scoffed at the idea. I can\u0027t be an expert in every field, and so I have to trust in their judgement. I\u0027m not one of those people who, even though I have very little (or no) education in a field of study, is dumb enough to question the judgement of the actual experts in that field, and think I could possibly come up with something that they hadn\u0027t already thought of yet.

The excitations in these fields are called particles. For example, if you try to push off electromagnetic field, as you would from water, you produce photons which take the recoil. You just built a photon drive. You can do the same with gravitational waves. Which sounds all sorts of awesome, but gives you the same 1N / 300MW of power input. You can even push from fermion fields, producing particle-antiparticle pairs in your wake. That requires even more energy.\u003Cp\u003EThe reason things are so easy with water is because water already has mass. Vacuum is at zero point, and there is no way to bring it bellow zero point, so anything you do to push from it requires extra mass. And that is tons and tons of wasted energy. Efficiency that EMDrive demonstrates absolutely proves that what it pushes off from is a bunch of real, massive particles. Whether it\u0027s something from the environment, say, ionized upper atmosphere, or if it\u0027s something ejected from the craft, say a leak, there is a reaction mass.
