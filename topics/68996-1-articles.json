Neomorph is the best person I know of to explain it). Unfortunately the thread I got that information from vanished in the Great Forum Derp of 2013, so there is no way to confirm it... but I did do some experiments involving rover wheels, batteries and very specific masses when they first came out and found that it\u0027s pretty darned close (and also that there\u0027s some surprising bugs/issues/quirks with the rover wheels that mostly go unnoticed, but that\u0027s neither here nor there). You should be able to do the same if you really need to know. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I may digress for but a moment: the only real resource worth measuring is Snack Levels, as a closed loop life support system would function for a mere (estimated) 6-12 EU per kerbal per minute (assuming the less efficient Bosch reactor). A Sabatier reactor would require much less energy but would need constant hydrogen replenishment (read: sloooooowly sips liquid fuel) as it only utilizes half the hydrogen for water generation, requiring the rest to be dumped. If we assumed CMs contained enough liquid fuel dedicated to replenishing water and regenerative fuel cells to make enough power to provide that for life support as part of its design (which would help explain their noticeably disproportionate masses, but that\u0027s just a cognitive rationalization as to why parts are incredibly inconsistent), we would find that any non-Snack-based life support system have been made irrelevant. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, I really like your parts (I love the opening panels so we can see and poke at the guts with a stick!), and I get that there are people who like to micromanage everything they can, so for the sake of fun, you may have to abandon realism for consistency. Since 1 EU in a stored battery is 1 coulomb, you\u0027ll need to figure out how many volts the systems run on to calculate watts... which will likely reveal a noticeable disconnect between stock kerbal parts and the life support parts as the kerbalverse is a wee bit different from ours.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
