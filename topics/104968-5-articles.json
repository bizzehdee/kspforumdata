Diving into gravity wells with a refinery on your back is only efficient in pint-sized kerbin. Anyone playing beyond beginner mode (stock) on a 3.2/6.4/10/RSS game will not be mining anything from the surface of planets/moons.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EOh, we\u0027ll probably get RealISRU pretty soon after 1.0 releases. If someone else doesn\u0027t do it, I will. It won\u0027t be anything like stock, but you\u0027ll be able to refuel in a realistic manner using CO2, oxygen, methane, and argon products. You are correct that the \u0022refinery on your back\u0022 scenario is silly, especially when the resource you\u0027re using is essentially unicorn poop, but there is at least one study I\u0027ve seen showing that 750kg of equipment can refuel a craft from ice products. We already have Sabatier equipment and are well into testing methane/LOX engines. ISRU is not a far-fetched concept it\u0027s just that most stock-alike implementations (EPL, immensely fun as it is, comes to mind) succumb to incredibly wishful thinking.\n"}]}
