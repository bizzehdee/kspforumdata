We were working hard to solve this and now I have to announce that in this week we will be migrating all the site to another server that we hope will be able to bear all the traffic.\n\nMaybe during the week you\u0027ll see that the site goes down, so we ask you for your patience and understanding while this happens.\n\nWhen everything returns to normal, we will notify you.\n\nCheers.\n\n//------- EDIT ------//\n\nSorry guys. This week was impossible to do the migration, so it\u0027ll be next week. \n\nEnjoy the site for one more weekend! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"gta-man","CreatedById":1702,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-26T23:40:35Z","Content":"Thats nice to know k:D"},{"CreatedByName":"ledo1222","CreatedById":1363,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-27T00:06:20Z","Content":"Good to know ill pack my stuff.\n\n[glow=red,2,300]-Loads rocket\u0027s-[/glow]"}]}
