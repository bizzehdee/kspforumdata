I\u0027m going to research the parts and use their exact specifications using procedural tanks and real fuels. The problem, as I was replicating the V2 rocket I couldn\u0027t find an engine that fit my exact specifications, so I was wondering, what mods replicate historical rocket parts. I looked at the realism overhaul page, but I\u0027m not interested in non historical rocket engines, and I am sure there are some historical mods that the RO page is missing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T03:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaerobee has the A-4 parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFASA and Saab\u0027s Historical Pack have early through 70s US parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRaidernick\u0027s various rocket mods have Soviet parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally, just look into Realism Overhaul, and the mods we suggest--some are \u0027generic\u0027 partmods, like KW Rocketry, but some are real-part partmods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jamgoth","CreatedById":93845,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-04T03:05:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay thanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
