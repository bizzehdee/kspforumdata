I, too, thought this would be a Good Thing. Sadly, KSP seems to have its own ideas about what symmetry I \u0022should\u0022 be using in the SPH--and that symmetry, apparently, is RADIAL. Whether that\u0027s what I think I \u0022should\u0022 want or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe design I have in mind uses FL-series LFO tanks, which admittedly are \u0022rocket\u0022 parts rather than \u0022plane\u0022 parts. This may be contributing to the issue. At any rate, during the build process there comes a point where KSP \u0022automagically\u0022 switches me over to radial symmetry with no action on my part...and then it becomes impossible to switch it back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do know about the \u0022R\u0022 key binding to toggle symmetry. I can guarantee that I have NOT touched it when this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I hit the \u0022R\u0022 key after KSP auto-toggles to radial symmetry... No joy. Sure, it \u0022works\u0022 in that KSP gives me a \u0022Mirror symmetry\u0022 message and changes the symmetry icon from dot to square. All as expected and as it should be. However, the instant I try to attach a new part, *POOF* the icon changes back, the \u0022Radial symmetry\u0022 HUD message appears, and that\u0027s how the new part insists on attaching. And NOTHING after that seems to make any difference--I toggle back to Mirror symmetry, try to place a part, and the symmetry mode changes itself back to radial as soon as the new part attaches. (Grrrrr!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe overall behavior is similar to the longstanding VAB behavior that once a \u0022core\u0022 part has something radially attached in, say, 4-fold symmetry, EVERYTHING radially attached to that part will have 4-fold radial symmetry. Except that I am certain I am not doing anything to \u0022set\u0022 anything on the craft to radial symmetry--KSP is doing that all by its lonesom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs already noted, I am using FL-series \u0022rocket\u0022 LFO tanks (better mass fraction than Mk2 tanks, and fewer joint-stiffness issues than Mk3 tanks), and of course there are rocket engines involved (it\u0027s a spaceplane, after all; it needs to operate in orbit, y\u0027know). The issue MAY be initially appearing when I first attach a rocket engine to a FL tank; I have yet to stay calm enough while in the SPH to do the requisite experimentation. (If so, the obvious workaround would be to place the rocket engines last. Except that balancing the CoL vs CoM would seem to demand all engines be placed prior to finalizing the wing design/position...at least, that\u0027s the only way I\u0027ve ever had success with spaceplanes to date.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, three questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Has anyone else seen this, or am I the first?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Is this a \u0022bug\u0022, or is it a deliberate \u0022feature\u0022 for some (incomprehensible to me) reason?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Is there a known fix/workaround?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor now, I\u0027m considering using Mk2 parts just to see what happens, despite their sucky fuel/structure mass ratio (and this is SUPPOSED to be a refueling tanker, so a less-than-ideal mass fraction is particularly irksome to me).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T21:47:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Claw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ereworded for clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cerberus738","CreatedById":100744,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T20:46:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve only seen that happen when I load a craft started in the VAB into the SPH. sorry not much help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T20:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI saw this exact same thing myself when I tried to attach something with mirror symmetry to parts that were themselves attached to the core with radial symmetry.

That operation works okay, but if anything is then attached to that subassembly (axially, at least), the auto-toggle to radial symmetry occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPotentially of note: the subassembly was also created in the SPH. There is no VAB \u0022contamination\u0022 anywhere in this build. (I did, however, call the subassembly \u0022Temp\u0022, which overwrote the previous \u0022Temp\u0022...which WAS built in the VAB. Again, no idea if that name retains its VAB connection somehow, or whether that is/isn\u0027t contributing to the issue.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I directly attached a single FL-T tank (not subassembly) to the core, mirror symmetry was retained--and I could attach more parts to it without invoking \u0027radial symmetry auto-toggle\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I begin to think this is a bug.

The upshot appears to be that the \u0027radial symmetry auto-toggle\u0027 is invoked by attaching a part to a member of a subassembly which was itself attached using mirror symmetry. I cannot imagine this being anything other than a bug. Though, all things considered, probably not an immensely high priority bug.
