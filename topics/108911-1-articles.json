But be careful: because the atmospheric pressure is fighting the rocket engine\u0027s ability to push out its exhaust, engine efficiency is dependant on atmospheric pressure. All engines only reach their full potential once in a vacuum. And some engines, especially those that are really vacuum-optimized and have the best stats, perform really really badly inside an atmosphere, or have low thrust... or both.

Their low profile make them good choices for landing with the basic landing legs, and they\u0027re quite light as well.

It\u0027s really indispensable for any serious rocket designer. The most important things to pay attention to are each stage\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003ETWR\u003C/strong\u003E (Thrust to Weight Ratio) and \u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv\u003C/strong\u003E (delta-vee or \u0027change in velocity\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good rocket design will have around 1.3 to 1.8 TWR in its lower stages. Any TWR above 1 is enough to push you up away from Kerbin. More than 1.5 to 2 TWR for a rocket probably means you\u0027ll be throttling your engines back to prevent going too fast low in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv number shows you how much \u0022change in speed\u0022 your rocket will produce. It helps to know that reaching LKO (Low Kerbin Orbit) requires ~4000 \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv, and from LKO to Mun takes about 1200. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.skyrender.net/lp/ksp/system_map.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis chart\u003C/a\u003E is old (the bodies with atmospheres are out of date as of game version 1.x and later), but still quite useful for mission planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs your rocket lifts, its TWR (within a given stage) will increase, for two reasons. First, you\u0027re lifting less and less mass as you burn fuel, so the Thrust is pushing against less Weight. Second (as of game version 1.x and later), as you rise through the atmosphere your engines will actually produce \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E thrust as the relative pressure of the atmosphere decreases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor these reasons, it\u0027s normal to throttle back as each stage burns. But ideally your design starts each stage at full throttle. Lifting engines that aren\u0027t firing (or aren\u0027t firing at 100%) is inefficient (you could just use fewer engines pushing harder).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mention that you thought you might need more engines higher in your orbital trajectory. The opposite is actually true. As your rocket\u0027s mass decreases, and as your distance from Kerbin climbs, you need \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E thrust to continue your ascent. Generally speaking your engines will grow more efficient, produce more thrust, Kerbin\u0027s gravity will exert less pull on you, and you\u0027ll experience less atmospheric drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou want the most thrust right at the launch pad, when you\u0027re lifting the full weight of your craft against the full pull of Kerbin\u0027s gravity, through the densest part of the atmosphere. And you still don\u0027t want a TWR of over about 1.8.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou mentioned some control problems higher in your flight. This might be for several reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou could be going too fast for the altitude you\u0027re at, increasing aerodynamic instability.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYour rocket\u0027s Center of Mass might be shifting backward toward the engines as you burn fuel, increasing your aerodynamic instability. This is hard to avoid, it just means you need more vectoring or some fins at the rear.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EYou might have a lack of control authority if you\u0027re relying on aerodynamic control surfaces over about 20km altitude, because the atmosphere thins out (so fins and things don\u0027t work so well).

Above 20km the atmosphere is thin enough that you can turn without too much trouble. Then push East until your apoapsis rises over 75km (mouseover it in map mode and watch it rise). Then coast to near apoapsis and burn facing prograde (directly east along the horizon) to circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA slightly more efficient trajectory might turn 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or so to the east directly off the launch pad, and hold that heading until over 20km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly though, it seems like you\u0027re having trouble with early-game rocket efficiency, which is normal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s pretend we have one of the tall thin FL-T800 fuel drums and the basic T45 vectored engine. It\u0027s going to go straight up quite quickly (probably too fast) until it burns out, but not nearly reach orbit. If we put, in radial symmetry, three radial decouplers and three more FL-T800 fuel tanks, each with their own engine, around it, and have all the engines fire at once, \u003Cem\u003Eall of the engines are going to burn for the same duration and run out of fuel at the same time\u003C/em\u003E. They\u0027ll produce even more too-much thrust, but we\u0027re not going to get significantly higher. It\u0027s true we can run them at a lower throttle, but pushing the rocket at 1/4 throttle with 4x as many engines isn\u0027t going to gain us much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we made it 6x radial, using the same design, all of our engines would still burn out at the same time, we wouldn\u0027t get much higher, and this craft almost certainly can\u0027t make orbit. At this point we\u0027re lifting insanely too much engine to do the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s build the same rocket, a central \u0022core\u0022 tank and engine, then 3x radial tanks with engines, and then a \u003Cem\u003Esecond set\u003C/em\u003E of 3x radial tanks and engines. Then set the staging such that the first set of radial \u0022boosters\u0022 fires first (lifting the whole craft on 3 engines). Then decouple the first set of 3 boosters and fire the second set. (still lifting the craft on 3 engines). Then decouple the remaining boosters and light the central \u0022core\u0022 engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis still isn\u0027t a particularly efficient design, but it\u0027s going to get much farther with exactly the same parts as our example above, because it allows us to generate thrust for a \u003Cstrong\u003Elonger duration\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich gives us one of the secrets.

I\u0027m sure there are threads explaining it on the forums, and some of my craft design notes (linked above) utilize it. In Asparagus, you light all of the engines at once, but use fuel lines to pull the fuel from the outer stages to the inner stages, such that the outermost boosters get discarded when empty, leaving the inner stages full of fuel for as long as possible. This stretches out burn time of the core stages, and lets you discard spent fuel tanks and engines as they\u0027re no longer useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo asparagus-ify our example above, we\u0027d put all the engines in the bottom stage (so all 7 fire off the pad), and we\u0027d run fuel lines from the \u0022first\u0022 set of 3 boosters to the second set, and from the second set to the core. So the first 3 fuel tanks are fueling all 7 engines (and will be depleted very quickly). Then we stage them away, getting rid of the empty fuel tanks \u003Cem\u003Eand the engines that were lifting them\u003C/em\u003E, leaving us with less mass and fewer engines (a more balanced TWR), and all our remaining fuel tanks are all full. Next the remaining 3 booster tanks are fueling 4 engines, and finally we have 1 full tank with 1 engine as our core stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing all 7 engines off the pad is going to give us a massive TWR for the example craft.
