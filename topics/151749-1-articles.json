These actions are gone now. Everyone who transported rovers with rockets knows that it is imperative to disable the motors while on rockets or they suck all electricity. Please re-add the actions for activate, deactivate and TOGGLE (new) the rover wheel motors.

Is it possible to turn their motors all the way down, in lieu of power toggles? Do they still suck power if the parking brake is on? Does a docking port set to \u0022disable crossfeed\u0022 stop EC transfer?
