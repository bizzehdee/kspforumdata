(through what we were shown) reveals that we will still be building rockets before we build planes.\u00A0 Why was this decision made, and what went into making that decision?\u00A0 Is it because the game is supposed to primarily be about rockets and space, or is it because the (perception of the) majority of fans/players of the game are more interested in rockets?\u00A0 Or did you just have to make a decision and here we are?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll throughout the video, Tom continuously talked about making decisions on what nodes to collect, and then at the end he was talking about having nodes open on tiers that are prior to the one you are focused on.\u00A0 This, coupled with the ingenuity of players, can make parts obsolete before you even get to them.\u00A0 As an example, I recently created a lander that had no legs, which makes landing legs pointless if I go that route.\u00A0 I know other players have done things that make parts obsolete (I\u0027m looking at those nano-crystalline players who made it to Jool without upgrading any buildings in KSP1).\u00A0 Will there ever be a way to hide parts you don\u0027t want to use, or to hide nodes you will never purchase?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTom had to actually go onto the surface of Kerbin to collect the surface sample, which is a change from KSP1 (where you only had to exit the pod and could hang on the ladder even well above the surface and get the sample).\u00A0 While I like the change, I\u0027m just curious if this is now the standard?\u00A0 Will we still be able to get samples while hanging on the ladder, or was that changed in KSP2?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpeaking of data and science, Tom transmitted what he could back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and then took the actual sample itself upon recovery.\u00A0 Are we going to be required to transmit reports back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, or can we just bring them all home\u00A0with us?\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn this note, I\u0027m curious about what happens when we transmit data back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E under different situations, such as time warp.\u00A0 Will that actually work?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAre we allowed to spend transmitted science points immediately, or do we have to wait for the ship that sent them to get back?\u00A0 Would be nice to be able to in the event we need parts for a rescue mission.\u00A0 Not that anyone has ever had to rescue Kerbals.\u00A0 Just saying.\u00A0 Or something.\u00A0 Look - snacks over there!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAnd while Tom stated this, that was far too many science points for a simple launch.\u00A0 More than 100?\u00A0 It takes massive grinding to get that many around the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in KSP1.\u00A0 Will this be corrected prior to the release?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI didn\u0027t see any heat effects during Tom\u0027s descent back to the surface of Kerbin, even though he was traveling rather rapidly prior to parachute deployment.\u00A0 We have been told that heat and atmospheric effects would be included with 0.2.\u00A0 Has something changed?\u00A0 Or did Tom simply get lucky enough to not generate them due to altitude and speed?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTom and Nate both mentioned dozens of discoverables around the Kerbolar system.\u00A0 I\u0027m curious to know if there are any clues given in-game as to their locations?\u00A0 Will we get some kind of music, or cut-scenes, or even messages to let us know we might be close?\u00A0 As someone who hasn\u0027t ever even seen the Mun arch in-game (with over 1000 hours played), it would be rather disappointing to not be able to find these in-game (and I\u0027m not very good at just wandering about and getting lucky).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTom and Nate both mentioned potential challenges, and to me they both sounded like the Caveman Challenge from KSP1.\u00A0 I\u0027m wondering if the introduction of Science here will force part count or weight limits at any point?\u00A0 In KSP1, before you upgrade anything, you are limited to 18 tons and 30 parts; will KSP2 ever have anything like this?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWill there be a way to review previously collected science reports?\u00A0 In KSP1 we can do this (somewhat) so we can see where we have gone previously and avoid going there again unless we really want to.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll told, the video was good.\u00A0 Can\u0027t wait for the 19th!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022
