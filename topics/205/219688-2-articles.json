Part of the problem is that the player doesn\u0027t really have any engineering tools to control those joints, or the ability to make any of the engineering tradeoffs that could be used IRL. We\u0027ve got lego bricks, and the bricks go together as the developers designed, and we have no ability to sneak in with a bit of superglue to fuse that lego together.

They just explode. And usually they don\u0027t because they\u0027re designed by engineers who know what they are doing. Wobble is the way the game gives feedback that you\u0027re flying an unsound design. People freak out when their rocket, shaped like a hot air balloon, flips over when they yank it to a 45\u00B0 angle at 10km. Imagine the complaints of people when their rocket explodes \u003Cem\u003Efor no reason.\u003C/em\u003E Oh yes, the reason is there: your design is too slender, there\u0027s too much weight on top, you\u0027re using way too much control authority, etc. But now the game doesn\u0027t give any visual clues up to that point, just \u003Cem\u003Eboom\u003C/em\u003E. Can we have rockets that don\u0027t wobble? Yes, but it would either be not fun (the rapid unplanned disassembly), or, ironically, unrealistic (build and fly what you want without regards for real life physics).

If its a realism decision, then the player should have realistic means by which to address it. If its not intended to be either and its just a passive side effect of the simulation, then I\u0027m of the opinion that the aspects of a simulation that cannot be influenced by the player should not be hostile to the players goals \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cryptobux","CreatedById":230559,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-30T01:57:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Nate says, \u0022that work is ongoing right now, so we should have some cool stuff to show you soon\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat he means by\u00A0\u0022cool stuff\u0022, and \u0022soon\u0022 can be only be guessed at, informed by looking at his track record so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-30T15:04:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224326709\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219688\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221696027236\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002259068\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022asmi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, asmi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProcedural fuel tanks would solve a lot of those issues, as each of those tanks will actually be a single rigid body, with no need for any welding.
