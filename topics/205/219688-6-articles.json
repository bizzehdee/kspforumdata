Because I don\u0027t think so. Any more than one should prevent any flex, but because of the way the construction works in-game, the only solution for multiple attachments are struts. And honestly, one strut per radially attached part is enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI always read \u00221 attachment point\u0022 and people complain about it (not you, it\u0027s just that it crossed my mind when I read what you wrote). But, it is not 1 attachment point. It is 1 joint. That\u0027s a difference! A joint is what the software uses to calculate and predict the relation between two parts. That\u0027s all. If you stack and bolt 2 tanks on top of each other, you may use 100 bolts in reality and you still have just 1 joint in the game. That\u0027s fine, because this 1 joint simulates the behavior of all those 100 bolts which form \u0022the connection\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my first point is, that it is irrelevant how many \u0022attachment points\u0022 we have. But just how good those simulate reality. That\u0027s also why it is perfectly fine to use chains of Rigidbodys connected via ConfigurableJoints to simulate a rocket. The only problem is the flaw or design choice (maybe it is not even a flaw, we could debate this... but for now it is what we have to work with) which makes joints enormously weak, if the weights of the connected parts are not equal enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is built on top of that system. That\u0027s why the game needs to handle this (in the background in my opinion). You don\u0027t want that you have to design your ships in a special manner, just because of the engine which does not simulate the stuff correctly. Therefor we need a fix in the game, which does this, preferably without the player remarking anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd by the way... I often hear stuff like \u0022we don\u0027t want workarounds\u0022 and stuff like that. But did you know that in KSP 1 parts were sometimes non physical parts and then turned into physical parts when it was needed? ... you could say, that this is also a \u0022workaround\u0022. It could be that this idea could also be used to solve the wobbly rocket problems in KSP 2. But... I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s an easier solution to implement...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Infinite Aerospace","CreatedById":230192,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-09T17:08:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, I feel I have to share an experience.

In real world we would have a huge amount of tools and options to fix issues with structural integrity. In the game we have only struts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is true, and got me thinking and doing some digging. I went through the code myself and noticed that the current implementation is only using configurable joints. There\u0027s definitely good arguments for that, probably the best one being the connected anchor and primary and secondary axis that you can set, as well as limiting rotation and motion between parts to some degree, but it\u0027s also prone to buggyness, and thus wobble.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne option would be, that in case of vertically stacked parts, you could use the fixed joint. But the problem there is then that there\u0027s no wobble whatsoever. I think most people wouldn\u0027t mind that, for obvious reasons, but then you lose certain aspects that make the games physics simulation so fun. For example, you would expect a massive rocket, consisting only of small fuel thanks to eventually collapse in on itself, because that\u0027s just bad design, and fixing it all in place with fixed joints would cause it to be really stable, whereas reality wouldn\u0027t exactly agree with that. In that case, it\u0027s not the joints between the parts that are flexing, but the parts themselves, and replacing all parts with a soft-body (to a certain degree) probably isn\u0027t the way to go either.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne other aspect to consider is clipping. Configurable Joints in Unity allow you to give an offset on the rotation and position of an object, and the engine would then use provided spring and damping values to try and keep it there, unless other forces (drag, collisions, gravity, thrust...) act on it. Fixed joints can\u0027t solve that problem, the only alternative would be to parent the gameobjects, but then you have overlapping colliders, and external forces couldn\u0027t break these things apart in any natural way, it would have to be coded, which would again result in several different sets of the rules of physics. Another way would be to use procedural meshes for the colliders, but that would create a big performance hit, and would be a mess to sync up in multiplayer, as well as pose a bunch of challenges when it comes to texturing and normal mapping.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure the devs have already explored all these options, and are indeed working to make things more stable. From what I\u0027ve seen, with a decent ascent profile, and a good amount of struts, you could launch the ISS in one go on a rocket and you would get there. But IRL that would be an aweful choice, there\u0027s a reason why it was assembled in orbit. For the time being, I think we\u0027re stuck with the wobble, at least until all the forces on the joints are properly configured, but that\u0027s part of optimisation and is expected to take some time in EA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rudolf Meier","CreatedById":176740,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-10T12:08:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224329349\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219688\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221696930386\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022230798\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NH4Cl Enthusiast\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, NH4Cl Enthusiast said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust copy ... or KJR.

Often catastrophically. At this point my vote is to echo what @regex says and implement node to node welding of parts of the same size or cross section.
