Last time I\u00A0played was maybe 3 weeks ago and I\u00A0was running the game\u00A0heavily modded but stable. I came back to it recently and at first my PC would\u00A0bluescreen before I\u00A0even got to the loading screen. I\u00A0thought I\u00A0had a bad stick of ram,\u00A0but my ram checks out. I then deleted all the mods and verified the game files, but the blue screen still plagued me. Now I\u0027ve gone as far as deleting it off my SSD and reinstalling fresh on a separate HDD. Now It starts and loads up but at low resolution and minimum\u00A0settings. When I\u00A0change settings in-game it either freezes or black-screens indefinitely. Last thing I\u00A0tried was changing the res settings in\u00A0the Config file but I get a black screen again before it hits the load screen. I\u0027m at a loss as to what the problem is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUPDATE: I\u0027ve forced it to run in OpenGL and I\u00A0can now run at full specs, but I\u0027d rather not lose the visual benefits of DirectX and I would like to find a more elegant fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-17T08:09:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2016 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by TheHoodedYanker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
