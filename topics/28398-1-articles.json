Like the Whack A Kerbal. (Alt-F3 Debug menu, click show Whack-A-Kerbal, press Middle Mouse Button to fire) It it really cool to see Space Station One destroyed by those balls. I do kind of wish thier velocity would be dependent on wether or not the navball is saying Orbit, Surface, or Target when the objects are launched. I also really enjoy the KSPX parts. I hope to see more from Claira. I think more updates should focus a bit more on just parts. plenty of parts. Of course, not without the new features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T11:31:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI, too, enjoy playing with my balls in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-23T13:23:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol aphox.
