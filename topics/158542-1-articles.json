Some of what we know as basics of midgame research are unavailble because they cost more than 550, which is severe in a tech tree that puts the upper 60% of tech at 550-10k science cost. The research limit of 500 thus really cripples my progress. I have already tried looking around for a way to change the limits, but found non, so here\u0027s my question to the community: does anyone know any way to change the limits of buildings?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-01T20:05:20Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2017 08:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by kendov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nakedchef","CreatedById":147096,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T20:29:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHave you tried upgrading the R\u0026amp;D Center?

The problem I\u0027m talking about is that the limit of 500 is not representative of the 2/3 mark in the stock game. in Stock KSP, there isn\u0027t as much to research beyond that, but ETT and KSPI expand the upper limit a lot, it\u0027s simply blown out of proportion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-01T20:48:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/01/2017 08:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by kendov\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nakedchef","CreatedById":147096,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-01T21:18:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think there is a easy way to raise the cap.
