If so, build a small depot station up in Mun orbit, dock your transport ships there, and after you transfer all the fuel they have left into the station, decouple the transport engine/tanks, along with activating a series of those tiny srb\u0027s setup so they fire in reverse to the stations orbit. The now debris parts now fall to the mun and destroy themselves on impact. Then you attach your orbital tug up there to the payload, then move the payload under the lander transport. Dock the tug, launch the lander, land at the mun base, drop the payload off, position the payload where you want it, hook it up, then either leave the lander at mun base until your next tranport arrives at the station, or send it back to the station now, dock it, refuel and wait.

Quick tire repair and he was on his way again, however the walls of the crater proved to be too steep for him to get the rover out. So after managing to travel 38km from the lander he abandoned the rover, used his eva jets to get out of the crater and to a large flat area, and called Jeb in the lander to come pick him up. Jeb and Bill then flew the lander 1km off the surface of the Mun at horizontal speeds that topped 200m/s, successfully landed 200 meters from Bob, picked him up, and then returned to Kerbin. There was a moment of panic during the flight to pick up Bob, when they realised that the lander was not generating any power and the batteries were down to a charge of 80-90 (from 720) thanks to the lights and SAS being on, AND a solar eclipse happening during the entire flight thanks to Kerbin. Current lander has LV-909s for engines, which you know does not generate power, hence the reason why they were so low on power (and the lights had been on for about 20-30 mins during the eclipse already).

So I detached my transfer and science stages and deorbited back to Kerbin. 3rd launch was success and I went to the Minmus. While landing on Minmus I used a bit more fuel than I wanted to, but I did all the science I could on that Mission and set course back to Kerbin.
