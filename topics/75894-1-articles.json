When I first started playing I seem to remember it would center around the cockpit and any movement you would make would revolve around the cockpit. This made sense to me and I liked it that way. Somewhere along the way, however, I\u0027ve managed to shift the view to centering over the middle of my craft (I think it\u0027s center of mass but not sure). It\u0027s usually just in the \u0027middle\u0027 though which is frustrating for longer crafts. How can I fix this? I\u0027ve tried the \u0027control from here\u0027 button but that doesn\u0027t do anything. Middle mouse button doesn\u0027t do it. Can\u0027t find anything in the key bindings nor on Google that addresses this problem. Anyone know?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechnicalK3rbal","CreatedById":86903,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T02:05:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMiddle mouse only works when you drag it, similar to changing the rotation.
