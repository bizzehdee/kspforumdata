In order for the drogues to have sufficient time after deployment to slow the vehicle down, the landing site needs to be at a low altitude. The previous two Expedition missions used mare/ former sea beds. This does not rule out a landing location that is outside of roving distance of scientifically significant sites.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeology:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding sites must have access to broad rock strata, so as best to analyse Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s geological history. Former lake/sea shores, canyons, mountainous regions and craters may be places that fulfil the geological requirements. Finding old terrain would be preferable - anywhere with a crater nearby would indicate that the land hasn\u0027t been renewed for eons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrology:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna was once a wetter planet. In order to understand how this water was lost, a landing site that was once host to significant bodies of water \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 and perhaps still does in the form of permafrost \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 is necessary. To have a good chance of finding permafrost, a non-equatorial landing site is required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmosphere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile not a primary criteria for landing site choice, a region with access to significant terrain elevation is desirable. This is so that a comparative climate study can be made at different altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerrain Types:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECanyons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECanyons that open up to low lying plains would be suitable if it could be determined that they were created using water rather than volcanic flows. There would be good science opportunities for the geology and hydrology mission objectives, although direct sampling of higher canyon strata may be difficult due to canyon wall steepness. For the same reason, fulfilling the climate mission objectives may also be difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraters:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrater lakes can be determined by looking for water drainage channels. Significant disruption of terrain is inevitable, making analysis of Duna\u0027s geological past more difficult. Crater wall steepness presents the same issues as that of canyon walls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMountain Ranges:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMountains could concievably fulfil all mission objectives if it were determined that water flowed between them in a significant way. A landing site at the foot of the mountains would be required, leading to a longer and therefore more hazardous rover sojourn. DRO would need to determine a safe path of ascent for the rover prior to landing at such a site.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESea/Lake Shores:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese locations are safe landing sites, as proved by the previous two Expedition Class landings. It would need to be proved that the sea/lake was created using hydrological rather than volcanic processes (although the Expedition Mission 2 site featured evidence for both). A shoreline with significant elevation from the seabed would fulfile the geolgy and climate mission objectives, although, like the Mountain sites, long sojourns would be required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DunaRocketeer","CreatedById":103193,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T16:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPics of the launch using my Light Class Launcher\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/69XHK\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Landing at Rift Zone would therefore create a much better picture of how that region evolved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERift Zone possesses all the pros and cons of Valles Excelsior except a lack of highland terrain close by. This needs to be balanced by the benefits of getting a more complete picture of the West Equatorial Sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESite D\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA low latitude volcanic plain hereafter referred to as The Snowbowl\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt has all the positive features of Deep South Crater, with the additional benefit of an easier landing site and direct access to the South Polar cap without traversing difficult terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike Deep South, the main issue with The Snowbowl is its very low latitude.

This left the core module of the lander and the ion propulsion return stage for the flight back to Kerbin. After a rest period, Jeb made ready for departure from Duna, and began the series of burns that would send him on the long fall sunwards, back home to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/h3IB5\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

As he saw Duna recede in his window, he felt a tinge of sadness contrasting with the knowledge that every second would bring him closer to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe departure burn was sufficiently accurate that only a very minor course correction after exiting Duna SOI was required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe journey back was not nearly as active as the outbound trip. The science and exploration aspect of the mission was over, and Jeb\u0027s routine consisted of spacecraft maintainence and preparing for the Kerbin aerobrake manoeuvre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs Kerbin neared, Discovery dived into its gravity well at 3km/s. He prepared the spacecraft for the dip into the upper atmosphere, the last critical phase of the mission. The deceleration caused by atmospheric drag captured the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit. After the ion engines raised the periapsis out of the atmosphere, its work was done, and was jettisoned. All that was left of the Expedition Spacecraft was the tiny capsule with limited propellant and battery capacity, but that was all that was needed to perform a rendezvous with The new Kerbin Gateway Station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking with the station was nearly trouble free, aside from a slight deviation from the approach path near the end of the docking run. This was quickly corrected. With that, the Expedition Spacecraft had completed its mission. No spacecraft in the history of the space program had accomplished so much, and it was with mixed feelings that Jeb closed the hatch to Discovery\u0027s habitation capsule after entering the station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithin hours a shuttle would be launched into a fast rendezvous trajectory, and if all went to plan, Jeb would see the first Kerbal in years.

After two hours, the shuttle was docked. Jeb, who hadn\u0027t seen a fellow Kerbal for the entire duration of his mission, was overjoyed to see his old friend Bill, who had specially requested to fly this shuttle mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn arrival at the station, Jeb had conducted simulations of shuttle landings to make sure that his flying skills were sharp. He also stepped up his excercise regimen, so that he could cope better with the full Kerbin gravity he was about to experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoon though, it was time for Jeb to depart, and with a few thruster firings the shuttle backed away from the station. After taking an orbit to ready the shuttle for re-entry, Jeb flipped the spacecraft around and performed a 1 minute 9 second de-orbit burn. He was now irrevocably on course for a return to Kerbin. As the superheated air glowed around his spacecraft, he performed a series of long s-curves to scrub off speed, and as the spaceraft descended through 10km altitude he fired up the turbofans to stabilize his descent rate. He kept the shuttle fairly level until he cleared the mountain range near KSC, after which, he started throttling down the engines and aligning the shuttle to KSC Runway 01. At the runway threshold, he flared the shuttle, and smoothly touched down. Jeb was home, he would later recall; \u0027it didn\u0027t feel real, I had been in space so long, it was surreal to be back on Kerbin again...\u0027. Taxiing the spacecraft to the spaceplane hanger, he found a group of fellow astronauts who welcomed him home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It was the longest, most ambitious mission to date, and the science return was phenominal.
