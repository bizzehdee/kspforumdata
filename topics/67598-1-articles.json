If you subtract the mass of fuel and the standard corresponding empty tank mass (the fuel\u002Btank component happens to be equivalent to an orange tank) from the engine, you get an engine with 2000 kN thrust, 6 t mass, and 320/360 \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v. This makes the engine equivalent to a mainsail.... if the mainsail had 9% better vac Isp, 14% better ASL Isp, and \u003Cstrong\u003E33% more thrust!\u003C/strong\u003E Even more ridiculous is the fact that this liquid fuel booster unlocks \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIN THE SAME TECH\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E as the mainsail!

What I\u0027m trying to say is that the mainsail has become \u003Cem\u003Estrictly worse\u003C/em\u003E than the LFB KR-1x2 liquid fuel booster, which frankly surprises me greatly.
