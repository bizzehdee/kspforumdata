The issue I have aside finding the small gadgets in flight is the menu placement after right clicking for activation/re-evaluation, the popup tends to cover other gadgets and in many cases ends up half out of the screen depending on your viewing angle and so sometimes finding that little blue activation button can be tricky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA suggestion would be to give science its own context menu that can be opened by right clicking the main control module where a new \u0027science\u0027 tab can be found, pressing it opens a science menu where all the gadgets applied to your vessel are listed and can be activated/deactivated via that tab which ill also hold all the info for set items, similar to how MechJeb would be setup and utilized. Combining science into this type of spreadsheet format would be great \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
