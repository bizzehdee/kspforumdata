This is my first ever working SSTO, 67 parts most of em radial intakes. Its *just* capable of a 70x70 orbit with enough juice to de-orbit, however it does get there having used only 1/2 its jet fuel although that doesn\u0027t do you much good as the reentry is brutal. Every kind of spin imaginable which can only be got out of with RCS and luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/47z10bO.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002247z10bO.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the IKN Swallow Mk3. Fantastic little ship, handles like a dream and incredibly agile. Again 70x70 *just* and gets there with 2/3rds of its jet fuel left. The main improvements are re-entry and take off, as it can comfortably come in very hot with zero control issues and can take off at 40m/s. As it can also take off at an angle of 80 degrees is being turned into a fighter with ASat capabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iVXTwv6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iVXTwv6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the IKN Swallow Mk4 and Mk5, the major difference to the Mk3 being a docking port, solar panels and more fuel. The Mk4 has an extra flt400 while the Mk5 has an extra flt800. The Mk4 will do a 100x100 with fuel for playing around, the Mk5 will do 500x500 with plenty to mess around with. Flying characteristics are worse than the Mk3 being more prone to backflip with harsh use of the \u0027w\u0027 key, and the Mk5 is harder to get off the ground due to the extra length of the flt800 sticking out the back as pulling up to hard causes it to hit tarmac. They do have an RCS tank but not the thrusters as I haven\u0027t learned to dock yet and don\u0027t know where to put them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in a bit of a KSP slump at the moment.

Which works great when they are full, but is a problem when you are out of gas. For the most part you should put the fuel where your craft\u0027s natural CG is. That way when they burn off, your CG remains unchanged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStrip your craft down to bare fuselage and engines. Place the fuel along a horizontal line in parallel with your CG. Now when they burn off your CG won\u0027t change (at least not much, see below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rsAS1uc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rsAS1uc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAttach your wings to get that cool wedge shape. But see the problem? Your center of lift is WAY ahead of your CG, and as your fuel in the fuselage gets used up, it makes the difference even worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nvDBFFZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022nvDBFFZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you need to do is bring your center of lift farther back. Preferably behind the CG a little bit. That way as your fuel burns, your CG will shift back a little bit to meet your Center of Lift. The best way to do this (and keep this particular shape) is to plaster really \u0022lifty\u0022 wings behind the CG to pull the Center of lift farther back. In this case I have done it by cramming Swept wings in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sOtwFzh.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sOtwFzh.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can further control your Center of Gravity by controlling how your fuel flows. In this case I would run fuel lines directly to the engines from the rocket fuel tanks. That way the engines will use up the liquid fuel in your perfectly positioned Rocket Fuel tanks first, before taking from the long fuselage part. Run Fuel lines from your fuselage to the rocket tanks too. (Fuselage -\u0026gt; Rocket Tanks -\u0026gt; Engines ~~~)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
