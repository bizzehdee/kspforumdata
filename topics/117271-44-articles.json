The majority, if I remember correctly, was \u0022it should look plane-like\u0022, but no actual hard and fast definitions.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you would rather limit the wing styles, be my guest.  I enjoy working out new solutions.\n\u003E \n\nI am leaning towards a ban on wing spam/stacking (many wings sandwiched together) or wings inside fuselage, though maybe that building technique adds to the fun in which case a ban would suck.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 43 minutes ago, drtricky said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E There is an issue with the rules related to which fighter has the fastest climb rate. I was testing my heavy fighter-bomber against a much smaller, lighter, more nimble fighter I designed (which I\u0027m not entering because I designed it in 15 minutes. It wouldn\u0027t feel like a challenge to me if I entered it), and my fighter-bomber won 70% of the battles mainly because its faster climb rate (thanks to it having seven engines compared to the other\u0027s single engine) allowed it to reach the minimum altitude faster and engage sooner with its AIM-120\u0027s (Both planes had a minimum altitude of 900).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The fighter-bomber shouldn\u0027t have won because due to the dumb AI, it bled a ton of speed when trying to point itself towards the enemy or dodging missiles, and thus bled maneuverability. On the rare occasions the fighters got caught in a turning battle, the smaller fighter held the clear advantage. What this means is that in the beginning, climb rate is a significant factor in the battle. Too significant.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Perhaps instead of having the fighters take off relatively close to each other with the AI turned on, they should be flown a significant distance away (enough so that the AI won\u0027t engage each other when turned on), and then turned towards each other and then have the AI turned on.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Well, actually...my fighter-bomber is currently poorly fit for combat because I need to investigate why exactly the plane, when driven by AI, is being an idiot when it comes to turning.

That\u0027s not a bad thing, unless you want the challenge to be a contest to find the best fighter, and not the best competitor of that challenge.\n\nPersonally I agree this challenge should be kept as is, with no limitations to allow the most creative designs possible, but a second challenge should be started more focused on a semi-realistic contest between semi-realistic jet fighters.\n\nThe way I would run this would be:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - Ideally this would be done over multiplayer to allow pilots to fly in a way that suits their craft instead of having to rely on the same, very flawed, autopilot (a MiG-17 will beat an F-4 Phantom being flown like it\u0027s a MiG-17, but that doesn\u0027t mean the MiG is the better fighter), but if that\u0027s not possible a setup like [@colmo](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/25950-colmo/) [proposed](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/117271-top-gun-ai-the-official-tournament-thread/\u0026do=findComment\u0026comment=2338685) would be the next best thing.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  - Wing/Engine spam would be banned, I can\u0027t think of any other way to do this than as a judgement call by the challenge host.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  - The fights would be held round robin style so every fighter fights every other fighter, to determine which is best against the widest variety of threats.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  - Possibly tests other than air to air fights could be included, for example mock airstrikes against a premade well defended ground target, or bonus points for cheap/low part designs or for craft capable of flying long range missions, helping encourage designs with more varied capability than the very single minded craft the current challenge encourages.\n\u003E \n\nHowever, this is not a very thoroughly thought out idea at all, and I think that would be a very time consuming way to run tournaments."},{"CreatedByName":"SasquatchM","CreatedById":11888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-28T13:26:17Z","Content":"I have been thinking about this as well.  The way this challenge is set up the only limits are the point cost of weapons, perhaps for future challenges there can be tighter definitions.  Not that this set up is bad - it encourages wilder designs and more experimentation, I know as I ran over 40 different simulations testing different designs and balancing to come up with what I finally submitted, but putting tighter limits in can encourage creativity in different directions.\n\nHere area few examples, obviously there could be many more:\n\nTotal cost in funds.

More than that and it seems that diminishing returns in thrust no longer offset the weight penalties in a fairly small craft.  Yes the 4 engine Adder gets to altitude a bit faster than my Asp designs, but even then results are about 50-50, even if the fight gets to the gun to gun dogfight stage.  The additional engines may prove more of a benefit with higher altitudes or greater engagement ranges where the higher speed makes more difference, but at the ranges and altitudes we are at it seems to be more about being the first and most stable craft to bear on the enemy and clever ai settings to aid in missile avoidance.  It does seem as if the AIM-120s are a bit overpowered at the moment, but if both craft survive the missile exchange having the tightest controlled turn radius seems to win out.
