My understanding is that everything defined for action group (I\u0027ll play with #6) stays with the group no matter what is in control. If someone has group 6 toggle an engine, clamp-o-tron release, or decoupler, and a station has group 6 set up for some lights... someone flipping a light switch on the station with that ship attached could be disastrous. (The front page\u0027s write up on \u0022Docked Vessels\u0022 covers a work around that I like.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect, an assigned action is always activated when that group is activated. The action groups added by AGX allow you to avoid this situation by using groups 1-10 for the docked vessel and groups 11-20 for the space station. Then using keysets you can use the same 10 physical keys to control the two different sets of 10 action groups.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can even hide the actions on the docked vessel using the visibility groups now if you wish.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERequests/notes:\u003Cp\u003EFor testing purposes and users without enough free keys, can this control panel be given buttons to toggle the action groups (this panel both a control panel and the way to edit groups) or make a separate panel to toggle/activate groups without keys/stick?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure both of these things are already in.
