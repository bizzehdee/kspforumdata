All GTA games take place in the same universe, and there is a chronological order, but story wise, you actually don\u0027t really miss out on anything in any given game by not having played games that cover the earlier chronology, because each game is a self contained story, as is the case for each fallout game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex Mechs Robot","CreatedById":83406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T21:15:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all very helpful and I appreciate the responses.
