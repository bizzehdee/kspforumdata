Is has no goal like \u0022we will have a language or a large brain\u0022. Evolution is the outcome of variation and selection. The \u0022evolutionary advantage\u0022 is not a plan for the future but a momentary fitness, an advantage for an individual to have a slightly better chance than the competitors to bring its genes to the next generation, where the same rules apply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore there is no single feature without the rest of the organism. A large brain needs nutrition and oxygen, manipulative hands need a body with the necessary mechanical components to control it. A forearm and an elbow is a complicated mechanism. The bird\u0027s arm is simpler than that of a land living vertebrate, humerus (upper arm), ulna/radius(lower arm) and hand are nearly equal in length, there is only one strong finger. That cannot hold on to anything but can fly. Disadvantage: it\u0027s unflexible and breaks easily. The birds breast is formed to anchor those tasty flight-muscles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake a look at a bird\u0027s skeleton and at a humans. You\u0027ll recognize the same basic program but different realizations. The human arm is much more flexible, more like that of a bear or a cat. It has five developed fingers (varies ;-)), the thumb is opposed, the forearm can rotate. That will never fly but can easily climb a tree or manipulate things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBirds nutrition is connected to the lifestyle: seeds and berrys, insects, some bigger ones small animals. The beak is quite suitable for that and it\u0027s light weighted (hollow). The beak has many variations, it can be long and pointed to pick insects out of the bark or a strong one to tear apart small animals. Many functions in a simple light weight tool to bring nutrition to the alimentary canal :-) The beak can\u0027t be changed to change the intestines as well and that is not easy, even for a process like evolution.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA mammal mouth works different. Weight is not a problem and nutrition can be more diverse. So there are teeth and a strong jaw behind it to chew. The skull is massive compared to a birds skull to support the chewing muscles. And they have a long, winding and heavy canal that could be able to support a big brain.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as a conclusion: No, a bird will not evolve into something with a mouth, hands and a brain.

Theoretically you just need an equivalent of opposable thumb and a surface it can work against. I know a man that lost three fingers in an industrial accident - he does well enough with his thumb and pinky finger (relatively speaking of course). No, range of motions the arm have is very important too. Look at human arm - our range of motion is quite high at shoulder, elbow and the wrist. Structure of a wing is quite different - it\u0027s capable of strong and fast motions, but only in some directions.
