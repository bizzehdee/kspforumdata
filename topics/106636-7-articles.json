The KSC strip was 98 km out when the engines spooled down and I was about 20 km up, moving along at around 1100 m/s. Tried to glide it, but the nose started pitching wildly before finally rising 90 degree, killing all forward velocity, and leaving me fighting to try to point back to the prograde. Didn\u0027t happen. Best I could manage was getting a flat attitude as I plummeted seaward. Couldn\u0027t revert flight as I\u0027d saved when the fuel was critically low and reloaded to retry the descent approach under manual controls. Out of some fluke, that flat attitude was almost as good as a parachute, getting my downward velocity down to about 20 m/s, letting most of the craft survive. More than 7000 km flown and I splashed down less than 50 km short of the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1TtXt9A.png\u0022 alt=\u00221TtXt9A.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real kicker, though, was that when I went back to the SPH verify that the lift was what I though it should be, I realized I\u0027d left out about 1800 units of fuel prior to take off.
