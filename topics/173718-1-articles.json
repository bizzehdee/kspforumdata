You can get a decent desktop for around $500 that should be fine for anything you need, though if it were me I\u0027d save up about $1,500 and get as close to top-of-the-line as you can because future-proofing yourself will save you head and heart ache in the long run. I know people like to think that only hardcore gamers will ever need a beefy rig (and they\u0027re right of course), but think of it this way: if all you want to play is KSP and nothing else, then you\u0027ll never need to upgrade ever again if you get the highest quality build that you can reasonably afford.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know this is absolutely what you \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E want to hear, but with those specs you\u0027re going to be falling behind on just about everything, gaming and otherwise.
