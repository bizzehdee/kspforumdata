Outside time does not pass while you are \u0022inside\u0022 the buildings, so, for example, spending hours assembling something in the VAB doesn\u0027t mean the planet will have rotated when you go back outside. And of course any time you \u0022revert\u0022 a flight, outside time is backed up. Furthermore, the game is not 1:1 scale, and Kerbin\u0027s rotation cycle is only 6 hours long. It\u0027s quite possible, especially if you\u0027ve used accelerated time (warp) that you left the launch site one night and came back to it the following night. Most likely, it\u0027s some combination of those. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, welcome to the forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kialar","CreatedById":60893,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T21:48:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd the atorney from greenland asked the suspect: \u0022Where were you in the night from the 21st of September until 22nd of march?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AletzN1","CreatedById":65154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T22:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EGreat first post by the way.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
