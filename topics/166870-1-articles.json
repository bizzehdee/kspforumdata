(this is known as co-investment)\u00A0 So what if the US started a Sovereign Wealth Fund and used it to build\u00A0space-inindustries like asteroid-mining and space-tourism from scratch?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe advantage of doing this with a Sovereign Wealth Fund, rather than direct government funding, is that it ensures that the government collects more of the profit from its investment- in the form of capital gains of seed money invested in startups and dividends from public corporations, as WELL as taxes on the executive salaries and profits of those corporations...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpace Tourism is a potentially very lucrative industry if SpaceX can realize fully-reusable launch vehicles, for instance. \u00A0If the government were to invest in developing a space-tourism industry it could not only push the development of reusable launch vehicles along, but also realize considerable profits that could be reinvested here on Earth in things like education and healthcare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly, if the US invested in the enterprises of asteroid-mining startups, it could not only help to provide\u00A0cheaper fuel in Low Earth Orbit for purposes like Mars\u00A0missions and upper stage reusability- it could also provide a Return On Investment for the government in growth of valuation of its stock shares in such companies- which could be held onto for the dividends or sold to private investors for a profit...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, if space is such an untapped market, maybe the government should take an approach to ensure it gathers a larger share of the profits from exploiting it than what can be achieved merely by taxing the profits...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-26T03:22:14Z\u0022 title=\u002210/26/2017 03:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 26, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
