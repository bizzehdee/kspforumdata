He heard a really strange wooshing sound and looked around. There was a blue box standing right next to the KSC! Impressed by the following meeting with a guy with a weird red hat, this Kerbal, Russeltdavies Kerman, later went on to run a show on KBC (Kerbal Broadcasting Corporation) called Doctor Kerman\n\nHere is an excerpt from the show:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hello, I am the Doctor!\n\u003E Doctor Kerman?\n\u003E \n\u003E No, just the Doctor.\n\n![2015-06-23%2008.40.45_zpsogwlb7nf.png](http://i1306.photobucket.com/albums/s568/Kamik423/2015-06-23%2008.40.45_zpsogwlb7nf.png)\n\n(Made completely with Inkpad on iPad)\n\nKamik423"}]}
