Try making them vertical. Alternatively, since you clearly don\u0027t mind clipping, you could hide vertical tail surfaces inside the rear fuselage, just ahead of the engine nozzles.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe cupola appears to be attached radially; if so, you have a source of severe drag far in front of the centre of mass, possibly enough to destabilise the vehicle.
