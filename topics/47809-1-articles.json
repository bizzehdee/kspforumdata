Not enough to break the docks, mind you, but enough to get a good oscillation going and eventually lead to the entire platform spinning. The landers are at the end of long struts, so any movement is going to be pretty leveraged, and whilst the boosters are in a similar configuration (basically an X shape) they\u0027re inside the landers which is doubtless worsening things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a think about redesigning the platform, but was wondering what other people had done on this front.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thought that came to mind was to dock the landers from underneath, so they\u0027re in line with the axis of the main platform. I could try sitting them closer to the central axis, but that will make docking trickier. I could also try docking them from the side, so they\u0027re closer to the central axis, but again they will move under thrust. Double docking ports also came to mind, but I suspect they\u0027d be a catastrophic PITA to build and dock with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landers themselves are fairly weighty and could probably do with some weight off. I was thinking of sitting the main platform somewhere off Jool and sending the landers in, so there would need to be capability of doing that. I might send a regular one probe mission to Jool to about where I was thinking and seeing what I could get away with lander-wise.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alexandicity","CreatedById":83819,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T11:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking to do something similar myself soon so I\u0027ll be watching for replies here! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo ideas I\u0027ve seen tossed around before:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Put your thrust at the front of your platform (so it \u0022pulls\u0022 the assembly). Apparently this is more stable or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* If the oscillation is definitely coming from the docking ports, use triple-docks and/or quantum struts (mod); both of these give rigidity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe someone else has hands-on experience with these can comment?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seret","CreatedById":41409,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T11:48:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you post a screenshot?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T18:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETow configuration. Two things are happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Your center of mass is dangerously close to the center of thrust, perhaps even behind it, causing engine gimballing to worsen the oscillation rather than correct it (gimballing has yet to have support for above CoM).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Your docking arms are flexible and have heavy landers, which is resulting in a very wide distribution of mass. The sligtest offset from flexing multiplies quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution I use here is a puller configuration. I stack my landers inline with each other (or close to center on docking hub if former is impossible) and have multiple engines mounted on girders to pull the payload. Note that you need to disable gimballing or else there is a chance of the craft destroying itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vat","CreatedById":32259,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-09T19:39:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks - hadn\u0027t considered a tow configuration, but that sounds like a good solution, and easy to implement without redoing the launch vehicle from scratch.
