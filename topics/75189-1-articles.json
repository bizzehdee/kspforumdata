While this is en route, I can send a station to Mun ( with Sci lab ) and get all Mun equatorial biomes. By the time I get a station to Minmus, I only need a couple of flat landings to complete the tech tree. IRL though this probably took a month, what with living and all that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-16T18:38:40Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2014 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Aethon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-16T18:35:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aethon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aethon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESorry. Not clear. I mean the two days flight time to Minmus. Technically what I do is get some easy stuff near KSC. My standard sci pod has 4 goo and 4 sci jrs, as well as whatever other sci stuff is unlocked, so I only have to visit a biome once. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I meant too.
