THAT\u0027S RIGHT! BUILDING IT IN ORBIT! There should be certain (EXTREMELY LARGE) parts that can be launched into space, and then, when there is enough electricity, ore and other possible recourses, the parts are capable of creating saved ships, or maybe it even has a special construction meny, simmilar to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, but with less features.\u00A0It would be awesome. Imagine having a giant structure in space, that just prints out an entire space station! Any containers would be empty, however, and have to be fueled in space. And there also would of course not be any astronauts onboard of the ship.
