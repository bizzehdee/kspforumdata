The definition I see pretty much everywhere \u003Cem\u003Ebut\u003C/em\u003E the KSP forums is that aerocapture is a maneuver that involves being captured into an elliptical orbit from a hyperbolic one using a body\u0027s atmosphere to slow down. Aerobraking, on the other hand, is used once one is in an elliptical orbit to reduce apoapsis. An aerogravity assist would be one where you use the inherent lift of your craft while diving into a body\u0027s atmosphere to attain even greater velocities from a gravity assist. All of these fall under the general heading of \u0022aeroassist\u0022 rather than \u0022aerobraking\u0022 since certain maneuvers don\u0027t involve braking.
