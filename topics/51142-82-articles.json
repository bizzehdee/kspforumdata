What would really be neat is something like invisible bump mapping for the cloud layers, so that it will generate clouds of varying altitude-depth according to bump map value per pixel of the cloud layer map above or below. Then we can have clouds with 3D topographies, generate clouds like cumulus and huge cumulonimbus to fly around and gawk at, fly through vallays and towers of fluffy eye candy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sidfu","CreatedById":70409,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T16:04:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ecaptain just try them after playing with clouds on yur planets u wont want to go back\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-08T16:07:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CaptainArchmage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CaptainArchmage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI heard about the volumetric clouds from Scott Manley\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s latest interstellar quest video (at the time of posting this).
