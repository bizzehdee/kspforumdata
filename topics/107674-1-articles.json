I was burning on up to space, in my all-in-one Minmus resource mining rocket. All was going well, until around 600 meters up, when the launch clamps teleported into my main lifter tanks destroying most of the rocket. Sanalla and Valentina Kerman both died after spiralling back to Kerbin (no \u0027chutes, was a one-way mission). On the upside, I realised that there were no drills on the lander.\n\nPossible reasons based on other\u0027s comments:\n\n- I had various parts in various different symmetry numbers in odd places on the craft, including lots of launch clamps and struts\n- Lots of part clipping\n- A part disappeared when in the VAB, and I could still select it in mid air, but it was invisible\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T18:17:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vectura**"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:53:05Z","Content":"Something similar happened to my first nuclear mothership.
