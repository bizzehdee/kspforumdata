I built and landed this light tower but was disappointed to find out that the Mk2 lights can\u0027t even shine far enough to light up the ground from atop of my tower. I know the description says that they don\u0027t shine very far, but I was hoping that the wider beam would be a good application for a wide area lighting tower. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I try to use the Mk1 lights? Are there any mods available that have brighter lights or is there a way to edit the light properties to make the beam travel farther? I can\u0027t seem to find a setting in the spotLightMk2.cfg file.

And indeed, towers are unnecessary because even the light from those lights won\u0027t reach very far. I recommend low-laying lights that are angled very shallowly to project light over a long distance right on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fat Gordy","CreatedById":143443,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T16:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the pointer. I rebuilt my light tower with the round Mk1 lights and they are SIGNIFICANTLY brighter than the Mk2 ones. In fact, as I was landing the new one on site, I had the lights on and I could start to see that they were lighting up the terrain at about 300m up in the air.
