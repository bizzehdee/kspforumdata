But you will need to deal with three different resources, not just one. You have \u0022Supplies\u0022 as your life support resource (together with Ec!), you have \u0022Mulch\u0022 for waste, and you have \u0022Fertilizer\u0022 as a supporting resource.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as keeping your Kerbals alive is concerned, you only ever need to worry about supplies and Ec. In fact, for missions shorter than 15 Kerbin days (configurable), you only need Ec, no supplies needed. But if you want to use the station modules that produce more supplies, you will need to deal with fertilizer as well (mulch handles itself). No way around that - unless you feel like manually writing ModuleManager patches that remove the need for fertilizer from the greenhouses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also the concept of \u0022recyclers\u0022, which reduce the supplies intake of Kerbals by a percentage in exchange for increased Ec consumption. But if you only install USI-LS on its own, and none of RoverDude\u0027s other mods, then the only recycler you get is one built into the Mobile Processing Lab (plus potentially one dedicated part he may add in a future release of USI-LS).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I thought Snacks! was a better fit, because none of the other LS mods limit themselves to one resource and one production method.

TAC Life Support definitely has way more parts and resources and complex reprocessing steps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T12:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell if you can indefinitely maintain life support in space, doesn\u0027t that somewhat defeat the point?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say TAC Life Support can be simple if you want. Just put on enough of the all-purpose containers and job done. At that level it\u0027s simply a time limit on your mission. TAC-LS can then \u0022grow\u0022 to be more complex if you want with various recyclers as well as ways to get water and oxygen from the environment. TAC is good at alerting you when life support is about to run out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUSI Life Support is in some ways more complex. As well as the consumable \u0022Supplies\u0022 which works much like TAC\u0027s resources folded into one, it has the habitation mechanic where parts offer a certain number of Kerbal-months and other parts can multiply that amount. However you can disable the habitation mechanic if you like and then you\u0027re free to stuff Kerbals in lander cans for years. It too has things to recycle resources, but USI-LS alone doesn\u0027t have any way to make more supplies, that\u0027s left to UKS or other mods. (But like I said, it\u0027s never very sensible to make stuff from empty space anyway). USI-LS is not so good at telling you life support will run out, but it does have a generous \u0022grace period\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIncidentally, USI-LS developer Roverdude mentioned that \u0022Supplies\u0022 are actually mostly \u003Cem\u003Ewater\u003C/em\u003E, with the food and oxygen relatively minor components.
