Thankfully, there were plenty of scientists working at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, so needing to find enough crew wasn\u2019t a problem at all.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe spaceport was shaped like a ring, but to the hungry minds at R\u0026amp;D it was referred to as \u2018the most magnificent donut-in-a-donut\u2019, as the station was divided into two parts, the outer ring and the inner ring. The inner ring housed the building equipment and held the ship under construction in place. It was connected to the outer ring via two tubes, which allowed workers to go between the rings, and also to provide building material for construction, which were stored in the outer ring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe outer ring spun to create artificial gravity so that \u2018the workers would feel right at home\u2019, as an engineer said. It housed the other facilities of the spaceport, mainly docking bays, storage, a hall, and the crew quarters. When a spacecraft was coming in to dock with the spaceport, the outer ring would stop rotating and allow the spacecraft to dock, then continue to spin again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJandy cut the tape as he inaugurated the Spaceport Of Kerbin with the press taking so many pictures Jandy could barely keep his eyes open for the photographs.

Aboard were a 426-strong crew of skilled scientists and engineers, which were to take the first step beyond the confines of the Kerbol system. Commanding the spaceship named the Far Reacher was Rhode Kerman, a specifically selected geologist to find worlds on which resources were available to mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ship was shaped like a triangle, with a rectangular command post protruding upwards at the back of the ship. Two massive ion engines propelled the ship, along with the revolutionary warp drive. They were powered by huge batteries, which in turn were charged by even bigger ultra-efficient solar panels which were retractable; a technology perfected over the years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Far Reacher had three powerful scanners situated at the three corners of its triangular shape. They would scan planets, stars and other celestial bodies and study them in detail either from orbit or on the surface, which in case the ship was equipped with landing legs and landing engines. The bottom of the ship was also padded with heat-resistant material for atmospheric landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the crew the ship had arguably cramped living areas for each of the scientists, but most of them were perfectly fine with that. There were also several labs for tests, and a small quantum computer that despite its small processing power relative to the projected designs, had a reasonable edge over its conventional relatives.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSir, where will we be heading on our first excursion?\u201D asked the navigation officer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCan someone bring out the galactic map?\u201D answered Rhode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA hologram appeared in the command post, showing the Kerbol system and a few named systems of particular interest in the vicinity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmm\u2026 let\u2019s go to this one,\u201D replied Rhode as he pointed to a blip on the hologram.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSure thing.

The engines roared softly as they ignited. The warp drive, much bigger in size than the one on the Fabric Ripper, hummed to life a few seconds later as the space in front of the Far Reacher distorted and off the spaceship was on its first of many journeys.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile and the Spaceport Of Kerbin, Kerbals were cheering at the sight of the Far Reacher speeding away.

Don\u2019t spend too much on donuts though, we went over the budget last time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThanks!\u201D replied Wernher. \u201CDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t spend too much on donuts only!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore Jandy could hear \u2018only\u2019 Wernher had already burst out of his office and was well on his way scampering the couple hundred meters to R\u0026amp;D instead of taking the buggies parked everywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 ----------------------------------------------------\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the Far Reacher was in orbit around a gas giant named \u2018Cotton Candy\u2019. It appeared that at the time the scientists in the Far Reacher were all thinking about food and only food. Unknown to Jandy, all of the previous systems that had been discovered and surveyed were named after food; there was even a star called \u2018Minty Hydrogen\u2019.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the command post, everyone was just doing their usual thing; looking at some data, plotting courses, looking at the gas giant or eating a donut, which on request by the crew comprised 45% of the food onboard the spaceship, to the great frustration of the health specialists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, a scientist came up to the command post and exclaimed, \u201CJACKPOT!\u201D at the top of his lungs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhoa, what is it?\u201D asked a startled Rhode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientist just handed the few pieces of paper he was holding to Rhode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHmm\u2026\u201D said Rhode as he looked at the data. \u201CWait\u2026 are you sure this is not an anomalous result?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CI have forgotten how many times I\u2019ve scanned and reanalyzed the data. As hard as it seems to believe, this is legitimate!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRhode suddenly went into a state of feverishness as he grabbed the intercom and practically shouted into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEveryone listen up! Around Cotton Candy we have discovered a small moon that has an extraordinarily high amount of rare materials!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few sounds of amazement were heard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CStatisticians, wherever you guys are, the data will be handed over to you and I want you guys to calculate the estimated value of this moon! We shall name this moon \u2018The Golden Moon\u2019 so that all of Kerbalkind can remember this amazing find!\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientists started cheering as a donut or two was dropped. Just as the cheering started, another scientist came up to the command post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCalm down, guys. This might be a pretty marvelous discovery, but the latest calculations from the computer estimates that the moon will fall below the Roche limit of Cotton Candy in a few hundred years.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAww. Then shouldn\u2019t we start mining it now?\u201D said a scientist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe moon is under constant tidal forces and has little gravity. Plus, it has a pretty irregular shape and a high orbital speed. It will take a while for us to build a mining base on there, and even if we manage to do that who knows what could then happen? It\u2019s a pretty unstable place to be.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell, you do have a point. This is what us scientists are supposed to be doing; evaluating discoveries and plausible projects.\u201D said Rhode. \u201CThe best we can do now is to send the data back to Kerbin immediately and see if they can make something out of this.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEveryone agreed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Space Dino","CreatedById":163476,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-15T01:18:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHype?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was a catch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt had lights dotted on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-10-15T01:18:21Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2017 01:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by The Space Dino\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoarBoostersRUS","CreatedById":181916,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-15T02:15:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove the story\u0027s people come up with!!
