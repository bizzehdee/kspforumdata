We setup warpmode to be set as Subspace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving got a server setup, and started our career together. We fast realised something was wrong, concidering we could always see each other on the airstrip before take off, but once in flight, the player in the air disappears, not to be seen again, until we land. The opposite of what we would want really.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving done some research, we foud out about the distance bubbles on the airstrip and launch pad. Even a possible bubble surrounding KSC. so we decided to find a land mark, to travel too, in hopes that we will appear outside KSC\u0027s bubble. Nothing. we were Sync\u0027d together, but nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have read through the DMP FAQ and found out that not only is there a bubble around the airstrip and launchpad, but the atmosphere serves as a singleplayer subspace, regardless. Now from my understanding, ive been watching many videos on youtube of players dogfighting, and having fun together at many different ranges, within the atmosphere of kerbin. so we\u0027re confused, and need help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are we doing wrong? is there a setting we need to change? do we need another mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone help us?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nxxx\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-19T06:24:36Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2016 06:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 19, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Haristess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Haristess","CreatedById":157236,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-19T17:02:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSolved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlanetshine has a setting for visible vessel distance. it was turned off by default.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was never mentioned anywhere online. solved. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
