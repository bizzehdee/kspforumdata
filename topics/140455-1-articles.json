It works fine other times, so is it just the rocket gets launched before it falls apart, or is it a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry that I posted it here.

It is possible while you\u0027re tabbed out to another programme that some quirk of physics has caused a motion that your whip can\u0027t handle and something is detaching. The only time I\u0027ve had something fall to pieces on the launch pad is when I\u0027ve failed to make it strong enough and a weak joint has detached sending tons of metal and fuel crashing to the pad with all that that entails!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, if you already have clamps and struts and duct tape well represented within your design, then the best thing to do is to post a report on the bug tracker to see if it can be replicated and identified\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
