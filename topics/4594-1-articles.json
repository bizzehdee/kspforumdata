Once the first trio of boosters jettison, the rolling stops, and all is well for a while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA while after jettisoning the second trio of boosters, I make a low orbit, and start using periapsis burns to increase the apoapsis. That\\\u0027s when the second problem manifests, usually when I\\\u0027m down to the last set of tanks on the last long booster trio - while I can roll the ship with no trouble, trying to pitch or yaw seems to become intermittently impossible, no matter how much I lean on the controls (and no, I\\\u0027m not in precision mode). In fact, even when not under thrust, the ship will start pitching, yawing, and rolling of its own accord. Often, I\\\u0027ll be partway through a periapsis burn, and turn off SAS to nose back down to stay pointed parallel to the ground, only to find the ship nosing up instead, and not noticeably responding to SAS or pitch or yaw commands, even when I engage RCS. The ship just slowly tumbles for a while before it lets me get it back under control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre these problems due to design flaws, poor piloting, and/or one or more bugs? If the answer is \u0027bug(s)\u0027, then could a mod move this to the Development subforum?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ivan Ivanovich","CreatedById":8977,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-17T13:31:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a bug, just bad placement of struts.
