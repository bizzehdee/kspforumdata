I\u0027ll point out that the engineering complexities involved in regenerative cooling are enough that the RS-68, used by the Delta IV rockets, instead uses mechanically simpler ablative cooling, where they basically coat the interior of the rocket nozzle with a heatshield material.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also suspect regenerative cooling is part of what drives RP-1 being so heavily refined; you really don\u0027t want fuel passing over your nozzle to start coking and forming tars and deposits: you need those passages clear. Liquid oxygen isn\u0027t exactly a great choice either, on account of being liquid oxygen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe part of why the A-4 rockets produced by Germany in the 1940s used 70% alcohol in water was because that mixture has a cool flame temperature, which reduces stress on the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
