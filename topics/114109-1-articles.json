Constructive criticism of the game is allowed, even welcomed, but if that criticism is just insulting or offers no constructive feedback then we would rather people just didn\u0027t post it. Similarly, people are free to disagree with those that have complaints or criticisms about the game, but when that disagreement changes from discussing the criticism to discussing the critic then it stops being a useful discussion and becomes a useless argument.
