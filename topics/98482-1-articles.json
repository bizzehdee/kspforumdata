It consists of a small space station for science processing and refueling, a CSM-like crew return vehicle, a lander, and a reusable rover that can reattach to the lander via a Clamp-O-Tron Jr. But, each planet or moon has it\u0027s own hardware requirements. My rover is practically useless on Minmus-sized bodies for lack of traction, so I might as well not take it with, opting instead for more fuel. For planets without atmosphere, barometers and parachutes are useless so I might as well not take them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I would like to be able to build each component as a subassembly and stack them together with minor modifications to each so I can spend less time building the same parts from scratch over and over again. Problem is, the subassembly system seems to be designed specifically to prevent this. Build anything resembling a whole space ship and inevitably it says the part is \u0022unattachable.\u0022 I\u0027ve never once been able to just glue on my standard rover or lander to a stack. You can\u0027t start with a subassembly, so you can\u0027t do \u0022I want to launch *this* ship with *this* booster, change this Poodle to a Skipper, and go.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnless I just don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T20:49:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s unattachable because the ROOT part is the only part in a subassambly that can be attatched to anything after loading it. That\u0027s how the system works. Since the root part is usually surrounded by parts on all sides on a full sized craft, there are no open connection points on the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe now have a stock system to change the root part. So move the root part to whatever the part is that you want to connect to the rocket after loading the subassambly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s perfectly usable, you\u0027re just missing a step\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-01T20:58:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right that you can\u0027t start a craft with a subassembly. What you have to do in that case is save the first bit as a craft (by rebuilding, or attaching it onto a part re-rooting and removing that part) then load that craft and add the subassemblies onto that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, if you wanted to send a probe into space you might build it, then add an orbital stage subassembly, then add a booster stage subassembly.

What you can save as an subassembly is a part which is attached to the main craft. Here are workarounds:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can start from a placeholder decoupler, and build your probe BOTTOM-UP from there; it will be possible to make it a subassembly then (by selecting from it\u0027s bottom-most part).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, you could build it TOP-DOWN like usual, put a placeholder decoupler where the second-to-last stage will begin, and re-root the ship to that decoupler. The resulting probe can then be used like the above case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, when you want to use the subassembly (probe, rover) to build a craft, you must start from a placeholder decoupler too (or a fully built lower stage), and place the subassembly on top of it (you might have to rotate it when you select it from the subassemblies - those pesky docking ports like to face up!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the lower stages are also subassemblies (i.e., your rocket is entirely modular - awesome!), what you do is re-root your ship to the probe core from the subassembly you just placed, and then throw away the placeholder decoupler.
