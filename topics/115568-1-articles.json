There is a version of the base that inspired mine called Kassandra (Its not called Kassandra!) that has long connectors between each module/habitat that might make it easier to assemble. The base craft files are on here somewhere complete with landers \u0026amp; boosters I think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the end I installed KIS/KAS and had my engineer hook up a fuel line instead of trying to fly my tanker onto the docking port with RCS and thrusters.
