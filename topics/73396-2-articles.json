It\u0027s one thing not to like them. Godfather movies were a great example, personally I\u0027m bored to tears with them. It doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re not great movies though, it\u0027s just me not connecting with the art.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really get how 2001 doesn\u0027t have a plot though. It has lots of plot. What it\u0027s missing is the standard, all-pervasive Hollywood 3-act structure where in act one groundwork is laid for the story, protagonist is introduced along with his list of Trait A, Trait B, Strenght X, Weakness Y, Quirky Habit Z and Personal Challenge To Overcome, in the end PLOT TWIST! to act two, where everything goes badly for protagonist, ending in PLOT TWIST!!, followed by act three where protagonist pulls trough, wins his Personal Challenge and if the movie is Deep or Dramatic, the protagonist dies or someone close to him suffers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve been seriously brainwashed to expect this structure from movies and of course it works really well in keeping viewers attention and it\u0027s not a bad structure in itself. But it does condition us to react badly to different kinds of movies. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example 2001 moves in a completely different pacing. It concentrates much more on imagery, thoughts and ideas. Many things in the plot are left unknown and I mean properly unknown and mysterious, not the \u0022The butler was the killer. OR WAS HE?!\u0022 type where the viewers task is to speculate on some possible outcomes that can be deducted directly from the movie but which are left slightly obscure. The characters are a bit boring because they\u0027re fairly normal, realistic people. And the final boss battle isn\u0027t an epic struggle where personal conflicts clash with the urgency of saving the world and conquering the objectified female reward.

He was practically raised on the New Trilogy era of Star Wars. That ought to give you an idea of what he normally expects from a movie. Lets cut now to the moment in the film when the kid gets called by the ship and makes his way into the hangar.
