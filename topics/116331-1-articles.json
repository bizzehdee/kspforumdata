I can make it to mun with no problems and I can now do an orbit which is a big step for me. I did the orbit and decided this time I would not crash. Once in a stable orbit I told MechJeb to pick a landingspot and initiate. He did just that and things went well, untill we got close to Mun, Mechjeb\u0027s brilliant plan was to suicide dive down then do a retroburn at the surface with all his might, but we still crashed like so many times before.

Instead of \u0022clean\u0022 suicide burn, perform the burn some 1000m short of the optimal goal, reducing your speed to 30m/s or so. Then perform another 100m short of the surface with some 20m/s target, then another 10m above the surface, stopping dead, and finally descend on the engines set to such a power that you have a safe descent speed.
