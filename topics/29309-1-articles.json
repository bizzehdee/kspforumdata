Total dedication to science \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn comparison to mankind, Kerbals seem to have a total dedication for science! Have you ever seen an entertainment system aboard any Kerbal vessel? Everything aboard is strictly tech-orientated. Not even a simple card deck in one of the drawers! Or take a look into the VAB. I see many Kerbal technicians there, men with yellow and white helmets, scientists or guys with these glowing sticks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E2.

Science until death, without fear\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever seen any Kerbal screaming in fear? Ah, of course you have. But these seem to be well-trained actor skills to bring a little drama to KNN (Kerbal News Network). In fact, the Kerbals are totally emotionless and totally fearless. They even fly with rockets which are damned to doom by eyesight. They never protest against any flying vessel they\u0027re assigned to. They do whatever you want. They never quit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E5. Experimental parts and higher tech level\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals fly with parts mankind hasn\u0027t even used yet, e.g. Atomic Rockets. They fear no radiation, they fear no overheating. They build stations as big as whole asteroids or bigger. I even heard there are some Kerbals out there who simply let go from gripping their space station, floating around in Orbit freely! I have never seen any human doing this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E6. Costs\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbals have no cost limit. Government seems to support every dollar the Kerbals give away. Rocket explodes thirty times on first day of KSP? Absolutely no problem!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E7. Low hunger / Only basic and cheap nutrition\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we see, the Kerbals have a drawer aboard the spaceship titled \u0022Snacks\u0022. But the note also states, they have already been eaten! This means that the Kerbals can endure a long time without any healthy nutrition, instead it even seems they can rely on fatty, unhealthy nutrition. As the crew doesn\u0027t protest against having no food aboard, I assume they have pre-eaten fatty snacks before the flight. By MockKnizzle - a participant of this ongoing thread - it was brought into the discussion that this could be a sign of photosynthesis which would also be a way to explain the green color of the Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E8. Physical construction of the Kerbals (brought in by LeonG17)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey are very resilient. They can survive re-entry and supersonic free fall.

Cuteness (brought in by Pachi3080)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPachi3080 notes that Kerbals are also very cute. From an analysis point of view, this is a real space advantage. Imagine a huge swarm of ant-like lifeforms to visit Earth. Would you stay diplomatic or stay a war? Aww, come on, don\u0027t hide your feelings! But then on the other hand imagine a lots of Kerbals visiting Earth. You would do everything for them. I know!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E11. They ask no questions (brought in by JaySmoka)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals never ask any questions, like humans. \u0022Is this neccessary?\u0022, \u0022Where do we go?\u0022, \u0022How long will it take?\u0022, \u0022Do we have enough food?\u0022 - typical human questions! Kerbals are like: \u0022Woot!! A new rocket? With atomic engine that overheats? This is great stuff!! LEEEEEETTTTTT\u0027s RIIIIIIIIIIDE!!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E12. Head-Body ratio (brought in by Brabbit1987)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible that the Kerbals have very big brains. This is due to the ration between their head- and body-size. They could be incredibly smart if this reflects their real brain size. Humans on the other hand are very limited due to their average-sized skulls which offer no more space for big brains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E13.

Even more, it seems the Kerbals don\u0027t even think in different nations. They know no racism as they are all equally green. This gives the Kerbals the opportunity to work together as a real team with no cultural misunderstandings to overcome.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E-----\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EWell, I hope you enjoyed my short analysis of Kerbal culture.
