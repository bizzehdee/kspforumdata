When you fly a ship into space orbit, you can then \u0022finalize\u0022 it and it will publish to the main server, and any changes to a craft will be made. A Permission and Turns system for any one spacecraft will be needed. (two people can\u0027t dock to the same ship at any one time, for instance.) The plugin would also maintain contact so your game knows when to reload a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-09T08:55:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe advantage of collaborative save files is simplicity - no server to run.
