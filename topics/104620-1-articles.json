The fuel flow rules in this games are, in a word, dumb. It\u0027s one of the many fixes we\u0027ve been promised in the release version. We\u0027ll se if that pans out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E It\u0027s very possible that something didn\u0027t translate well in your reinstall. It\u0027s unlikely it\u0027s something you did, it\u0027s just one of the issues we have to live with in a pre-release game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tassyr","CreatedById":42397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T22:13:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E...

If you want to drain fuel from the outer tanks into the inner tank, you just need one line from each outer tank, attached first to that outer tank, feeding into the middle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t quite see the fuel line arrows from the picture, but if you have fuel lines going in opposite directions to and from each tank, then I could see how this might confuse what is an easily confused mechanic.
