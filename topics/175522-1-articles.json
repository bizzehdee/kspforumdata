When I ran it off an SSD, the game started sometimes having the music stutter as if my computer was blue-screening, but the game kept on playing just fine. This was not observed with the hard drive. Meaning I\u0027m only more confused to this all. Is it a save thing? Is it a mod thing? Is it a Windows 10 thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Did a lot of looking into it. I think it may be a RAM issue? But there\u0027s still 5GB of system RAM open before the game crashes. The game never gets past 10GB ever. I\u0027ve also found this happening where if I got to the Tracking Station\u00A0on a new save, the game still gives out. I removed quite a few non-critical mods in order to eliminate possible issues, but that, didn\u0027t do anything. What puzzles me is this ran perfectly fine days ago. No mods have been changed when the game worked properly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit 2: Attempted to uninstall MSI Afterburner as has been referenced in the past. Lockups and crashes were still observed, even with RAM sucking mods besides GPO uninstalled. The same locking up behavior also manifested still in new saves. The mods have not been changed in a week on this install, and these issues only started as of last night. Even on new saves, with no mods changed in or out, when this install worked perfectly before. Windows issue due to the lack of crash log output? If so, what to do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-01T11:18:23Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2018 11:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Cooly568\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cooly568","CreatedById":17763,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-05T07:03:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I ended up solving it on my own, but I feel like the knowledge could be useful to others.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was running my RAM at 2667 MHz on my Ryzen system.
