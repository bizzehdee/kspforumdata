I have a craft sitting nicely on the pad, and I set up a launch to rendezvous with target, select autowarp and hit enable, and while time starts moving, I briefly hear the sounds of engines starting (then the noise cuts. Like a quick \u0027woosh\u0027) and then my craft is sitting at an odd angle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/47631382607990164/6DD44BA82397BA801ED94E81AEC8471837C835AA/\u0022 alt=\u00226DD44BA82397BA801ED94E81AEC8471837C835AA\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it doesn\u0027t fall over or act like it is off balance, it just goes weird.
