I have a craft sitting nicely on the pad, and I set up a launch to rendezvous with target, select autowarp and hit enable, and while time starts moving, I briefly hear the sounds of engines starting (then the noise cuts. Like a quick \u0027woosh\u0027) and then my craft is sitting at an odd angle\n\n![6DD44BA82397BA801ED94E81AEC8471837C835AA](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/47631382607990164/6DD44BA82397BA801ED94E81AEC8471837C835AA/)\n\nNow it doesn\u0027t fall over or act like it is off balance, it just goes weird. Does the same thing if I have supports too. Once launch time hits, it goes up like normal.\n\nAlso, several times I\u0027ve been in the air, say around 30km, and on the map, it still says I am sitting on the pad, and the apoapsis marker jumps all over the place until I get into \u0027space\u0027, and then it\u0027s all normal."},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T09:07:33Z","Content":"I\u0027ve had a funny like this related to launch clamps. You think you have disengaged them and the craft flies off but then they re-release at ~20km, with bits falling away from the craft."}]}
