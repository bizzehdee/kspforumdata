Therefore it\u0027d be far easier to save this aerodynamic behavior at that point of time when the configuration is actually present in game which will usually be while building the craft. (Usually you start to build your crafts from the top stage, don\u0027t you) Also regarding reattaching everything after stripping it of, you can just reload the finished craft provided you saved it earlier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022helaeon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022helaeon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the amazing shrinking predicted orbits on aerobraking on FAR issue:\u003Cp\u003EJust switched to NEAR from FAR.
