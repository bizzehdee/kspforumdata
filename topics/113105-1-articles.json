That way, this thread is dedicated to the Elcano Circumnavigation Challenge, keeping things clean from an organizational standpoint (though the story will jump between the previous thread and this one as critical dates go by).\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nPREVIOUSLY, ON THE SUNSHOOTER PROGRAM:\n\nOne of the Beyond goals has been the delivery of a MOLAB to the Mun--except that instead of a MOLAB, Subproject KRISTEN design director Carlisle Kerman proposed instead a circumnavigation rover, the Elcano-SunShooter Munar Magellanic Expedition (ESME) Vehicle, a proof-of-concept to demonstrate key technologies that will eventually be integrated into SunShooter\u0027s extraplanetary exploration and exploitation architecture. In SunShooter XIV, the Kerbal Space Program launched ESME and her all-female crew of Samene Kerman (pilot-ESME control), Marliana Kerman (scientist-ESME navigation), and Leevy Kerman (engineer-ESME systems) to the Mun. \n\nTheir mission was to scour select survey sites for a potential Mun base, and to investigate a couple of anomalies identified in the SunShooter X Munar mapping/observation mission. Above all else, though, was the primary goal: *the circumnavigation of the Mun*, on the resources which they had, with minimal (if any) support from Kerbin. The plucky ladies have just touched down and brought ESME to life. And they are about to embark on the grand munar journey...\n\n*LEGAL DISCLAIMER: The use of copyrighted material in this particular post was not authorized by the original authors.

We\u0027ve set an alarm for about two and a half days, at which point we advise you halt journey, go on standby, and rack out. In three days we have to launch some SunShooter hardware, and it will interfere with flight control for your mission.\u0022\n\n\u0022Copy, Crystal Palace,\u0022 replied Samene. She turned to Marliana, though Leevy, who was at the back in the crew tank, could still listen in and pipe up via intercom. \u0022So, you think we can get this done in three days?\u0022 she asked with a grin.\n\n\u0022Two and a half, Sam,\u0022 replied Marliana.\n\n\u0022Ugh, and here I was thinking of a \u0027three days\u0027 joke. Thanks, \u0027liana.\u0022\n\n~~~\n\n*At* Snow White *Base*\n\n![FumXpVo.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/FumXpVo.png?2)\n\nLeevy: \u0022I\u0027ve got the parts, and I\u0027m now heading over to the SEPOMS, Crystal Palace. Okay, taking off the light, installing probe core, and antenna, replacing light... and she\u0027s done!\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Understood, Leevy. Please turn the package on.\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Got it... she\u0027s alive! I can open the goo, gravioli readings coming in, ooh, pretty surface light! Tell the lab coats that all instruments are working and ready for their stuff. You see that, Podvey? THAT\u0027s how you do it! You need your mommy to wipe your butt for you after making poo-poo, too?\u0022\n\n*Meanwhile, at the kerbonaut complex on Kerbin, Podvey Kerman (the one responsible for installing a remote unkerballed experiment package without probe core or antenna) feels an odd tingle in his ear.*\n\nPodvey: \u0022Hmm... did someone just call me out? And implied I need diapers?\u0022\n\n~~~\n\n*Back in the ESME*\n\nSamene: \u0022Okay, Crystal, Leevy is back in her seat--and grinning like a madgirl, that creeps me out a bit. ESME was docile coming in, twelve, fifteen m/s max. Now we get to test her limits, maybe even give Carlisle a few heart attacks.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Copy, you are go for Elcano proper. And somehow, I don\u0027t think you can give that guy a heart attack. Even with the ES-1 landing, he mostly kept his cool. Keep us updated, and if all goes well, we will see you at Survey Site 1.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Thank you. Elcano-One out. Okay Marliana, this is how we do it. Leevy takes care of the engineering stuff, the fuel cell, reac valves, the works. You can handle the steering wheel and the gas pedal--well, drive lever. And I\u0027ll take care of attitude control.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Got it. I should really thank Bob for letting me have this spot--what are you plugging into the data port, Sam?\u0022\n\n![epZ0LaL.jpg?2](http://i.imgur.com/epZ0LaL.jpg?2)\n\nSamene: \u0022Just a little driving music.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Oh no, Sam, it\u0027s okay if you like Stage One Direction, I won\u0027t judge, and yes for what they sing, I can admit they can be talented, but that doesn\u0027t mean that others may like them. Like, for example, me. I\u0027m more of a Pretty Reckless fan. So, you know, things can get a little tense here.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Marliana, Marliana, Marliana. I can\u0027t believe you would think that of me. [Just because I let Bill and Hudgar have a piece of my mind about it, suddenly people think I\u0027m just boyband crazy](http://imgur.com/a/mFKTS#16).\u0022\n\nLeevy: (*muttering*) \u0022I don\u0027t think people *just think*...\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022But (1) I am a girl of varied musical tastes. (![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) I also happen to be a girl who is sensitive to the needs of her crewmates.\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022So as long as they don\u0027t intend to insult Stage One Direction, it seems.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Damn straight! And (quatro), the song in here is more appropriate--as an ode to this wonderful chariot that will take us around the Mun, and to her awesome crew that\u0027ll turn every head with an eye for beauty.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Oh gods, she\u0027s gone poetic. What\u0027s with the Mun and going romantic?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Eh, I\u0027m being complimented, let her poetry away!\u0022\n\n*Samene just grinned, plugged in her memory module, and hit Play.* [*An infectious, Western-style riff began pounding through the intercom*](https://soundcloud.com/coyotekisses/six-shooter).\n\nMarliana: (*smile growing on her face*) \u0022Okay... I likee.\u0022\n\nSamane: \u0022Thought you would.

Anyway, first checkpoint is down. Next checkpoint is the first of the possible anomalies that Crisgola caught during SunShooter X.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Understod, Crystal. \u0027liana, I\u0027ll bring her around, you get the flag.

Okay, Zayn Kerman, I\u0027ll have you know I have a more appropriate name for this place, based off its most prominent feature. Sinkhole Promenade.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Yeah. I don\u0027t see the difference with the name I just proposed.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Says the Stage One Direction fan.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Was that meant to be an insult?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Girls, *behave*!

This looks like an interesting feature to mark on the map. I mean, this turn-off here leads to the Northwest Crater, and obviously the two branches off to our left lead off to other areas of the Mun... I say we can call this land bridge a crossroads of sorts? *he he*\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Interesting insight, Leevy. Do you have a suggested name?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022How about \u0027Bridge of Sighs\u0027? *chuckle chuckle*\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022What does this place have to do with sighs, anyway?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022I dunno... sounds like a cool name, though? *snicker snicker*\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Well, far be it for me to contradict the explorer on mission, but go ahead. Plant your flag and stake your claim.\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Roger, Crystal Palace. *tee-hee*\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Uh, Leevy?

SAS arresting roll, I\u0027ve got her.\u0022 One eye on the navball, the other out the window, Samene slammed the flight stick to one side *hard*. \u0022Flipping her level--\u0022\n\n\u0022We\u0027re falling, Samene! Five meters, four--\u0022\n\n\u0022S\u0026^\u002B! I haven\u0027t lined her up yet!\u0022\n\nESME-01 landed crosswise her flight path. Her right side wheels caught the regolith, the force from which flipped her back into the air, as though the rover tripped on her wheels. Matters were not helped by the roll bar/landing strut taking the full force of ESME\u0027s roll--though since that bar caught her before she could land on her back, there was some wisdom to those roll bars.\n\n\u0022We\u0027re rolling right!\u0022 reported Marlene, her breath catching on each word.\n\n\u0022Countering!

That was fun! Can we do that again?\u0022\n\nMarlene could only stare at the intercom panel in utter disbelief. \u0022What the *hell* is wrong with you, Leevy?!\u0022\n\n\u0022Elcano-One!\u0022 The radio crackled to life. \u0022Report your sitch! Are--\u0022\n\n\u0022Samene here. We\u0027re stable-one, Crystal. Holy... I think we caught a rut there.\u0022\n\n\u0022That was *some* rut. For a moment there we thought you bought it.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, Kerbal Foundries do make their wheels good. And Carlisle\u0027s design isn\u0027t too shabby, either. We got her back under control, we\u0027ll be resuming shortly. Out. Well, girls, I think we gave Carlisle his heart attack with that. You okay, \u0027liana?\u0022\n\nAt this point, Marliana was borderline hyperventilating. \u0022I\u0027m sorry, guys. I should have paid attention to the surface. I shouldn\u0027t have taken that turn at speed--\u0022\n\n\u0022It\u0027s okay, Marliana. I was watching everything. We didn\u0027t notice that rut until it was too late. You got this, Marly. You\u0027re a good driver.\u0022 Samene rubbed the otherwise heaving shoulders of her copilot. \u0022Breathe.\u0022\n\nIt was a full minute before Marliana breathed normally. \u0022Okay.\u0022\n\n\u0022You want to take a break?\u0022\n\n\u0022No...\u0022 Marlene shook her head, gripping the wheel tight once more. \u0022No. It\u0027s okay, Sam.

Ten deegs, fifteen...\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Guys, I\u0027m checking your nav data here, and why is the waypoint lower than us?\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Alright, we\u0027re cresting this hill, and... ***oh you have got to be kidding me***.\u0022\n\n![ntGAGo2.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/ntGAGo2.png?1)\n\nSamene: \u0022Crystal Palace, please do me a solid and slap Crisgola when you see her.

(I\u0027m not going to be the one to slap her, though.) It is your judgment call, Elcano. The circumnavigation takes top priority, but the scientists here are hoping for some observational data.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Wait one, Crystal... Okay, we are making the call. **We\u0027re going down.**\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Are you sure?\u0022\n\n![K8gbDvv.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/K8gbDvv.png?1)\n\nSamene: \u0022The SCAN SAR hasn\u0027t been able to cover this crater yet. But I\u0027m eyeballing it, and the slopes don\u0027t seem too severe. ESME\u0027s been able to take the gradient getting up here, and I think she can take it going down. We\u0027ve got a good design here. We have all the power we need, as well as the Puffer brakes. We can control this.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Understood, Elcano. We\u0027ll be watching, and we\u0027re putting the *Regan* on remote standby, just in case.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Copy. Okay, Marly, what I want to do is to take this in switchbacks, take the slope at an angle to reduce the gradient we face.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Yeah. I recommend we don\u0027t go past ten as much as possible. But stand ready on the Puffers, just in case. I\u0027ve had enough tumbles for today.\u0022\n\n![RYO6i6O.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/RYO6i6O.png?1)\n*The legendary Eight-Six of Akina negotiates the--*\n\n*Oh, I\u0027m sorry.

Crystal Palace, our thermostat caution just came alive. Okay, it\u0027s the power pack. We are at 700 degrees and climbing.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Copy, Elcano-One. We confirm your readings, and they are on yellow. Those wedges are rated for 1400 degrees--\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022And we\u0027re not waiting for that, Crystal Palace. Leevy, shut her down. How long have we been running her?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Roger. Over an hour, ever since we left Sinkhole.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022I see. I thought US\u0027 inbuilt radiators would have been able to take care of those... We\u0027ll run on reserves for now.\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022So much for Universal Storage being the s\u0026^\u002B...\u0022\n\n~~~\n\nMarliana: \u0022Crystal Palace, we are at the Waypoint.

We\u0027re at the bottom of the barrel, and all we see are dregs.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Start a spiral search.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Cripes... and while running on reserves, too. Copy. Marlene, let\u0027s get this over with and get out of here...\u0022\n\n***Minutes later***\n\nMarliana: \u0022Hold up.

Leevy, can you break out the spotlight?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Bahamuto ICU-360 online. Swinging her portside. Whoa. I see...\u0022\n\n![RrURC89.png?2](http://i.imgur.com/RrURC89.png?2)\n\nSamene: \u0022I see it too!\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Crystal Palace, please buy Crisgola a pint for us. I... I think we found it!\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022And \u0027it\u0027 is?\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Looks like a monolith just like the one near KSC, only most of it\u0027s buried underground. We\u0027re stopping over her while I go down and check.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022I agree. I\u0027d also like to take the opportunity to cool down the power pack before we go on. I don\u0027t like the idea of that thng blowing up on us, or melting down the battery bulkhead halfway through our journey. Leevy, let\u0027s shut down the non-essentials and break out the emergency solar panel--\u0022\n\n*At this point, Carlisle broke into the comms.*\n\nCarlisle: \u0022Carlisle here. Mission specifications were to keep this journey solar-independent for as long as possible.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Well, doc, while I\u0027m trying to cool down the power pack, I can\u0027t very well run her, can I? And even with all systems off, we\u0027re drawing power for comms and telemetry. In any case, we\u0027re only breaking out the solars for as long as we\u0027re stopped over, just keep the battery charged while the fuel cell is offline. Once we\u0027re cooled off, it comes down. Unless, of course, you want us to run our batteries down until we cool off, which may take Kraken knows how long. How copy?\u0022\n\nGene: \u0022Elcano, FLIGHT, stand by.\u0022 (*off comms, to Carlisle*) \u0022I\u0027d listen to them, Carlisle. They\u0027re the ones on the ground there. If Samene says she won\u0027t run until they\u0027re cooled off, then they don\u0027t run. And if they need to go to solar power in the meanwhile, I say they go. Proving your design 100% is second place to their safety.\u0022\n\nCarlisle: \u0022I never implied I never cared for their safety. I just thought we had this overheating beat... Okay, solar while stopped over doesn\u0027t compromise the test run agenda much, anyway.\u0022\n\nGene: \u0022Thank you, Doctor. CAPCOM, tell them they\u0027re GO.\u0022\n\n![BZjo3vf.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/BZjo3vf.png?1)\n\n*Inset: Leevy Kerman installs the OX-STAT panel for hibernate/warm shutdown status*\n\n*And, geez, those US wedges take a long time to cool down...*\n\nChristina: \u0022Relax, Carlisle.

Did it only start overheating in the shadows of that crater, or was it a gradual climb?\n\nThanks Daishi! It\u0027s an honor hearing from you--and I was planning to drop a query on the US thread about processor run times, too. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI wasn\u0027t actively monitoring operating temperatures until the TempGauge went active at 700\u002B degrees (is it in Kelvin or Celsius? I never did figure that out from all the devnotes...), so I can\u0027t tell if there was a sudden spike right before I entered the crater. There are some observations I can give, though, if it could help:\n\nThis leg was the first time I decided to try running the fuel cell continuously (in Leg 1, I was alternating on and off whenever the battery was running low). The time I turned the FC on for Leg 2, the MET timestamp on a screenshot I took shortly after was 4d 03:09:42. When TempGauge went active, the screenshot I took after verifying which parts were heating with an F10 check (which is the screenshot used in the story), the MET was 4d 04:58:56. So if it was just from constant use, a gradual build-up, it took 2 hours for the parts to reach 700\u002B degrees, from whatever their vacuum rest temperature was. And to be fair, that\u0027s not even overheating by any standard--it\u0027s just Samene being extra cautious, it\u0027s her butt in the rover, after all. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI\u0027d already run Leg 3 immediately after Leg 2, once the temps dropped down to around 450, but for that I went back to turning off the FC whenever the batts were full, but this time paying attention to the temps on the TempGauge (I hadn\u0027t thought of using the debug menu to bring up part-specific numerical temp readings, d\u0027oh!). One nice thing about Kerbal Foundries wheels is that they have wonderful coasting behavior, so I\u0027m not on the throttle as much on level or downslope, so I get more time to cool off the FC in between batt top-ups. She still heats up every time the processor goes on, of course, but with the longer downtime, I can keep the temps down to around 400 degrees before I have to turn her on again, by the time I ended Leg 3 (another ~100km or so run). \n\nHeating rate on Leg 3 when the fuel cell was on was between one to two degrees per second. FC off, the cooling rate seemed maybe longer, I couldn\u0027t tell (call it 1 deg/sec?), but the longer downtime helps with temp management. All these, the cargo bay was open, partly if it helped cool off the wedges, and partly because I forgot to set the fuel cell to an action group.![:blush:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif)\n\nBefore I started Leg 3, however, I decided to see how far the wedges could cool down if I just time warped it. I wasn\u0027t paying attention to the clock sorry, but it was long enough for the sun to go higher in the sky (it brightened considerably), and the TempGauge went as far down as ~375 degrees, estimated (maybe even lower), before she started to climb again purely on solar heating. My guess is, an hour to two hours of cooling. I felt it too long, so I F9\u0027d to the quicksave I made right before I began cooling off, and went ahead as described a couple paragraphs above. \n\nAlthough the fuel cell heating is a concern, I think it\u0027s not critical: as Leg 3 had shown (I just need to do the write up), I can manage temperature levels just fine since I don\u0027t have to run her continuously. Downrange with the Apollo challenge this run is attached to, though, I am worried about the Elektron, since I think that will be the processor that I would run continuously (though admittedly a lot of it might happen in the background) to convert the water byproducts back to LH and LOX for the fuel cells. (Plus, that would be the wedge whose craft would be seeing a lot of sunlight.) I haven\u0027t tested yet the Elektron\u0027s heating behavior though.\n\nAnd--Leevy\u0027s lament notwithstanding--I actually do still think of Universal Storage as da bomb ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif), making it the (second-generation) core solar-independent heavy EC power system in the Apollo challenge submission I\u0027m doing. Way better than piling on the PB-NUKs, in a smaller and lighter package than the equivalent LFO fuel cell package, and more useful in atmo bodies when deploying solar panels is not an option. Processor heating would be the only concern on the horizon, though there are ways to design around it with stock or mod radiator solutions.\n\nAlso, that it took 2 hours for the wedges to even reach 700 degrees is an improvement over a couple US versions back (1.0.0.2, I think?). I was that guy that seconded having a radiator or heat sink wedge to wick off fuel cell or even craft heat in the thread. I had an electrical mini VTOL then, using Rover\u0027s ducted fans. Back then, I\u0027d be seeing the fuel cell assembly start glowing (F10 check) about 30 minutes of continuous operation. Though the way that VTOL was designed, its girder fuselage (to which everything else attached) was what sucked up all the heat from the fuel cell plus the engines. And yes, it got hot enough to blow up the girder. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m about to embark on Leg 4 soon, I plan to make another stress test of continuously running the fuel cell again, this time checking temperature rates. I can pass on any observations that I pick up. And I can\u0027t wait to see what US2 will bring. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nAnd I will pass on to Christina the note about calling up Nox In., Inc. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEDIT/CORRECTION: am running Leg 4 now.

I actually completed legs 4 (nearly 100km) and (surprisingly enough) 5 (about 160\u002B km) while leaving the FC on. Pleasantly surprised to see that the fuel cell held up, it didn\u0027t even hit 700 until more than halfway through Leg 5. Had the thermal debug displays on as well to keep track of things. I\u0027m planning on writing up in the story an experiment report of sorts (addressed to you guys in-story!) that would go over the findings, but I can drop in some highlights now that may be taken into account when you guys begin tweak: \n\nI got different heat rates across the journey. At the start of Leg 4, when I turned the fuel cell on for the continuous stress test, the heat gain rate was about a degree over six seconds. The start temps was 426.2.\n\nFurther along the Leg 4 trip, I took another heat rate check. Temps then was 575 degrees, heat rate was 1 degree/10 seconds.\n\nBy the time I reached Leg 4\u0027s waypoint for a stopover and survey, temps was 660 degrees, heat gain rate about a degree over 1 min 3 seconds. All this time, the cargo bay door was open.\n\nHere\u0027s where it gets cute. The stopover involved some EVA and housekeeping, but I kept the fuel cell on. When I got back, I found the cargo bay door closed (I don\u0027t know how that happened ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)--maybe I accidentally closed it while mucking about in EVA\\*). When I opened and checked the fuel cell, though, heat rates went back up to a degree over 10 seconds.\n\n(\\* = There\u0027s a hypothesis. I KIS\u0027d some redundant struts off the ESME, at least one of which were mounted on the cargo bay. And I just read from the US thread that KIS has a habit of resetting parts animations in the process. Maybe that\u0027s what happened.)\n\nSo now it\u0027s the run to Leg 5. My average speeds for the first half were lower than the speeds during the second half, but while this was going on, heat rates dropped back down to a tenth of a degree per five seconds... about 50 seconds for a degree. Also notable in this leg is that, while all previous legs were run with the sun in the sky, this leg saw an eclipse, and the sun dip back down below the terrain horizon. So it was practically a low solar radiation run. \n\nBy the time I completed Leg 5 and stopped, it was dawn twilight light-wise, temps were at 702 degrees, and the heat rate was 1 deg/15 sec. The fun part was when I shut it off, since I needed to stop over until there was more light out for base survey: the cooling rate was a relatively brisk -1 degree per 4 seconds. \n\nFinally, and this is the curious part, I didn\u0027t take notes about this, but IIRC, I didn\u0027t notice the parts temps of the surrounding parts change: the cargo bay (theoretically, which node the US core is mounted on, but which I think were built to either take or reject the heat well?), the battery (which was the bulkhead of the cargo bay, and would have been affected by conduction from the cargo bay), or the KIS container mounted nearby (which would have been affected by IR radiation from the heating processor), they were all still below 400 degrees. The US quadcore did heat up (second hottest, by a difference of 20-40 degrees, though I didn\u0027t check that much), as well as the other wedges.\n\nI\u0027d still say that the fuel cell, at least, is viable for short-term uninterrupted use. Certainly the radiator does its job quite well in dumping heat once the fuel cell is off. Haven\u0027t gotten her yet to 1000, and my bet is that it would take a bit more time to get her to 1000, let alone the max temp tolerance (so as long as the rover is at speed, though, considering the observations). I still haven\u0027t blown up a fuel cell yet, though back in 1.1.0.2, to reiterate, I managed to blow up a girder the fuel cell assembly was mounted to.\n\nThe differing rates are most curious, though, as are their contexts--I could almost imagine that the heat rate is inversely tied to the rover\u0027s speed ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif). Solar radiation could be a factor--I mean, while in motion, the rover\u0027s orientation would sometimes block out direct line of sight to Kerbol. The fuel cell is mounted towards the keel of the rover, though, below the other wedges, which should (I think) have provided that block from the sun, though. \n\nI think improvements to the heating model of the processor would be more critical to Sabatier and Elektron use, since their low conversion rates means that they\u0027re often left running continuously and long-term to get the desired products (though is heating tracked in background/out-of-focus processing?). That and... well, I was planning on making a long-range atmo electric flyer using a US fuel cell (hey, that\u0027s 6 hours endurance on one cell, without having to add extra tankage!), as well as the USI miniVTOL I had from 0.90. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThat is a great radiator model! Kinda how I imagined a radiator wedge could look like when I asked the question back in the thread, solid block of metal--the piping in the back is great detail that I haven\u0027t imagined! (The other option that someone else raised, where the wedge opens up to deploy a foldable radiator panel, I thought might not have worked for cooling an atmospheric speed craft since, well, folding panels). I only have one tank to capture the water byproduct, though--I take it the water simply overflows and is dumped if there\u0027s no free water space? (As it is, that radiator would be well appreciated on the proposed electric flyer craft, to keep heat accumulation from seeping into more fragile parts, and on the long-term processors. And I don\u0027t have to worry about recycling the water on this run, anyway--no available facilities; it\u0027ll be when I drop a Mun base there down the road that recycling and heat management will be critical.![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif))\n\nThanks again for all the help!

One problem, if not *the* problem, in space colonization is energy. Without it, we have nothing. On the heavy consumption side, we have the rover wheels, both KM and KF. Resource harvesting and conversion, including Snacks! support. We even have e-aircraft on the boards. The options on the supply side are limited. PB-NUKs at this level are unless en-masse, but we can\u0027t do that with manned craft for safety reasons. Nukes are also out, same reason. Solar panels? Spamming the STATs, inefficient. The more efficient options, they risk breakage. And once missions start going to the outer planets, efficiency begins dropping like a lead balloon. Not to mention useless during night or terrain shadow ops, or in eclipses. LFO fuel cells, power-to-weight for both the cells and the fuel leave much to be desired for some specific applications.\u0022\n\n\u0022And so US gives you what they can\u0027t: powerful, efficient, compact, modular, and flexible.\u0022\n\n![uNL3ndn.jpg?1](http://i.imgur.com/uNL3ndn.jpg?1)\n\n*This is really one of the advertised features of Universal Storage:*\n\n*to pair the Elektron and the Alkaline Fuel Cell into an RFC (regenerative fuel cell) system,*\n\n*provided you have enough solar panels and wedge space for the job.*\n\n*(Further questions about the efficiency of the design may be directed to the proper forum,*\n\n*I haven\u0027t gotten this far yet in my playthrough)*\n\nImage source: [CMR Prototech](http://www.prototech.no/index.cfm?id=223469)\n\n\u0022In nearly all, if not all, respects.

A lot of really rough ground between us and Site 2, though.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Yeah, well, if it doesn\u0027t bother you. I mean, we just had another spinout back there--\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022I\u0027m alright. You got skills on the flightstick, girl, and Leevy there doesn\u0027t seem to mind. I think we can jump this.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Jump?\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Yeah! Take this at speed.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Would you look at that. Marliana Kerman taking to her baptism of fire. Leevy, start that cell up again. I guess Marly here wants to show us what she\u0027s really made of.\u0022\n\n![zFDBnd5.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/zFDBnd5.png?1)\n\n*And Marliana is made of STUFF.*\n\n*This leg has seen more jumps than the movie White Men Can\u0027t Jump.*\n\nLeevy: ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif) \u0022What\u0027s a \u0027Men\u0027?\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n\u0022Funding?\u0022 Reclusiveness notwithstanding, Carlisle was allowed to care for the concerns of others--a badly needed attitude in a highly integrated multidisciplinary program like SunShooter.\n\n\u0022Whatever controls Kongress has on my purse, I do have some discretionary funds for when I see the need.\u0022\n\n\u0022Thank you.\u0022\n\nChristina shook her head. \u0022No.\u0022 Then leaned across the table, commanding the designer\u0027s attention. \u0022If I had concentrated more on Project EVANNA earlier, it\u0027s because they were on point for Phase 1: land a kerbal on the Mun and see him home safely. That\u0027s done, mission accomplished. We are on different ground now, foreign even. For Phase 2, it is KRISTEN and EMILY that are on point. We have the SKYbary, and maybe one in LMO as well. We need that Munbase. Without it, without KRISTEN, we have nothing. So there is no need to thank me, because I need you to deliver.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\nMarliana: \u0022Woo-hoo! Crystal Palace, Elcano-One is at Survey Site 2. Leg 3 is down!\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022And we\u0027re still in one piece.

Best site we\u0027d suggest for a Mun base in this locale is at the bottom of a crater.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Wait, did you say a crater?\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022But it\u0027s a nice crater. Getting in and out doesn\u0027t seem to be too hard, it\u0027s not like the base rovers or the drill bit need to be that mobile, and the gradients down here are as nice and soft as a warm bed. Plus, it\u0027s the best ore concentrations we have in the immediate vicinity. And it\u0027s certainly way better than back at the Northwest Crater.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Well, the hope was that we could deploy a more dispersed base, not have everything concentrated in one location. Would be pretty nasty, for example, if a fuel depot explosion were to send debris flying towards the hab, or a lander drop right on top of a mining rig.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022We hear, we hear. Well, if you want nicer ground, the ore concentrations are lightly lower. And that gets deader the more we head out to flatter ground westwards.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Alright, alright, your suggestion is duly noted. We got more sites to hit anyway, maybe they\u0027ll be more promising. Stand by and rig up for the next leg of your journey.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Roger that. We could use a bit of a cooldown, anyway.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n\u0022Nonetheless, I thank you. It is good to work for someone who can combine vision with practicality, and compassion with strentgh.

This time, the *55* circled in red was annotated with *Change of plans*. \u0022You could write me a speech.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  It\u0027s amazing, really. That small observation on the Universal Storage Alkaline Fuel Cell in Leg 2, then the response from Daishi about it.. which led to an experimental stress test in Legs 4 and 5 to figure out the limits and thermal behavior of the Fuel Cell on my part, and a look into the same issues on the part of the mod authors (see posts above). \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E[MFW your mission report attracts the attention of mod authors regarding the mod you just talked about](http://zrdavis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/real-life1.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E But really. US is a staple in any modded game I play precisely because of the virtues of accessible verisimilitude that Paul Kingtiger and Daishi have infused into the mod, that opens up sustainable and useful applications in a given playthrough. The heating issue was one that was observed since it was made compatible for 1.0.x, and (as Daishi explained here, and both him and Paul in the main US thread) the authors have been grappling with the necessary heating balance to preserve US\u0027 underlying design philosophy while accommodating the new gameplay challenge. The first step was to rebalance the heating rates of all the processors for 1.1.0.3. ESME\u0027s running on US 1.1.0.4, and as will be revealed in succeeding chapters, the US fuel cell does hold up to a surprisingly reasonable long-time use. That being said, there is still some heat creep, and that was what probably attracted Daishi to make the response he did.\n\u003E \n\u003E In any case, like Carlisle said, US is central to the solar-independent, LFO-independent power supply needs of the SunShooter Program, and the ESME Elcano run is the first test of that capability: to circumnavigate around the Mun on the US fuel cell alone \u002B 1@ additional LH2/LOX reserve tanks (at least when the rover is running. In extended stopovers and where/when able, Leevy mounts the OX-STAT like she did at the end of Leg 2 to cool off the fuel cell and keep the batteries topped up) without resupply. That\u0027s 21 days\u0027 endurance (1 day internal to the fuel cell\u0027s supplies \u002B 20 from the reserve tanks) on uninterrupted and continuous fuel cell use, discounting the possibility of overheat. \n\u003E \n\u003E Trust me, this ain\u0027t just cheerleading for Universal Storage: back in 0.90, I had *plans* for those cells on Duna operations, along with electrical rotors and propellers and wings and Kerbal Foundries wheels and tracks and Karbonite drills and converters and Extraplanetary Launchpads and and IR arms and KAS magnets and winches that would have made the Ahnold *Total Recall* look like *Little House on the*--okay, maybe I exaggerate, but you get the idea. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) (More specifically,\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GBRlvsR86s?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003E , as well as katateochi\u0027s own Contellation analogue.

The US QuadCore itself is at 548. The entire power pack is showing good heat rejection, except for the heat still feeding in. And here\u0027s the good part. Everything else in that compartment is sitting below 400 degrees. Even the compartment itself.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022So we won\u0027t have to worry about the entire rover melting, just the power pack itself.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022And we\u0027re still some ways off from the 1200 limit.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022I\u0027m actually feeling a lot better about this trip already.\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022So we keep going?\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022We keep going. Leave the power pack on, Leev. And keep the wheels warm, Marly. Before we set off, we\u0027ve got a job to do.\u0022\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This run was made after getting the call from Nox/getting the message from Daishi referred to back in Leg 3. From this point on, this circumnavigation became as much of a test of the US fuel cell as it was of the ESME. Well, it actually already was, but now seeing how much the fuel cell could take, and her behavior at different parts of the journey, is part of the experiment package, and part of what this circumnavigation is all about.\n\n**MISSION STATUS:** Fourth leg of circumnavigation complete. Second possible base site surveyed. US fuel cell heating dynamics observed. Temp. ~660 degrees.

What did your parents teach you? Flush your debris!\n\nAlright, before they had to embark on the longest leg of their journey so far, some housekeeping duties were in order.\n\nSamene had a flag to plant--partly for Elcano, partly to tell KSP \u0022Hey! Land here, here there be ore! In concentrations whose economic viability we do not know, but... ugh, my head.\u0022 Piloting is soooo much simpler.\n\nAs for Leevy, there were some support strut studs hanging off ESME that she wanted off. The less she had to worry about, the better. She did accidentally bump the cargo bay closed--it had been open the entire leg to help with heat management--and one stud mysteriously fell apart upon contact with the ground--but otherwise, it was an uneventful stopover.\n\n*Oy vey, your narrator jinxed it, didn\u0027t he?*\n\n* * *\n\n\u0022Sam, you\u0027re not going to believe this,\u0022 moaned Leevy after she reboarded the ESME. \u0022Heat rates went back up!\u0022\n\n\u0022What? Check your instruments again!\u0022\n\n\u0022I just did. We\u0027re back to a degree in ten seconds.\u0022\n\n\u0022I noticed the bay doors were closed. You think that had something to do with it?\u0022\n\n\u0022I don\u0027t know. We were out for how long? Five minutes, ten max?\u0022\n\n\u0022So the only difference between then and now is that we stopped, right? Crystal Palace, do you read?\u0022\n\n\u0022We read you, Elcano-One,\u0022 replied CAPCOM. \u0022And we have your telemetry. We don\u0027t know how to explain it, either. It\u0027s your call.\u0022\n\nIt\u0027s not that pilots are not given to thoughtfulness--they are. Being who they are, though, their thoughtfulness has to run faster than the average kerbal. It only took three seconds. \u0022I say we go on. This is going to sound weird, but maybe we\u0027ll cool off the faster we go. Just like a radiator in a car. What do you think, girls?\u0022\n\n\u0022The only weird part about that analogy is that it\u0027s not like in a car, we\u0027re in a vacuum,\u0022 Marliana pointed out. \u0022There\u0027s no convection to help us out here.\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, it seems we slow down heating the faster we go, right? I\u0027ll take what we\u0027ve got so far.\u0022\n\n\u0022I hear you. Booking it.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n![9NDl0VQ.png](http://i.imgur.com/9NDl0VQ.png)\n\nInset: One would think that this terrain looks easy.\n\nWell, one is mistaken.\n\nMarliana: \u0022Alright, we got another visual swing download from the *Katie Bell*. Not as many craters to worry about between us and the terminator line, at least. Some to worry about closer to our destination, but nothing worse than what we\u0027ve faced.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022If they all were only this easy. Press on!\u0022\n\n***Later...***\n\nMarliana: \u0022Okay, maybe I spoke too soon. We\u0027re seeing some of the slowest average speeds around here, barely breaking out of the low 20\u0027s.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022It\u0027s just like in the craters--\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022I can make up the upslope speeds with the downslope. Here, it\u0027s one hump after the other. This isn\u0027t helping your \u0027we must go faster\u0027 theory--or our travel rate. We\u0027ve only lopped off about 23 kilometers in 20 minutes.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Let me bring up the slope data...\u0022\n\n![aCMWiFt.png](http://i.imgur.com/aCMWiFt.png)\n\nSamene: \u0022Well, no wonder, Marly. You\u0027ve driven us into red tide.\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Uh, isn\u0027t that... insensitive?\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022I wasn\u0027t making any reference to that impolite euphemism for periods. Red tide, as in bad algae blooms.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Wow, she actually knows some science beyond aerodynamics.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Oh, it\u0027s common enough to someone who lives close to the sea. Check the BTDT trace. Even if the SAR hadn\u0027t captured the entire area yet, we\u0027re in an area of radical slope changes marked off in--\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022I see. Red, like a bad algae bloom. And just like a bad algae bloom--not to mention the \u0027other red tide\u0027--this is getting irritating. We must go faster!\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Wow, Marliana has turned into QUITE the speed demon.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n![Ysiy2zv.png](http://i.imgur.com/Ysiy2zv.png)\n\nOnce upon a time there was light in my life\n\nBut now there\u0027s only love in the dark\n\nNothing I can say\n\nA total eclipse of the... er, sun.\n\n\u0022Wow, would you look at that?\u0022 exclaimed Leevy.\n\n\u0022And this is where the solar-independent power concept proves itself,\u0022 Carlisle pointed out back in Mission Control, without any trace of smugness, as they saw the picture Leevy caught from her window, of Kerbin eclipsing the sun. A certain haunted mood descended on everyone, with the reflection that they, down in Kerbin, now shrouded the ESME and her crew in that unnatural dark, and were it not for the US fuel cell (heating behavior notwithstanding), they would have run ESME to the ground from lack of power. \n\n* * *\n\nMarliana: \u0022Terrain\u0027s flattening out some, I think we\u0027re coming out of red tide.\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Those must be the most refreshing words a girl can say any day.\u0022\n\nMarliana and Samene: *\u0022Leevy!*\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022What? You were the one to bring it up, Sam.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022I DIDN\u0027T MEAN THAT! I TOLD YOU THAT, DIDN\u0027T I?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Er... Oh, would you look at this, too? Heating rates are way down again. A while ago, it was five seconds for a tenth of a degree--fifty seconds for a degree. Now, it\u0027s eight seconds to the tenth--a degree per eighty seconds.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n![AtQzf2r.png](http://i.imgur.com/AtQzf2r.png)\n\nMarliana: \u0022Oh, we are out of red tide now! (Leevy, NOT A WORD!). We\u0027re tagging forty, wow, up to FIFTY me\u0027s!\u0022\n\nROVER: \u0022We read your max speed as fifty meters per second... yes, that\u0027s actually ***take-off*** speed, Marliana. You sure you\u0027re still alright?\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Sure I\u0027m sure!\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Here comes a bump!\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Not a problem!\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022*And those craters up ahead?*\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022After all we\u0027ve gone through, and the speed we have? Not gonna be a problem, either!\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n![207ylcV.png](http://i.imgur.com/207ylcV.png)\n\nWasn\u0027t it just sunrise a couple hours ago?\n\nInset: And oh, look! A nighttime obstacle course!\n\nLeevy: \u0022Holy... Are we outpacing the sunrise, girls?\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Really? Wow, I guess I can say I\u0027m faster than light now!\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Not to burst your bubble, Marly, but that is a bit of a hill behind us. Also, with the interaction among the Mun\u0027s rotation, her orbit around Kerbin, and the time of year, there will be some times that Kerbolrise and Kerbolset will be slower.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Way to dampen my mood, Sam.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Yeah, way to dampen her mood, Sam.\u0022\n\nSamene: ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif) \u0022Oh, thanks for butting in, CAPCOM.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Anytime, Elcano-One, it goes with the job. Anyway, even as your observations are impressively accurate, Samene, we actually read your position at the Munar terminator. The boundary between light and dark. You really are racing the sunrise now.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022CAPCOM, did I ever thank you for knowing how to make a girl feel better?\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022You\u0027re always welcome, but now on to more serious matters. We had chosen to make your drop in Snow White at sunrise to maximize daylight dravel time. As it stands, however, our projections were woefully inadequate. You are running straight into the dark at your rate. Also, you are running straight into an extensive crater formation. I would strenuously suggest navigating the high ground rather than going through the holes, Marliana. A crater in the dark can be a tricky proposition.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n\u0022\u0027A crater in the dark can be a tricky proposition.\u0027 Yeah, so can high ground at 40 meters per second,\u0022 Samene muttered about twelve minutes later as they tried to negotiate the land bridge in the light of twilight.\n\n\u0022We need to make up for lost time, Sam,\u0022 Marliana muttered back. \u0022At this speed, we\u0027re thirty minutes to waypoint, as the krow flies. And since there may be more detours or bumps...\u0022\n\nBoth concentrated hard as they drove in twilight; even Leevy had stopped her usual cheerful banter, defering to the moment. Instead, she operated the Bahamuto ICU-360 spotlight, to light up their path further than their headlights could.\n\nAll the caution in the world may not be able to prevent all misfortune, but they can help in dealing with them.\n\n**BAM!**\n\n![QJGQGg3.png](http://i.imgur.com/QJGQGg3.png)\n*Taken after the second roll, trying to line up with the ground*\n\nMarliana: \u0022Wheel bump! ESME flipping left!\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022SAS dampening--damn, this is violent! Carrying the roll instead! One roll! Two roll--arrested! Coming down--lining up!\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Throttling up! Keep her nose up, Sam!\u0022\n\n**THUD!**\n\nSamene: \u0022And we\u0027re down.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Easing up on throttle, twenty, seventeen... Okay, everything is still intact. I am starting to get used to this.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Crystal Palace, be advised: We hit another bump at speed there, but we are down and fine. Something has to be said for hitting bumps at low gravity and high speed. It gives you more time to react--usually.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022It\u0027s still a protocol we will not recommend for the books, Sam. But great hands, girl. Great stick work. Good to have you on board.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\n![8WtN79f.png](http://i.imgur.com/8WtN79f.png)\n\n*Okay, now this is weird. The vessel classification kept rapidly switching between Base and Rover.*\n\n*Does this also explain why I could quit to the Space Center even while in motion, so as long as I was on the ground?*\n\nGNC: \u0022FLIGHT, I think that last bump is the least of their problems. They hold their course, they will hit the Canyons.\u0022\n\nGene: \u0022Really, now, the Canyons? Well, no one wants to hit the Canyons, do they?\u0022\n\nCarlisle: (*muttering to Christina*) \u0022Forgive my confusion, but there must be an inside joke somewhere here, is there?\u0022\n\nChristina: (*muttering back*) \u0022Trust me, C, no matter how curious you get, just don\u0027t hit the Canyons.\u0022 (*to Gene*) \u0022There can be opportunities for additional surface scans, though, Gene. And in any case, unless they want to make a detour--\u0022\n\nGene: \u0022Their call, though. Apart from that, I concur. Send it up, CAPCOM. Tell them to hit the Canyons.

I just forgot to hit the surface analysis device.*\n\nMarliana: \u0022Crystal Palace, we\u0027re just about out of the Canyons, just a bit of a climb and we can call it done.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Except for one thing, Elcano-One. You missed a spot.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Huh?\u0022\n\nCAPCCOM: \u0022Your surface analysis data.\u0022\n\nMarliana: ![:huh:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif) \u0022Dude, we have data for the Farside Crater and Highland Craters.

An easy enough maneuver for any experienced pilot to deal with *(and no, it is not Z or R twice, or LB \u002B RB)*, so not the drama.\n\n\u0022*Phew*,\u0022 sighed Marliana after they hit the ground on all six wheels, \u0022that ramp was more wicked than back at my ex-boyfriend\u0027s skate park.\u0022\n\nSamene could only goggle at the self-proclaimed geology nerd. \u0022You.

How\u0027s the site?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Dark.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022Apart from that smart-a\\*\\* comment, Leevy?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022Well, I can\u0027t evaluate the terrain in these conditions. I could use a little extra light. A lot more than the spotlight, that\u0027s for sure.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Wow, I really did race the sunrise. And WIN!\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022How\u0027s the fuel cell holding up?\u0022\n\nLeevy: \u0022We\u0027re at 712 right now. Last time I checked at 702 degrees, the heat rate was at 15 seconds for one degree.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022Okay, that one\u0027s going fast. Crystal Palace, request permission to shut down the fuel cell temporarily, I\u0027d like to see some cooling properties.\u0022\n\nCAPCOM: \u0022We see no harm in that, Elcano-One.

I don\u0027t want to make a call in the dark... literally. We can also observe the fuel cell at rest, I\u0027d like to confirm some hypotheses I have since the last stopover.\u0022\n\nSamene: \u0022I concur.\u0022\n\nMarliana: \u0022Well, as much as I am enjoying this... yeah.

We waited three hours so we can have a good look at the survey site, things seem okay, so we\u0027re marking this as a possible. We now have two hours before we have to call a break, so Crystal Palace can work on something big. Sam\u0027s telling us to punch it, we have two hours to the alarm, and she wants to make it to Waypoint 6 by then.\n\n![RtAA6FH.png](http://i.imgur.com/RtAA6FH.png)\n\nThis is one of the longest legs of our journey, about 150\u002B kilometers, and I thought the fuel cell redlining would make things exciting, but she\u0027s taking her sweet time getting there. At least Samene ain\u0027t stressing about it anymore, she just be cruising along, just like the ESME.\n\nAnd Marliana, wow, one day behind the wheel and she\u0027s suddenly NASKAR material. I mean, she managed to drive us into two big craters, no big deal for her, right? Two craters. **TWO.** That\u0027s two ones. \n\n![mIgnU2u.png](http://i.imgur.com/mIgnU2u.png)\n\n\u0022Samene, I swear, that crater popped out of nowhere!\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, and so did your skater ex-boyfriend, Marliana. Completely out from left field.\u0022\n\nAnd that\u0027s... awesome?\n\nWell, not for Samene. Now she\u0027s complaining about using up all our prop just trying to brake our drops. Crater one, there was this steep dropoff, Samene was afraid of going out of control, so poof! go the Puffs, and bingo, we\u0027re now 50% fuel, down from about 60%. She really needs to learn to relax about the gas. Remember the saying? If the gauge says \u0022empty\u0022, it just means you\u0027ve got a couple of kilometers left.\n\nThat first crater was BIG. I mean, the crater had craters. Crater-ception? Marliana talked about stuff that we all knew already: no air on Mun, 100% of all meteorites hit, yadda yadda. \n\nOh, but what really made Marliana light up? We\u0027re supposed to be doing our surveys at the designated waypoints, right? Apparently not, because suddenly Marly started jumping in her seat, going \u0022We\u0027re getting 8\u0027s! We\u0027re getting 9\u0027s!\u0022 and insisting on stopping halfway to the next waypoint. **TWICE.** That\u0027s two ones. *Again*. \n\n![tdxcb8T.png](http://i.imgur.com/tdxcb8T.png)\n\n\u0022Marliana, I don\u0027t think you get the idea of circumnavigation. Circumnavigation usually involves circumnavigating something.\n\nNot moving at all isn\u0027t circumnavigating.\u0022\n\nAnd that\u0027s... terrible.\n\nI don\u0027t know about these locations. Marly\u0027s going \u0022They\u0027re the best concentrations so far on this trip, why shouldn\u0027t the base be here?\u0022 and I\u0027m going \u0022I\u0027m not liking the slope readings at all, haven\u0027t you checked the SCANsat?\u0022 and Samene\u0027s all \u0022Look, I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re right, Marliana, or you\u0027re right, Leevy, but so as long as I don\u0027t plant my face on the ground on touchdown, it\u0027s good enough for a base.\u0022\n\nI\u0027m the one who\u0027s right. Base setup is an engineering problem. I\u0027m always right. Right? But who listens to us engineers, anyway, when it\u0027s all \u0022In the name of science\u0022 and \u0022Economic viability of ore extraction\u0022 and \u0022Ooh, shiny!\u0022 It\u0027s a shame, though. All this lovely ore, and they have to be locked in some of the worst spots to build a munbase. Don\u0027t blame me, Sam, if you manage to tip over that new drill rig Carlisle is cooking up!\n\nSpeaking of tip-overs: The most exciting part of the trip, though? WE MANAGED TO ROLL OVER!\n\n![ntfk0Fm.png](http://i.imgur.com/ntfk0Fm.png)\n\n*You ever seen turtles flipped onto their shells? How helpless they were as they tried to flip back upright?*\n\n*I know how we can help them: give them Advanced SAS!*\n\nWe were just cruising along, in Four-Red status, then suddenly, BAM! We\u0027re in the air, and rolling as fast as the centrifuges back in ground school. Sam\u0027s all \u0022![:0.0:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif)She\u0027s spinning too fast!\u0022 and Marly\u0027s like \u0022![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)You\u0027re feeding the spin!\u0022 and Crystal Palace is all \u0022[**CENSORED**]\u0022, \u0022[**CENSORED**]\u0022, and even more \u0022[**CENSORED SO HARD THE FCC IS FEELING THIS RIGHT NOW**].\u0022 So Samene managed to get it all under control, but there wasn\u0027t enough time to straighten out our landing, so she just let us land on our right side wheels, but we were nearly upside-down. Marly\u0027s all \u0022You can\u0027t recover!\u0022 and Sam\u0027s \u0022I\u0027m not trying to recover!\u0022\n\nWhat she was doing was using the reaction wheels to gently set us on our back, so we don\u0027t break anything important. It\u0027s a good thing that Kerbal Foundries wheels are tough, and that all the important bits and bobs are all within the profile of the ESME hull, so we could gently roll onto our backs like what Sam did. I wasn\u0027t expecting it, really. Anyway, once we were on our back, all Sam had to do was power up the wheels and flip us back on our feet. Presto! \n\n![hpWk9UF.png](http://i.imgur.com/hpWk9UF.png)\n\nThe Kerbal Space Program apologizes for the dark photographs sometimes taken.\n\nThe Mun\u0027s orbital and rotation mechanics are not cooperating with the ESME\u0027s speed.\n\nWell, we\u0027re here now in Waypoint 6, actually. And would you look at that, it\u0027s dark again! Crystal Palace is thinking about asking us to stay over for longer, maybe until the sun is high above our heads, so we\u0027d get longer travel times. Sam and Marly are thinking about trying to drive in the dark--I can\u0027t blame them, we\u0027re halfway around the Mun now! I don\u0027t know about that, though: we do need to evaluate these sites for possible base locations, and you can\u0027t do that if you can\u0027t see the terrain, so I\u0027m with Crystal Palace on this. A SCANsat reading can only tell you so much, and without really fine resolution at that.\n\nAnd amazingly, we made it to Waypoint 6 within the two hours to the alarm, with minutes to spare! Imagine that? Nearly 160 kilometers, maybe even longer since we weren\u0027t exactly driving in a straight line, with TWO extra stopovers, and one rollover event, and all that in two hours. That\u0027s highway speeds! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnyway, have to sign off now. Crystal Palace says they need the bandwidth for the big launch they\u0027re going to do today. Once they\u0027re done, then everyone\u0027s going to decide if we head on out in the dark, or stick it out until there\u0027s more light out. Until then, I do have a fuel cell to babysit (though it isn\u0027t giving us much trouble, really; her heat just keeps going up and down, but at the end of this leg we\u0027re sitting at 732 degrees, the same as when we set out. Heat\u0027s just weird, I guess), and some suspensions to check.\n\nTTFN, kerwitches!\n\nLeev\n\n~~~\n\nNOTE: The content of this publication does not reflect the official opinion of the Kerbal Space Program. \n\nResponsibility for the information and views expressed therein lies entirely with the author(s).\n\n* * *\n\n![jIapoqu.png](http://i.imgur.com/jIapoqu.png)\n\n**MISSION STATUS:** Leg 6 of circumnavigation complete.

We could have gone on to Leg 8 and just waited for the CARE Package there, though. Save us some time, too.\u0022\n\nWhat CAPCOM back home at Kerbin could not see, though, even through the crew cams, was the common impatience infecting the three. Elcano-One was way more than half-way around the Mun, by some estimates, 2/3 of the way. Their next waypoint, and the last marked survey site, was only about a tad over a hundred kilometers away. CARE Package was under an hour before her scheduled orbital insertion burn. Then FIDO discovered that the burn node was directly over Elcano-One\u0027s position. \n\n\u0022This way,\u0022 replied CAPCOM, \u0022we get the package faster to you. I think you will be pleased with what\u0027s inside. Plus, waiting an hour gives you more light to work with.\u0022 The orbital insertion was turned into a suborbital drop over the girls\u0027 heads.\n\n\u0022This package better be worth it.\u0022 Samene traded a wry eye with Marliana.\n\n* * *\n\n***One hour later...***\n\n![RTGPtTE.png](http://i.imgur.com/RTGPtTE.png)\n\nCompact Autonomous Reliable Expeditious Package. *Look, not all the acronyms have to make sense*.\n\n\u0022CARE Package is down!\u0022 Samene announced over the radio as the drone resupply pod touched down. \n\n\u0022Yeah, I give it a 2.6 on the landing,\u0022 Leevy laughed, \u0022you were hopping her all over the place, Crystal Palace.\u0022\n\n\u0022If you hadn\u0027t noticed, Leevy,\u0022 replied a testy CAPCOM, \u0022we were trying to get the pod closer to you.\u0022\n\n\u0022We are in a muncar,\u0022 Marliana pointed out amiably. \u0022We could have just driven over.\u0022\n\n\u0022Ugh!

Crystal Palace, Leevy, *is this for real*?\u0022\n\n\u0022As real as it gets!\u0022 CAPCOM replied. \u0022The boss got in contact with US marketing, who passed it on to Nox Industrial, and Daishi himself dug out that prototype radiator from their labs, tweaked it a bit, and sent it over to us.\u0022\n\n\u0022NO WAY!\u0022 joined Samene.\n\n\u0022Way! They were concerned about the fuel cell running hot--Nox and New Horizons designed Universal Storage processor systems with long-term continuous usage in mind. Now that they\u0027re building up to Universal Storage 2, they\u0027d like to be able to nail down heat dynamics--like you said, Samene, heat can act weird sometimes.\u0022\n\n\u0022NO WAY!\u0022 exclaimed Marlene--okay, now NO WAY is getting infectious as well.\n\n\u0022Now, remember that what we\u0027ve got is a prototype. We\u0027re still not sure what the effects will be out in the field. Right now, we\u0027re putting the radiator through simulations and vacuum chamber tests. Seems to hold up okay most of the time, it keeps the fuel cell to a comfortable temperature for extended periods. Other times, though, the fuel cell manages to reach 700 degrees, especially in simulation if we warp, though the radiator does somehow slow down the heating rate. Daishi himself says that at the very least, it\u0027ll keep the fuel cell temps down, especially away from the critical 1200.\u0022\n\n\u0022And since we\u0027re in the field, we get to be the ones to test it, right?\u0022 Samene inquired, though she already knew the answer. \u0022Alright, we\u0027ll put it through its paces. What now?\u0022\n\n\u0022Daishi says to replace the water wedge with the radiator. We\u0027ve included a couple of radial water tanks to take its place. Don\u0027t forget to drain whatever water\u0027s in the fuel cell\u0027s storage into the tank, should give you a couple liters extra room. We don\u0027t expect your run to fill up even one of the 10 liter water radials for the remainder of your journey, so it should suffice.\u0022\n\n* * *\n\nLeevy: \u0022Dang, this wedge is heavy!

Set suspension to 10, and it\u0027s as if metal bearings are *grinding* in them wheels.\n\nPROTIP: Don\u0027t drop the tweakable suspension any lower than necessary when operational.\n\nLeevy: \u0022Yep!

Last time I tried the closed-circuit run was back in 0.90, and it wasn\u0027t perpetual-motion. IIRC, the finding I had there was that there\u0027s a difference between the consumption rate of water of the Elektron (slower) and the production rate of the fuel cell (faster). So even if one fuel cell can power one Elektron, water wasn\u0027t being electrolysed back to H and O fast enough to meet the fuel cell\u0027s needs. Even in the separate tests of those two today (which I did to test heating values), I think the Elektron runs slower in the water-conversion department than the fuel cell in water-generation. But I\u0027d need to run another test to be sure. We could also recheck the configs or the published parts stats to see the actual per-second production and consumption rates for EC, water, H and O. \n\nPaul does make adjustments to the parts stats based on balance tweaking plus the latest research he could get on equivalent real-world systems.

The resource generator module might have bugged out.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T10:44:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 10:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Daishi**"}]}
