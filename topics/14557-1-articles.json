Why? It is almost always a TON easier. Here\\\u0027s a generic list of parts and general price ranges you want to be looking at (in AUD; USD are pretty close usually anyway). The only exception is if you plan on buying a Mac, in which case you can just use Apple\\\u0027s customiser to get you the best of everything. It\\\u0027s hellishly expensive, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMotherboard -- suggest a Gigabyte branded mobo, in the range of $100-$150. There are some real gems around that range if you have a bit of a hunt around then internet. You\\\u0027ll want at least one PCI-E 16x slot, either 2.0 or 2.1, for the graphics card. If you want to avoid spending a thousand bucks for an epic processor, you should get one that has an AM3/AM3\u002B slot for a CPU. Why? See next point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcessor -- the best bang for your buck processor is almost undoubtedly the six-core AMD Phenom II X6, which I got brand new for around $230, whereas similar Intel processor (i5 or i7) would be upwards of $600 in some cases, according to most of what I hear about Intel\\\u0027s processors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPower Supply -- Ideally around 500W-750W. Most likely to be under $100.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECase -- Anything big enough to fit in a normal-sized motherboard (if it can take an ATX motherboard -- NOT Micro-ATX -- it should be OK, but try to have a bit extra room; video cards are typically pretty huge). Around $100-$150.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERAM -- Around 4GB will do fine, but you can go for more if you want and are planning on using a 64-bit OS. Depending on the brand you get, you can get around 4GB for less than $60 if you look around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHard Disk -- Either a reasonably large SSD drive -- say, 120-ish GB or a standard disk drive at around 1TB. Sure, you probably won\\\u0027t use all the space on a 1TB drive, but they aren\\\u0027t exactly expensive these days. Around $120 for a decent SSD, and around $60 for a 1TB HDD, from memory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVideo Card -- Whatever is within budget. It\\\u0027s a good idea to go for one around $100-$150 if you\\\u0027re going for budget, and upwards of $200-$300 if you\\\u0027ve got a bit extra cash. I\\\u0027d recommend going with an ATI card, primarily because you almost always get more bang for your buck, although be sure to do a bit of research on the card you\\\u0027re going to get, because on some of the cards, the drivers that go with them do not play nice with certain games, and you get it looking all funny. As long as you steer clear of the real troublemakers, you should be fine. Just do a Google search for the card\\\u0027s name and model and see if any major problems with them pop up.\\\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnnnd... that should just about cover all your bases. Not including peripherals, that\\\u0027s (I haven\\\u0027t added it all up, but) roughly under $1000. A similar PC from a retail store would most likely be above $1700 or more. And a decent computer repair shop will put it all together for you and get it up and running usually for less than a hundred or a hundred and fifty at the very outside, unless they\\\u0027re extremely stingy or they encounter unusual problems with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if you decide to go this way, make sure you talk to whoever you\\\u0027re getting to put it together for you and ask for recommendations, etc, because 99% of the time they know what they\\\u0027re talking about and can tell you if something isn\\\u0027t going to work and what alternatives are available and costs and suchlike. Do so when you have a list of parts you think will work well for you, but BEFORE you go off and buy them, in case you missed something about a particular part (or two) that will make things difficult for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rico88","CreatedById":3712,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-18T12:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think he meant the old Mun texture.
