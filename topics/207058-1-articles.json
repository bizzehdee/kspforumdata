Oxygen is highly reactive and unlikely to exist in those concentrations without some process that constantly replenishes it. If new Oxygen wasn\u0027t constantly being generated on Earth it would all just be used up in fires and less violent forms of oxidation and end up as some carbon-oxygen compound or water or various metallic oxides. All in all that means it\u0027s unlikely we will ever find any kind of planet - rocky or gaseous - that has breathable air unless that planet already contains oxygen-producing life forms.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore life, Earth had very little free Oxygen, and the first appearance of oxygen producing life very nearly killed everything on the planet, including the life that produced it, due to the extreme chemical changes in the atmosphere and oceans that it caused. See the \u0022Great Oxidation Event\u0022, it\u0027s a very interesting episode in Earth\u0027s past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course we have no examples of life existing on gas giants, so if that would even be possible is anyone\u0027s guess, but it\u0027s safe to say that if we ever did find enough oxygen in a gas giant\u0027s atmosphere, there\u0027d be something there that might not want to share it with us \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-02-26T17:00:49Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2022 05:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Beamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-26T18:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n*Raises finger* Ah!
