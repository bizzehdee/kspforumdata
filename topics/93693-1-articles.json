If you have sufficient TWR and stability, you\u0027ll get it every time when burning at 120\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA from a very low orbit. The right positioning relative to the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnrise vary by altitude of Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo rendezvous in orbit without maneuver nodes or targeting:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) Get in a slightly lower orbit if you\u0027re behind, or slightly higher if you\u0027re ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) Time warp until you start to get a lot closer. The point at which you put your orbit back like the target\u0027s orbit is when you\u0027d meet up on the other side of the planet. So watch how much closer you get in one half orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) Lower/raise the opposite side of your orbit to match the target\u0027s orbit. Time warp around to the other side and see how close you got, and adjust your orbit circular again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) Keep repeating steps 1-3, getting your orbit closer and closer to the target\u0027s orbit as you get closer and closer to the target. When you get very close to the target, switch out of map view to finish the rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) Find the target\u0027s color diamond marker in your view and watch its heading relative to yours. Line up the target directly past your spaceship from your view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) Point your ship in the direction that the target appears to be heading. It should be completely horizontal to you. Burn gradually until the target appears to stop moving. You might have to adjust your heading a few times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.) Burn directly towards the target. Watch its distance so you know how fast you\u0027re approaching it. Give yourself plenty of time to \u0022stop\u0022. Turn directly around (exact opposite of the way you were just facing), then slow down at closest approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.) You may (probably will) have to repeat steps 5 and 6 again once you get closer. Keep going through steps 5-7 until you\u0027re right next to the target. Careful not to crash into it!
