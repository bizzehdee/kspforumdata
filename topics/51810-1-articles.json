He showed a way in which the interaction was projected onto where the orbital body currently is, so one can easily fine-tune the orbit, as opposed to where it will be, which doesn\u0027t let you focus on the target body and adjust. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T08:36:52Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 08:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Collin Dow\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vector","CreatedById":80152,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T06:46:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn settings.cfg, change to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECONIC_PATCH_DRAW_MODE = 0\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T06:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11322-Different-Conic-drawing-modes\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11322-Different-Conic-drawing-modes\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore detail explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Collin Dow","CreatedById":64846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T08:36:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFantastic, thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
