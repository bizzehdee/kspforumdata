If you want to into the same plane as an orbiting station, you wait until the plane of the station is directly above \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E before launching at the correct inclination. If you do it with KOS, you might be able to get a slight time offset to compensate for the fact that you do not start at full speed, but in my experience I get larger errors from controlling the rocket than being off by a few minutes. A fully automated launch require knowledge of the orbital parameters of the station as well as Kerbin itself, and is far beyond what I can describe in a single post. It is at that time you need to study celestial mechanics somewhat seriously, as in college level textbooks. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128005-ohiobob/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022128005\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128005-ohiobob/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@OhioBob\u003C/a\u003E \u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehomepage\u003C/a\u003E gives the equations, but it is somewhat condensed, as it is not a textbook.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T13:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll second the reference to OhioBob\u0027s page.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wrote up my solution to launching into an inclined plane here (specifically the etaToOrbitPlane function):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/ElWanderer/kOS_scripts/blob/master/documentation/lib_launch_geo_readme.md\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/ElWanderer/kOS_scripts/blob/master/documentation/lib_launch_geo_readme.md\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hard part was finding out where the orbit plane would be, as opposed to the ground track of whatever\u0027s in the orbit plane. The latter seems a lot more common in the results of Google searches.

The approach I take is to make sure the orbits intersect then set-up a phasing orbit of the right period so that the two craft meet at the intersection some number of orbits later. The maths of that was a headache to figure out, particularly trying to account for all the combinations of being ahead of/behind the target and in a shorter/longer orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life, I\u0027m pretty sure they go through a series of phasing orbits that are entirely below the altitude of the station so that in the event of loss of control, there is no collision risk. Effectively, intersection occurs very late on in the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-28T13:27:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2017 01:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by ElWanderer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-28T15:11:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe this article will help you... \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.klabs.org/history/papers/lunney_gemini_rendezvous.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.klabs.org/history/papers/lunney_gemini_rendezvous.pdf\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
