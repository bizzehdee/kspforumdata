It seems counter-productive to make a commitment to inform people about the development of your game, yet not to talk about the most interesting part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that\u0027s been brought up by the community is the frequency of said devnotes: many people think that a week is not a long time for a game that has and is being developed over years. I, among others, believe that a less frequent but more in-depth program would be more productive and informative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples: \u0022Eh. I agree with regex, \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe devnotes seem to have lost their touch\u003C/strong\u003E\u0022 this post was the first reply on this week\u0027s devnotes. The post belonging to \u0022regex\u0022 was removed, I don\u0027t know why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why keep it secret? isn\u0027t the intention of the dev notes to talk about what you\u0027re developing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you guys should make one of these for ksp: **link to another game\u0027s roadmap of development**\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah, I feel that they need to show some pictures and some real content. What\u0027s the point in keeping the Administrative Building a secret?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022AKA: We developed stuff and it\u0027s pretty cool but if you talk about it, you\u0027ll be fed to a T-Rex. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Its a fairly common view that theres been little meat on the bones of recent devnotes, even before .24\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So basically SQUAD is afraid of the community that they think is so great\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It is a fact Squad act different that most gaming companies. And that isn\u0027t always a good thing.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Nah, its i think we want to hear more about your workflow, like \u0022we did X, encountered problem Y, and we solved it so\u0022.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I do definitely feel like there is less info in recent dev notes\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022See, basically NOTHING about the content itself spoiled in such a sentence, but it shows how the workflow is. I\u0027m ALL FOR devnotes, but to read every week \u0022i worked this week...it will be great\u0022 is not any information besides \u0022i\u0027m still here\u0022.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDevnotes seem to just be a register of who is still working for the company as opposed to any form of notes about development.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlex (aLeXmOrA): Still working\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMike (Mu): I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been continuing to work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDaniel (danRosas): I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m working\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJim (Romfarer): Last week i spent a lot of time working but unfortunately i can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t say anything about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMiguel (Maxmaps): Organizing and running through our plan for 0.25.

They could stick to a strict PR campaign. Only release information through press releases and trailers.\u0022\u003C/strong\u003E VERY valid point: I think Squad are trying to act like indie devs and inform their fanbase about their games, while hiding information and trying to act like a huge publisher and teasing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EI think Kerbal has merely grown to a size where suddenly Squad is considering PR. How to release information. This contradicts the idea of weekly dev notes.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Honestly I\u0027d have to agree the devnotes have gotten worse.

People are going to complain no matter what happens. Look at the Suggestions forum and gaze upon the endless threads of \u0022the science system is bad, here\u0027s how to make it better\u0022. If SQUAD is just going to develop their game their way, damn the torpedoes, what\u0027s the harm in keeping the community informed?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bad news is still valid news. If players are to have respect for developers, they have to be shown respect. That goes both ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck out this dev blog from Introversion Software. It details the development of a game that failed to reach a releasable state due to the core concept being un-fun. Through all the details given, it\u0027s easy for players to rationalise their decision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reiterate, unhappiness in the forums is the result of insufficient communication\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s worth noting that in all the examples given, detailed technical discussions are at best a monthly occurrence\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Why are so many posts in this thread being censored?!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I\u0027m gathering I\u0027m not allowed to be critical of the dev notes?\u0022 (another issue, more about censorship)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah...
