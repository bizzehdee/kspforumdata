It is as if the physics engine continually overcompensates. Sometimes I don\u0027t use it at all because the system is more stable without it. But as soon as I turn it on, any control surfaces I have are wobbling back and forth, RCS is shooting out everywhere ... even on a stable ship. It also seems to introduce a rotational element more often than not, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat causes this?

SAS in general works on the basis of a concept called PID-Controller. This controller can be configured with three parameters, generally called Ki, Kp and Kd. The game does not allow it, but you could actually change these parameters to suit any spacecraft and even large space stations. For myself I have made a plugin that adds a configurable ASAS and with it, I can easily trim the ASAS to perfectly control any craft. I think it is time to upload it to the Space Port...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mellojoe","CreatedById":69154,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T20:41:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoing some searches shows that I\u0027m not the only one with trouble with ASAS, so MajorNr01 it might be a VERY good idea if you have a fix.
