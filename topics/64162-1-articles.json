This\u0027d be great. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOften I find the 4 kerbal module is a bit overkill, and makes my landers too tall. Aside from a hitchhiker module, there really isn\u0027t a decent looking and compact way of expanding the carrying capacity of a 2.5m craft short of getting into clipping shenanigans. I\u0027d suggest this in the KSPX thread if that mod was still being developed, but as the developer is now on the Squad payroll...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"briansun1","CreatedById":67451,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T14:14:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethey already have one (MK2-lander can)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ravener","CreatedById":44766,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T14:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022briansun1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022briansun1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethey already have one (MK2-lander can)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe lander can looks ugly in the middle of a ship, i get the people that want a shorter hitchhiker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bomoo","CreatedById":78616,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-24T16:48:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ravener\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ravener\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe lander can looks ugly in the middle of a ship, i get the people that want a shorter hitchhiker.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight, exactly.
