But I\\\u0027m not so sure about the Avatar planet. Even if they did put it in, KSP\\\u0027s a physics-based game right? That would make for some weird gravitational pull. The only way I can see that planet being physically possible is tens of thousands of tiny floating mounds of land all orbiting around a huge central mass. That would be rather hard to script, and would push the game to its limits of CPU usage, considering all of the orbiting it needs to account for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Markus Reese","CreatedById":28539,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-13T06:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bluejayek\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Bluejayek\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is special about that planet?

Better to keep the game simple to help re-enforce the core focus of it. If interstellar travel does enter the game formula, I would be for a terrestrial moon. But it can be just a twin of Kerbin as far as environment and geography goes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
