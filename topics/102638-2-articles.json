It\u0027s annoying but without clean up and now the reduction in scene changes - what does that do to overall memory use and release? Has any efficiency been sought to improve the release of memory? People seem to not want GC, but it\u0027s actually important to long term stability and the game\u0027s memory footprint.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
