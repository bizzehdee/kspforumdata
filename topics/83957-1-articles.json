However, while I\u0027ve been able to export .png textures, I haven\u0027t been able to export/convert .blend files into .FBX files. Every time I do, It says that blender has crashed, and that I need a version after 2.48, while I do have the latest version 2.70. I also have the latest version of unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be a Unity/Blender problem?, or am I running out of memory?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe console states:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlender could not convert the .blend file to FBX file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to use Blender 2.45-2.49 or 2.58 and later versions for direct Blender import to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnityEditorInternal.InternalEditorUtility:_ProjectWindowDrag(HierarchyProperty, Boolean)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnityEditor.DockArea:OnGUI()\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emodding is so confusing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, do you people know of existing non-dated tutorials on how to use the part tools?
