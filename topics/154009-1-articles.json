Your actual rep goes from -1000 to \u002B1000, and the meter shows your rep / 10. You can see your exact rep on the contract completion window (3rd tab) after you complete any mission -- or your approximate rep when loading any savegame.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-25T21:30:24Z\u0022 title=\u002212/25/2016 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
