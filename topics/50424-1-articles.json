I looked on the forums and learned about the Max Physics Delta Time. Some of the descriptions of it were confusing, in game and on the forums and since then I have come up with my own understanding of it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. This setting controls the maximum physics time step that the game is allowed to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The minimum physics time step is probably 0.01 seconds, so it effectively tries to do 100 physics steps per in game second. I came up with this number because it is the lowest setting possible in the .cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The game dynamically increased the physics time step from 0.01 to your maximum physics delta time setting in order to maintain realtime gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. The game will not use time steps above your setting so it will instead slow down game time to allow the cpu to catch up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy observations of the effects of this setting:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Higher settings result in inaccurate physics and make the game unplayable due to absurd physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The physics calculations seem to be more complicated the higher the time step is, in other words, it takes longer to calculate a time step of 0.03 than a time step of 0.01. If the calculations took exactly the same amount of time, then at maximum time step, the game should run 3 times slower at 0.01 than at 0.03, but I found that this is not the case. In my experience, I have seen that time slow down only 1. times more. Why or how this is happening is unknown to me and I need to run more tests.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. The game drops frames. Why and when it decides to do this is also unknown to me. I have found that under a high part count ship (660 parts), my frame rate is only 24 per in game second for 0.03, and 50 for 0.01 (8 FPS and 12 FPS respectively).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The max physics delta time slider should be adjusted to bet between 0.1 and 0.01. This because the physics are far too inaccurate above 0.1 and I doubt anyone on here uses a setting above 0.1. How low you will go depends on how much in game time dilation you are willing to accept for higher frame rates and better physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Physics time warp probably functions by increasing the time step to a set amount. Perhaps this should be set so that it increases the time step to no more than 4 times of what your max physics delta time is. Currently, this setting upsets the physics too much so that larger ships tear themselves apart way to easily, and even small ships act oddly. If it can increase the time step from my 0.01 setting to 0.04 or even to 0.1, then the physics should still be okay as long as the forces applied are not too extreme.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still need to do more testing, and all this is based on conjecture so please take it with a grain of salt. I will appreciate any comments and I am sorry for rambling so much without presenting any graphs!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
