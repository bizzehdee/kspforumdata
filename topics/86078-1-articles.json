So you\u0027ll want to reduce things where you can for kerbalizing it! I\u0027m planning to import Clueless\u0027s model as a reference object and then model on top of it as a shortcut so I don\u0027t have to do all of the faithful measuring and research he\u0027s done already! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when I opened the blender file every shape was still separate? If you wanted advice on workflow (again, I\u0027m talking because I don\u0027t know your experience level, feel free to ignore me!) I\u0027d use this opportunity to unwrap everything to separate UV space, then join all of the pieces that will come into unity as single parts... so you could get it down to CCB, Centaur, Payload Fairing pieces... you could separate the engines or build them into the bodies of the stages... which is what I plan to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027m trying to decide what to join in Blender and what to join in Unity... it usually comes down to \u0027is there anything that I need to animate?\u0027 and \u0027is there anything that will be easier to do with the way Unity handles parenting than the way Blender does?\u0022 I don\u0027t know that either of those questions is relevant here, so you can really do it either way - I just find it easier to deal with big object lists in Blender than I do in Unity, so I join before the export when I can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to collaborate on the Atlas launcher, let me know. I\u0027ll be happy, at least, to post what I build of it back here. I\u0027m building it as a launch vehicle for a specific payload... so I won\u0027t be spending time on generic fairings and such but will happily share the parts I do build of the stages, engines, and maybe boosters!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArt\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T18:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI went ahead and built my own Atlas V launcher, as it was easier than sorting through someone else\u0027s file... and I needed the twin engine Centaur variant, anyway.
