I\u0027m not sure if steam counts that as .90 as the stable release or if it counts the micropatches and will just roll you back to 1.0.1. Still this is the only legit option to try and get 90 back if you didnt save a copy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"komodoone","CreatedById":142734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:19:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a copy of 0.90, but I\u0027m not sure if it would be legal to send you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is not. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
