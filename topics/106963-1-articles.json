Personally I want to download a copy of 0.90 (I prefer the soup-o-sphere, honestly) and would be curious to know where I could get it from."},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T21:29:33Z","Content":"in your game library right click on KSP and select properties. select the betas tab and opt in to the \u0022Beta\u0022 for the previous stable release. I\u0027m not sure if steam counts that as .90 as the stable release or if it counts the micropatches and will just roll you back to 1.0.1. Still this is the only legit option to try and get 90 back if you didnt save a copy."},{"CreatedByName":"komodoone","CreatedById":142734,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:16:08Z","Content":"Thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"Commissioner Tadpole","CreatedById":91993,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T22:19:15Z","Content":"I have a copy of 0.90, but I\u0027m not sure if it would be legal to send you."},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T02:42:26Z","Content":"It is not. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
