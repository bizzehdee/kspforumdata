Plan. No but seriously, right now the plan is to build a few gameplay/mechanic prototypes before consolidating them and crafting a roughly playable version of the full game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWill the early versions be free?\u003C/em\u003E - Unknown. It\u0027s certainly a possibility but I think it\u0027s far too early at this point to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHow much will the full game cost?\u003C/em\u003E - Unknown. Again, I\u0027d like to wait to see what the future holds then decide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWill there be awe inspiring music in the game?\u003C/em\u003E - Yes. I have a plan for how music will work in the game. Actually have already written a short blog about that, just waiting til I have a batch of stuff to post together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECould I have an estimate of when a playable demo will be released?\u003C/em\u003E - Eeeehhh... not really. Give it a couple months and I might be able to give you a vague estimate. Although that said, I might release the original unity prototype as a teaser of sorts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emiracmert:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAre you using Unity or another engine? Or are you coding another engine?\u003C/em\u003E - The first prototypes both used Unity but now it\u0027s being rebuilt with Panda3D. The nice thing about this is P3D comes with audio and physics libraries among others, and is totally free and open source. So, that means any problem with the engine can be smashed, and any amount of new stuff can be added in without having to have it tacked on top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhen did you start working on the game? Or are you just at planning stage now?\u003C/em\u003E - The first ideas and prototypes came up around... august, I think. From there it was pretty on and off until the New Initiative\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 started later last year, and has continued somewhat steady ever since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you started working on the game, then what stage are you at?\u003C/em\u003E - Presently it\u0027s in the planning, concept, and engine work stage, with a couple early assets made. The big thing right now is to get the terrain prototype working... that might be released as a free download for people to play with, because I have to say when it\u0027s done it is gonna be cool. That\u0027s being done by one of the other guys though, he\u0027s going to make a big blog post about it when it\u0027s farther along, so keep an eye out for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKrevsin:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWill this feature orbital mechanics for ship movement like KSP, or will we be able to simply move ships around in a 3D enviroment?\u003C/em\u003E - Yes, though it won\u0027t function too much like KSP in practice. All planets will exert gravitational force on you, which makes orbiting a bit... weird. It\u0027s best not to trust something floating in space to remain in a good spot for very long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWill the game feature a storyline, or will it be a pure exploration sandbox?\u003C/em\u003E - Exploration sandbox, but with various goals that can be provided to the player, by the government, corporations, or various universities, etc. The existence of the MEA, while officially denied, is somewhat of an open secret.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eastropap1i: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWill we be able to build our own spacecraft KSP-style, or will we have to use prebuilt ones?\u003C/em\u003E - Yes, ships are built from scratch. Start with an empty frame, fit it with various things like computers, fuel tanks, engines, sensors, etc. I\u0027ve been drafting up concepts for how construction will work and think I\u0027ve got it pretty solid now, so hopefully yet another post will cover that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat kind of control mechanics could we expect?\u003C/em\u003E - Very similar to KSP (WSADQE for 6DOF rotation, tenatively the numpad for translation in the case of vehicles that actually have that capability), with pulsed engine thrust usually. As in, holding down shift turns your engine on, releasing shift turns it off. Later, fancier engines can be throttled via other hotkeys, or a slider on the UI, and then pulsed at that new throttle value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat might be some cultural aspects of the society that is launching those ships?\u003C/em\u003E - The ships are launched from Earth and shoved into a space hole into this other, tiny universe. This space hole is located just outside St. Louis, so I guess you could say that\u0027s the culture in question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat would be the game\u0027s currencies (like KSP\u0027s money, science, and reputation)?\u003C/em\u003E - $dolla bills ya\u0027ll$. Like NASA, pretty much everything ends up costing money, be it parts, research (the inner workings of research are still TBD however so that may change!), or whatever. Not sure if you can consider this a \u0022currency\u0022 but you have resources such as, say, gold, which can be sold and transformed into the aformentioned $dolla bills ya\u0027ll$.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWhat\u0027s your favorite pie flavor?\u003C/em\u003E - .. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve ever eaten pie. You\u0027ve just made me realize this, and now I\u0027m having a crisis. -edit: actually I believe I may have had a bit of some form of apple pie a family event but it was awful and was not a good impression of what pie can be. I also recall crafting a delicious ice cream \u0022pie\u0022 of graham cracker crumb crust, filled with vanilla ice cream and covered with chocolate sauce and I\u0027m hungry now.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-09T21:28:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/09/2014 09:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hotmailcompany52","CreatedById":21696,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-09T22:51:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI forgot one question.
