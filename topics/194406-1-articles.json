It struck them as bizarre for two reasons. One, it came from an executive producer at the publishing company funding their next video game. Two, it said the game\u2014in the works for the previous two years\u2014was being pulled from their studio.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThis was an incredibly difficult decision for us to make, but it became necessary when we felt business circumstances might compromise the development, execution and integrity of the game,\u201D Michael Cook, the executive at Take-Two Interactive Software Inc., wrote in the message, which was reviewed by Bloomberg. \u201CTo that end, we encourage you to apply for a position with us.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was strange and disconcerting news to Star Theory\u2019s employees. Normally, an announcement like this would be delivered in a companywide meeting or an email from Star Theory\u2019s leadership team. The contract with Take-Two was the studio\u2019s only source of revenue at the time. Without it, the independent studio was in serious trouble.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe LinkedIn message went on to say Take-Two was setting up a new studio to keep working on the same game Star Theory had been developing, a sequel to the cult classic Kerbal Space Program. Take-Two was looking to hire all of Star Theory\u2019s development staff to make that happen. \u201CWe are offering a compensation package that includes a cash sign-on bonus, an excellent salary, bonus eligibility and other benefits,\u201D Cook wrote.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen employees returned to the office on Monday, Star Theory founders Bob Berry and Jonathan Mavor convened an all-hands meeting. The two men had been in discussions about selling their company to Take-Two but were dissatisfied with the terms, they explained. The game\u2019s cancellation was a shock, but the founders assured staff that Star Theory still had money in the bank and could try to sign other deals, according to five people who attended the meeting and asked not to be identified, citing the risk of litigation. Berry and Mavor encouraged employees to stick together and stay at the company.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next few weeks were chaos, employees said. Take-Two hired more than a third of Star Theory\u2019s staff, including the studio head and creative director. By March, as the coronavirus pandemic choked the global economy, any hope of saving the business appeared to be lost, and Star Theory closed its doors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven by the cutthroat standards of the video game business, Take-Two\u2019s tactics were extreme. The company behind the Grand Theft Auto franchise is one of America\u2019s largest publishers, with a market value of $15 billion. The stock is up 10% this year and trading near an all-time high, thanks to increased demand from people stuck at home. Take-Two cultivated a leading position in publishing through a mix of big-budget games developed in-house and by a tightknit group of studio partners. Publishers like Take-Two control a project\u2019s financing, marketing and distribution, giving them a great deal of leverage over most developers they sign.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe swift demise of Star Theory and the events of its three final months, which have not been previously reported, highlight the frailty of those business relationships and the power dynamics within the industry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBrian Roundy, a spokesman for Take-Two\u2019s Private Division publishing label, said the company contacted \u201Cevery member of the development team\u201D at Star Theory with an invitation to join the new studio, called Intercept Games. \u201CMore than half of the team is now at Intercept Games,\u201D Roundy wrote. \u201CIn doing so, we are empowering our deeply passionate and talented team to focus on quality, and we are thrilled with the progress that they are making on the game.\u201D Star Theory\u2019s Berry and Mavor didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPatrick Meade, a senior engineer at Star Theory, said he turned down the job offer from Take-Two. He declined to discuss the events in detail but said he didn\u2019t want to work for a big company where he wouldn\u2019t have the same degree of influence or financial benefits if the game were a hit. \u201CI was at a small studio, where the work I did had a massive impact on our success,\u201D Meade said. \u201CWhen I see myself at any large corporation, that is fundamentally not true.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBerry and Mavor started their game studio in 2008 in Bellevue, Washington. They called it Uber Entertainment, later changing the name to Star Theory following the rise of a certain ride-hailing company. Early hits included Monday Night Combat, a cartoonish shooter that sold more than 300,000 copies, and Planetary Annihilation, a strategy game that raised more than $2 million on Kickstarter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn 2017, Star Theory began working with Take-Two on its most high-profile project. Take-Two had\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ir.take2games.com/news-releases/news-release-details/take-two-interactive-software-inc-acquires-kerbal-space-program?ID=2277633\u0026amp;c=86428\u0026amp;p=irol-newsArticle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epurchased the rights\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0to a popular flight simulation game developed by another independent studio and contracted Star Theory to make a sequel. The original game, Kerbal Space Program, allowed players to construct and launch rockets using realistic physics. It sold more than 2 million copies, was critically acclaimed and even led to partnerships with NASA and the European Space Agency. Gamers, like moviegoers, tend to flock to brands they know, so working on a well-liked franchise is a chance for a studio to increase sales and gain exposure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe view inside Star Theory was that development on Kerbal Space Program 2 was proceeding smoothly, according to the people who worked on the project. A preview of the game on display at the Penny Arcade Expo in September left fans impressed, and Take-Two\u2019s public enthusiasm for the title was rising, said Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen \u0026amp; Co.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLate last year, Take-Two agreed to extend Star Theory\u2019s development deadline by six months to add new content to the game. That kicked off a new round of contract negotiations. All seemed well, said the people who worked on the game, until Dec. 6, when the project was pulled and the LinkedIn messages went out. At the hastily called staff meeting a few days later, the founders said in addition to sale talks, they had been trying to clarify royalty terms, which were unclear in their contract, they told employees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree of Star Theory\u2019s leaders\u2014Jeremy Ables, the studio chief; Nate Simpson, the creative director; and Nate Robinson, the lead producer\u2014departed for Take-Two\u2019s new studio immediately. Other staff mulled whether to go, torn between leaving and abandoning their colleagues or staying and risking their livelihoods, they said. One employee, who asked not to be identified, said they felt a mix of confusion and fury, adding that they\u2019d never been put in this type of position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe attempt at hiring away the development team came with business risks, both for the project and for Take-Two if word got out, said Creutz. \u201CThey\u0027ve got a game they\u0027ve got high hopes for, and they have now potentially injected an enormous amount of disruption into the development process,\u201D he said. \u201CYou could be taking a reputational risk as well, if you want other studios to work with you and it appears that you play this kind of move when things don\u0027t go the way you want.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout a dozen of Star Theory\u2019s 30 employees wound up leaving for Take-Two\u2019s new studio, while the rest stuck around in an attempt to save the business, they said. By January, the remaining team had a plan in place: Each employee would spend the next two months brainstorming new ideas and building prototypes. Then they would pitch the best ones to publishers at the Game Developers Conference in mid-March in the hope of securing a new deal, the five workers said. The annual conference is always full of publishers looking to make investments in indie studios with proven track records.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen came the pandemic. The conference was canceled, leaving Star Theory with nowhere to take its pitches. Publishers, sensing an economic downturn, tightened their spending. On March 4, Star Theory shut down. Each worker received a month\u2019s pay and two months of health insurance, said three former employees. A few joined their former colleagues at Take-Two\u2019s Intercept Games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbal Space Program 2 remains in development at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/dev-diaries/introducing-intercept-games/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EIntercept\u003C/a\u003E.

Were Star Theory\u0027s founders\u0027 terms so outlandish that negotiations simply broke down?

If things were going just fine nothing would have changed. Remember; T2 invested a ton of money in KSP and has no reason to jeopardize that investment by a major disruption and that\u0027s just what happened. What we don\u0027t know is the reason. Timelines? Artistic vision (unlikely given they hired Nate Simpson)? Micropayments? Even if things truly went south and in reality T2 bailed out KSP by doing this, hanging out the dirty laundry would reflect bad on them so they won\u0027t do that. Truth is, we don\u0027t really know what happened.

They were witnessing their passion project slipping away. And bills still need to be paid. Cozy up to the monster, get paid and get out. Mark my words that is what\u0027s going to happen. They already killed Linux support, next it will be epic exclusive, and micro-transactions and everything Nate promised it wouldn\u0027t be. I paid squad 4x full price for ksp 1 so I could give to friends and family. Private Division (T2) will be lucky if I pick it up in a humble bundle, assuming they don\u0027t ruin it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VITAS","CreatedById":124625,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-03T16:51:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust because things are common isn\u0027t reason to ask the other side to explain their view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112420-shadowzone/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112420\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112420-shadowzone/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ShadowZone\u003C/a\u003E KSP2 meeting our all expectations (especialy after sort of being under new management) worries me too but i think its about something different here: Trust and ethics.It\u0027s not the first time people are stunned by surprising messages.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI just wait and hope they do something to win some of that back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-06-03T16:51:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2020 04:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by VITAS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
