I cant actually remember what I had just done, it wasnt a dock, I think i switched to a flight in progress, a tractor towing a surface base to Duna. Screen wouldnt load (only some UI elements), speed was NaN, map was black, clicking space centre did nothing.\n\nHad to force quit (sever the thread in control panel). Save file was actually corrupted and had to scrap the game.

From personal experience the game becomes generally less stable with lots of complex flights in progress. More so if those flights involve docking connections.\n\nThe most recent time I saw this however was vanilla(ish). I had KAC/KER/PNode only. The tractor/surface base that bugged out was aimed at a high-end contract on Duna surface and was the only craft outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI...but kerbin space was full with 30-odd surface/orbital stations and other misc craft.\n\n@eddiew: Good plan, think i\u0027ll have to start a similar routinue."},{"CreatedByName":"ColourOfFire","CreatedById":135926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T10:40:47Z","Content":"I only had this in one save/install with a ton of mods in 0.25.
