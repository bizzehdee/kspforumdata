I hear you! It\u0027s been requested ad-naseum, and it can\u0027t be done it\u0027s been said. But I have an idea.... bear with me. If this type of idea has been proposed and shot down, well, forgive me. But read on, I think it may work and would be a huge bonus to the game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe know there\u0027s a physics limit, so a true elevator can\u0027t be done. But what about simulating one?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGround base: Add into the tech tree, a unit, or unit\u0027s of varying strength, that would represent the ground base/anchor for the elevator. These units would be very, very heavy, but would be launchable by a heavy booster so it might be landed on other bodies. The heaviest unit would be able to support lifting the lighter ones into orbit on the elevator. Each size unit would have a max lifting capacity, and would require the matching sized orbiting station and filament to operate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Station: This would be made up of a variety of parts. First off would be the core, manned, so the kerbals could monitor and control traffic up to, down from, in, and out of the station. Then the orbital anchor unit, this would be the main mass of the station and where the elevator would be attached to. These would need RCS and probably some decent engines to make some adjustments to remain in geosynchronous orbit over the base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe elevator itself would be made of Karbon nano tubes (Sorry! Couldn\u0027t help myself!). These would be lofted into orbit in containers similar to fuel tanks. The light weight elevator would use the full size 1.25m tanks, while the medium 2.5m, and heavy 3.75m. It should require at least 6-8 tanks worth of filament up there to dangle it back to the surface, and there would need to be a spare on the station for tension adjustments (Not actually simmed, just having a tank with \u0026gt;25% capacity would suffice). So it would require many launches to build the elevator. The orbital station/anchor would have a resource (filament?) that would have to be transferred from the filament tanks, and once it\u0027s full (6-8 tanks worth) and the spare is present, the elevator would be operable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how\u0027s it work? Take the magic of Hyper-edit and mix in some Construction Time, and it might work. When you build an object/payload to be lifted, it would spawn on the base object (obviously only KSC bases would spawn items, others on other bodies could attach to it through a docking port or such). It then starts to lift, and is despawned. After a certain amount of time based upon the size of your elevator, speed of the car, and mass of the payload, the payload would respawn on the orbital station. There it could be detached and docked to a conventional craft, and a something else could head down, or another payload heads up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there actually isn\u0027t a physical object spanning the space in between the ground and orbital units, we just get the functionality of one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Each filament can only support it\u0027s max weight, and only in one direction at a time, but you can have multiple cars (another item that needs to be included, and matched for the appropriate size filament) on one filament as long as it doesn\u0027t exceed the max weight. If you have a station with two filaments on it, you can have an up filament and a down filament. Filament can only be produced in bulk on Kerbin, maybe tiny amounts could be produced from an insane amount of ore in orbit. This would allow a small elevator orbiting another body to eventually create enough filament to upgrade to a bigger elevator, but the anchors (ground and orbital) and station would have to be imported. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, I think it\u0027s plausible as I\u0027ve seen all the elements of this idea function in other mods. The time delay might get tricky, but the rest should be doable for a skilled modder. The orbital construction aspect makes it good for gameplay, and the different levels of the pieces make it \u0027realistic\u0027 as you\u0027ll have to traditionally launch heavy payloads repeatedly to build one. Or one could whackjob a single launch. Switch out mass and weight where appropriate, I used them interchangeably here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to tackle this myself, but I have neither the skill, nor the time to do it or learn to do it. But maybe I\u0027ve planted a bug in a modder somewhere who might take this on....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T14:36:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by gargamel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kagame","CreatedById":141304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:36:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI support this thread.

Just a matter of timing and planning. One \u0022cheat\u0022 that immediately comes to mind would be to hyperedit a tiny placeholder craft into the correct position until you can rendezvous your first station piece to that location.

If you ram the station, then you knock it out of it\u0027s orbit, just like you would any other station. Given the onrails nature of the engine sometimes alters the position of objects, there should be a small window that the station could occupy, and if there is enough RCS remaining on the station (some arbitrary amount), then the station would be automatically adjusted back to it\u0027s proper position upon spawning. \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ESome celestials have a SOI which doesn\u0027t reach to geostationary orbit heights.
