In fact, I haven\u0027t been this into a game in years and I\u0027m still discovering new things each time I start it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027ve got a career going (my second career, but first with contracts) and I\u0027ve been doing okay, despite the fact that it\u0027s basically been a comedy of errors throughout. Most of my mistakes tend to stem from lack of planning and attention to detail, which brings me to my current dilemma. Here\u0027s the situation...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sent a science lander to the Mun, everything went fine and then I tried to head home. Lo-and-behold, I guess I used a bit more fuel than I should have during decent and landing, cause it turned out I only had enough to get into low munar orbit, but not escape velocity!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve got plenty of cash and science, so I unlock the AGU and some other stuff to allow me to launch a rescue/refueling mission. All goes well, and I make a very nice rendezvous in munar orbit and split the remaining fuel between the two craft, which is more than enough to bring both back (and decelerate them, since I\u0027m using FAR and deadly reentry). So I disengage the AGU and set up return burns for each ship individually. This means that, while they\u0027ll be on relatively similar transfer orbits, they\u0027ll be seperated by quite a distance for much of the trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all looks fine, except for the fact that I forgot I was using TAC life support and never transfered life support resources when I did the fuel, and one of my guys only has about 3/4 enough to get back home! And my last save was after leaving the mun\u0027s SOI, and the ships were already quite far from each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong story (really long, sorry about that) short, I need to re-rendezvous my ships, but they\u0027re now on long, Kerbicentric transfer orbits. I have absolutely no idea how to do a rendezvous when essentially not in orbit. I guess what I need to know is how to rendezvous within less than half an orbit, where both orbits are extremely eccentric. Is this even possible? Am I better off launching a new resupply ship and attempting a rendezvous like that? Is my Kerbal just doomed to die within shouting distance of home and safety?

I\u0027ve done an aero capture on Laythe when I launched my rover and forgot to attach a landing rocket (so sent another probe on an intercept course about 2 mins after the first).

Orbital mechanics starts to screw \u0022burn straight for it\u0022 maneuvers proportional to the fraction of an orbit completed, and you probably have at best 1/4 of an orbit to catch up. The more delta-V you have left, the better: you can make more aggressive, more direct maneuvers, and you don\u0027t have the time for efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you use the trailing vehicle, I imagine your maneuver would be mostly prograde with a bit of radial-in; tweak it to get a good intercept, and don\u0027t be afraid of correction burns. Do, of course, ensure you have enough delta-V to cancel relative velocities at the rendezvous: this will have the advantage of putting the rendezvousing craft back on a Kerbin reentry orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you just do not have the delta-V on your two vehicles to manage that, you\u0027re going to need to build a delta-V monster capable of meeting the troubled vehicle halfway, and then completely reversing trajectory.
