Nothing else to do, it\u0027s over in 3 minutes, 5 at the most.\n\nSo considering I\u0027ve been to almost every body in ksp, played career mode and caught some asteroids i feel like it\u0027s not gonna be fun anymore.\n\nDo you guys have any advices on what else can i do?\n\nAnd is there any mod that\u0027s gonna make it more fun like some new activities on planets or space, alien civilizations, etc..\n\nI like real solar system and life support mods.\n\nAny suggestions? \n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T22:14:01Z","Content":"You could try extraplanetary launchpads and build a base on another planet/moon.
