If you\u0027re hitting max TWR with a turbo at around 13km, and max TWR with a Rapier at around 16-17km, surely the fact that you\u0027ve got more power, at a higher altitude will always be more favourable than petering out much sooner?

That said, unles you absolutely need them, its extra mass and parts that are useless in space. A rapier (even if you use nukes and dont carry oxy) makes more sense, less part count, and at least in my opinion is very very similar in what its capable of.\n\nAs for the preecoolers, they have LESS drag then a nose mounted intake, and provide 40 extra LF to power your engines, but suffers from somewhat high mass for what it does (unless you want a structural element that is). it also pulls heat away from stuff very well and radiates it better then most other parts, but it is still not worth it unless you need more intake area, or want to use it as a structural element for appearance or whatever. i use it myself some for nuke mounts though, as it looks really cool when the nuke is clipped all the way inside and all you see is that much cooler jet engine look with blue flames coming out of it.

The pictures are of my new Terra Block 1 craft, which I\u0027ve set up as a crew transporter seeing as I\u0027ve been running alot of LKO tourist runs lately. I\u0027ve not equipped it to carry any cargo, just a small service bay to hide solar panels and batteries in which helps cut down on a bit of supersonic drag forces. \n\nI chose the LV-T45 as an experiment to see if it could augment the turbojets as they trail off around 17km. Even with the large tails (I like having the option of pulling silly high G turns in the upper atmo and not flat spinning, sue me) it\u0027s reliably getting to a 200km orbit with about 430 m/s in the tank, with a simple point at 10 degrees pitch and hold it there ascent. \n\nNot the world\u0027s best performance judging by what I\u0027ve seen so far in this thread, but for a mid career craft, it\u0027s been very reliable.\n\n\u003E ![2226079248CC13248CE50668EE45C2E2B4D8AE29](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45378230775993264/2226079248CC13248CE50668EE45C2E2B4D8AE29/)\n\u003E ![48453594C6FA0CE753C7520E0CFD4FD11B82D87F](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/45378230775990717/48453594C6FA0CE753C7520E0CFD4FD11B82D87F/)\n\u003E \n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T05:21:27Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Gilly is so tiny, you can basically ignore its gravity, and just assume one is in orbit of Eve itself (oberth from Gilly is a pitance, gravity drag from gilly is irrelevant)\n\u003E Its semi-major axis is 31,500 km (ie, thats the average height from Eve).\n\u003E \n\u003E So... going here: [http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/)\n\u003E \n\u003E Selecting Eve orbit, 31,500 km as the start, and Moho as the destination:\n\u003E \n\u003E Ejection \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv: 2,355 m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E Insertion \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv: 1,531 m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E Total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv: 3,886 m/s\n\u003E \n\u003E 3886 is much better than going to Moho from LKO (5031)\n\u003E \n\u003E However, if one were to fill up at minmus, drop PE down just above kerbin, and then do the burn, the difference would be much less than the 1,145 calculated here.\n\u003E \n\u003E It also depends somewhat on where gilly is in its orbit as you depart - ideally you\u0027d want to leave gilly at apoapsis, so you can cheaply bring you PE down right above EVe\u0027s atmosphere and have a higher speed when you do the burn... but then the launch window is more complicated.\n\u003E \n\u003E If you have ISRU at gilly and moho, you can go to moho and back with a craft that only hasa dV capability of 4km/s\n\nThanks! That\u0027s still quite a lot though... And for \u0022safety\u0022 reasons it would be better to have about 4,500 dV... Yeah, Moho seems to be difficult ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
