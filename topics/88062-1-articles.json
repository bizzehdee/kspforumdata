The -.5 is simply for the sheer amount of bullsh*t science included. There wasn\u0027t even any pseudoscience to back it up! In my 10\u002B years of watch the show, anything that can be explained/done using the current science is explained/done using current science, and if it can\u0027t it\u0027s done with pseudoscience. I have never seen an episode break the laws of physics and biology except for very, VERY, essential plot points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Kill the Moon was an outstanding episode from perspective of plot.
