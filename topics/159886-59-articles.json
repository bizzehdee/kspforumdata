KSP players point of view or perhaps how Spacex would do a similar thing.\u00A0 In such normal worlds, you spend money and expect to get things done.\u00A0 You spend money to go into a huge money pit and you have problems.\u00A0 NASA is a governement agency and deals with the entirely different world of convincing Congress to maintain funding.\u00A0 In such a world, a huge money pit is ideal (provided said money spills into the right congressional districts) as it would maintain funding above all else and have whatever make-work projects are needed to keep it going.\u00A0 In such a system, NASA could then go onto the Moon or Mars simply to keep the DSG gravy train going to the right congressional districts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are many lessons from the Shuttle.\u00A0 From an engineering aspect, the shuttle did nearly everything wrong.\u00A0 Another lesson was that letting the various paymasters pile too many conflicting requirements clearly caused this disaster (I\u0027ve seen may shuttle design \u0027improvements\u0027.\u00A0 None of them would meet the requirements NASA received to build the shuttle).\u00A0 One *critical* lesson should be that Congress will react to the \u0022sunk cost fallacy\u0022 by letting you make 134 launches, compared to Apollos 27 (and most of them were unmanned tests of parts of Saturn).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNASA was created to respond to Sputnic in 1958 and altered in 1962 to put a man on the Moon.\u00A0 Since then it has been a jobs program with a public face of manned space and secondary turf of space science and aeronautics R\u0026amp;D (secondary missions tend to be underfunded but have less political meddling.\u00A0 This works well until you have a JWT-sized budget disaster).\u00A0 It also has the problem of a \u0022long term mission\u0022 changing with every new president, so any mission to Mars would likely need to be done by Spacex (or possibly Blue Origin if something happens to Musk/Spacex/BFR).\u00A0 Spacex is unlikely to have the money, so presumably it would come from Congress, with NASA getting a cut.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy overall point is that NASA may well see DSG as a \u0022white elephant in space\u0022 (like plenty of others concerned with space).\u00A0 But they know they will be the ones getting the budget to feed the elephant, and Congress will have trouble shutting that flow down.\u00A0 Such \u0022long term budget sources\u0022 are seen in a vastly different light inside NASA (especially the high level GS-types and similar contractors).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-31T17:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

Allow a 5\u002B m fairing and the 5m version (EUS) can fit. So a total mass under the fairing of either 27 tons (ICPS, with nothing else on it), to ~34 tons (EUS with no cargo). If you want to add cargo like habs, there is even less room. Pretty much all the mass to LEO is stage 2 propellant. Zubrin seems to think he has 60 tons of non-FH to work with. He doesn\u0027t.
