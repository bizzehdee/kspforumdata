The problem is part count; if the sum of your station\u0027s parts and those of whatever you\u0027re trying to dock with it is above a certain amount (depends on your computer), it\u0027ll slow everything down badly. More on that later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve planned a Kethane module for reuseable rockets (I just need to learn the converters and stuff)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Kethane module is only useful if you have a way of getting raw Kethane to the station. Generally, that\u0027s a bad idea, because converters turn ~5 units of Kethane into 1 unit of fuel. It\u0027s much more efficient to have the converter (which doesn\u0027t require much mass) on the vessel doing the drilling, to haul refined fuel up into orbit, instead of moving raw Kethane around. So if your station is just going to orbit around a body, there\u0027s no point in putting a converter on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, if you\u0027re going to do this, there\u0027s no point in having the space station in the first place, fuel-wise. Just put extra docking ports on the drilling/refining lander, and let passing ships dock with THAT instead. I\u0027ve got a 400-ton mobile refinery that does exactly this; it lands, drills, refines until its tanks are full, then returns to orbit to act as a fuel station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyone have any ideas?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Download \u0022big part\u0022 mods, like KW Rocketry, and use them where possible. Instead of three or four 3.75m tanks, you can use a single 5m tank to have the same capacity at a lower part count (and less chance of random physics issues causing your station to fall apart).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Even if you\u0027re planning the station to be manned most of the time (necessary if you put a science lab on it), put a probe core of some type on board to allow you to do things (turn on/off lights, keep SAS going) when no one is on board. This is true for all vessels, really. Also, put an RTG on board to ensure the probe core always has power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Put some high-efficiency engines (LV-Ns, in stock) on it. This\u0027ll let you change the station\u0027s orbit as necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; Lifeboats. Have some way for the crew to leave if necessary, without relying on a rendezvous with another vessel; if you\u0027re orbiting a body with atmosphere (Kerbin, Laythe, Eve, Duna) then all you need is something with a little RCS and a few parachutes, but for airless bodies you\u0027ll want something a bit more complex.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; There\u0027s a temptation to put a ton of solar panels on it, because real-life stations do that. But KSP doesn\u0027t have many things that require electricity, so there\u0027s really no point in going overboard on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeyond that, you can pretty much put whatever you want on it.
