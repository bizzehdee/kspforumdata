I guess just like it somewhat more transparent when viewed orthogonally, i.e. in the middle, while keeping the cool coloration effects on the edges and on the day/night line.. I think I got more or less what I wanted by reducing the values in the m\\_betaR vector and increasing HR a little while testing with your config tool, however it seems the additional parameters available in the actual atmo config change the result too much to apply the config from the Config tool 1:1.. Is there a way to change the atmo config ingame or is the only way to tweak it to do so in between game launches? Or is there maybe a cheatsheet i.e. as to what all the parameters do?\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for your help and thank you so much for making this amazing mod!\n\u003E \n\nYeah, I kinda felt it was more transparent before too, but apparently not.
