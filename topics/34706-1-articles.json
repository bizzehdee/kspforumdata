How many parts is the cube itself? How many parts is the cube \u002B launcher? What is the weight of the cube? I have not made a launcher that makes use of the rockomax multi-point connectors. They are kind of heavy though, and that could be limiting you. You are using an awful lot of boosters there, the cube must be heavy.
