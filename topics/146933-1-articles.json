I know, it\u0027s disgusting that I want to do this rather than send a Kerbal and pick up the samples in person but I plan on making the transmission penalty so high that the sample will have to be returned to Kerbin anyway in order to gain any useful science from them. The way I look at it it\u0027s just going to be using an unmanned probe rather than risking the life of a Kerbal to get the sample and you can already use probes to mine for ore which basically is a surface sample anyway so this seems like a logical progression of that mechanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that\u0027s enough of the starter now on to the main course...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can resize/re-texture the drill fine and can get it to display the \u0022Take Surface Sample\u0022 message and run the experiment OK but I can\u0027t figure out how the animation of the part works. Ideally I would like to use the stock animation to deploy, drill for the sample and then stow the drill again when the experiment is run but I don\u0027t know if this is possible? Could someone please point me in the right direction for a tutorial on how the animation commands of the config work? I can\u0027t find much information on the \u0022ModuleAnimationGroup\u0022 \u0022deployAnimationName\u0022 and \u0022activeAnimationName\u0022\u00A0commands which I am assuming are what I need to use?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should also point out that I intend to sue these parts purely in my own personal game and will not distribute other peoples code, I just want to learn and reverse engineering existing parts seems to be the logical starting point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you in advance for any help offered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T18:00:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi as i understand it (not being a great lover of animation group) the \u0022deployAnimationName\u0022 is just the same as in animation generic and is the name of the animation that was created in unity and in this case being a multi part\u00A0 animation it is the first animation played in the sequence, following that the \u0022activeAnimationName\u0022\u00A0 animation\u00A0 is played, with the drill that would be the rotary motion i presume, and on animation stop, it again plays the deploy animation but in reverse\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T18:06:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you @SpannerMonkey(smce) that seems to back up what little information I\u0027ve been able to find so far.
