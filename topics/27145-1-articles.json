To be sure of this, my own designs generally put the RCS tank and one set of jets ABOVE the final stack separator, so that they go with the capsule in case of emergency. That way, you have very little mass getting pushed by the RCS jets. But my older designs didn\u0027t do this, and it still worked fine.

The central module is one piece, and ran out of fuel right at around Minmus\u0027 orbit after circularizing around Kerbin. I made it the rest of the way home using only RCS, so I\u0027m sure you could have made it home from Minmus the same way if your tanks had run dry.
