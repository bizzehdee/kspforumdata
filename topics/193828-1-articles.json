to it now would be necro\u0027ing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiving credence to some of the interesting thoughts there (why I\u0027m linking it), I thought I\u0027d bring back up the subject of airships...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially now with SpaceX making the possibility of a Mars colony (and thus regular lifts to Mars) a real thing, developing more efficient ways to get to orbit than rockets is becoming ever more imperative...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly, orbital airships could work *even better* on Mars.\u00A0 That\u0027s because:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The atmosphere on Mars is mostly composed of CO2, in comparison to which even a breathable N2/O2 mix is a lifting gas (and other, lighter gasses even more effective)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The gravity on Mars is much lower than Earth\u0027s, reducing the weight an airship needs to fight against when lifting a payload.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The air on mars is extremely thin, even near the surface- so it packs very little force, even in 100 km/hour winds.\u00A0 This means that strong winds ripping apart an airship are less of a concern, and you don\u0027t need 2 separate \u0022stages\u0022 (a sturdy airship to take you to a \u0022Dark Sky\u0022 platform, where you transfer cargo/people to a lighter, larger airship designed for the calmer upper atmosphere of Earth...)\u00A0 A single very large/weak airship could take you from the surface all the way to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Orbital Velocity on Mars is less than Earth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Payloads returning from Mars to Earth are likely to have very high value for their weight, and be relatively small in total mass (mostly, people making a return trip).\u00A0 This is the optimal niche for orbital airships- which would be EXTREMELY safe (not explosive, very easy to bail out of if things go south) and even at very large sizes have extremely limited cargo capacity...\u00A0 An airship that takes you to orbit, where a specialized orbit-to-orbit only spacecraft takes you back to Earth, and a reusable reentry vehicle/pod takes you to the surface, would be ideal at high annual volumes of traffic I would think...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, this thread is for discussion of airships, orbital airships, and airships on Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne misconception I wanted to clear up, by the way: envelope mass of an airship does NOT scale linearly with volume, because it\u0027s not a pressure vessel.\u00A0 It operates at ambient (or close to ambient) pressure- indeed one of the design constraints of an orbital airship is that its volume needs to expand quite significantly on the way up, until the internal pressure is very low (and shrinks on the way back down).\u00A0 Therefore, it really DOES benefit from the Square-Cube Law for envelope mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore importantly, an orbital airship also benefits from the Square-Cube Law when it comes to Drag: an orbital airship with 2x the dimensions in every axis has 8x the volume, but only 4x the cross-sectional and total surface areas...\u00A0 So, 4x the Drag but 8x the volume to provide lifting capacity- adding up to MORE than 8x the payload capacity for 8x the size...\u00A0 At small sizes, aerodynamic Drag is the major obstacle to achieving orbit: so bigger is definitely better for an orbital airship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Piscator","CreatedById":107202,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-13T07:00:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

Normal air under the same conditions would have a density of 0.0099 kg/m^3. The difference is about 0.005 kg/m^3. So for every cubic meter of displacement you can lift 5 grams. You\u0027d need 200 m^3 to lift 1 kg. To lift 50 tonnes you\u0027d need 10 million m^3. Assuming a length to radius ratio of 20 you\u0027d need a cylinder 54 meters in radius and over one km long. And keep in mind that 50 tonnes has to include the structural mass for all that - something on the order of 406 thousand m^2. To make this fly at all you\u0027d need a structural area density of less than 0.123 kg per m^2. Probably doable. But if you want any performance margin you\u0027re going to want much less structural density. Or you have to build the vehicle much, much larger. And we haven\u0027t even considered the change in volume required as the vehicle gains altitude. But you also need a lot of ground infrastructure for such a beast.

Ascender and the Dark Sky Station have already been created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third stage of ATO is the\u00A0Orbital Ascender, a 6,000 foot (1.8 km) long air/spaceship designed to make the trip from the DSS to 93 miles (150 km), or low Earth orbit.\u00A0\u00A0Although helium is still lighter than air at 25 miles (40 km), this effect diminishes and eventually halts, making the craft heavier than its surroundings.\u00A0At 93 miles (150 km) the density of air is only three billionths of what it is at\u00A0sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJP Aerospace has proposed covering this massive Ascender in solar panels and using\u00A0ion\u00A0engines to accelerate the craft to approximately 5 miles per second (8,000 meters per second), the required speed for any object to reach orbit.\u00A0\u00A0It has been claimed that this process would take around five days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EUnfortunately, some simple calculations show that ion engines
