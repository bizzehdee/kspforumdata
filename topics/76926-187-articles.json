They are much better with only two craft, I\u0027ll post some tomorrow. And this is truly all I do in Kerbal anymore. It isn\u0027t just for these updates. I play this as a building sim way more than a flying/space sim. I tweak my craft, battle them, tweak, continue. I want to be a one stop shop when/if multiplayer becomes stock. A bunch of equally performing craft for people to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I love the 16, looks a little weird with those giant weapons on it. I wouldn\u0027t complain one bit if all the missiles were scaled just a tiny bit smaller...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I sent you the MRK II F-15 if you wanna test it.

For example, it wing leading edge happens to be exactly perpendicular to toy - it would be visible. Imagina airplane has mirror surfaces and is in completely dark void, and you have a flashlight. If the light reflects to you - you can see the airplane is there. If it reflects in other direction - you can\u0027t see it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"volcanicshrimp","CreatedById":139666,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T11:31:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022 data-cite=\u0022BahamutoD\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt the moment the radars only detect airborne vessels.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug, a feature, or what?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"will 146","CreatedById":110672,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T12:25:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know how to use JDAM\u0027s, i know there GPS guided but i don\u0027t know how to target them,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, slave turrets isn\u0027t working for me atm, thanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-14T12:28:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/14/2015 12:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by will 146\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scoundrel","CreatedById":15369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-14T13:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022will 146\u0022 data-cite=\u0022will 146\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyone know how to use JDAM\u0027s, i know there GPS guided but i don\u0027t know how to target them\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou point the laser on the spot you want to target, click target, then click the button that adds it to the GPS list.
