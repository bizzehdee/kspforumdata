I installed Mission Controller 2 among other mods. I\u0027m in a carreer mode. Here are 3 questions for you :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. At some point I was proposed a contract to build a space station around kerbin but decided to postpone it for after i went to Mun and Minmus. Unfortunately when i came back i was not proposed the contract anymore. instead I have contracts to build space station around Mun and Minmus which is far overkill for me now ... Can i debug the game or MC2 so i find the basic contract back and if yes how ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What is a good space station design ? What is needed exactly ? I watched several youtube videos on this topic but everyone seems to have different views ... so i\u0027m a bit lost. What would you recommend I start with ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I heard mining planets and moons is now in the stock game ? What is the required tech for this ? Will i be proposed contract for this or do i need a mod(s) ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Contracts have expire date (which is usually just a couple of days). If you don\u0027t accept by then, they\u0027ll just expire and new ones will spawn. Most contracts are randomly generated anyway, so just keep rejecting until you meet something that you want to do. That\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Which means easily extensible is the most important part. Just tons of docking ports, then you can add whatever you want at any time. For me, my station has TAC life support, StationScience, RemoteTech antennas, each being its own module docked to the main station core. Very flexible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Yes, and it\u0027s called Ore, using ISRU to convert to Mono/LF/LFO. There will be contracts asking you to extract x Ores (and optionally return to Kerbin) etc. It\u0027s kind of mid-career thing.

After my first trip to Mun, I built a space station there, set it into polar orbit and strip science from the Mun in one mission. I redid it on minmus, but on equatorial orbit. The station is sufficiently fuelled not to be refueled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELKO Refueling\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a small station, but I don\u0027t use it. I\u0027m managing to build a bigger one. But again, I opted for the SSTO rocket to drastically cut on launch costs. So I\u0027m not using the orbit empty interplanetary stage and refuel it on a station with minmus mining or asteroid. I find the round trip, to minmus quite tedious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven though, there are different ways to go. Again, think modular : you might want to add an ISRU (or maybe an additionnal one...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for station contract, I found them ridiculous. I was asked for a 6000 liquid fuel around minmus. The full exploration of minmus only requires 1000, depending on you lander. I usually edit SFS files to fix stupid contracts. The 6000 units of fuel is more than I brought with me to Jool when I explore all the moons twice (full strip of Pol, Bop and Vall \u002B half of Laythe and 2 landings on Tylo \u002B 5 fly-by) All with 15T SSTO Landers (thus not fuel efficient).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AzertyBot","CreatedById":144975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T13:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for station contract, I found them ridiculous.

Don\u0027t forget to equip your station with solar panels (put more solar panels the farther you are from the sun as their effectiveness decreases with the distance). A fast antena and a lot of battery will help you too, as the science transmit takes time and a lot of energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA probe core somewhere could also be a good idea, in case you need your kerbals somewhere else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others said : docking ports are almost mandatory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:05:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm, science lab are great, but the science generation comes efficiently too late. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem 1 : having some experienced scientits comes late. You get level 3 kerbonautes only by leaving SOI after landing on Mun and Minmus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem 2 : stripping Minmus and Mun for science is enough to get the whole tech tree unlocked. Those missions can be done in several days. Lab would only generate very few science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Step 1 : master new atmo and orbiting. Doing some Kerbin plane flights for fun and research to get most science experiments unlocked (except sesmic, gravity and atmo analysis).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Step 2 : Sending a simple Mimmus mission : small lander and half an orange tank of fuel. Landed 3 times all biomes visited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Step 3 : Sending a real space station to Mun in polar orbit : 2 small landers. all biomes visited\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Step 4 : Kerbol SOI peek : send a bus full of kerbals to get XP to level 3\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Step 5 : All science expermients unlocked, new Minmus space station with more science (complement and missing experiments)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, all tech tree unlocked and I\u0027m few days from the first Duna window. During that time, my 2 labs generated less than 100 science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy typical \u0022Space station missions\u0022 is a dual mission : 1 for the space station with additionnal fuel. 1 with the return vehicle, kerbals and landers (even sats). I usually bring around 7-12 kerbals to get XP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Labs aren\u0027t that usefull to farm science. But I always add one for RP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow time to get an administrative strategy to turn science into cash. but my Duna mission is nearly ready. Same thing : Space station mission (with one big 3.75m fuel tank full) and another mission with 2 landers, 2 sats and return vehicle. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll do a science stripping on Duna, but I should be able to land 4 or 5 times, maybe with one small hop each time (Duna lander has 2800m/s). For Ike, I\u0027ve planned less landing, but more hops, as the station will orbit Duna, not Ike (Ike lander has 3000m/s).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I won\u0027t go to polar orbit, because of Ike exploration. Polar orbit is very nice for Eeloo. Boring for Mun (as it\u0027s tidally locked), I dealt with it by using 2 landers. No useful for Minmus as plane change are cheap. Probably a good idea for Dres (never been there). For Jool\u0027s moons, that depends how you explore them ; last time I went for a 500km equatorial orbit of Laythe, a VERY nice view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xiombargdei","CreatedById":125757,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T14:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eok thanks guys for your answers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Getting the contract done was important for RP reasons, but i guess this can wait for me to install Real Solar System and Survival mods and get some serious stuff done.

If i want a polar orbit on Minmus is it better to launch northward on kerbin then transfer to minmus, or get an equatorial orbit of kerbin first, then adjust trajectory toward Minmus ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

I usually start flat east and do some tweak during mun transfer burn. It\u0027s quite cheap. It\u0027s even easier with Minmus but polar orbit is less useful as landing costs little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Mun, polar orbit is efficient to explore biomes, BUT as Mun is tidally locked it turns VERY slowly and you can be stuck for as while on ground waiting for the mother ship/space station to fly over you location.
