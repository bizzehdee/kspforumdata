Men by the name of Newton and Kepler helped refine this model and explain why nature works this way, and we have used it to send men to the Moon, and our instruments to the furthest corners of our vast solar system. Also, don\u0027t insult the Pope. That gets you charged with heresy. Seriously. Don\u0027t publish something featuring \u0027Pope Simplicio\u0027. This isn\u0027t going to go over well for you, even if the Pope was remarkably gentle about your arrest\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, show Dmitri Mendeleev the modern Periodic Table of the Elements, and at least the Bohr model of the atom. The modern understanding of electron probability clouds might make him think I\u0027m leading him on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird, Antoine Lavoisier,\u00A0mostly the same. The man was one of the greatest chemists of all time, turning the study of alchemistry to true chemistry. If the conversation is long enough, I might also describe the modern computational technique of alchemical free energy simulations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFourth, to good old Charles Darwin: \u0022The world is 4.5 billion years old, with life having existed for 3 billion. Here\u0027s the molecular mechanisms underlying your theory. Hopefully this helps patch up some of the holes in your current argument.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: To clarify on the Darwin thing, I may very well have been one of the skeptics when he first released \u0022On The Origin of Species\u0022. Some of his theory was at the time founded on shaky evidence; for example, it postulated that Earth was around for longer than most people were willing to credit at the time, and the molecular mechanism behind it (DNA, its mutation, recombination, and overall genetics) was unknown.

Perhaps *the* father of it, because he provided the outline of how it all had to go down in order to be successful and NASA got the plan from him...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Kondratyuk was a very obscure mathematician/ physicist even in his own day. He concurrently and independently (and less famously) developed the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation at the same time as his legendary colleague, but it was just a footnote in his overall design to explore interplanetary space, which was exceedingly pragmatic for his day. He put together a manuscript with treatises, doodles, and equations and nobody wanted to print it because it seemed so fanciful. He wound up getting it printed in a limited run to pretty much no reception except in very small academic circles. That was pretty much it for his aerospace ambitions and he went on to civil engineering. That would be the end of his involvement, except...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFast forward to the Apollo program, and the big question was whether we would be going with the \u0022Direct Ascent\u0022 approach or the \u0022Earth Orbit Rendezvous\u0022 approach. And then along comes John Houboldt, who suggests a radically different approach; the \u003Cem\u003Elunar\u003C/em\u003E orbit rendezvous. He is credited with the success of the program because he wouldn\u0027t let it die, but it wasn\u0027t originally his idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Houboldt read the report from the Space Task Group which mentioned an oddball proposal from a junior engineer at Vought named Tom Dolan and was convinced that this was the way it had to be in order to be successful. But it wasn\u0027t actually Dolan\u0027s idea either, because he got it from this crazy book he found written by some obscure Ukrainian guy named... Yuri Kondratyuk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 So the entire concept of detaching a small lunar lander from a mothership in lunar orbit, landing, returning to orbit, and docking in order to save weight (because weight is always the overriding concern)... That was all Kondratyuk\u0027s idea. Additionally, the free- return trajectory and the gravity assist were originally his ideas as well. And as I said earlier, he also invented the rocket equation completely on his own although Tsiolkovsky gets the credit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cu\u003EPretty much the entire Apollo design and mission plan was initially laid out in Kondratyuk\u0027s book, and that\u0027s where NASA got it from\u003C/u\u003E... though through convoluted channels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Kondratyuk\u0027s life was a great deal more mundane and tragic.

Newton did not believe there was an actual force acting on objects, but in order for his \u0027every force has an equal and opposite for working on it (why we can have rockets) something had to be pushing your posterior down on a chair as the chair pushed up on your posterior\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn layman\u0027s term the pound is a unit of force, a spring scale of an earlier era is measuring force, not mass, even the balance in the lab is measuring force at some level, there has to be non-inertial force acting on the bottom of the balance in order for it to work, its just less sensitive to gravity than a scale.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am watching these lectures on quantum physics and classical physics and I find it intriguing that they talk about let the math do the work and give your sense a break, but then they turn around and do thinks like say\u003Cbr\u003E\nif something appears to be true then it is also true.
