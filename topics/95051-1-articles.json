It\u0027s been great help and I\u0027m amazed to get 0.90 working with mods, however even with Vanilla KSP, I\u0027m having trouble getting a 0.25 save to load in KSP 0.90. I got it working once, but it died again on save/load the second time. I get a frozen screen zoomed in on the facilities on load, so I\u0027m assuming it\u0027s the bugged Kerbal Achievements bug, but having problems resolving it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly have/had KAC and Mechjeb installed, but I can take those mods off if needed as they are not vital (though will of cause need the mechjeb part to prevent ship deletion).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea on where or what lines I need to delete or change?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave is: \u003Ca href=\u0022benart.www.idnet.com/persistentTB.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ebenart.www.idnet.com/persistentTB.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP 0.90 32bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb as mod or part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas old 0.25 save.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T22:56:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 10:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Technical Ben\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-01T13:21:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed now.
