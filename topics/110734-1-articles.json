These events aren\u0027t crashes in the standard sense; there\u0027s no lockup, slowdown, freeze, or BSOD. I\u0027ll be happily playing, when suddenly my screen goes black and my computer powers down. When I press the power button to reboot, Windows launches normally; it doesn\u0027t realize anything untoward happened. There\u0027s no \u0022Windows didn\u0027t shut down properly\u0022 message. It\u0027s as if something is just telling it to shut down, out of the blue, no explanation. If it were a hardware issue, I would expect Windows to at least sense the presence of an issue; here, there\u0027s nothing.\n\nI went through a lot of steps to pin down the source of the issue, and it\u0027s KSP. I even completely re-installed Windows, then installed all my other games one by one. Everything is perfect until I add KSP. Unfortunately, when the issue begins, it affects all my software, even Chrome. I must re-install Windows in order to fix it.\n\nI thought the issue was a compatibility one. I went through all the standard troubleshooting procedures, including setting KSP to run on a single core, but nothing worked. \n\nMy machine isn\u0027t top-end, but it\u0027s well within the recommended specs and should be beefy enough to play KSP without struggling. I\u0027ve never had it display any issues with any other game before. Here\u0027s what I have:\n\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit\n\nAMD FX-4100 Quad-Core 3.60 GHz\n\n8 GB RAM\n\nAMD Radeon HD 6800\n\n[Here\u0027s a link to the last KSP file I could find.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d3lpRb6IrkVz3hLzFPfPd0G4Dm-Vzq9bCi85-GMWq_8/pub)\n\nI love this game so much I\u0027ve been playing it with really crappy graphics on an old iMac, but that\u0027s reached the limit of its capabilities. I\u0027m just to the point where I\u0027m exploring beyond Minmus, and I don\u0027t want to give it up. Can anyone help?"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T04:44:08Z","Content":"Check your windows system event logs after a shutdown to see what caused the shutdown, if possible. Fri, May 08, 2015 17:17:00 is the end of that KSP log, so look about that time in the Event Viewer. Look for any errors/warnings."},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorSaticoy","CreatedById":144848,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:44:09Z","Content":"Thanks for the reply. I couldn\u0027t find any old event logs, so I re-created the situation. Here\u0027s what happened:\n\nI re-loaded KSP and played it until I got a shutdown. I went into the Event Viewer and looked at \u0022Administrative Events.\u0022 The crash happened at around 2:20 p.m. In the Viewer, there\u0027s an event at 12:27 p.m., then one at 2:23 p.m. The one just after the crash says \u0022The previous system shutdown at 2:21:38 PM on \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BD5/\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BD25/\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u00BD2015 was unexpected.\u0022 For almost two hours before that, there are no events of any kind listed.\n\n[Here is the KSP file from that shutdown.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IsUZmpbjrxsv42c1sLKnvBPQQopWPilFJhigojR55cg/pub)\n\nRight before it happened, I switched focus from my orbiter to my lander. The last event in that KSP log reflects that; there\u0027s no event listed after it.\n\nStill no clue what\u0027s happening."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T09:08:47Z","Content":"This sounds like your computer is overheating, your motherboard will automatically shut down the PC if it detects dangerous levels of heat, this is at the BIOS/UEFI level, above the OS.\n\nMake sure all fans are clean and turning freely, and that no cables are able to move into the fan blades, they can often move when they themselves get hot, also ensure all vents into and out of your case are not blocked."}]}
