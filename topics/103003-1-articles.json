Forget about speed, pretend everything is going the same speed. Now, imagine two track runners running around circular track. One is on the inside lane and the other on the outside. Assuming they are running at the same speed, which one arrives at the finish lane first? The inside, because it\u0027s a shorter distance. Now, in orbital mechanics the end result is the same, even though really the craft are in fact moving at different speeds in this case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is unintuitive and confuses many about orbital mechanics however is the higher your orbit, the slower your speed. You can see this effect on your own. Establish a 75 km circular orbit and write down your m/s. Raise it to 300, and check the m/s again. This is a rather confounding principle because you have to accelerate more to get a higher orbit which goes slower. That is where the confusion lies. However, the lower speed is the result of weaker gravity. Even though your adding more acceleration, that velocity does not translate into the orbit. I\u0027m sure you have heard that orbiting is just endlessly falling, well that is true but at higher orbits there is weaker gravity so you don\u0027t fall as fast. With an elliptical orbit, this principle still holds true. As you approach Pe, you get faster and faster and as you approach Ap, you get slower and slower.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"culturekills","CreatedById":140395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T08:25:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis history of docking at Wikipedia explains a lot of the specifics of how and why too: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Een.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_rendezvous\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
