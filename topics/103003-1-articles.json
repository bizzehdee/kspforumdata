Raise your orbit if it\u0027s in front of your station. All is assuming that the orbit of the station and the spacecraft which wants to dock is the same at the moment.\n\nFor the final roundevouz, control the spacecraft, select the spacestation as target and set up a maneuver-node that intersects the orbit of the station. You\u0027ll get the separation distance displayed. Try to set up a node to get a seperation of 5km (more is still possible if you can\u0027t get it tight on first time) and then try to get burn right.\n\nThere are plenty of tutorials out there for roundevouz (gettings 2 ships close to each other) and docking itself.

You can alter your orbit from anywhere if it\u0027s mostly circular, it\u0027s just most fuel efficient at Ap or Pe. However, if you\u0027re targeting something like the Mun then it\u0027s less likely you will be burning prograde at periapsis. Eventually you will be increasing Ap or Pe from any location (or even turning your Pe into Ap)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T02:00:17Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Invader Myk","CreatedById":137014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T04:36:25Z","Content":"Being creatures that evolved under the influence of gravity orbital mechanics are very unintuitive and often counter-intuitive.\n\nIf you are behind your target you need to go slower.

Forget about speed, pretend everything is going the same speed. Now, imagine two track runners running around circular track. One is on the inside lane and the other on the outside. Assuming they are running at the same speed, which one arrives at the finish lane first? The inside, because it\u0027s a shorter distance. Now, in orbital mechanics the end result is the same, even though really the craft are in fact moving at different speeds in this case.\n\nWhat is unintuitive and confuses many about orbital mechanics however is the higher your orbit, the slower your speed. You can see this effect on your own. Establish a 75 km circular orbit and write down your m/s. Raise it to 300, and check the m/s again. This is a rather confounding principle because you have to accelerate more to get a higher orbit which goes slower. That is where the confusion lies. However, the lower speed is the result of weaker gravity. Even though your adding more acceleration, that velocity does not translate into the orbit. I\u0027m sure you have heard that orbiting is just endlessly falling, well that is true but at higher orbits there is weaker gravity so you don\u0027t fall as fast. With an elliptical orbit, this principle still holds true. As you approach Pe, you get faster and faster and as you approach Ap, you get slower and slower."},{"CreatedByName":"culturekills","CreatedById":140395,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T08:25:07Z","Content":"This history of docking at Wikipedia explains a lot of the specifics of how and why too: \n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\\_rendezvous"}]}
