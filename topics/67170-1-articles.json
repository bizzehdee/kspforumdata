I have a ship on an Eve orbit and it\u0027s low on fuel. Around 660 out of 2880. I have 3 nuclear engines on 3 ft-800 tanks with fuel being fed from biggest non-orange tank (it\u0027s empty now). I\u0027ve done some calculations and from the results I doubt the ship can return to Kerbin. I have 17 stored science experiments (gravity, temperature, crew report, EVA reports, Surface sample from Gilly, materials and goo samples) and I\u0027d like to get them back for the points. My question is: can kerbals take the science and transfer the data to a hitchhiker storage unit or will I have to use another Mk3 command pod? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t launched the rescue mission yet as I don\u0027t know the answer to the question above.
