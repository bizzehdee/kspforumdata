I can\u0027t really afford a beefy PC currently so being able to play it on a console that small and that portable would be a godsend, along with possibly being able to connect\u00A0 a keyboard and mouse to enhance the experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bingo96","CreatedById":226305,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T15:39:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPD have said there will be no official optimization for the steam deck\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.
