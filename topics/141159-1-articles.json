The most important determinations are\u00A0where you impact, and your angle. On a flat surface, you need to be very nearly perpendicular to the surface (maybe 85 degrees). \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn a curved surface, the klaw needs to be aimed at the centerline of the surface\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(within a few centimeters)\u00A0and be mostly perpendicular, too (maybe 80\u00A0degrees).
