BUT, there is nothing the companies gain when they release ships, sure, popularity, but I was thinking that companies deserve a little bit more than people looking at their crafts only to abandon them in the load menu, I was thinking we could do some sort of ingame and inforums currency, like, Kuros, Koins, Kollars, or something like that, to give companies, and people who release ships in general a little more than just respect from veteran builders like Zekes, or Marex333, or people like them. How would companies gain this currency? Simple, you pay to access a file on the forums, and you cannot re-distribute the files without the permission of the original publisher; if you do you will be given a warning and the thread will be removed, do it again and you get banned, Yes people can post craft files on youtube, but heck, it\u0027ll add an aspect to the game that hasn\u0027t really been implemented yet; one problem you might think of is: can\u0027t people just create random forum accounts and buy crafts on another one when one account runs out of money? Yes, but, people will start out with a VERY small ammount of money, enough for probably 1-2 ships, so it\u0027ll cause them to create tons of accounts, the mods/admins of the forums can see what email is used for each account, and then send an email to the person who does that kind of thing telling them to stop or have their email verification revoked every time they try to create a new account.
