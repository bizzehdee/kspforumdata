If I remember correctly, KSPI takes the first MJ produced by a generator and converts it to 1,000 EC. That means that you are just getting a TINY amount of power left over from the 62.5cm reactor/generator. It looks like you don\u0027t have any reactor/generator upgrades yet either, guessing from the power that the engine is getting. You need some serious power generation to get lots of thrust from a plasma thruster engine. Personally, I typically don\u0027t use them until I get antimatter reactors. They *might* be kinda useable with the 3.75m reactor/generators without upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news is that the plasma engine will consume power from all the reactor/generator combos on your ship (someone correct me if I\u0027m wrong). So you can put multiple power sources on your ship and the engine should pull power from all of them. However, you\u0027ll run into TWR issues by adding a lot of heavy power generators. Which leads me back to not really using these engines until I get antimatter reactors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry making that same design in sandbox mode. It\u0027ll automatically have the upgraded nuke reactors and generators. Launch that same ship and see if you get more power on the right click info pane.

If I run out of antimatter on the ship/station from burning antimatter to charge the containment fields, I no longer need the containment fields because there is no antimatter.

It has a nice 1.25m Xenon container. I think there are other mods like stretchy tanks and such you can use, but if you want a lightweight solution, KSPX might do it for you. There are a few really nice parts in KSPX.

It\u0027s insane how quickly you can gain antimatter at Jool. If you collect antimatter in the right spots, you can get lots of antimatter quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that might help you is to mod the config files to have the antimatter storage tanks start with some antimatter. I changed my tanks to start 1% full. I did this to basically simulate a ground based lab making antimatter. Keeps me from having to add a ground base to make antimatter and from having to use KAS to make antimatter fuel trucks. Basically saves me a bit of time and PC memory/processing from having to run the ground factory and an extra mod. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s too cheaty for me to do that.

If I remember correctly, it has a couple of the 62.5cm nuke reactors for backup power but the main drive is powered by an antimatter reactor. The ship only need 7,500 antimatter to spend alllll that delta V. That\u0027s less than 10% of the smallest antimatter tank. Most ships can probably get by with a few hundred to a couple thousand antimatter for the duration of their mission.
