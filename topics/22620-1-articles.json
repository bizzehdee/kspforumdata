However you can also create a dummy object that has a much simplified mesh in your 3D modelling program, import that into Unity as well and then use that mesh instead. You do this by creating a new empty GameObject in Unity, naming it node_collider and then placing it in the hierarchy of your part. I\u0027m not 100% sure if you need to rename it node_collider, but I do and it seems to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3Uao29W.png\u0022 alt=\u00223Uao29W.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EExample used also includes thrustTransforms for an engine.
