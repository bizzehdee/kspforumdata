The usefulness of taking the road with you is that you get stuck less easily, because you are spreading the load across a larger area. It is doing the same as the semi-deflated wheels you talk about, but on an even larger scale. Reducing pressure is the name of the game and that is a useful property when on muddy building sites, or in shot up fields of mud or loose sand trying not to get stuck and become a sitting duck.\u003Cp\u003EI find it difficult to divide this into two seperate qualities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see what you mean buddy, but it\u0027s quite easy to explain. It\u0027s all about the design of the tracks and the wheels that interact with them. Tracks allow a vehicle to move even when sunk into the mud due to the fact there is a positive interaction between the track and the front wheel, helpfully called a sprocket (which is the only driving wheel on a tracked vehicle). In fact, tracks work best when they are sunk into the mud, because when they are sunk into the mud they are gripping the surface extremely well and the sprocket teeth fit into the corresponding holes in the track allowing the vehicle to essentially climb along the track due to the gear tooth type interaction between them. Take away the fact that the track is keyed to the driving wheel and you would have a vehicle with wheels spinning on tracks not going anywhere instead of a vehicle with wheels spinning on the surface not going anywhere, even though it might not have sunk as deeply into the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if the drive sprocket was not gear-like, on ground where there is no resistance to the torque applied by the drive wheel the vehicle would move. But the second there was some resistance, it would start to slip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a tracked vehicle, the thing to understand, that may seem contrary to a layperson, until you see one up close move then you would understand immediately, is that the vehicle climbs up the tracks due to the gear like interaction, not rolls along them. That is what gives them their amazing grip and off-road capabilities. The track and sprocket allows a greater torque to be applied due to the weight of the vehicle holding the tracks down thus increasing surface area and thus grip. Reducing pressure has nothing to due with their effectiveness whatsoever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMathematically I would write is as :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egrip (tracks) \u002B torque (drive sprocket) \u0026gt; depth sunk into surface (weight spreading properties).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis picture explains that interaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://previewcf.turbosquid.com/Preview/Content_2010_12_05__14_58_00/Sprocket2.png0c3043ff-388f-4790-82d7-f76a363ec91cLarger.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Sprocket2.png0c3043ff-388f-4790-82d7-f76a363ec91cLarger.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that explain it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry to derail the thread \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-19T01:32:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/19/2013 01:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Kass\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T01:32:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kass\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kass\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is not the purpose of tracked vehicles. The idea behind tracks is that it allows vehicles to travel off road because they take the road with them (the tracks). If it was to reduce the pressure of the wheels on the ground, the track would have to be tight yet all tracks are designed to have a certain element of slackness in them or the track becomes too tight and pops off. The fact that many tracked vehicles have 10-14 wheels each resting on the width of an individual link of track instead of just the contact point on the circumference of the wheel reduces the ground pressure, not the tracks themselves. Usually when a vehicle wants to reduce it\u0027s footprint, it uses huge, lightly inflated rubber wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s interesting. British Army armoured vehicle drivers are taught not to brake too hard because they can literally tip the whole vehicle over the vehicles stop so fast. Also, when any armoured vehicles are taken on civilian roads either in the UK or Germany, it has to have a sign on the back that literally says \u0022KEEP YOUR DISTANCE, THIS VEHICLE CAN STOP EXTREMELY QUICKLY\u0022 (much faster than a car at the same speed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually tracks aren\u0027t to bring the road with you, they are to reduce the ground pressure footprint of the vehicle thus making it less likely to bog down in loose terrain. This is why the T-34/76 performed so much better than the Panzerkampfwaggen MkVIE Tiger on the eastern front. Because the T-34/76 had a wider track, and had a MUCH lower pounds per square inch, than the Tiger tank.
