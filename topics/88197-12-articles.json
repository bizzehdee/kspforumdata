As I\u0027ve pointed out quite clearly, the more mass you divide up your energy over, the more Thrust/MW you will achieve. When you don\u0027t have to create the mass, it\u0027s like the difference between a Thermal Turbojet and an Electric Propeller (both accelerate air to generate thrust, but the propeller has much lower Exhaust Velocity, and thus generates much more Thrust/MW at low speeds...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThink about hawking radiation: it is commonly explained with virtual particles in the proximity of the even horizont. You have a pair of virtual particles. One will fall into the event horizont, the other will become hawking radiation. But why? Why can\u0027t both particles just be hawking radiation. Because if you wan\u0027t virtual particles to actually do anything useful (like being hawking radiation), you have to invest energy into it. The energy-invest-mechanism at the event horizont is the virtual particle falling into the event horizont. The black hole loses the energy in the process in the exact same quantity as if it just would have created the hawking radiation out of energy.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s accurate- you have to invest energy into virtual particles to get them to do anything useful- but once again, the Canna/EmDrive or a black hole DOES NOT INVEST ENERGY TO *CREATE* THE VIRTUAL PARTICLES. And, you\u0027re comparing apples and oranges here- the Cannae/EmDrive also loses energy, just like if you had used a photon-drive instead, but what we\u0027re measuring is not the AMOUNT of energy lost, it\u0027s how much useful work (Thrust) we derive from those particles before sending them off. Because the Exhaust Velocity is lower, you get more useful work out of accelerating virtual particles to speeds less than the speed of light than out of creating photons. You could still design a photon-drive that would consume Energy at the exact same rate as the Cannae/EmDrive, but it would produce less USEFUL work. In essence, the Cannae/EmDrive is more efficient than a photon-drive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe same is true for any other case: To actually interact with the virtual particle \u0022in a meaningful way\u0022 (in this example to impart net momentum onto them) you will have to invest a big amout of energy, exactly as much as if you would create matter out of energy. Virtual particles \u0022poping in and out of existens\u0022 doesn\u0027t mean you don\u0027t have to pay your bill at the end of the night. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI NEVER SAID you don\u0027t have to \u0022pay your bill\u0022 in the end, in the form of investing energy. What I said is, the Cannae/EmDrive is more EFFICIENT than a photon-drive. It is a known fact that the most energy-efficient propulsion method (from a given frame of reference) is one that has an Exhaust velocity equal to your vehicle velocity. However, in your frame of reference, the spacecraft using the Cannae/EmDrive would not be moving at NEARLY the speed of light. So, it\u0027s more energy-efficient to create an exhaust-stream of slower-moving particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mass of a photon is non-existant outside of the mass imparted by its energy, and thus the photon-drive expends negligible energy creating the actual photon outside of the energy required for the photon\u0027s energy (this is why it costs less energy to create infrared light than X-rays: the entire energy-cost is invested in the energy/velocity of the photon, and none of it in the mass...) In the same way, a Cannae/EmDrive does NOT consume any energy creating the actual virtual particles, only in giving them momentum (which causes the particles to become longer-lived). Producing/exciting a stream of slower-moving particles with negligible energy-requirements to create the mass of (neither the photon-drive nor the Cannae/EmDrive expends significant energy creating particle mass- only in giving the particles energy, which in turn gives the particles some amount of mass) will be more EFFICIENT at speeds greatly less than the speed of light, as your Exhaust Velocity is closer to your spacecraft velocity. It should follow, however, that once your spacecraft accelerates a certain amount past the Exhaust Velocity of a Cannae/EmDrive, a photon-drive would become the more energy-efficient of the two (we\u0027re talking at relativistic speeds here...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENo, if you do the actual math, the poton drive will give the upper efficency:\u003Cp\u003EEnergy you have to invest (into virtual particles) to give momentum to them: E = sqrt((m_rest c^2)^2 \u002B (pc)^2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo get the maximum momentum per invested energy you wan\u0027t to use particles without rest mass, hence photons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMomentum per invested Energy is exactly the same as Force per invested Power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo. You don\u0027t expend any energy to give the Virtual Particles rest-mass. They already had that when they appeared. Perhaps that statement is true from the standpoint of the ENTIRE UNIVERSE (if the energy to create the Virtual Particles in the first place came from somewhere else), but the spacecraft expends no actual energy creating the virtual particles, and thus is not penalized for the rest-mass of the virtual particles in any way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the closest analogy to what we\u0027re talking about here is ACTUALLY an electric propeller vs. a photon-drive. IF the electric-propeller had to invest the energy to create its working mass, it would be the less efficient of the two propulsion methods due to the rest-mass of its exhaust. However the electric propeller does NOT expend energy to create the rest-mass of its exhaust, and thus is far more energy-efficient at low speeds...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr, you could just use real particles in the first place. Since you don\u0027t have to pay the heavy bill of their rest mass, you will get amazing amounts of momentum per invested energy (hence the usefulness of ion drives in comparison to photon drives)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve said this once, I\u0027m going to say it again. And again if necessary until you actually listen. The Cannae/EmDrive *DOES NOT, AND CANNOT* pay the bill of creating the rest-mass of the virtual particles. The Vritual Particles had rest-mass \u003Cstrong\u003EBEFORE the Cannae/EmDrive ever started acting on them\u003C/strong\u003E, and would exist even if the Cannae/EmDrive were not there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is why Virtual Particles are so weird- they come into existence with mass and energy WITHOUT you having to invest any energy to create them. However they then normally spontaneously pop back out of existence. The very existence of virtual particles technically, for an infinitesimally small amount of time, may violate Conservation of Energy. What a Cannae/EmDrive does is take advantage of these particles that ALREADY EXIST, and gives them momentum. Even if the particles then pop back out of existence, the reaction force has already been exerted on the Cannae/EmDrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho knows? Maybe the Virtual Particles pop into existence SOMEWHERE ELSE in the universe with the momentum that the Cannae/EmDrive gave them (thus preventing the Cannae/EmDrive from actually violating Conservation of Momentum). But, what a Cannae/EmDrive *REALLY* does is take advantage of the fact that VACUUM IS NOT TRULY EMPTY, not create particles to act as its propellant. Thus, it is more similar to a propeller (which acts on working mass which already exists around it) than a photon-drive (which creates the working mass it needs for its propellent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, thats why I brought up the example. If you do the actual math you will see that the standart solar sail will be incredibly more powerful than the \u0022solar power photon drive\u0022, because photovoltaics are so much heavier per area than a thin sail foil.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t argue that point. However a nuclear reactor coupled with a photon-drive... (or better yet, a Cannae/EmDrive...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022N_las\u0022 data-cite=\u0022N_las\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYes, this is just another version of the battery example I stated earlier. So the conversation went from: \u0022You could use an energy source on the ship\u0022 over \u0022but an alternative would be to use solar power\u0022 back to \u0022another alternative could be to use an energy source on the ship\u0022.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I don\u0027t disagree. A nuclear reactor is, from a certain perspective, just like a battery with incredibly high energy-density. And, if you\u0027re using an internal power-source like that, you\u0027re going to want to get the most Thrust/MW, which means YOU\u0027RE GOING TO WANT YOUR EXHAUST VELOCITY TO MATCH YOUR SPACECRAFT VELOCITY. A photon-drive creates an exhaust-stream moving at the speed of light (with no rest-mass), and thus is much less efficient at non-relativistic speeds than a Cannae/EmDrive which acts of particles that have rest-mass but the Cannae/EmDrive imparted no energy to in order to give rest-mass to in the first place (much like a propeller does NOT expend energy to give air its rest-mass), and accelerates those particles to speeds only a fraction a speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBottom Line:\u003C/strong\u003E ANY propulsion-system invests energy in order to achieve usable work (Thrust). The more energy is imparted to each particle of the exhaust-stream, the less of that energy is converted into usable work and the more of it remains in the exhaust. Photon-drives achieve the WORST possible ratio of usable work to energy-consumption (at non-relativistic speeds), due to their VERY high Exhaust Velocity. A Cannae/EmDrive, on the other hand, produces an exhaust stream of lower velocity, and thus harvests more usable work from it. It does NOT invest any energy to create the propellant, just like a photon-drive doesn\u0027t (the energy it invests actually all goes into the energy of the photons, NOT into creating any rest-mass) and a rocket engine doesn\u0027t. A Cannae/EmDrive actually produces LESS Thrust/MW than any chemical or thermal propulsion system, due to its much higher Exhaust Velocity- but unlike these systems it does not have to carry its propellant-mass with it, but rather utilizes Virtual Particles, that already appeared and disappeared before the Cannae/EmDrive entered that space, and will continue to appear and disappear there after the Cannae/EmDrive leaves that space...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T19:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not familiar with the god-of-the-gaps fallacy. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps\u003C/a\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sean Mirrsen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m just saying that people should start providing more theories besides the one that\u0027s supposedly obviously wrong, if they don\u0027t want the obviously wrong theory to be used.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Used\u0022 is a strong word, because no one working in actual engineering or physics will use that pseudo-argument.

If the particle can hold momentum in that way, it has to become real, and someone had to bay the bill, someone had to spend the energy for that mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example a virtual photon can hold momentum (that it took from an electron), but only if it gives that momentum \u0022immediately\u0022 back to maybe another electron. From the outside it looks like the electrons were exchanging momentum directly (over the electromagnetic force). You don\u0027t need to spend the energy for that photon, because it keeps beeing virtual because it gives that momentum back immediately.

One issue I\u0027ve been having to try and circumvent is this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor all intents and purposes, a cannae/em Drive is no different than just a random directional microwave radio. The only special thing it has going for it is the enclosed cavity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, unless we suddenly find out that directional microwave antennae have been found to have thrusts like this, whatever theory we are operating on needs to address the difference between an enclosed cavity and a freestanding emitter. If it was simply that the microwaves were pushing off of virtual particles, great! But then why is the boxed emitter gaining more thrust than a free emitter? If the microwaves push off the virtual particles, then we should be able to see this effect with a microwave emitter that is not enclosed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is quite possible that nobody has hooked up a microwave emitter in such a way as to test the thrust it generates and noticed the discrepancy between the thrust detected vs what a photon drive should be emitting. I find this a \u0027little\u0027 unlikely, but it isn\u0027t exactly outside the realm of reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, if this turned out to be true (that a freestanding directional antenna observed the cannae/em Drive effect) then I would actually expect a freestanding directional antenna to work BETTER, simply because it doesn\u0027t have the \u0027counter thrust\u0027 of the microwaves impacting against it (the whole tossing a ball backwards inside your own ship thing) to slow you down. Unless of course, the effect is super minimal, but the reflections inside the drive itself causes a sort of macro-buildup. This could quite possibly be the case since they actually saw that the cannae drive (the one with slots) had a slightly worse output than the one without the slots in the technical documents I read. Very slightly worse, but consistently slightly worse. If this is the case then that might mean some interesting ways on how to design the drives for better performance, such as utilizing surfaces/materials designed to maximize reflections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust some mad ramblings.

(because of the energy gradient, this is more likely to happen on one end of the cavity than the other) They interact with that end of the cavity, picking up a momentum debt as it pushes the craft foreward. It then travels to the other end of the cavity, interacts and pays off it\u0027s momentum debt, stopping the craft and becoming fully virtual again, vanishing in a puff of not-real. But because the particle had momentum energy as it traveled the length of the cavity (again, this is normally an omidirectional effect and thus self-canceling- only the energy gradient of the asymmetic resonator creates a directional bias) the cavity itself gaines an opposite momentum until the second interaction stopped it. Repeated for every virtual particle to spawn in the high energy end (minus the virtual particles that spawn in the low energy end, that convey reverse momentum) this becomes a measurable effect, despite relying on virtual intereactions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-18T21:26:10Z\u0022 title=\u002202/18/2015 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rakaydos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"technicalfool","CreatedById":70430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T21:22:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan we continue this thread without public accusations of trollage and implications of idiocy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankyou.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-18T21:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESuch as?

(because of the energy gradient, this is more likely to happen on one end of the cavity than the other) They interact with that end of the cavity, picking up a momentum debt as it pushes the craft foreward. It then travels to the other end of the cavity, interacts and pays off it\u0027s momentum debt, stopping the craft, becoming fully virtual again, and vanishes in a puff of not-real. But because the particle had momentum energy as it traveled the length of the cavity (again, this is normally an omidirectional effect and thus self-canceling- only the energy gradient of the asymmetic resonator creates a directional bias) the cavity itself gaines an opposite momentum until the second interaction stopped it. Repeated for every virtual particle to spawn in the high energy end (minus the virtual particles that spawn in the low energy end, that convey reverse momentum) this becomes a measurable effect, despite relying on virtual intereactions.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a macroscopic level this wouldn\u0027t look like the box having momentum for a short time, then stopping, then having momentum, then stopping.
