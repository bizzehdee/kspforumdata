This is your problem right here.

I\u0027m going to quote myself from a thread I just explained this in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Aphox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Aphox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPlanetary Phase Angle, as far as KSP goes, is the angle of your target planet in relation to Kerbin, your planet. Think of it like a clock, and Kerbin is at 3 o\u0027 clock, and Duna is at 12 o\u0027 clock. Duna\u0027s planetary phase angle would be 90 degrees. According to the interplanetary calculator at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E, ideal phase angle for Duna interception and capture is 44.36 degrees, which is an acute angle, which is slightly over halfway between 12 and 3 on the clock. A picture is shown on that website describing what I mean.\u003Cp\u003EEjection or escape angle is a little hard to describe. If you zoom way out in map view, you\u0027ll see an orbit line coming out of every planet. That is the planet\u0027s prograde. It follows that line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour ejection angle is the angle of your ship in relation to that line on a vertical axis. The website also shows pictures. The blue line coming out of Kerbin in the picture is Kerbin\u0027s prograde, and that angle is where your ship needs to be for a proper ejection to occur in order to achieve an encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn easier way to see Kerbin\u0027s prograde as by looking at the \u003Cstrong\u003Eshadow\u003C/strong\u003E. It\u0027s basically always line up with Kerbin\u0027s prograde. The shadow follows the same direction as the prograde line, at least when you\u0027re zoomed in that far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new MechJeb beta .dll gives very accurate, detailed information about phase angle and ejection angle if you wish to download it.

It pretty much guarantees success, provided of course that you have enough fuel. It is only a question of time and effort (less than using only one save). It also allows for a lot more experimentation, which is a great way to learn. Let me explain:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Open the saves folder in your main KSP folder. From there, open the folder with the corresponding player name (or game name, whatever it is), in which you can find the \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 and \u0022quicksave.sfs\u0022 files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The quick save file can be copied and renamed freely like any windows file, thus granting you a practically infinite amount of saves. I am sure some people would consider this cheating but why use quick save to begin with then? Just keep in mind that when you press the F9 key (or whichever hot-key you use for loading quick saves), the game will only ever load the file with the name \u0022quicksave.sfs\u0022. Also, never touch the \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 file. You do not need to backup the original quick save or anything of sorts. The game always generates a new one when you quick save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Quick save your game every time you make a major change in anything. Then also copy the quick save file and re-name the copy to something that makes you remember what it is. The copy can later be named back to \u0022quicksave.sfs\u0022 (you obviously need to remove the current \u0022quicksave.sfs\u0022 first, which is okay because you made a copy), and then it will be loaded as normal. This does not require a restart of the game. This is easier to do in windowed mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Just before you start the transfer burn, save the game and copy the save file. Finish the burn only in terms of velocity required (get the sun apoapsis as far out as it needs to go, relative to target orbit, ignoring any inclination or eccentricity). Now save the game again (remember to copy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Warp all the way to apoapsis to see if they actually get close to each other. If you get close enough to be able to correct the orbit from before you started warping (but after you finished the burn), load the save file in which you had just finished the burn and correct it. If it is way off, note whether your ship was early or late compared to the target, then load the save file in which you were about to start the burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Redo the burn. You will have to start burning earlier or later than given ejection angle, depending on whether you were early or late, as mentioned in step 5. Repeat step 4 to 6. To make this less tedious, use phys-warp (alt \u002B \u0026lt; and alt \u002B \u0026gt; , or alt \u002B whichever keys you have warping bound to). This allows up to four times warp while burning, but be careful not to diverge from your intended course. Unless your orbit is way off in every respect, at this point, you only need to redo the transfer burn until your ship and the planet arrive at the same place at the same time (again, only in terms of velocity requirements, as mentioned in step 4). This does not necessarily have to be at the sun apoapsis. If it is all wrong, however, you will have to improve your orbit around the origin body before even starting the burn, or perhaps read up more on how to actually perform interplanetary transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. The above does not have to be perfect. Once I am happy with it, I usually warp to and make a save at the sun periapsis, as this is a good place to change inclination, and is outside of the origin SOI, which allows for corrections without being affected by the origin body\u0027s gravity, while still being very far from the target. Now, knowing that your ship and target will arrive at the same place at the same time, you can feel confident in the fact that you will eventually find an encounter without correcting too much. So keep correcting it until you do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Soon enough, you will find an encounter. At this point, I save the game. This allows you to start doing the corrections all over again (after having found the encounter), in case you would end up missing the planet after all, but this should not happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Do corrections as early as possible, starting from the moment you find an encounter. Observe whether the target body periapsis is above, below, to the right or left of the body, and correct accordingly. Keep a close eye on the periapsis distance from the body as you are making the correction. Keep burning until the distance starts to increase again, then you will need to correct at a different angle. If you can not see where the periapsis is relative to the body then you are too far away and you can go ahead and warp closer by about half the remaining distance. Then start correcting again. I recommend targeting (focusing the camera on) the sun, to start with, as it will put the camera closer to the encounter which makes it easier to see, until your ship is closer. Keep doing this until the periapsis is at most 1 million km from the body, preferably less (depends on its gravitational force).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Once the periapsis is close enough to the body, it is safe to warp all the way to the SOI. If you are planning to use the atmosphere as a means of braking (recommended), do not blindly do retro-burns to get the periapsis close enough. It is usually a lot more fuel efficient to correct the trajectory at either 270 or 90 degrees, provided that you entered the SOI horizontally. Remember that the attitude indicator (the blue and brown ball) always is relative to the body the ship is currently orbiting, and that \u0022up\u0022 is always due North (0 degrees), \u0022down\u0022 is South (180), 90 is the the way everything spins (anticlockwise), 270 is the opposite, the dot in the circle on the blue side (the position it is in when you are on the launchpad) is straight away from the planet, and the other way around, always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.

Now you can go ahead and launch your rocket into orbit around Kerbin. I recommend heading east (90 degrees) when you are doing your gravity turn since you already have some velocity in that direction from the rotation of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/alysn.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022alysn.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re in a circular orbit, look at the information window from the plugin. You\u0027ll want to pay attention to your current ejection angle and the ejection angle required to get to Duna. The ejection angle assumes you are instantly changing your velocity to the amount needed to get to Duna so you will want to start your burn a bit earlier than the listed ejection angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/roVc7.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022roVc7.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started my ejection burn at about this ejection angle.
