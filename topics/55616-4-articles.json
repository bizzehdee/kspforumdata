In fact, they wouldn\u0027t be after anything that would be against our best interests, because that would require them to invade us. That would not end well...for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny sort of alien invasion wouldn\u0027t be the curbstomp you would expect. On one side you have: 7 Billion humans, all now 100% committed to making life for the invaders as ugly and short as possible, with a planet full of resources to employ towards this goal. On the other side, you have: An isolated armed force, with limited soldiers, ammunition and supplies. Even if they capture some land, they would need significant time to build infrastructure that could replace said supplies. The defenders (humanity) knows the terrain better than any form of life in the universe, they can survive anywhere with minimal technological assistance, and their equipment is masterfully engineered to work as effectively as possible in any given corner of the planet, from the sands and jungles of Africa to the blizzards of Antartica. The attackers are literally lightyears away from whatever planet they evolved and trained on. The entire biosphere is their potential enemy, everything from pathogens doing major direct damage to them (forcing them into \u0022spacesuits\u0022, and making their entire body a weak spot for human forces), to the atmosphere and terrian being so incompatable with their equipment, it makes the attrition involved with \u0022invading Russia in the winter\u0022 look like a walk in the park.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETheir only, ONLY, advantage is their technology, but remember, although they will be advanced enough to travel between the stars, that doesn\u0027t mean they will have weapons that blows us out of the water. It may turn out that the key to interstellar travel is some Law of Nature that we are about to discover (think of how much we\u0027ve advanced in Physics in the last 100 years, and how much we will in the next 100), and the invaders have a few decades advantage on us. Even 200 years might not mean that much, given that humans have every other thing going for them. Then, once survivors of the first few battles snatch the guns from the cold, dead hands of the invaders, and the greatest minds humanity has are mobilized to pick apart those guns, we would be closing that gap. The 400 year tradition of \u0022encounter, capture, test, understand, innovate and destroy\u0022 would be used to give the invaders a crash-course on exactly how horrible we can be if we wanted to be. Acts of underhanded hostility that we today associate with terrorists would give the attackers one huge frickin\u0027 headache. Once a few alien cadavers are put under the knife, biological and chemical weapons enter the arsenal (I doubt the Geneva convention applies here). If they were about to capture a city, we bury the biggest nuclear weapon available and we leg it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould we have a chance of annihilating them? Not a very big one. Would we be destroyed anyway? If they could adapt to the planet, if they wanted us dead as much as we wanted them, that is pretty likely. Are we so good at killing stuff that the aliens would take one look at Earth, estimate how many of their kind would descend to that hellhole and never come back, and go \u0022Nah, let\u0027s just leave those crazy mothertruckers alone.\u0022? Absolutely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if they wanted anything to do with us and our planet, they would most likely come in peace. What they want will have something to do with Earth life, including us. Since we\u0027ve gone to the trouble of learning as much about Earth as we can, they\u0027ll probably prefer to ask us for the data instead of learning it themselves. Our culture, from ancient tales and confident religions to modern economic and military doctrine, would fascinate them. It has been stated earlier in the thread that we might be terrifyingly advanced in some way compared to even them. Maybe the climate of their home planet wasn\u0027t as varied as ours, and they marvel at how we conquered such a wild, unpredictable world. Maybe there is only a tiny area of their planet covered in water, and vast navies of steel never entered their imagination before meeting us. If their planet has slightly lower gravity than Earth, they might have never required the performance that our rockets have (~90% of Earth gravity is low enough that a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle is possible with current rockets.), and the genius we\u0027ve poured into this field would mean alot to them. The reverse, of course, is true. It\u0027ll take a while for Wikipedia to procure the culture of a second intelligent race. If they were generous enough to give at least a hint to what technology got them across the interstellar void, our scientists and engineers would devour that knowledge like a fat kid with chocolate cake, and the sudden knowledge that we are not alone would hopefully give humanity a goal: to elevate itself to the galactic stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] I really did plan to have a much shorter post than this.

Their entire business model is based on (now artificial) scarcity of information and info-media. And they will use all resources at their disposal to bend the political and legal landscape to resist this change.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell it makes sense. Their source of income is selling entertainment. If entertainment becomes free they\u0027re out of a job. So it\u0027s only natural that they\u0027re reluctant to embrace this new information age. I wouldn\u0027t necessarily call this a bad thing either, making a good action movie simply takes a lot of money in terms of pyrotechnics, CGI and actor payrolls. Way more than any amateur on the internet can afford. So if these big organisations die the triple A games and big blockbuster movies will die with them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll be interesting to see how it all pans out in the coming decades. Crowd funding, microtransactions and alpha access seems to be pretty successful for videogames (including KSP). But I am unsure if these methods can rake up enough cash to produce triple A games or blockbuster movies. They could very well go extinct for a few decades. We already see that they\u0027re playing it safe to minimize financial risk: Triple A games tend towards generic brown shooters and summer blockbusters tend towards CGI action flicks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn any case, this trouble surrounding this change in a \u0027minor\u0027 part of our economy is an interesting example and perhaps a preparation of the earthquake in economics when something like \u0027energy\u0027 ever become cheap enough to be considered \u0027free\u0027 like information is now.

But I can see the unlimited growth model as a fairly good approximation. Sure, the number of atoms we can access is limited. But increases in efficiency can come a long way towards unlimited growth. The best approximation would be a bucket of lego bricks. Sure, the bucket holds a limited number of bricks. But even for very small numbers of bricks the number of possible combinations is staggering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re already seeing extensive recycling going on as our supplies of metals dwindle. Copper is a good example, since it is relatively rare we\u0027ve been recycling it for ages. In fact, 80% of all copper ever mined is still circulating around in the economy. And since we\u0027re expected to reach peak copper soon, people are busily poking around on old scrapyards to recycle more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing we consume that is truly unrecoverable is energy (Or the associated entropy increase if you want to be physically correct).

This is my only worry about the future really: can we get fusion energy economically viable? Once we have fusion I\u0027m fairly confident that humanity will turn out okay.
