Then I remembered what I learned from the game and physics class and remembered \u0027center of mass\u0027. I realized that the way the gemini was designed in the game (not sure if they did this IRL) places the two sets of RCS blocks where they are not equidistant from the capsule\u0027s center of mass. So when the top ones are firing, they may be firing at the same time as the bottom ones, but they\u0027re too far away from CoM and impart rotation. What did was place the two closer and equidistant from the center of mass and the rotation nearly disappeared. I still had to make minor corrections, but it was enough to think \u0022This is lateral movement\u0022 rather than \u0022this is poorly designed rotatational movement\u0022. Still, somehow, even with the original thruster placement I got those puppies docked. I shouted and cheered. I had been working at getting those two joined up for hours (counting previous attempts to get their orbits matched and failing... and one entirely aborted mission). Anyway, if you\u0027re getting too much rotation, try making sure your RCS blocks are equidistant from the center of mass. There\u0027s a button in the VAB (assembly building) that shows a big dot where it is. once you do that and you\u0027re not rotating like crazy, you should be able to get to the other capsule easier. Definitely check out the Gemini mission setup in the wiki and read the docking instructions there. I learned on those. The above video certainly can\u0027t hurt to check out as well. You may have to keep switching back and forth from lateral and rotational movement or just use rotational movement entirely with H and N to go \u0027foward\u0027 and \u0027reverse\u0027 respectively to control your approach. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.
