That is why I like the AKST weaponry. They arent very powerful, especially compared to the GAU19. The smallest one can even have trouble punching through wings, while the heaviest can rip a plane or lightly armoured craft apart, but has a really low ROF, and a metric ****ton of recoil, along with massing a metric tonne. Plus, actually using bullets seems a bit more realistic than just rocket powered railguns and tanks. It also comes with a small unguided missile, which isnt incredibly powerful and only has a 5m blast radius. You still have to manage weapons, and their wieght, but it brings part count down to fun and playable levels, especially considering that you shed not only the parts used to make the weapon, but also the parts used to mount it as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-04T20:38:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2014 08:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Deathsoul097\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camulus777","CreatedById":77385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T20:38:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edepends on the weapon i use missiles that have 8 parts on some of my low part count rovers they are still under 120 parts fully armed. and they are better than most other larger missiles with more parts. not to mention that the missils in the laser mod are auto hit so its very difficult to judge a turn based battle and the RT multi player mods are quite glitchy. the only mod i have considered for weapons is the cannon mod but the shells do very little damage. the other was the gatling cannon but it is way to powerfun and has no ammo limitations.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camulus777","CreatedById":77385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T20:38:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enot to mention that most of the mods dont even work right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camulus777","CreatedById":77385,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T20:40:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei considered the B9 mod too but im worried that and update will ruin the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deathsoul097","CreatedById":77396,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T20:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.

I consider it actually harder to use the AKST weapons, as you have much less control over it\u0027s missiles and guns than the stock weapons that we make, that have to be manually controlled for a decent chance of hitting anything. I dont think any other mods would be nessecary, certainly not B9, except maybe the tracks and LLL. Thos can make some really nice tanks, that look like actual tanks without being 100\u002B parts.
