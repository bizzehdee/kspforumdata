I though of this a while ago and \u003Cstrong\u003Ereally\u003C/strong\u003E wanted to help this game out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy idea would coincide with currency when it is implemented. As you know, you can hire new kerbonauts to replace the ones that you kille- I MEAN sacrificed to the improvement of \u0022SCIENCE!!\u0022. I thought it would be really cool if you could have another \u0022tab\u0022 of sorts to switch between kerbonauts and \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Eengineers\u003C/span\u003E to build you\u0027re fantastic rockets. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make this easier to understand. You have just started a new career mode. You go into the VAB and see that it is empty (no cars transporting items, etc.). You go into the Astronaut Complex to see what\u0027s up. In it, you see you\u0027re normal kerbal astronaut selection. But next to it is a tab that has a wrench icon. You select it and multiple kerbals show up holding various building tools. One is holding a wrench, another holding a blowtorch, etc. You buy one and head back to the VAB. Once inside, he is now walking around lonely in the VAB. At that point you can proceed to build you\u0027re first rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds neat, but it seems a bit bland to just be able to buy new engineers. That is why I came up with some interesting features about buying new engineers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEach individual engineer has various amounts of \u0022kerbal dollars\u0022 you need to purchase them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEach one has thier own purpose. As in each engineer works on their own select area of the rocket to work on.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know SQUAD is the only one who decides what goes into KSP and what doesn\u0027t but I just wanted to pay tribute to this beautiful game they have created. If you actually liked my ideas. try spreading them to convince SQUAD to test this feature out!

While money and science will do a certain amount of work in controlling the size of a rocket for a particular mission, if SQUAD wanted a way to limit the size of the rockets you can build at a given stage of the game in some absolute way (such as mass of the system) this could be implemented by the hiring of ground crew. In simplistic terms, if 10 kerbals can make a 100 ton rocket, then maybe you need 15 to make a 150 ton rocket. Of course to get more ground crew you would have to hire them, bringing about an expenditure of funds (costs money). Depending on how other mechanics work (like the telescope we will need to find the asteroids in the upcomming NASA pack), the space program staffing system could extend to other mechanics as well. More astronomers means faster sky-searching. More scientists means cheaper/faster research, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get the inevitable hatred that will be visited on the idea of a method on forcefully limiting the size of rockets during the campaign, but depending on how SQUAD envisions the campaign actually operating, maybe they want to force players to have to find more efficient ways to package their missions. The campaign mode is not sandbox, it (best my understanding) is not meant to be sandbox with missions. It is a limited sandbox with objectives and goals beyond simply the whim of the player, you can still decide HOW you do a thing within constraints, but not necessarily what you do or when. This manpower system also somewhat helps provide a non-roleplay reason for doing a probe vs a manned mission, which is something people have been complaining about not existing. The probe could carry more science equipment, but it cannot do all the things a manned mission could do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-20T15:29:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease do not get me wrong, I do approve of the idea, but I also have to agree with what else has been posted on here.
