I drew a small storyboard and made some reference to other doge fight videos ( like *Stealth ,ace combat* )  \n  \nIt took me nearly 2 months to finish it, and I found that C4D is a pretty good way to kill time~lol  \n  \nIt still have some bugs, like flares, missiles, ect.I didn\u0027t correct them in the end. Time precious   \n  \n![yl86nhO.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/yl86nhO.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceXray","CreatedById":113396,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T17:56:47Z","Content":"Wow, that was amazing!
