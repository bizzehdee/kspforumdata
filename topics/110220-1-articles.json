Im thinking about a Mothership that goes into orbit and detach a ship that can descent and mine fuel.\n\nI have been trying to make one myself, but my engeneering skill have stopped evolving at lvl 1 ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif). And have not found one to downloade. That is why Im asking you guys to take on the challenge. \n\nMostly stock, but can use Kethane mod (the drill in 1.0 is HUGE). The mods I usually use is ScanSat and Mechjeb. \n\nSorry about my english ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nLove,\n\nPekkur"},{"CreatedByName":"Pekkur","CreatedById":144425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:33:19Z","Content":"I have found one that looked interesting, but I cant get it to work. \n\n[http://imgur.com/oGS5uxx](http://imgur.com/oGS5uxx)"}]}
