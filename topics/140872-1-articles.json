Enter the current date of your savegame under \u0022earliest departure\u0022. Choose your first destination. Make sure you set initial and final orbits (or the fly-by toggle) to match what you\u0027re planning to do, but there\u0027s no need to be overly precise. Select transfer type \u0022optimal\u0022. Let it compute a result. Either accept the result, or choose a different profile from the porkchop plot. In either case, when you\u0027re happy, write down departure and arrival dates, as well as the total dV.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, choose the planet you just went to as the origin, and select the next destination.

Get yourself the next result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRepeat until you have all legs of your journey mapped out. Now, add up all of the dV numbers you calculated. When you build your spaceship, take no less than \u003Cem\u003Ethat plus 10%\u003C/em\u003E. Or if you want to be extra safe, and not follow the plan to the letter, make it plus 25%.
