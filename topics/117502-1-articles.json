Given the the listed characteristics, a 24.449 km orbit should have a period of 1h 1m 12.72s (11:1 resonance with sidereal rotation period). Instead, the actual period of such an orbit is 1h 1m 10s. What is creating the inaccuracy here? Is my math wrong or is one of the values on the wiki bad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EG=6.6739999509529e-11\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EM=2.6457897e19\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er0=6e4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea=24499\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Et=2*pi*sqrt((r0\u002Ba)^3/(GM))=3672.72\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to directly inspect planet characteristics in game/config? I would prefer to have values more accurate than I could gain by experimentation.
