Given the the listed characteristics, a 24.449 km orbit should have a period of 1h 1m 12.72s (11:1 resonance with sidereal rotation period). Instead, the actual period of such an orbit is 1h 1m 10s. What is creating the inaccuracy here? Is my math wrong or is one of the values on the wiki bad?\n\nG=6.6739999509529e-11\n\nM=2.6457897e19\n\nr0=6e4\n\na=24499\n\nt=2\\*pi\\*sqrt((r0\u002Ba)^3/(GM))=3672.72\n\nIs there any way to directly inspect planet characteristics in game/config? I would prefer to have values more accurate than I could gain by experimentation. I changed orbit until I got the desired resonance on Minmus. but I would like to avoid such mishaps in the future.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-03T05:40:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/03/2015 05:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**\n  \nExtend precision to used values"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T05:14:28Z","Content":"You\u0027re suffering from inaccurate GM value to begin with.
