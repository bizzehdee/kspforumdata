When I do that the asteroid\u0027s trajectory appears but the asteroid disappears. I\u0027ve read and watched tutorials on capturing an asteroid and when they track the asteroid is does not disappear. When I go to my ship and select the map then click on an asteroid the only option I have is view in tracking station or something like that. There is no option to track it. In the tutorials they also have the option to track the asteroid. Am I missing something or is there some kind of error going on here or what?\n\nTom\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T13:58:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 01:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ralgh**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralgh","CreatedById":131337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:21:12Z","Content":"Okay I\u0027ve learned something. When I try this in sandbox mode it works as it does in the tutorials. When I try it in science mode I can\u0027t track or target an asteroid. Is this what others are seeing too?\n\nTom"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T16:25:46Z","Content":"Check the bar at the top center of your screen. I get the feeling you\u0027ve turned off the asteroid tracking."},{"CreatedByName":"Ralgh","CreatedById":131337,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T13:58:10Z","Content":"That\u0027s the ticket. I had unknow objects selected but apparently when you start tracking an asteroid it becomes known and then will shoe up with space objects selected. I never noticed that button that is way over......um........right next to the unknown objects button. Oops.\n\nTom"}]}
