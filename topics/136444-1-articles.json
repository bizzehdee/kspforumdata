First, put more control surfaces at the back for better pitch authority. Second, give your main wings some angle of incidence. This is where you angle your wings so that the front is slightly higher than the back, giving them some angle of attack while the rest of the plane is at 0 AoA.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T23:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears you made the ship with the Space Shuttle in mind.

For this purpose, your ship is rather large and heavy, not to mention fuel-inefficient (I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027d get much burn time out of that rocket engine). To fix this, you\u0027re going to want to lighten the load significantly. Use only one or two liquid fuel tanks, and replace the rocket engine with a jet engine. This lets you fly for longer and not have to carry as much fuel, reducing the amount of mass you have to lift (rockets, while very powerful, require that heavy Oxidiser, which is superfluous in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere). I\u0027d also recommend going down to a MK 2 or even MK 1 fuselage, as the MK 3 ones tend to be very large and heavy, useful more for very large ships. Lastly, if I\u0027ve misjudged the mission of your ship and you do want a rocket plane, just let me know and I can revise this advice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving on. For takeoff, I can see three problems from the picture. Firstly, it appears your landing gear are set up such that the nose points down on the runway (or in more aircrafty terms,\u00A0a negative angle of attack). This is a good thing for ships which need to land safely (think the Space Shuttle), but will make lifting off extremely difficult at anything less than super high speeds, as you\u0027ve seen. I suggest using smaller rear landing gear and a larger nose one, which should let the ship sit level on the runway, or even pitch the nose forward. Next, the rocket engine is attached further upwards of your centre of mass; this will produce a negative moment on the runway, and essentially fight any attempts at pitching the nose upwards. Move that down to be more in-line with the centre of mass, or follow my above advice to swap it out for a few smaller jet engines. Lastly, the wings of the ship are quite small as well. The Space Shuttle had small wings as well, but its primary goal was to land, and even with that it behaved like a flying brick, as above. You want larger wings for sure, try experimenting with the structural wings, I find the BigS wings are difficult to use in anything but Shuttle replicas. If you\u0027ve followed all this advice yet you\u0027re still having takeoff problems, add a pair of canards to the nose of the ship. These will have the side-effect of making the ship more manoeuvrable, but they help immensely in getting ships off the runway sooner. They aren\u0027t magic though, and if you just slap canards onto that design it will likely still flip out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gonzxor5","CreatedById":161634,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-09T02:11:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222503554\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136444\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460159380\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002258313\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, CalculusWarrior said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt appears you made the ship with the Space Shuttle in mind.
