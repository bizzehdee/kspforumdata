(it was like I was in the rocket building editor)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut even with 2 parts.... landing gear for example, one would be placed under the wing, where my mouse point was, but the other one would be on top of the wing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndoing wings was even stranger.... I\u0027d line one wing up.... perfectly.... only to find the other wing at some strange angle .... ummm, 1st wing, 90 degrees ... second wing... 110 degrees or whatever...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t the first time its happened to me, so I\u0027m assuming its happened to others...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone?
