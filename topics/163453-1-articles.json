You should have enough background already to be able to sit for the test and have a decent shot at passing.\u00A0 If not, you now know what you are weak in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Assuming you still live at home (and there is nothing wrong with that, it\u0027s a good way to bank cash until you can set out on your own), you should sit down with the parent\u0027s and instead of the ultimatum I believe this really is, have them help you set up a plan to pass the test by the end of the year.\u00A0 Take a practice test, attend classes, get a tutor.\u00A0 Local vocational schools usually run GED prep classes year round-ish.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Once you have identified weaknesses, and you obviously think math is one of them, get a tutor.\u00A0 Local colleges and HS guidance counselors will usually be able to hook you up with a good one.\u00A0 It doesn\u0027t have to be somebody you know.\u00A0 A good tutor can do so much more in a subject than a good teacher in a full classroom.\u00A0 The one on one environment will allow them to help you learn the subjects you are weak in a lot faster than a classroom.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Get a tutor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) Set out some short and mid-term goals.\u00A0 I\u0027m getting the feeling, and I may be way off, so apologies if I am, that you are/were hoping to get by writing for a career?\u00A0 That\u0027s a very admirable goal, we need more creative people in the world.\u00A0 But until you land that big publishing deal, you\u0027ll need to find a way to support yourself.\u00A0 It\u0027s very difficult in today\u0027s world to get any decent job without a diploma or GED.\u00A0 Unskilled production labor pays well enough to raise a family on, and usually leaves plenty of time for family or other pursuits, but they won\u0027t even look at you if you don\u0027t have your GED.\u00A0 Non GED worker\u0027s are usually stuck in minimum wage roles, and you can rarely make ends meet at these wages. \u00A0 So by setting one of your short term goals (6mo - 1 yr) to be getting your GED, you have allowed your self a better chance of having gainful employment in the future.\u00A0 Set some other long term goals to help steer your future too.\u00A0 Perhaps taking a few classes at a local community college that focuses on your writing would be a great mid- term goal (1yr-3yr). \u00A0 Then write down a couple long term goals (3yr\u002B), and create a set of short and mid term goals you\u0027ll need to accomplish to reach that long term goal.\u00A0 By breaking down the big goals into smaller things, they are much easier to accomplish. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7) Get a tutor and study your ass off.\u00A0 If 2 months is all you have, then take a practice test by the end of the week.\u00A0 I\u0027m guessing there has to be quite a few available online.\u00A0 See where you are lacking and study those subjects as hard as you can.\u00A0 There are many free courses available online to help you in your deficiencies.\u00A0 Even if you fail the first time and don\u0027t earn it within the 2 month window, hopefully your parents will understand you applied yourself to passing it, and are very close to doing so in the future and will extend their deadline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood Luck, and get a tutor. \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceception","CreatedById":152800,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-17T02:16:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002264714\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/64714-gargamel/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Gargamel\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I actually fell behind in math, by almost 2 years, because I could never really wrap my head around it, and when I did, it took a little bit to fully click (Don\u0027t know why), and books did Jack to help in that area.
