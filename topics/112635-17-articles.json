That\u0027s what a leisure cruiser sub would look like...if they existed. Does it dovetail with Mk3 parts?\n\nThere\u0027s gobs of guys making military stuff. While I\u0027ll do what I can to help support that side of KSP, the military aspect of this game just isn\u0027t my thing. So yes, it\u0027s intent is to be more of a leisure/exploratory vessel. My parts will always focus on civilian pursuits. I\u0027m sure someone, sooner or later will ask for missile tubes but, I have none planned at the moment. Unfortunately for now (this may change in the future, depending) it\u0027s limited to it\u0027s own parts. You can put a few very small stock or mod parts on it (lights, intakes, etc) without slowing it down too much or affecting it\u0027s buoyancy. But to give you an idea, I put a couple of the big stock RCS tanks on it and it went from 40m/s underwater to being unable to dive without 40 extra tons of weight and then, it\u0027s max speed was 3m/s. So, no, it\u0027ll have it\u0027s own specific size and shape and parts. ATM, most center hull parts are 10m in length with a 5m radius. The bow and stern are a bit longer and some other parts, smaller.\n\nThe sub parts will use, for now, Firespitter buoyancy and (this is gonna be scary guys) a plugin that I\u0027m writing. Since I\u0027m a Pascal and PHP hack and know this much -\u003E\u003C- about C#, stand by to make bug reports.\n\nOnce I get a few more parts finished, I\u0027ll work up a sea-trials video so you can see how it works... and, like my last part pack, I\u0027ll put out a \u0027beta\u0027 to those that read this thread. It\u0027s still a couple of weeks away at best, perhaps longer. There\u0027s a lot of \u0027behind the parts\u0027 work going on with this one.\n\nFor now, some things to expect.\n\n- It will initially have a 2.5 meter rear engine. But, radial engines are also planned. This is so that you can attach a docking port or a stack separator and actually mount it on a rocket.\n- The engines will be entirely electric and will use the Firespitter plugin to work. Without it, no engines. They won\u0027t be quite as power hungry as Firespitter\u0027s prop engines though. One of the things that just annoyed the crap outta me was the fact that you had to use DOZENS of solar panels just to get one of his props to run at half throttle.\n- Since electricity can only be generated by a few things (solar, nukes, rtg\u0027s, etc) the sub will also be equipped with a diesel generator... yep, it produces smoke and runs off LF. Think of it like my paddlewheel stacks except it generates electricity. It\u0027ll generate enough that you can run the single sub engine on it at full throttle and still slowly recharge the batteries.\n- BUT, like a real sub, the generator will only work on the surface and will require an intake. One of the things that the plugin I\u0027m working on will do is, close all intakes once you dive below the surface. Yes, I\u0027m forcing you to think like a submariner.\n- Next issue, this sub, like my boats, will be pretty light. That means, it has a strong potential to fly. Therefore, should you come flying out of the water, the throttle gets shut down. You\u0027ll still be able to \u0027blow the ballast\u0027 and come flying out of the water like a real sub and maybe even fly a short distance depending on your speed, but you\u0027ll come crashing down pretty quick. Not to worry, as soon as you hit the water again, the throttle reengages.\n\nThose are the plans atm. If you have any ideas, I\u0027d love to hear them."},{"CreatedByName":"Fengist","CreatedById":78435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T22:54:34Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ah I did indeed.

Either way this makes me very excited for the near future!\n\nIn that video, I used KerbCam. While it worked for testing purposes, you have to manually move the camera which is a pain. But, you are correct Hooligan Labs was one of several people that worked on underwater cameras. For now, the camera code for the plugin I\u0027m working on is based on the Hooligan Labs code. I managed to find his old sub code with the camera routines. It took some work and there\u0027s a few forehead indentations on my wall but I have it functional. That means, when this sub comes out, it\u0027ll have a rotating camera underwater. It\u0027s not perfect by any means, but it\u0027s a damn sight better than the stock top-down view or a locked-in view with mods like KerbCam.\n\nAs far as the 600m point, once again, you nailed that depth exactly. THAT is a different source of problems. For whatever reason, the instant you hit the 600m depth, KSP goes nuts and begins spamming the hell out of an error. It floods the debugger and loads up the output\\_log.txt with this error for as long as you stay below 600m. Squad is apparently aware of this but, since water is not their thing, have ignored requests to fix it. Hooligan\u0027s solution was to simply crush your vessel should you take it beyond 600m. InfiniteDice\u0027s solution was to turn the area around the sub black and start flashing a warning while also making sub \u0027creaking\u0027 noises. The whole problem with this 600m log spamming is lag. If you have an older machine... lots of lag and a big loss of framerate. You\u0027ve seen my video at depths beyond 600m and it wasn\u0027t bad and I have an ancient AMD quad core. Soooo.....\n\nAs for my intended solution. Thanks to the generosity of Dice, he\u0027s given me a one-off license to use portions of his code. Most importantly, it\u0027s the portion of the code that fixes the fact that there\u0027s no surface to the water when viewed from underneath. His solution is actually genius but not a complete fix. What it does is, it creates a 5km wide lens shaped dome over the vessel and adds fog to it. When you look up or off into the distance, you see a hazy surface. The instant you surface though, the dome vanishes. If you look close, you can see it being used in the video of the \u0027flying sub\u0027. His solution at 550m was to switch from a lens shaped dome to a black ball that surrounds the vessel with I think, a radius of 400m . That was his warning that you were entering the spam depth. And then he flashed a warning on the screen but he let you keep diving if you wished. I plan on much the same approach. One difference is, rather than abruptly switching between the lens and the black dome, I\u0027m working on fading things out to black. The deeper you go, the darker it gets. At 600m, you get a warning that you can turn off in the .cfg file.\n\nThe next issue is thus far, unfixable. At 1,000m, the bottom of the ocean loses it\u0027s solidity and you can pass right through it. While the actual depth may be much deeper, 3,000m\u002B on Laythe, the visible bottom only extends to 1,000m. If you dive beyond 1,000m, things get really, really weird.\n\nBut, if you guys like this sub, the only way these things are going to get fixed is if you become Squad\u0027s squeaky wheel.\n\nSo, there\u0027s a long answer to a short question."},{"CreatedByName":"ThatOneBritishGuy...","CreatedById":144135,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T03:11:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The next issue is thus far, unfixable.

The log spamming may start at different depths on Laythe The 600m one is the one on Kerbin. The camera one is a new one to me. It may be the way you were rotated... dunno. And that\u0027s the trench where I tested the bathysphere when I built it. I couldn\u0027t remember the exact depth and I\u0027m pretty sure you went deeper than I did. But, you found the same results.\n\nWith a moderate machine and decent graphics, the lag isn\u0027t bad. Older machines... laptops... they may have issues.\n\nYou have to admit though, passing though the 1,000m barrier for the first time gave some rather unexpected results.\n\nOh, and I dunno if you tried it but you can actually pass back through the 1,000m mark and surface.\n\nAnd there is a \u0027fix\u0027 if I really want to do it... I can simply force the ship to stop diving at 999m. But I\u0027d rather Squad fix that problem. Finding an anomaly on the bottom of an ocean would be... intriguing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-07T04:59:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2015 04:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Fengist**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T05:01:14Z","Content":"@thatonebritishguy: How come your debug console looks different from the one I have?
