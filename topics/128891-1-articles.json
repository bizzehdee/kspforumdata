The main reason being, once I make a few outer interplanetary flights and return, The game is almost \u0022over\u0022 (in a sense)..All tech is unlocked, and there isn\u0027t much left in the sense of accomplishment to be had. I was wondering if anyone had some interesting (end-game-ish)mods or some interesting goals to reintroduce the excitement? Keep in mind, I\u0027m not talking about making the game harder, (adding life support, etc) Although if that can play into more (fun) feel free to recommend a combination of mods.\u00A0 This game is awesome, I just want more to keep it awesome \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiniMatt","CreatedById":78749,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-30T10:53:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d perhaps reconsider some of the life support mods - RoverDude\u0027s USI mods for example add complexity to the game for sure but do it in a friendly enough way that it doesn\u0027t seem harder as such, just different and gives more a purpose to space exploration.
