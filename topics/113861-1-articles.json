I have 2 ships with KER modules installed, but I do not have KER or any other mod installed in 1.0.3. Newly created career games show the tech tree.

For anyone having this issue, it appears to result from missing a ModuleManager techtree file. Regardless of whether or not your current install is modded, ensure you have modulemanager installed on the new version if you\u0027re moving saves and the previous was modded. It\u0027s apparently not just a parts issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T15:58:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 03:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jodo42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
