(Don\u0027t give me that look, SargeRho already brought the subject up!) Probably not. We\u0027ll almost certainly encounter life on other planets--almost entirely microbes, plants and animals. The universe is 13 billion years old; human evolution took us from that point to our current level of technology in only a few thousand years.

The payload would merely warp a few light-days away from Earth to test the feasibility of such a project.
