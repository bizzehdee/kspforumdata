Just over half a ton and around 380 m/s of delta-V. A transfer stage put it onto a Duna encounter, and then I flew by Duna, Kerbin, Duna, Duna, and Duna. And then ran out of fuel \u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E short of arranging the Jool encounter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWasn\u0027t what I\u0027d call time efficient, I ended up making several orbits waiting for encounters a few times, but still not bad for a first go at this stuff. Despite the fuel blown when setting up the 4th Duna flyby because I didn\u0027t realise I had the navball in surface mode; if I hadn\u0027t done that, I probably would have made Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T03:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJeb had a little mishap on takeoff from the Mun, be SURE you clear the ground if you\u0027re in a crater!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/EO0L6#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
