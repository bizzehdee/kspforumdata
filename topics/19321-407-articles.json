First, I\u0027ve had some luck with attaching parachutes to my aircraft to save at least the crew compartment, short of augering in at speed. The second option would be flying using drone cores, of course. The third option, which I think is the best, long term, is using one of the several mods that allow you to simulate your flight before actually launching. It\u0027s not the same as just reverting, because even if it goes perfectly, you STILL have to redo it. Besides, simulation has been a part of aircraft design since the Wright Brothers\u0027 built a wind tunnel for testing airfoil shapes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I use Kerbal Construction Time, because it has simulations, but they cost money.

To achieve this, keep your centre of lift behind the centre of mass (= mass on nose, wings at tail).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYaw stability is the same as pitch, just for yaw. Add vertical tail wings. Wing sweep also increases yaw stability (60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u002B sweep is fun in that regard)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoll stability leads to your plane\u0027s wings returning to horizontal by themselves. Increase by keeping your CoL above your CoM, and using dihedral effect (-\u0026gt; dihedral wings, wing sweep) (dihedral effect makes your plane roll in the direction you yaw towards - dont add too much)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was some very good tutorial on the forum somewhere (albeit with a very silly font...).

Basically, I\u0027ve decreased fuel tank empty mass and fuel density 2 times, and increased engine gimbal limits to realistic values. Now I\u0027m flying mostly unstable rockets, just like in real life. Engine gimbal, stock SAS, MechJeb ascent trajectories and angle of attack limiting are doing a good job to keep rockets from flipping. One should be careful not to exceed speed tho, usually limiting acceleration to 18m/s until first boosters or first stage separation. It\u0027s still freakin difficult tho, but I like it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most difficult moment is stage separation, as there\u0027s no engine thrust to keep rocket stable at that point.
