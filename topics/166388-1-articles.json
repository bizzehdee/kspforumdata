So the tl;dr is yes it can be done stock, but you\u0027ll have to decide first exaxtly what size in KSP you\u0027d consider a BFR: Mk3, or larger?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the only non-stock item I could think of, based on all I\u0027ve seen here, in the KSP reddit, and Youtube are the landing legs, because there\u0027s none that are big enough--although you could use structural parts or tanks to extend them past the ship\u0027s butt end and extend past the engines (for example, use the cargo bays as engine fairings and mount the legs onto that), and if you\u0027re scaling the ship up to the intended BFR scale the stock legs alone won\u0027t be able to take the weight--you\u0027d be spamming legs otherwise. In that case though, nothing wrong with landing\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0very gently\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Eon the engines if you can manage it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway there have been, at the very least functional recreations, and eben those that capture the BFR profile as well, most I\u0027ve seen on YT and reddit. For those pursuing the Mk3 profile as the BFR size, the cargo ramp makes a nice BFR beak/cargo door. Larger in stock, I\u0027ve seen clustering of fuselages and tanks to achieve BFR-type profiles. To get larger cargo bays than Mk3, one could try combinations of stock fairings and hinges to create a larger-than-stock cargo bay with a swing-out nose door. (Don\u0027t know how to do hinges, sorry, but I think there\u0027s a tutorial somewhere here).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimplest\u00A0Mk3-type profile for the BFR would be the ramp and cargo bay (or the ramp, Mk3 passenger and clipping a Mk2 cockpit for the pax model), fuel tankage (all Mk3 or Mk3 \u002B adapter to 3.75 and tanks), and whatever engines gets you there (usually the larger Size 2s, the Rhino (probably overkill though) and the Vectors, add wing parts on the ventral aft surface. One can probably play with that, adding more tanks or clustering, to get the desired performance (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E= \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E--\u0026gt;Duna surface) out of the ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-11T10:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve got a couple of takes on it, but I\u0027ve yet to test them thoroughly:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QtnIDsB.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QtnIDsB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022BnjVCfS.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/BnjVCfS.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022unDjdlA.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/unDjdlA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, I don\u0027t really like that cocodrile bay door, it doesn\u0027t fit the outline of the crewed version, just the one shot of the thing lunching satellites. So I made a crewed version, and it kinda works better because of the tank/weight distribution being much more sensible than in the real thing. That made the whole aerodynamic balancing act to reenter it belly-first and then flipping it close to the ground, well, much easier with much less wasted weight in wings. In the end, it has the same payload, but it has a crew capsule with abort capability on top, and a lower total weight:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022e1CLrJc.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/e1CLrJc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey are a bit tricky to launch in pure stock, but it is possible to recover the booster without resorting to quicksave-quickload in the same flight, I\u0027ve done it several times now. It just takes a \u0027slightly\u0027 inefficient 4.5km/s launch (meaning I\u0027m wasting around 1km/s), and a lot of switching around at the appropiate time, but hey, fully reusable TSTO ~20mT launcher. Not that I don\u0027t have lighter chemical SSTOs that can do the same thing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is obviously scaled quite a bit down, but you know, KSP scale. I couldn\u0027t fit 31 engines in the first stage, six in the second, and make the staging make sense in kerbal scale, so I took out the outer ring of 12 on the booster, and scaled it to something that fit under the biggest stock tanks, turned out to fit the launch requirements (TSTO) quite well using the humble LV-T45 and 30 as Raptor analogs. The spaceship has the proper number of engines, at least, and the whole thing looks like the BFR if you squint, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.

But, you totally don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E it. The only trick really is to leave the booster with the same-ish apoapsis every time, so you have the same time to put the spaceship on a long (\u0026gt;2min) coast to apoapsis that gives you time to switch back to the booster to land it while that is going on. Basically you just have to remember at which point to stage (I use \u0027500m/s left on that stage\u0027 thanks to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u0027ll have to work out the fuel level for that in order to give the stock flight manual), then do a bunch of steps mechanically each time, with a nail-biting suicide burn required to land the booster. I think I can condense all that into a \u0027simple\u0027 flight manual of no more than ten discrete steps, using stock instrumentation. Note that I\u0027ve never been able to do it without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s suicide burn indicator, that is true, but I guess if you are Scott Manley and/or I work out the exact height to start it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.
