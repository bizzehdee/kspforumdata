I had the problem with the pod rockets having their thrustVector really off. So I opened them up in blender and fixed the incorrect angle. I also made a cargo variant with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E that has no Kerbals, a probe module and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E Inventory. This is basically like the dragon cargo variant. I also changed the textures so the windows are not glass, they are the hull colour, looks kinda cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot sure what the rules area as I know this is someone else\u0027s work but I fixed the problem I see a few people have had and would be great if people could use these pods again... maybe its worth me sharing the files?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: This is in the latest version of KSP BTW\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-21T14:52:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/21/2018 02:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 21, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by thevegimobil\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-21T15:00:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSeem that the license allows forking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thevegimobil","CreatedById":42804,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-21T15:05:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea how licenses work, sorry.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI take from what you said: it allows the editing of the original content and sharing of such edits?
