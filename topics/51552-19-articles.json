The logical approach is to place a single relay in a geo-stationary orbit (2868.75km) above the KSC. In theory, this lone sat would always be in contact with the KSC and could therefore be used to relay signals to more distant sats. The reality of KSP is that even geostationary sats drift. There is no station keeping in KSP and orbits can never be made truly perfect. The most logical approach to overcoming this problem is to fly multiple geo-stationary relays so that at least one will be over the KSC at any given moment. Again, good in theory but bad in practice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a formation of relays at 700km orbits. Each has only a communitron 32 and a dipole used for launch. The formation isn\u0027t perfect, but does provide total coverage. Note the equilateral triangle formed by three of the relays. Theoretically, three relays in 700km orbits would provide total coverage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fzh9AfY.png\u0022 alt=\u0022fzh9AfY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here is that same formation after a couple years worth of warping. Note the dead area in the lower left. These relays are at 700km but the same would happen at 2868.75km, just more slowly.

They now have a very low periapsis (80km\u002B/-) and high apoapsis (3000km \u002B/-). Their orbital speeds vary from around 560m/s at apoapsis to 3000m/s at periapsis. This means most of their time is spent loitering high over Kerbin, where they are best able to act as relays to the KSC. I have also left a couple sats in their initial 700km orbits to act as links between the Molniyas. Because orbits are stable in KSP, there is no clumping. Each relay remains clearly separated in its respective orbit. This basic formation should give you 99.9999% uptime for probes out to 5000km, the max range of the communitron 32.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart II - Dishes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith our network of molniya relays in place we can conduct operations near kerbin without issue, but are limited by the range of our omnidirectional antennas. Anything beyond 5000km will require dishes. Dishes come in various sizes, appearing at various points in the tech tree, but I\u0027m going to assume everyone is playing in sandbox mode. A single sat with a big dish might be enough, but Mun presents a problem. From the perceptive of a deepspace probe, a single sat can easily be blocked by Mun. There are a couple options to deal with this. We could use a polar molniya-type orbit, throwing a relay sat high above Mun\u0027s orbital plane, but a single sat is still too easily blocked. The answer is two sats in perpendicular polar orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuild something like this... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cUN7XHX.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cUN7XHX.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key parts are a single big dish, a communictron 32, and enough equipment to keep them powered 24/7.

Then head back to the KSC and ready a second, identical, relay sat. Wait until the KSC rotates 90* away from the orbit of the first sat before launch.

The logical approach is to place a single relay in a geo-stationary orbit (2868.75km) above the KSC. In theory, this lone sat would always be in contact with the KSC and could therefore be used to relay signals to more distant sats. The reality of KSP is that even geostationary sats drift. There is no station keeping in KSP and orbits can never be made truly perfect. The most logical approach to overcoming this problem is to fly multiple geo-stationary relays so that at least one will be over the KSC at any given moment. Again, good in theory but bad in practice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a formation of relays at 700km orbits.

They now have a very low periapsis (80km\u002B/-) and high apoapsis (3000km \u002B/-). Their orbital speeds vary from around 560m/s at apoapsis to 3000m/s at periapsis. This means most of their time is spent loitering high over Kerbin, where they are best able to act as relays to the KSC. I have also left a couple sats in their initial 700km orbits to act as links between the Molniyas. Because orbits are stable in KSP, there is no clumping. Each relay remains clearly separated in its respective orbit. This basic formation should give you 99.9999% uptime for probes out to 5000km, the max range of the communitron 32.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart II - Dishes\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerekL1963","CreatedById":57091,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T04:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk... version 1.2.1 does not appear to play nicely at all.

KSP\u0027s math isn\u0027t perfect during high warps. The little simplifications add up. Geo-stationary may look pretty, but just isn\u0027t worth the effort. Anything that requires maintenance defeats the purpose. And if you are playing under career mode, the low-power engines necessary to perfect an orbit aren\u0027t available when you need them.
