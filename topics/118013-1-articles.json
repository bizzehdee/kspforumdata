I can make simple programs.\n\nNow, I liked 0.90. I hated 1.anything.\n\nI want to make it as Beta/Alpha like as possible.\n\nBut atmosphere curve, since I am not a squad dev, I have no idea how it works.\n\nThis is an actual snippet from the Ion Engine CFG. (Not sure it\u0027s the right acronym):\n\n*atmosphereCurve*\n\n *{*\n\n *key = 0 4200* [Probably Isp]\n\n *key = 1 100* [Percentage engine power in space?]\n\n *key = 1.2 0.001* [Percentage engine power at sea lvl?]\n\nNow, I have this idea. But I\u0027m not sure, and don\u0027t want to risk Ion engine in space too."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T12:38:26Z","Content":"The keys are simply points on the imaginary graph that the line must cross at a given X value, X representing atmospheric pressure.\n\nAt 0 atmospheres (space), the Isp is 4200;\n\nAt 1 atmosphere (Kerbin sea level), the Isp is 100;\n\nAt 1.2 atmospheres (something one may encounter on Eve or Jool), the Isp is 0.001.\n\nPresumably the curve continues past this point, so on the surface of Eve the ion engine will have an Isp extremely close to zero, or if not, it\u0027ll at least be useless at 0.001.\n\nThe curve determined by this set of keys, coupled with KSP 1.0\u0027s behavior of making fuel consumption constant, is the reason that vacuum engines are weak on the ground and hardly anything works at all on Eve."}]}
