There are 7 requirements to complete this contract which include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Put your station in orbit of Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Build a new station that has an antenna, docking port, and can generate power\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Have a facility supporting at least six Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Have a research lab at the station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Have a viewing cupola at the station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Have 2000 units of ore in your station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Maintain stability for 10 seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll requirements have been fulfilled except for the second one, and I think it has something to do with the antenna, which is on the rear docked module of the ship on the right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe antenna was the only component listed in the second requirement that wasn\u0027t included in the first module. It was new, it had a docking port, and it could generate power, but no antenna. I\u0027m wondering if the second requirement isn\u0027t being fulfilled because the antenna wasn\u0027t included in the original module. But wait, other requirements such as having a research lab, and a facility supporting at least six Kerbals also weren\u0027t included in the original module, yet they are in fact fulfilled in the contract list. There seems to be some sort of a contradiction going on here. Yes, it\u0027s a little confusing to say the least, which is why I think it could be some sort of a bug. I can\u0027t think of any other explanation for why the second requirement wouldn\u0027t be fulfilled. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would greatly appreciate any insight, feedback, or suggestions from the KSP community on this issue. Is this likely a bug? Any suggestions for a workaround? The only solution I can think of is to relaunch the first module with an antenna on it... which would be dumb and frustrating. That\u0027s an expensive launch to essentially put an antenna into orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-03T20:28:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2015 08:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dragonsqrrl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:24:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou mention a \u0022first module\u0022, was this a new vessel or did you add bits to an existing station?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station has to be brand new, you cannot reuse one you launched previously.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dragonsqrrl","CreatedById":145608,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T20:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, it was new. \u0022It was new, it had a docking port, and it could generate power\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImage of the ship in orbit.
