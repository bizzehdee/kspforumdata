One big issue is that my engines are burning out long before my fuel is used up and I\u0027m not sure why.

Atlas uses a stage-and-a-half design, where the booster engines (LR-89) are jettisoned 133 seconds into flight, while the sustainer engine (LR-105) carries the payload into orbit. If you\u0027re not jettisoning the booster engines, you\u0027re exceeding their rated burn time and causing engine failures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
