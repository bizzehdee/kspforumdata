I am running into an issue of cpu fan ramps up on \u0022loading asset bundle\u0022. I play through steam launcher and with steam\u0027s FPS monitor running during this part of loading the game the frames will jump up above 3,000 FPS. I have checked for networks but have none to disable, fresh install on a lan only pc. If a parts list for this computer is needed just let me know. any idea would be helpful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T11:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174748-soberone/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022174748\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/174748-soberone/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@soberone\u003C/a\u003E, this isn\u0027t a known issue so anything I suggest is going to be guesswork, but if KSP is loading then I wouldn\u0027t worry about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the asset bundle loading the png images that make up the KSPedia are being imported by the Unity game engine, this has been reported to be very slow (half an hour or more) for some players if they have \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E networks, used or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLoading png images is a cpu intensive process on Windows, it may be due to the codecs used.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe high fps I would be suspicious of being accurate, there\u0027s almost nothing occurring graphically during loading that would cause your gpu to struggle, so I suspect you have v-sync disabled, either way this wouldn\u0027t cause any harm.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest you enable v-sync to keep the fps in check, but other than that I don\u0027t think there is much to worry about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dafni","CreatedById":149636,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-09T12:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222949769\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156173\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486641260\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002216426\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sal_vager\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 minutes ago, sal_vager said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuring the asset bundle loading the png images that make up the KSPedia are being imported by the Unity game engine, this has been reported to be very slow (half an hour or more) for some players if they have \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E networks, used or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInteresting.

Key reason I mentioned the FPS jump was more for others who might see a similar action happen. My current load time for KSP is about 40 seconds, so even if stressing hardware (which isn\u0027t the case), it isn\u0027t long enough to do any real harm. Proof a proper heat sink is a valuable tool in a custom build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
