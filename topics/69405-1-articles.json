The part I don\u0027t agree with is where regex is insisting on putting readme, license, and changelog flat into the folder above gamedata, which is your KSP\u0027s main folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I install a mod, I want that mod\u0027s files in a folder NAMED FOR that mod, not in the root KSP folder where they\u0027ll get clobbered by the next mod I install.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you insist on having none of those files in GameData, then the alternative proposed should not make them all name clash with each other and clobber each other like what regex showed would do. If there\u0027s some reason you don\u0027t want them under GameData/mod-name, then this would be a better suggestion - to still keep them under SOMETHING named \u0027mod-name\u0027 to keep all the readme\u0027s and so on separate from each other:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003Egamedata\u003Cbr\u003E  \u0060-- mod\u0027s name\u003Cbr\u003E         \u0060-- Plugin\u003Cbr\u003E         \u0060-- PluginData\u003Cbr\u003E         etc\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003Cbr\u003Emodfiles\u003Cbr\u003E  \u0060-- mod\u0027s name\u003Cbr\u003E         \u0060-- readme.txt\u003Cbr\u003E         \u0060-- changelog.txt\u003Cbr\u003E         \u0060-- license.txt\u003Cbr\u003E         \u0060-- source (if present)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting them in the directory one step up from gamedata, like regex suggested, means you only have the readme.txt of the most recently installed mod, it having clobbered the previously installed mod\u0027s readme.txt\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-17T04:22:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2014 04:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 17, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-17T04:28:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf I lived in this imaginary universe you\u0027re referring to where those files don\u0027t matter I\u0027d agree with you.
