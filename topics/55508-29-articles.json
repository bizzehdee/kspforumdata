Suffice it to say it reports that kerbals are being mapped properly.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see the head textures that are explicitly assigned to a kerbal are selected properly. Corwin has the \u0022fair\u0022 head (yellow), BillyBobTrey has the \u0022bald old\u0022 head (orange), Roddas has the \u0022old\u0022 (violet), Samsel has the \u0022kerbalHead\u0022 (green), while Loeny has the \u0022kerbalHead02\u0022 (blue). [if you need me to do this with texture patterns instead of colors to see the difference I would be happy to go and take another screenshot.] \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the rest of the \u0022DEFAULT\u0022 kerbals are using a random assortment of heads from the \u0022excludedHeads\u0022 list, which to me seems broken. Out of curiosity I removed the \u0022old01\u0022 texture from the prohibited list and ran the test again. Same results. I also tested by setting the above \u0022DEFAULT\u0022 kerbals to \u0022GENERIC.\u0022 This produced the results I expected from \u0022DEFAULT\u0022 when the \u0022old01\u0022 texture was not in the excluded list, but when all heads were excluded it went back to the \u0022pick a random head\u0022 logic, which again seems broken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, unless I\u0027m mistaken, there is currently no way to force Kerbals to use the stock KSP head texture while using any custom head textures. This was something that worked a couple version back, otherwise I would just write it off as \u0022normal\u0022 and not a bug. If all heads are excluded from random assignment, I feel like it should default back to the KSP texture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for looking at this, whether it\u0027s a bug or just a misunderstanding on my part. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: If you\u0027d like these exact texture files to work from in reproducing I can upload them and post a link.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Skull","CreatedById":103510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-10T19:05:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to include a \u0022Normal\u0022 file in the file categories so they all go in one place?
