And came up with a 1.4 million ton rocket. FAR hates me, but its just the first stage. I will add 2nd stage and fairing later. For now, Ill take a break. This caused several crashes today from the thrust plates. I changed the attach rules instead."},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T21:21:09Z","Content":"Eh, I\u0027m sure Whackjob\u0027s built bigger! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nNevertheless, that is a magnificently huge rocket, well done!

And there is a massive issue with ksp freaking out and killing itself. As in, corrupting every craft file, making it impossible to build things,and forcing your hands at a reinstall. Plus you gotta click a lot for the thing to get to the size its at. Such as this which is 100 meters long and 200 meters tall. \n\nCheers!"},{"CreatedByName":"ghostbuzzer7","CreatedById":138096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T01:56:12Z","Content":"**\\*Builds giant rocket and launches it\\* \\*KSP is not responding\\* \\*KSP must close due to an error\\* \\*Checks crash report\\* \\*It says \u0022STOP BUILDING HUGE ROCKETS YOUR 1 GB OF DDR2 RAM CAN\u0027T SAVE YOU... end crash report\\*** ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) **That is one huge rocket you got there.**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T02:00:28Z","Content":"Anyone remember the BFE?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T02:20:38Z","Content":"Moved to the craft sharing and showing section."},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T03:04:26Z","Content":"Pretty sure this has everything anyone could ever hope to build beat in terms of absurdly huge:\n\n![Yrh4Slw.png](http://i.imgur.com/Yrh4Slw.png)\n\n Those engines on the bottom are called BFE-5000s.
