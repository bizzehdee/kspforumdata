It has an oxygen atmosphere (as others have suggested) and a blue color. The planet orbits in a slightly elliptical orbit. It has a ring system relatively close to the planet. As for size, it could be smaller than Jool (but still much bigger than Eve or Kerbin), especially if the big GP2 is implemented. It has a moon system, and each moon has its own extremely unique or difficult features. Azuria is in a 15 degree inclined orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Jebland - Formerly known as \u0022Aykd\u0022 (ARE YOU KIDDING, DUDE?, pronounced \u0022ayked\u0022 with the \u0022ay\u0022 rhyming with \u0022day\u0022), this moon orbits just kilometers above where the atmosphere of Azuria starts. Named for the Kerbal most likely to follow the moon in its orbit, Jeblandis the size of Gilly, but very dense and tidally locked. It\u0027s almost impossibly dense composition prevents it from being torn apart by tidal forces (although re-entry is fairly imminent.) Nevertheless, the moon is stretched into a prolate spheroid. It has no apparent north or south pole, but rather \u0022towards\u0022 and \u0022away\u0022 poles, as its true north and south poles are on the \u0022equator.\u0022 The \u0022towards\u0022 pole always faces Azuria. Jebland is in a highly inclined orbit, so you had better maneuver in advance to get to this place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Fissure - This icy moon is between the sizes of Duna and Kerbin and is the second-largest moon of the Azuria system. in a highly elliptical, steeply inclined orbit. It has a Kerbin-like atmospheric pressure, but the atmosphere is NOT oxygen. It is thought to have been a captured object, much like the real-life Triton. It doesn\u0027t get in the way of existing moons, but it is thought to have destroyed all moons that have dared get near its orbit, causing craters where the ice is gone, exposing the rock below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moon was likely created in a foreign land in the early days of the Kerbol system as a binary planet, where one was captured by Azuria and one was ejected from the Kerbol A system in a manner similar to Triton. The water on the surface was liquid due to the high concentration of decaying radioactive elements, but today, radiation heat is minimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to its close apporoaches to Azuria, it experiences high tidal forces, causing stress in the icy surface. It also rotates quickly - it never has been tidally locked to Azuria and seems to not be slowing down. The planet bulges a little at the equator. The icy surface has cracked near the equator to form a series of fissures, giving the moon its name.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Nada - This moon is next to nothing. It is literally smaller than Gilly. However, it literally orbits Fissure in a polar orbit, making it the first moon-of-a-moon. Nada is tidally locked to Fissure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Rubble - A large captured asteroid, this very elliptically-orbiting moon\u0027s apoapsis coincided with Azuria\u0027s ancient outer ring system. The new moon coalesced material from this ring, which disappeared over millions of years, only leaving a wide \u0022asteroid belt\u0022 of small objects whose orbits were perturbed by Rubble. The asteroid\u0027s formation gave it its name - it is a \u0022rubble pile\u0022 and has a white and grey appearance from the ice, rocks, and dust that fell upon it. Since Rubble finished forming, a small, fast body has crashed into it, leaving a crater which shows Rubble\u0027s old, brown surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Solo - This moon is known as the loneliest moon of all. It is Kerbin-sized and lies at the very edge of Azuria\u0027s SOI. It has a thin atmosphere that has no oxygen, but the gravity is... wait for it... 2.5 times Kerbin\u0027s. It doesn\u0027t disturb the inner moons due to sheer distance. Solo orbits above Azuria\u0027s equator. Jebediah has considered using it to assist in throwing his ships around the Azurian system with little concern for the safety of the Kerbonauts inside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Erif- This Duna-sized planet orbits so close to Kerbol that the star fills most of the sky. It is tidally locked and has a slightly eccentric orbit. The planet\u0027s day side is covered in lava, but has islands of very tough rock - it essentially resembles a lava version of Laythe. The molten rock ends just behind the terminator, where there are spotty islands which intermittently heat and cool due to the libration of the planet. Engines on the day side will overheat quickly, and any part that touches the lava will overheat rapidly. A kerbal who touches the lava will die. The planet\u0027s night side is very cold, due to the lack of a substantial atmosphere to distribute heat (in KSP, this means no atmosphere.) Tidal forces crack the surface the surface wherever solid ground exists, the far side, and there are also several impact craters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
