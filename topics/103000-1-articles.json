When flying SSTOs as their ascent profile requires significant time in the upper atmosphere, you often get the \u0022re-entry\u0022 effects when throttling up. When this happens, I get a massive stutter. Not just a framerate drop, but a period of 1 second of 60fps and then 1 second of lockup. Repeat ad infinitum until one is out of the atmosphere or until frustration. Not running -force-openGL, but I could if that would help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KristopherKerblumbus","CreatedById":132207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T16:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnybody have any ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T19:00:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease provide your logs Kristopher, the stickies show where to find them, we may need your dxdiag as well, your settings.cfg and the craft file you are using \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KristopherKerblumbus","CreatedById":132207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T21:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give all that--but I thought logs only did good when there were crashes...I\u0027m not crashing, just having performance issues.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KristopherKerblumbus","CreatedById":132207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T02:26:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDXDiag: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/WnkPxXGY\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/WnkPxXGY\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esettings.cfg: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/uz4gCH1D\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/uz4gCH1D\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft files: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.sendspace.com/file/n7t5oi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.sendspace.com/file/n7t5oi\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KristopherKerblumbus","CreatedById":132207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T19:14:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnybody?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
