True mods do things like add parts that aren\u0027t in the stock game. Of course, most of the craft files on Spaceport use parts from mods, so you have to get those mods to use the craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut bear in mind that it\u0027s pretty hard to design a general-purpose craft of any type in KSP, rovers included. Rovers range from simple Kerbal-movers to complex cranes, mining units, and mobile bases. What\u0027s good for 1 purpose will suck at or be unable to do some other purpose. If all you\u0027re trying to do is move Kerbals around, you can make such a rover out of 10 parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E1x 2m square flat structural panel\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E4x of the small rover wheels, 1 at each corner\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E1x RTG to power the wheels\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E1x low-power headlight\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E2x command seats\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E1x small probe core (for SAS stability and so you can drive it without Kerbals aboard)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
