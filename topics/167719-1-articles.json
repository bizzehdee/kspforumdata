I built a few simple jets just for fun. I noticed that when I switch between them while they are on the ground, they will pop up in the air, usually resulting in an explosion or flipping of the aircraft. I noticed it also happens when a vehicle on the ground comes into physics range (the grounded aircraft will jump with no effect on the aircraft in flight). Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere is a screen shot of my GameData folder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/CDeIk\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/CDeIk\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
