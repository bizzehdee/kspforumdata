It works for the first few sets of boosters but for the later stages i found you would need to warp the boosters to the ground and unload them or handle recovering them before you reach the height when the ground collider gets removed by the game(i think its around 50000-70000m) or the boosters will drop through the surface and explode. But it really looks cool seeing the boosters float to the ground while your ship ascends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps if youre going this path you could change the color of the vessel marker for the boosters to reflect that they are being handled by the plugin.

They weren\u0027t supposed to be a full test run of the mission, because that should itself be a mission. If you know that you\u0027re going to run out of fuel right after capturing at the Mun, then where\u0027s the fun in building a rescue mission?! I\u0027ll think about it, but I\u0027d rather not let you simulate an ENTIRE mission. An hour of game time (starting after launch, not when its put on the pad, so you can still timewarp for weeks) is enough to get into orbit and test things, even setup a transfer to another planet but not actually execute the encounter. Without manually making a backup of the save, I can\u0027t allow switching to another vessel as the \u0022Revert to Vehicle Assembly\u0022 function no longer works when you do. I may have to go this route anyway if I make it timed, because I have no idea what docking would do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for launches starting on the pad, this is something I was thinking about, but I decided that the functionality of moving the ship to another location was outside the scope of this mod. Should simulations go to a timed method, using HyperEdit to transfer into orbit around another body would work just fine without any issues. Then you could test landers/transfer vehicles/aerobraking/etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shader idea is interesting. I have no idea how to actually implement it though. Currently a window pops up when you start a simulation stating the end conditions. If I move to a timed method then I will put a clock with the amount of remaining time on the screen. That should be more than enough to remind you that its a simulation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the build list, both of those ideas are things I\u0027m planning on implementing. I want to make it so you can change the order in which vessels are built, so if you\u0027re half way through one ship and then REALLY need a new ship finished you can just put it at the top of the list and the old ship will stop building but keep its progress. When vessels are finished they\u0027ll be placed in a \u0022Warehouse\u0022 where they will stay until you launch them. That way you can always have things in the build list even if you won\u0027t need them for a while. The warehouse will have a limited size (which will increase as you progress through the tech tree), so you can\u0027t just fill it with a bunch of ships you\u0027ll never use. You\u0027ll be able to remove ships from the build list and warehouse and if you remove them from the warehouse their parts will be added to the part inventory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry if it sounds like I\u0027m shooting down your ideas :/ They\u0027re all pretty good, so thank you for the suggestions!

Perhaps with a special progressbar for refuelling. Perhaps this could be used on standard builds too after the construction is complete) i realize this is very similar to recycling but if you think about it its really very applicable to ssto\u0027s etc. This option would only be available to vessels with a command module ofcourse so it cant be done with boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* i like the idea of sequential building. But perhaps limited parallel construction could be researched.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* perhaps in a future version you could tie in with the vesselview plugin or use repurpose code from it to get a wireframe view of the vessel as its assembled from the ground and up (this would be cool tho probably hard to impliment, thats why i said perhaps and in a future version:P)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther ideas: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* now that squad is making the official contracts id suggest implimenting cost to the construction process when 0.24 is released and we know how that system is going to work.

A lot of what is fun with this game is the guesswork with the process after the launch.

So a 5 day SSTO will take 12 hours to build. This is to simulate refuelling and refurbishing of the vessel.

I have gotten to the Mun in less than 2 hours though, but it requires a lot of deliberation. The way simulations were implemented in Pre-Release 1 had it end when apoapsis \u0026gt; 250km or periapsis \u0026gt; 70km but that didn\u0027t let you test things in orbit.

Then if you really wanted them to work one way or the other, you could make a small change to the time limit. 15 minutes would probably work just fine for getting into orbit/small amounts of testing. 2 hours (maybe 1 hour) would be the default.

My major concern with contracts is that they\u0027ll have time limits like 3 hours (from now) to send a satellite into orbit or land on the Mun in 2 days, where the time limits this mod imposes makes it impossible to satisfy those conditions. 5 years to Jool would still be doable when your ship takes 10 days, but I may have to try to rework the time limits of the early game contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-15T17:46:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/15/2014 05:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"curiousepic","CreatedById":60039,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T16:50:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETime spent in Simulation mode could add time to build for the actual ship, representing time spent in testing... not sure if that could actually be tracked if you change the craft though...?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MasseFlieger","CreatedById":74250,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T21:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a great idea and I cant wait for the build list, just wanted to add my suggestion to a couple of your outstanding questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. building order in build list: rather than decide a sequential vs parallel build order, you could setup a system that would be able to build sequentially (FIFO - first in first out) with the ability to pause a build in the sequence - there by still able to influence the order in a way. Another approach, would be to implement a priority to the ship under construction, with a time penalty added depending on the amount of ships in progress; say for every additional ship addded to the list, a x% would be added to every ships ETA for completion... this could also add to the immersion of scheduling projects/launches, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Regarding the simulation, I typically always default to giving the option to the user, you can add a prompt for the user to select a timer (and/or parameters to end the simulation - time, altitude, similar to mission controllers mod) or to run the simulation under the flight is reverted or recovered. - You could enforce a reversal of the flight regardless to prevent simulations being used to bypass build times, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust 2 cents, either way this is a great mod, and a wonderful idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magico13","CreatedById":73338,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T00:12:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MasseFlieger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MasseFlieger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebuild sequentially (FIFO - first in first out) with the ability to pause a build in the sequence \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe method I\u0027m gonna use for the first incarnation of the build list (it\u0027s coming along nicely now btw, but is still very primitive and not totally functional. It may take until next weekend to get something that doesn\u0027t completely suck) only adds progress to the first ship in the respective build list (VAB and SPH each have their own), but you can cancel any ship and you can move any ship to the top of the list, thereby pushing the others down one slot. Any progress is kept when ships get moved around. You can completely reorganize the list with some clever usage of the \u0022TOP\u0022 button. Later incarnations (possibly in the next release) will let you move things up and down more precisely (up/down buttons instead of just going to the top, possibly keeping the top button though). When tech tree implementation is added, I want to allow the second or third ships in the list to also gain progress at a lower rate (with the rate increasing from 0 with more tech tree nodes. The VAB list would be dependent on the rocket construction nodes, while the SPH list would be dependent on plane part nodes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MasseFlieger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MasseFlieger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can add a prompt for the user to select a timer (and/or parameters to end the simulation - time, altitude\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes a lot of sense.

Since simulations are supposed to not take any real time in world, I can\u0027t have the time be one to one. But perhaps completing a simulation (with certain conditions) would give you a 5% reduction in build time or something like that. That\u0027s something for later down the road I think though and may tie in well with letting the user choose restrictions (the more restrictive the bigger the bonus?). Alternatively, simulations may actually take MORE time since you won\u0027t be blindly flying a ship for the first time, unaware of its flaws. For now, simulations are there to give back the stock ability to test fly a craft and revert to fix it, since this mod eliminates that ability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA sneak peak at what I\u0027m working on.
