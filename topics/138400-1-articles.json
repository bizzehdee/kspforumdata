The material of the leg can flex, but that would be a suspension with a pretty hard curve. There would be a combination of both that you could simplify but for games sake, rigid looking wheel -\u0026gt; no suspension as you would not expect it to have one\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-28T23:59:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2016 11:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by NikkyD\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kmMango","CreatedById":109375,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T02:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice to see you complaining again.

Not just for personal preference in playstyle (though that is very much valid), but also because we have a finite selection of landing gear but a near infinite variety of plane designs. I like a certain amount of stiffness in the suspension, and I\u0027ve found that some designs are too soft with a smaller gear and too stiff with the next larger one. So even if the defaults were well suited to my preference, there would still be designs where they didn\u0027t work well for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
