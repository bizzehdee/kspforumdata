This can cause a severe thrust imbalance, which is likely the cause of your tumbling at 10k (when the air starts to get too thin for them to work in air breathing mode with your ascent profile and intake number).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect you would notice much better results if you just dropped the air intakes, and even better if you switched to LV-T45s or LV-T30s, or even aerospikes or LV-909s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to make use of the rapier\u0027s air breathing, you should be using them in air breathing mode right from the start (have them activate at the same time as the mainsail), they are ridiculously efficient in air breathing mode.

It keeps everything in-line and almost entirely symmetrical. As you\u0027ve already found, this keeps the craft balanced and makes it a whole lot easier to fly. The fuel budget is fairly tight, so it may need some practice to get to orbit, but it will get there. I\u0027ll have a think about a more forgiving design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine choice. The Mainsail has bags of thrust but isn\u0027t terribly efficient. That makes it a decent choice for a main engine, since you need plenty of thrust to get the fully fueled rocket off the launch pad. In contrast, the Poodle is efficient but has relatively poor thrust. It\u0027s a good second stage engine for both reasons - the second stage engine is pushing a much lighter rocket so doesn\u0027t need enormous amounts of thrust, and a high efficiency second stage minimises the amount of fuel that the first stage needs to lift. Finally, the LV909 is a deliberately small engine since it\u0027s only going to be used to finish your climb to orbit, and for orbital maneuvering. Again, high efficiency good, high thrust not required.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: The Poodle is not generally regarded as the best choice stats-wise, but it makes for a much simpler design (as it\u0027s sized to fit with the other Rockomax parts), and I personally find that it gives a nice flight profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPossible modifications.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a more general workhorse craft for orbital operations, you could try the following steps: 1. Strip out the decoupler between your capsule and Service Module. This is primarily included for aesthetics, so that you can deorbit your crew behind a heat shield. However, unless you\u0027re using realism mods, there is no atmospheric heating to take into account, so deorbiting the capsule and service module together is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Swap out the relatively heavy solar panels for lighter ones. 3. Replace the XL parachute with a docking port, 4. Add a pair of radially mounted parachutes to the capsule. 5.
