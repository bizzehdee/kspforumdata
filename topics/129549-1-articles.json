Kethane aren\u0027t misled, I shall now ennumerate the multiple failings of Kethane:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E1.\u00A0 Kethane Locations:\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0 Kethane draws a hex grid over the planet, then randomly fills in these hexes with some amount of Kethane or none at all.\u00A0 The Kethane locations pay no attention whatsoever to the terrain features of the planet so it is highly, highly likely that most of it will be in inaccessible locations, especially on Laythe.\u00A0 I\u0027ve had games where there wasn\u0027t a drop of Kethane anywhere above sea level.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare to Karbonite which has at least a trace amount everywhere and the concentrations are based on the planet\u0027s biomes and terrain features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E2.\u00A0 Scanning:\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0 First off, Kethane won\u0027t scan in the background, you have to be focused on the scanning ship the entire time.\u00A0 And the scanners only work reliably up to about 100x warp at most planets.\u00A0 At 1000x warp, you only scan about 10% of the hexes you pass over.\u00A0 Furthermore, the scanner unrealistically\u00A0only scans a path 1 hex wide regardless of altitude.\u00A0 Thus, to scan the most hexes in a given amount of gametime, you\u00A0need the highest orbital velocity, which means being as low as possible, where you can\u0027t warp very much anyway.\u00A0 So you had a choice.\u00A0 You could put 1 scanner on the ship, fly just above the terrain or atmosphere, go at 50-100x warp at most, and keep your focus on that 1 ship for like 4-6 real hours to scan the planet, but this would only consume a week or 2 of gametime.\u00A0 Or you could make this huge, expensive probe with a dozen scanners (and their required power) on it, and put it high enough to warp 1000x or even 10000x, and get the job done in a few REAL minutes but it might take a year or even a decade of game time.\u00A0 This is because each individual scanner only be working at 10% (1000x warp) or 1% (10Kx warp) so you\u0027d miss a lot on each orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare this to Karbonite (or Ore when using SCANsat), which scans with 100% efficiency at any warp level IN THE BACKGROUND and the width of the scanned strip realistically varies with altitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E3.\u00A0 LImited Resources:\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0 There\u0027s only so much Kethane in any deposit and it\u0027s not very much.\u00A0 Once\u00A0you mine it all, it\u0027s gone forever.\u00A0 Basically, you can only use the average Kethane deposit a few times before it\u0027s used up.\u00A0 IOW, you can\u0027t base large-scale, long-term colonies on it.\u00A0 It\u0027s only really good to extend the range of exploration ships.\u00A0 Now, while in real life, there\u0027s only so much oil in the ground, it\u0027s still enough to fuel a global industrialized economy for a long time and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\u00A0 At the scale of even massive KSP consumption, resource depletion\u00A0is unrealistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCompare this to Karbonite and Ore that last forever (at least on planets---asteroirds are consumable).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E4.\u00A0 Violation of Conservation of Mass:\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0 When you refine Kethane, you create mass as Kethane weighs less than the amount of LFO it converts into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing Kethane has going for it that Ore doesn\u0027t have is engines and electrical generators that burn it directly without

they created a half baked Kerbal class and leveling system that to this day doesn\u0027t work and is completely unbalanced.\u00A0 They wanted to add something to justify the existence of Engineers because they didn\u0027t have one.\u00A0 They chose very poorly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that the Kerbal class system is\u00A0thoroughly\u00A0unworkable and should be either completely scrapped or replaced with something a lot better (for which there have been many good suggestions).\u00A0 But I disagree that mining was the reason for the engineer class because the class system happened before mining.\u00A0 And originally, the engineers were the only ones with any real use because they could fix flat tires and repack chutes.\u00A0 Having them influence mining and refining came later IIRC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut in any case, uncrewed mining is totally\u00A0possible, it just takes longer.\u00A0 So the question to ask yourself is, how fast do you need it to happen?\u00A0 In KSP, elapsed gametime is hardly ever\u00A0a concern.\u00A0 Elapsed gametime only starts to matter when a task takes so long that it won\u0027t be complete before the next transfer window, which is usually months or years in the future.\u00A0 Even if you play with life support, you still need enough to wait on the transfer window anway, so having to mine most of that time doesn\u0027t hurt you.\u00A0 And if you\u0027re doing this uncrewed, then you don\u0027t need life support.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe time required for mining and refining in KSP is dependent on the following factors:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nOre concentration at the site (drilling only)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNumber of drills in operation (drilling only)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSize of parts (big or small)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTemperature of parts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEngineer skill level\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 1st 4 variables give you the base rate of stuff happening.\u00A0 And of these, the ore concentration in the ground is by far the most important.\u00A0 If you\u0027re on low-grade ore, then you\u0027ll never get much speed out of the system.\u00A0 Having an engineer just speeds things up more or less depending on skill level, but the engineer can\u0027t greatly improve on the rate provided by a low-value ore deposit.\u00A0 As long as you\u0027ve got even 1 drill on a good ore concentration and it\u0027s running at the correct temperature, you\u0027ll still get the job done without an engineer before the next transfer window, often considerably faster than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find a high correlation between people who complain about stock ore scanning and who complain about slow ore speeds.\u00A0 I believe these factors are strongly related.\u00A0 Those who dismiss stock ore scanning as gamey (aka \u0022instant\u0022)\u00A0nearly always\u00A0think that just\u00A0doing the M700 orbital survey and then landing based solely on the resulting overlay to be all there is to it.\u00A0 But the M700 tells you NOTHING immediately useful, it just tells you were (in an area the size of Texas) you might find, if you bother to look, clues that will lead to good ore in good locations.\u00A0 If you land based solely on the overlay, you will most likely land in an ore-poor location.\u00A0 And then you will get very low production rates, no matter what you do with the rest of the variables.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn this thread, the OP didn\u0027t state how much ore he had in the ground, and nobody except me asked for that value.\u00A0 This indicates a lack of proper scanning by the OP, and a lack of understanding of the stock scanning process by those who tried to help.\u00A0 The amount of ore in the ground is the single most important thing about ISRU.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t know what it is, then you can\u0027t make any judgments regarding the efficiency of the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-09T17:10:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022

scan a path 1-hex wide regardless of altitude is just unrealistic and seriously detracts from your ability to park your ship in an ideal mapping orbit.\u00A0 The game is all about putting ships in the

your own biome\u00A0map (needed for helping to find site candidates) instead of using the Alt-F12 cheat, and to determine detail topography (as in flatness).\u00A0 SCANsat has a page of options that allow you to disable stock scanning and just use SCANsat mechanics.\u00A0 With this, you can map ore\u0027s location and concentration from orbit over time, same way you build up any other map over many orbits.\u00A0 This isn\u0027t in extreme detail, however, so you still need to get on the ground to find the best spots in a generally good area.\u00A0 But anyway, fully mapping the planet from oribt requires 3 stages:\u00A0 ore (or other resources) at about 150km, biomes (and low-res radar if you want to) at about 260km, and high-res radar (if available) at about 750km.\u00A0 Each stage will take a few weeks of gametime, but happens in the background and at any warp level.\u00A0 And you get to figure out the best non-synchronous mapping orbits at all 3 levels.\u00A0 Yay.\u00A0 And if

system works and, as a result, will only get on half-way decent by sheer chance---usually, you won\u0027t.\u00A0 And thus you won\u0027t get any sort of good production rates, and mistakenly blame it on things like a requirement for engineers.\u00A0 So seriously, LEARN how the stock scanning system works.\u00A0 Once you understand how it works and can use it to advantage, you\u0027ll have a lot better success at mining/refining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs RoverDude himself said, there is NO requirement for an engineer.\u00A0 Uncrewed mining works just fine---I do it all the time and preferrentially.\u00A0 All an engineer does is speed the process up, but the time required is hardly ever a factor in the game, so I find this (and using multiple drills, too) completely unnecessary, PROVIDED I find good ore first.\u00A0 An uncrewed miner on good ore works quite fast enough.\u00A0 But you have to have good ore.\u00A0 And you won\u0027t have good ore unless you know how to look for it, and you obviously don\u0027t because you erroneously think stock has \u0022instant\u0022 scanning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow granted, when mining 1st came out, engineers WERE pretty much required because back then they controlled how hot the parts got and we didn\u0027t yet have radiators (great decision by Squad to introduce heat but give no control for it).\u00A0 But that hasn\u0027t been the case for a long time now.\u00A0 These days, engineers are just an optional turbocharger which 99% of the time you don\u0027t need.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou completely misunderstand.\u00A0 I\u0027m talking about 1-trip loads.\u00A0 I\u0027m just doing a lot of loads, and they\u0027re big.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOre and Karbonite produce however much fuel you want because they do not deplete.\u00A0 Kethane runs out in just a few\u00A0big loads.\u00A0 Now suppose you have a big lander carrying a dozen Kerbals and life support supplies that needs to make round trips between your colony and orbit indefinitely for the colony to survive.\u00A0 Every trip it needs to be refueled.\u00A0 But with Kethane, you can only refuel it 3-6 times on average before all the kethane at the spaceport is gone, and that\u0027s the end of the colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUm, no, you still haven\u0027t mentioned anything, actually.\u00A0 2 of your supposed reasons were actually you having an incomplete and inaccurate\u00A0understanding of the stock system, so really don\u0027t exist.\u00A0\u00A0And if you think Kethane has anywhere near the amount of fuel required to run a large-scale colony, you\u0027ve obviously never tried to do that yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is \u0022instant

timewarp about 2 years at the highest concentrations I could find on Ike.\u00A0 That is insane.
