For example, mounting a Spark or an Ant in the middle of\u00A0a 1.25m stack. Also, clustering of non-surface-attachable engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the interstage fairing/cargo bay, that was possible long before engine plates became a thing. You just use a fairing base. Just stick it onto the craft somewhere, rightclick it, and make\u00A0sure that the options for truss structure and interstage nodes are both enabled. Now grab and attach the fairing base to the bottom of your previous stage (which should be a decoupler, since fairing bases don\u0027t decouple themselves), and voila - you not only have an interstage cargo bay, but one with a physical structure holding the rocket together to boot, rather than just an empty space between two sections of tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, the fairing base will actually shield all the parts inside the interstage area. The engine plate on the other hand will only obfuscate the drag cube of what\u0027s directly attached to the engine plate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the fairing can be ejected from the base once you are out of the atmosphere, allowing access to the contents of the interstage cargo bay even before stages separate. Or, you know, you can use this to build a shielded cargo bay inside stages, where no separation is meant to occur at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, yeah, and incidentally it also allows crossfeed. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-26T11:22:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2019 11:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micha","CreatedById":113840,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-26T11:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGreat info, thanks, haven\u0027t tried using fairings for interstages before.
