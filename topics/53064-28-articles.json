Correct me if I\u0027m wrong, but when we land a rover on another celestial body, I don\u0027t think it goes on for an epic drive around the entire surface right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s because even though they land in a single region, there is lots of experiments they can do. It\u0027s not like they take 1 sample ah go, ok, this entire region is now surveyed. Need to send the rover hundreds of miles in another direction to get anything useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith custom experiments, you could easily make experiments requiring the probodyne rover core for example. And that it needs to be landed in a specific biome in order to acquire science. The fact that all \u0027missions\u0027 in KSP are these open ended, change your mind on a whim, don\u0027t really make sense. I doubt that half way to Mars they\u0027d change the landing spot they designated years/month before launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can make multiple experiments, requiring varying degrees of time to be completed. All within the \u0027same biome\u0027. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe more interesting thing, and this would require huge amounts of work most likely, would be to have a resource system like Kethane, but that would track \u0027unique samples\u0027 or something. Each region could have a very low amount of them, making moving around perhaps worth while on a smaller scale? Then again, I don\u0027t recall the size of each zone when it comes to Kethan\u0027s map grid. (Probably still a long drive from one hex to another).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe have some more interesting requirements, like a specific altitude to get samples (below X) and having to transmit results from a higher ground?

I\u0027m no moddeler)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother Idea I had would be to create a sort of processing pre-science resources and create pre-existing conditions to existing experiments. IE, you send a rover on Mun. And you have to find a specific mineral let\u0027s say. So you get your rover on the ground, and \u0027dig up rocks/dust\u0027. Then when you are full you process it, and you only have X chance that you find said mineral. Then let\u0027s say that once you do, then you unlock another experiment... Meh, I think the fever is getting to me. Not sure if that\u0027s make sense. This would basically create a sort of series of experiments to carry out on the surface rather than land, click, click, click, all science acquired.

But the interface is very painful to work with, the dynamic re-sizing of the item lists is very hard to deal with. Unless all the items are assigned or not, it\u0027ll play tug of war with those 2 fields for display real estate. So you can end up with only seeing the first 3-4 letters of a part.

But, considering the massive changes to the RPL tech tree, I wasn\u0027t always able to keep \u0027stock\u0027 nodes in locations that made sense. And there are a very high number of new nodes intertwined, so in some cases you could have parts appear in funky locations which have nothing to do with it\u0027s intended use. This is mainly due to the high amount of crossover in the stock tech tree. The lack of definite tech lines causes some ambiguity when you try reorganize the tech lines.
