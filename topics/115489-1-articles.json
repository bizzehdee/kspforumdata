Consider:\n\nIt is very easy to ensure that a single-stage rocket is stable - the simplest way is to put enough fins at the bottom. Making multi-stage rockets stable is a lot trickier - to make the upper stages stable using fins, they have to be big enough to stabilise the upper stage, but those same fins will destabilise the lower stage.\n\nSecondly, an upper stage is only stable \\*IF\\* it is moving fast enough when it ignites. If the lower stage loses thrust before the \u0022fuse\u0022 burns through to the upper stage then the whole thing will slow down, and could already be tumbling before the upper stage ignites. Just as bad, if the lower stage propellant burns unevenly so the upper-stage fuse ignites too soon then the ignition of the upper stage will destabilise everything.\n\nAll these problems can be solved, but they either require genuine expertise, or else a lot of dangerous trial-and-error. For competions involving youngsters, single-stage is so very much safer!"}]}
