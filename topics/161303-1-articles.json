Kerbal Engineering Redux, for instance, won\u0027t work as it introduces parts. Visual mods such as Scatterer and EVA will not cause a crash, as they introduce no new parts to the catalogue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo as a general workaround for people suffering crashes; remove all the mods which install components, until those mods are updated by their developers (and don\u0027t go poke them until they do).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMods which introduce optional parts (which are not always needed) can be removed, this includes the parts in Kerbal Engineering Redux* (just remove the Parts subfolder from the Kerbal Engineering Redux folder).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this will at least enable people to enjoy the most they can out of KSP until the mods are updated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* I am aware that there is already an update for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, just like to include this example as a proof of concept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDISCLAIMER:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI shall post this as a general announcement/tip for those suffering from crashes on modded installs of KSP.
