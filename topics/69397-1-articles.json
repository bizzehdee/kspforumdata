So it would be nice if, after spending 5 RP on an new tech, we would have to wait some time for it to be researched. This way I don\u0027t go to the moons in day 3 of the game. Let\u0027s say that 1 RP equals 1 day. That would make science feel like it is actually researched. So a tech that is worth 300 RP would take 300 days to research, and so on..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame way, vehicles should take time to assemble.

When I\u0027m playing, I like to try to avoid major timewarping without doing anything in between (like, while waiting for a transfer window, I run a mission to Minmus or something), but really, there\u0027s no reason to do this. And that\u0027s probably for the best, since sometimes I just want to go through with my mission to Jool, even if it means putting the rest of my space program on hold for 3 or 4 years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I guess the question is whether this should change. When money comes around, will you be granted a yearly budget? Will missions have time constraints? That\u0027s the only reason this would be a good idea, otherwise what\u0027s the point when you could just timewarp at KSC anyways?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-15T20:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm. While I can appreciate the idea of a realistic timescale, I too would find it very frustrating to timewarp simply for the sake of skipping to the point of rocket assembly. The game doesn\u0027t have the structure to allow a pipeline of rockets to be designed/fabricated. So we would be stuck with: \u0022Design a rocket, sit and wait for it to show up. Now you can design your next rocket, and wait. Repeat...\u0022 Especially when you consider it can take years to design, build, and assemble a rocket. Although a lot of games work this way (wait for something to build), they aren\u0027t usually as flexible and open ended with design. Think of the pain if you realized at launch that you forgot to install that solar panel.... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m guessing that Twreed87 is probably on the right track. Career mode will probably become time dependent due to budget implementation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, I can see science taking time to fully research. A lot of games work that way. Although I\u0027m still not sure about waiting over a year of gametime for one science node to unlock.
