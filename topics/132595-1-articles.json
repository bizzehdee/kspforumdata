I know there are mods that fix this, but I think it should be in stock. For example, the cubic octagonal strut,\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002283px-Cubic_Octagonal_Strut.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/thumb/3/30/Cubic_Octagonal_Strut.png/83px-Cubic_Octagonal_Strut.png\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhas a max temperature of 2000 kelvin. That is equal to\u00A03140.33 Fahrenheit, or\u00A01726.85 Celsius. Assuming it\u0027s made of steel, steel usually melts at 2500 Fahrenheit, or 1370 Celsius. Already, it is pretty heat resistant. BUT, considering that it is so small and made out of very thin pieces of the metal, it\u0027s max tempurature should be lower.\u00A0A lot of parts are like this, like strut connectors, modular girder segments, etc. In my eyes, objects not designed to survive the rigors of reentry shouldn\u0027t. In real life, any debris that survives reentry is in really small bits, so even big deorbited space stations are reduced to a mere meteor shower.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow do I think they should fix this? Lower max heat tolerances, making heat shields a necessity. Add maybe an ablation panel. Something like the OX-STAT photovoltaic panel, but black and with an ablator. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022803px-Silica_Space_Shuttle_thermal_prote\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Silica_Space_Shuttle_thermal_protection_%28TPS%29_tile%2C_c_1980._%289663807484%29.jpg/803px-Silica_Space_Shuttle_thermal_protection_%28TPS%29_tile%2C_c_1980._%289663807484%29.jpg\u0022\u003EAdding these to the bottoms of wings and fuel tanks will make spaceplanes look 10x cooler. (And it will stick with the black/white theme of KSP and NASA.)
