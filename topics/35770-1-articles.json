The blue one is where you\u0027re going on your current path prior to the encounter, and the brown one is where your orbit is predicted to be after that encounter changes it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor some really annoying reason I continually have problems getting the game to let me click to set a maneuver node on the BLUE line when in this situation. It always instead sets one on the nearby brown line when I click on the blue, which is useless if the reason I want to do the maneuver is to change how the encounter will go prior to getting to the planet. I\u0027ve now gotten into the habit of just not using maneuver nodes to adjust the encounter, instead aligning the ship along exact orthogonal orientations (i.e. aimed toward prograde mark, rotated so \u0022up\u0022 is lined up exact with either normal, antinormal, \u0022in\u0022 or \u0022out\u0022), and then turning on RCS and using HNIJKL to experimentally see which orthogonal directions cause the encounter periopsis number to get smaller, and that tells me the direction to make my more substantial burn in. (i.e. if I discover that prograde makes the number get smaller fast, and antinormal makes it get smaller slowly, then that tells me to pick an orientation partway between prograde and antinormal, but closer to prograde than antinormal, and make my burn like that. This is the sort of thing I do in lieu of being able to set a maneuver node to see where the blue mark is.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut really I want to know if I\u0027m the only person who has encountered this behavior (can only set a maneuver node on the brown line, not the blue), and what others have done as a workaround if they\u0027ve encountered it too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xooll","CreatedById":72685,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T19:04:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve had that problem too.
