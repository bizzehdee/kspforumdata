After I got the airframe to the way i wanted it, I put F-12 servos on the sides (note: you cannot mirror or used the radial 2 tool as it will be uneven). After, I attached my wings and put a KAL-1000 controller, I set my target angles to -30 for unswept and 28 for swept. After completing that, I made action groups for setting the direction and playing the set angles. I can make a simplified version or a video tutorial (This was all done on the Xbox 1 so no mods used dw). Hope this helps \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
