Where \u0027here\u0027 is, I do not currently know. What I will do is write in this. That if in any event, I can escape. The outside world will know the truth of this place.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * I came here by choice. Less than a month ago, I was in jail. I was in for murder and **** of two women. Being completely guilty, I was sentenced to life in jail.That is by far the least of my problems. When they arrived to our jailhouse, it was an odd spectacle. They gathered all of the other inmates that had also been sentenced to life and the ones who were sentenced to death. After gathering us all in the mess hall, they made an announcement. They said, that if any inmates were willing to go through with some \u0027tests\u0027, and we survived their one month testing period, we would be pardoned of all our crimes. I was one of the few who thought that it would be worth any of the proposed risks, but now I think differently.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * After gathering all the willing inmates, they put us in a large truck, it was a semi-truck but it was sleek black. Inside was 5 rows of metal hand rails. As we entered the truck, we saw at the rear of the truck that there were several other groups of inmates obviously from other jailhouses. The ride seemed to go on forever. I don\u0027t know how long we rode, but I knew the sun had set, rose and set again before they ever got to where they were going. Where they dropped us off was completely cut off from any signs of civilization. The outside world just seemed to have faded away.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * Upon arrival, We saw another waiting line. There they told us to follow the line and receive our designation. Above our heads were metal walk ways. They were patrolled by guards. The line seemed to stretch forever. The room was huge; The size of a football field contained inside a room that seemed absent of the outside world.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * After walking and waiting for four hours straight. No food, no water; Cannot sit, cannot stop standing. After the wait, I walk to a desk, with another guard working it. It is protected by two inch thick glass and metal slats along the edges. I can see visibly that others have tried to break the glass and attack, but the blood spatters along the floors also make it apparent of what happened to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * \u0022You are D-65789, you will be in Junction Tango Four, you will be used for testing\u0022 rang the electric voice of the guard. Then a little card slid out of the machine, as I read it the guard said. \u0022Take this to the next guard you come to, when he asks for it, give it to him and he will take you to your quarters\u0022, rang the voice again. I yanked the card out and walked.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * Another two hours passed slowly walking. Taking one step every minute. As I thought again, that I would have to learn to walk in my sleep to get where I\u0027m going. I find the guard, and he does as the last said. He asked for my card and he gathered me up into a group with what I guess was other inmates in my \u0027junction\u0027. As we walked down, hallway after hallway and path after path. Finally we came to a long hallway that had multiple rooms off to the side. Some where closed. After I passed one door, I heard muttering inside, it sounded like the person inside was going insane. The mutters sounded fast and completely nonsense. That got me thinking, if the faculty is that bad, and that horrible to drive a man insane. A man that once could of fought a throng of police and been the victor, yet this place has torn him down, and I knew I could not hold as strong as that. I can say I will not fall apart like them, but I know it is inevitable.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * We come to one door, where we hear the person inside banging on the door screaming. The guard behind us stopped following us and opened his cell, then we saw him open fire on the person inside. Two rounds is all it took, two bullets and the strength, rage, and essence of the man ceased. Never to continue, but we could do nothing.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * Finally we get to the end of the hallway, and then he started calling out our designations, one by one, sending us to our cells. Finally my designation rose. He sent me to my cell and told me, like the others. To obey any and all commands but to me when my time for testing arises.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * When I enter my cell, I see a concrete bed, with a pillow on my right. On my left I *have a concrete toilet with no water, with a indenting table from the wall. On the table I see there was two sheets of paper and a journal. I picked up the papers and the journal and took a seat on the bed. On the first sheet of paper it read that I\u0027m only here for one month, and if I survive the one month trial period, I will be pardoned of all prior crimes. It was just a extended version of what the guard at the jailhouse said.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * That made me shook. The amount if time between then and now. The changes that have occurred, too much has changed in the time allotted. I shook it off and read the other page. It read that I have been given a journal to note whatever I wish, it is simply there to entertain and prevent insanity of D-Class Personnel, like myself. I knew it wasn\u0027t that much, especially remembering the one who had gone insane or the one that had been gunned down. It was not their fault, the faculty should have done more for them. Even when people who are sentenced to death get treated better than this. Nonetheless, it is how life is.*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* * That is how I came to right this. It now 8:02 am, and I now finish my first entry to my journal, hopefully, if I escape this can find someone and tell my story to help stop people from coming here and to cause a riot to examine this place and bring it down and whatever is inside it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-15T17:58:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2014 05:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ZooNamedGames\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T18:40:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow....
