Because of that, drudge work will still be a thing for a long time, as long as it\u0027s cheaper to hire a human than buy a machine. This is a moving target, and it \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E lead to exploitation of unskilled laborers. In fact, it\u0027s happening right now in some places.\u00A0We already have the technology to automate many jobs that are currently done by humans, but it\u0027s not always the cheapest option. A sweatshop\u00A0full of poor workers (often including children) in some 3rd world country is still a cheaper way of making T-shirts than a fully automatic production line in the 1st world. Eventually, this will change as machinery gets cheaper,\u00A0and those poor workers will have to find another place to work at, probably for less pay and in worse conditions. That\u0027s what the original Luddites were on about, and what trying to compete with machines\u00A0looks like from a human\u00A0perspective. It would take a major paradigm shift and probably abandonment of capitalism to get away from that, because no matter what, most people are simply not intelligent enough to do useful work with their\u00A0brains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists, engineers and designers\u00A0are already using computers to maximum extent practicable. In fact, most serious work is done with them, barring some menial lab jobs that are easier to get a grad student to do. And even that can be automated:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/07/09/robo-chemist-the-latest-version\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/07/09/robo-chemist-the-latest-version\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, I don\u0027t see it replacing grad students just yet (again, mostly because robots are expensive and\u00A0students are cheap \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E), but compared to my father\u0027s time, there\u0027s far less stuff to do around the labs, especially for undergrads. Between increasing automation and more stringent regulations (liability and so on), it can be though to find something to get started on. Of course, it\u0027s not that big of a problem in itself, as long as the university is well run.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, making a \u003Cem\u003Ecomputer\u003C/em\u003E that can think is impossible, because there are fundamental differences between what human brain does and what computer does. All a computer does is implement a logical operation, in a mathematical sense.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCritical thinking\u00A0is not deterministic, and it involves imagination, which is very much outside the realm of traditional computing. Whether quantum computing can do that remains to be seen, but either way, it will take a fundamental breakthrough, because a logic machine has some limitations inherent in the very fact that it\u0027s a logic machine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E(Edit: I went through a phase where I was writing my own sci fi and your threads really stoke my creative side. Keep it up, brother! These thought games are excellent.)\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe current processing design used for modern computers, if history is any indication, will \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E be the same design used by computers two centuries from now. Everything changes, and I think the problem, Dragon, is \u0022when\u0022 not \u0022if\u0022 some college project or research team will invent a completely new and fundamentally different processing design that bridges the gap between modern computing and human computing and can learn and reason. There is a ridiculous demand for this sort of capability, and I assure you there are thousands of people feverishly pursuing computers that can think. We\u0027re a smart enough species to make it happen, eventually.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the other point on cheap labor versus mechanized labor, I also think that\u0027s a modern phenomenon and one that won\u0027t exist in, say, 2920 society. Sure, we might still have sweat shops in 150 years, but nothing lasts forever; Eventually the human element will get replaced, probably once the \u003Cem\u003Enext iteration\u003C/em\u003E of future computers begin to design their own replacements better and faster than we can, and especially when said machines begin to operate everything from the acquisition of resources to the building of equipment.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn this example, there\u0027s no way a fully autonomous Nike can compete with a Nike that \u003Cstrong\u003Ehires\u003C/strong\u003E labor.

There will come a point where computers will be used to create screenplay, will write books, and will create paintings and furniture based only on examples. In fact, there have been examples of all of the above. For instance, there\u0027s a webpage you can go to where you can draw a sketch and a computer will finish the painting for you. There are websites where a computer will write a story for you based on your own concepts. Moving forward - especially when decades turn to centuries and so on - we\u0027ll reach a point where computers will do these things far better than we could. That\u0027s just my opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSort of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nToday there are no computers that can think critically or, really, think at all. I\u0027m assuming eventually - given enough time - we\u0027ll have computers that can. And how amazing will it be to have a Judge or CEO or Prime Minister that is programmed to follow the law, is completely selfless by design, is incapable of lying, and has only the best interests of the public in mind? I\u0027m surely not the first to imagine peerless leadership, and I would be lying if I said I wouldn\u0027t support replacing humans with their fairer creations with that regard. Imagine a leader that can\u0027t be bribed and won\u0027t lie.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI guess I\u0027m imagining Lt. Commander Data from Star Trek running for public office. And it\u0027s got my vote. Absolutely. I can\u0027t pretend to know through what medium a hot war will be fought in 2040, let alone 2540. That said, there\u0027s an argument to be made about the absolute lethality and efficiency of a computer based \u0022SkyNet\u0022 system. We already know no human chess player can beat the computer chess player that comes with every version of windows. In what way could a human General outsmart a computer General if said computer was designed well enough? What happens when a computer can look at satellite data, social media, and other sources to accurately map enemy movements and distribution and can strategize against it in real time? When a computer can tell a grunt on the ground to duck because a sniper miles away is aiming at him? When a computer can coordinate individual assets in a manner we couldn\u0027t dream of today? I mean one day these small cheap unmanned robot vehicles are fast enough to shoot down individual bullets with their own bullets?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m just imagining a playing field where the human element isn\u0027t just irrelevant, it\u0027s obsolete.
