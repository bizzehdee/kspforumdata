Ion engines in this game are considered to be of little use by many players because of how slow they are. I don\u0027t think their twr should be made even higher because its already unrealistically high, I actually think it should be decreased once there is a solution to decrease how much irl time you spend waiting after them. But that\u0027s not what I want to talk about. I think the ion engine should be replaced by a VASMIR engine with equal stats. I am not fond about including near future tech in the game, but according to the wiki page on this thing, its going to have a major real-life application in being used on the ISS as soon as next year, meaning adding it to the stock game would be less of a stretch than with the nerva. Its twr is higher than than a normal ion engine and most importantly it uses argon gas, which is much cheaper than xenon and can be used to justify a lower in game cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wahgineer","CreatedById":59292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T16:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe VASIMR is technically more powerful than any ion engine. Also, the reason the 48-7s seems to out perform other engines is because it was accidentally made OP (hence why I don\u0027t use them and why I disregard vessels that take advantage of their OP-ness.). And while I and others understand your dislike of near future tech, your kind of too late to stop it: the R.A.P.I.E.R. is based off of the SABRE: an in development, near future hybrid engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-14T17:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022z26\u0022 data-cite=\u0022z26\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E1.Some member made a chart of the optimal engine to use according to the situation here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/45155-Mass-optimal-engine-type-vs-delta-V-payload-and-min-TWR\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMass-optimal engine type vs delta-v\u003C/a\u003E The result can be summed in this sentence: Use the atomic rocket for big payloads where twr is of little relevance and use the 48-7s for anything else.
