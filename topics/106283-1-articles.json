Most of the parts have braking forces \u003E 100, but all sliders only seem to go up to 30. This means that even if you just bring up the right-click menu on a wheel (without even touching the slider) you end up overriding its braking force, to the point where you can make it possible to drive a craft around unimpeded with brakes enabled. I originally spotted this on my custom wheel parts but have been able to reproduce in a stock install with the rover from the Rover \u002B Skycrane craft.\n\nI\u0027m running the Steam version of KSP 1.0 on Windows 7 64bit.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Zodius\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T13:36:32Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 01:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ZodiusInfuser**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:40:20Z","Content":"You are indeed correct.
