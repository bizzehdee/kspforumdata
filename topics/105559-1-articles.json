Doesn\u0027t seem to matter what I\u0027m doing at the time. Has crashed on the launch pad, during flight, in the VAB being idle, attaching thermometer, attaching radial parachutes... the list goes on. \n\nThe crash log shows that between 35-45% of RAM is being used; however it shows that there is 0 MB physical memory, 0 MB paging file, and 0 MB user address space [1915 MB free], with *Write to location 00000000 caused an access violation* seeming to be the reason for the crash. \n\nI have run Windows Memory Diagnostic and MemTest; both came back with 0 errors.\n\nI had to run with -force-opengl in .90 for it to run without crashing; though with having to alt-tab out and in to fix graphical glitches. Don\u0027t know if this is related but thought I would report it anyway in case it helps... (will try that again now and will update if it helps; although with KSP being \u0027released\u0027 I had hoped that this would have been fixed.\n\nerror.log:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7U2eHh0eg4BWDZfaUg0SHA4dkE/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7U2eHh0eg4BWDZfaUg0SHA4dkE/view?usp=sharing)\n\noutput\\_log.txt:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7U2eHh0eg4BQzJKMk9CUERWYlk/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7U2eHh0eg4BQzJKMk9CUERWYlk/view?usp=sharing)\n\nsettings.cfg:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7U2eHh0eg4BdzNiLS1nUmtZTDQ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7U2eHh0eg4BdzNiLS1nUmtZTDQ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated as I have over 700 hours into this game since .18 and *need my fix and all the new stuff!*\n\n**update:** -force-opengl seems to fix the crashing problem for now; with the added bonus of now the mouse cursor stays visible after right click\u0026hold or selecting a textbox. It does take longer to load scene changes though... Would still like some insight as to why the force-opengl argument is necessary for me...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T09:26:13Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 09:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jamirrz**\n  \nupdate"},{"CreatedByName":"pandadoudou","CreatedById":142343,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T06:09:29Z","Content":"I have the exact same problem (same log informations, same installation process, etc.)\n\nThanks for the command-line, I\u0027ll try that later on ![:kiss:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_kiss.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Larz128","CreatedById":135012,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:12:58Z","Content":"Yeh having the same bug, which is weird since i have 16 gb of ram.\n\nAlways happens on re-entry which a space plane.\n\nI had drag forces showing to, so i guess it could be a memory leak in that.
