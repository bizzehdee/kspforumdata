However the relative velocity to your new location can be rather extreme if you do it wrong. Effectively the warp drive translates your position without touching your velocity and will always behave this way. That said there are tricks to minimize or eliminate the dV required to achieve a stable orbit at your destination, just not in a single warp jump unless your vectors are already lining up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can utilize multiple jumps near a sufficiently massive body to adjust your vector. If your going the wrong direction you can warp to near the sun or jool and use its gravity well to distort your orbit untill your vector is going the right direction and then warp to your destination. If you need to speed up or slow down you can warp to a point where your vector is pointing strait twards or away from said gravity well and let the gravity give you the dV. combining these two techniques you could in theory put yourself in a stable orbit around another body with no conventional drive systems. In reality your probably better off just geting close enough and useing conventional rockets to correct the errors.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prullenbak","CreatedById":44642,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T19:45:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis might be a really stupid question, but how are you supposed to upgrade the computer core?

That is a little bit weird because normal experiments have a fixed data size, science points change depending ob biomes. Maybe you could stick with that, and set the impactor experiment data size to something between 100 and 200 megabits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sirklick","CreatedById":76119,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T10:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fractal_UK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EApologies as well RealFuelers - I made an error in the compatibility file, here is a fixed version:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022MFS-RealFuels2.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://bitbucket.org/FractalUK/kspinstellar/downloads/MFS-RealFuels2.zip\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a more up to date config that works with the newest bits and bobs?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoAcario","CreatedById":24645,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-13T10:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Fractal, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s me again.. the guy you\u0027re tired of hearing from the with the Direct Conversion power stations.
