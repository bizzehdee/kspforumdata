I\u0027d like to be able to, for example, test an Eve lander. It obviously won\u0027t behave accurately on Kerbin, and flying it to Eve after every change is clearly impractical. I\u0027d like to design it normally in the space center, then launch it from some convenient flat, equatorial spot on Eve. If such a mod exists, please let me know. If not, please make one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T18:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37756\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHyperedit\u003C/a\u003E is quite helpful for this, can move your ship just about anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-30T18:44:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWelcome aboard!\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37756\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHyperedit\u003C/a\u003E is quite helpful for this, can move your ship just about anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyperedit is good, as long as you remember to revert \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso useful, if you\u0027re up to it, is \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Construction Time\u003C/a\u003E.
