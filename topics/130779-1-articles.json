It was sufficient for the pre 1.0 versions but now it does not meet the needs of the game naturally on it\u0027s own. So what about more things in the VAB/SPH to help line up the wing surfaces individually. At minimum lines going from the wings showing what their individual affect is and then maybe something added to start showing degres of angles for the wing(With an actual given numerical value and in multiple directions) and maybe a grid system that can be toggled showing relative position on the vehicle(also with a set of numerical values). This would at minimum help see the affects of more complex aircraft and could also help if you have to take off parts and put wings back on in a precise manner. Then you at least have a chance of seeing where it was before and putting it back on if you change a base part like a fuel tank to a different type. (This also makes adding a thing where you can change the fuel type out a good idea. if there are visual differences just make it change the skin and the reference part and not make you move it like fuel types etc.) But I\u0027m pretty sure the current system no longer is sufficient on it\u0027s own to show the aerodynamic qualities to build a craft well in this game. And I bet it\u0027s not the most complex thing to add. Just us the some red lines and other indicators and allow people to change how it looks a little for various practical purposes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso maybe add some values to those arrows and lines to show the relevant affect on the COL. Something so we see more how the attributes of the wings affect it practically. This could all be really helpful if you want to make really weird planes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-26T19:52:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2016 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T14:28:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor version 1.0 we where supposed to get a really fancy overlay in the SPH to show the new areo effects on any aircraft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0It never materialized and squad are silent about it..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arugela","CreatedById":133381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T14:30:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a display that shows it with the F12 button.
