I have to say I think it is a great addition to game, and while it is far from perfect, it is a good direction. It does give us something to do. I hope further career mode developments are coming soon: The open sandbox is nice, but having some goals gives you something to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 0.22 feedback (in no particular order):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I\u0027m not a big fan with the how the SAS works now. However, it did give me an idea: Would it make sense to have two modes? The initial and simple SAS modules could work like the current, overshooting and wobbling a bit when turning. Advanced SAS and high end capsules would have a more smooth handling and no overshooting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The science has it\u0027s quirks, and some aid is needed. A visible page in Science lab showing what you have researched would be nice. Have it only show biomes/experiments player has already completed. Maybe have them split by planet, biome, and experiment type.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Space center could also have a single hint from the scientists to give new players some help on what to research. For example, \u0022Our scientists wonder if you could do some measurements near the poles of Kerbin\u0022, \u0022do you think there is anythign scienfitically interesting in Mun?\u0022 or \u0022we made a bet on weather things look different outside the capsule then the inside. Could you check this?\u0022 to point players to areas and experiments they have missed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The transmitting/returning samples needs more work. Once you unlock solar panels, you can mine all the data by simply repeatedly sending the report until sending no longer yields research. At that point, there is only fractions left anyway, so it is worthless. Maybe have each experiment split to two parts, return and transmit. Any data loss and data earned via transmit only effects the transmit part. Return should effect both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way you could repeatedly transmit the data, but only get the transmit % of the original (20%, 40%, 50% depending on the report). At some point, even if you transmit data you gain nothing, but still have the return part untouched, and would get that when you repeatedly return the experiment data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Maybe adding sample bins, databases etc. parts to store more reports/data would be handy. Databases could require constant power or lose data, sample bins just add mass. And automated parts that enable probes to take soil samples. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, my 2 cents.

Hopefully provide my insights to the devs. The following are just my opinions and not intended as a response to anyone else\u0027s post or anything, just thought it would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve unlocked all of the Tier 4 stuff and some 5\u0027s and 6\u0027s and I have my guys poised to go beyond Minmus and (yet again) start exploring the galaxy, just to note where I am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, the career mode structure hasn\u0027t bothered me much, other than the fact that we\u0027ve got 2 new models on this version. I\u0027m really hoping that the devs will spend some time in a nearby update at getting more parts and pieces, especially now that they come in bit-sized chunks, there is no longer the need to restrict the number of parts based on new players needing to sift through a million options, so I don\u0027t think any harm would be done in exploiting this feature as an excuse to add a bunch of rocket parts with the next version. Adding KSPX was nice and much needed, but the community, as far as I can tell, wants more parts. Specially stuff to make our space planes look/fly better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that I\u0027m not just collecting science points when I go into space, but also these data things that seem to have no use other than being there. I\u0027m looking forward to finding out what Squad\u0027s intentions are toward these points and how they will fit into the grand structure of things, but science has become dull rather quickly. This is a shame, but pretty much what I was expecting from reading KSP weekly and watching the pre-release videos. It would be nice for different experiments to collect different types of data as a minimum, and maybe some option to upgrade parts with research. Perhaps instead of just having science, have different data that could be collected and downloaded at ksp, and then the KSP scientists could work through that data to produce things naturally, like upgrading engine parts and so forth, and you could manage your team. In my dreams, perhaps a system similar to the old x-com games, that would be awesome. Each part could have a mk1, mk2, etc list (same model, upgraded stats) and the descriptions can go from \u0022found on the side of the road\u0022 to \u0022by adding a few parts from the hardware store\u0022 to \u0022materials analysis led us to\u0022, etc. Just some thoughts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sub-assembly manager is nice, but like the mod, I find it severely lacking and limiting. The prime reason is that I can only store \u0022tails\u0022. IOW, I can build a sweet probe and rocket, and store the rocket as a sub-assembly, but storing the probe itself becomes rather annoying and finicky. This is most likely because of the way that ships are read/stored to the SPH files? I don\u0027t know how it\u0027s coded, but if it\u0027s an array of enum data, for instance, just adding a couple new sort algorithms might solve the problem? I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s just an annoyance, but one I\u0027ve learned to live with. (and why I stopped using subassm manager in the first place).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil now I\u0027ve given vanilla a good run and it\u0027s much better than the others before it, but I just feel that this game could be so much more and I hope once all this infrastructure is implemented, SQUAD will be able to start filling it out with a lot of content. The resources which are already in the game is a sound setup for adding more down the line, as proven with Kethane, TAC, and other resource mods. The science, I\u0027m afraid doesn\u0027t look as good from a meta viewpoint, and seems to be locked to the parts tree, which will probably not cater to some of my listed suggestions, but I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a last point. A system similar to flight engineer would be really helpful. All them guys in lab coats running around my VAB are starting to annoy me because I still have to do the delta-v calculations by hand while making my rockets without flight engineer. If Squad really wants to cater to the \u0022larger audience,\u0022 some kind of helpful advice from the lab-coat kerbals would be nice and IMHO, they should make a native engineering system for the game. Either that or change the scenery to some kid\u0027s backyard.

I\u0027m really hoping that the devs will spend some time in a nearby update at getting more parts and pieces, especially now that they come in bit-sized chunks, there is no longer the need to restrict the number of parts based on new players needing to sift through a million options, so I don\u0027t think any harm would be done in exploiting this feature as an excuse to add a bunch of rocket parts with the next version. Adding KSPX was nice and much needed, but the community, as far as I can tell, wants more parts. Specially stuff to make our space planes look/fly better.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood points and suggestions overall, but I\u0027m going to comment on this one in particular. The more parts the game gets, the more cluttered the VAB gets, especially as you work your way through the tech tree. Since this clutter makes it more difficult to find the parts you want to use, Squad should think about redesigning how the parts are sorted in the VAB before they add more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf nothing else, a \u0022Favorite Parts\u0022 tab would be extremely helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geckgo","CreatedById":76457,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T15:45:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood point.

So a hypothetical first rocket might consist of a small SRB, a dummy payload, basic sensors (thermometer, accelerometer, barometer), and a parachute to recover the sensors.
