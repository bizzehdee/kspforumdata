The resource reading in the top right includes all fuel on the vessel (even fuel you\u0027ve locked out from use). If you look in the lower left, the yellow bar shows how much fuel is available to that engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShowing fuel by stage could be useful also, but it gets tricky. Fuel by stage doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s actually accessible by the engines in that stage. And with fuel lines running across decouplers, it can also get weird. Do you include fuel available from across the fuel line? Or just what\u0027s below that stage?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the readouts from MechJeb and/or KER do it pretty well (although I\u0027m thinking of the dV readouts off hand). They show what\u0027s available for that stage and assume you\u0027re going to stage as soon as the fuel for that stage is consumed, even if there are fuel lines attached across decouplers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lttito","CreatedById":49289,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T20:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, I just checked it in 0.25 and it works the same as in 0.90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suposse I will have to write a thread in suggestion sub-forum. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can delete the post as it is not a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers and thanks for a quick response!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T21:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also found that the Resource window gets glitchy when you have the \u0022Stage Only\u0022 box checked IF you have engine\u002Bdecoupler together in the next stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tf7QC0O.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tf7QC0O.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad, just from changing the staging order:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ls3SV8x.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ls3SV8x.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the OP\u0027s post, he has the decoupler and engine together as well.
