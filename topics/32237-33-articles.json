However, I do plan to eventually make my own truss system that would better fit the FusTek aesthetic, with both static segments from VAB/SPH construction and docking-strut powered procedural segments that can be erected/dismantled while in EVA - the latter will allow the construction of closed-loop truss support frames.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-06T02:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002207/06/2014 02:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESpelling and grammatical derp\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sp1989","CreatedById":105359,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-06T02:08:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumghai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumghai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFusTek\u0027s focus will be on \u003Cstrong\u003EUnited States Orbital Segment (USOS)\u003C/strong\u003E-inspired ISS parts.\u003Cp\u003E KOSMOS and BobCat\u0027s Community ISS project already offers Russian-style station modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAHHHHH ok sounds good to me.
