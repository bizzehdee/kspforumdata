Why? Notch has added things that don\\\u0027t work and/are annoying. For example,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Endermen can pick up ANY block, including bedrock and player-placed. They also have zombie sounds as a placeholder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Hunger Bar: Me and my friend agree that it\\\u0027s one of the worst things to happen to Minecraft. Adds to the whole maintenance aspect that we hate. Food stacks, which helps, but does not make up for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Animal persistence. Now that breeding has been implemented, it helps a small bit, but may God have mercy if you are n00b who doesn\\\u0027t know yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Leather is nearly impossible to get now.
