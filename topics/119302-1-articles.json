I don\u0027t think you realize just how small those are. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Being in space is an advantage, but it doesn\u0027t compensate that much of a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother dealbreaker: cubesats have no attitude control. Not just \u0022very little\u0022, but quite literally none at all. No reactions wheels, no RCS, nada. They don\u0027t even have engines. They\u0027re just a box of electronics you decouple, which sends signals until its orbit decays a few weeks later. And space telescopes, they need attitude control. They need the most precise and elaborate attitude control you can imagine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could do something like that, potentially, with a spacecraft like the Arkyd-100 as imagined by Planetary Resources. the Arkyd-100 is a probe of a size that a person can hold in their arms, and it carries a telescope of roughly the size of the ground-based amateur telescopes you linked. It is intended to look for near-Earth asteroids. The probe is designed to be cheap and mass-producable, and is equipped with attitude control and the ability to stay in space for an extended time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m kind of scratching my head at your whole premise, though. \u0022So the big telescopes don\u0027t have to\u0022. Which big telescopes? Hubble isn\u0027t hunting Exoplanets. Gaia isn\u0027t hunting exoplanets. Spitzer isn\u0027t hunting exoplanets. James Webb will not be hunting exoplanets either. They may be drafted to help with \u003Cem\u003Econfirming\u003C/em\u003E strong candidates, but that will still be required even if the initial detection is done by another craft. Yes, Kepler is hunting exoplanets. Do you know why? Because it was designed from the ground up and launched for the express purpose of hunting exoplanets. That\u0027s literally all it does, and all it can do. It makes no sense trying to free up time for Kepler to do other things, because Kepler cannot do other things. Kepler can also detect things that no amateur telescope sized optics could hope to resolve, so it continues to be valuable in any case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while a flock of small planet hunter telescopes could indeed increase the number of stars we can survey at the same time, it would do nothing for \u0022freeing up\u0022 existing telescopes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
