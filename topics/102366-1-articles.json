I expect it would be an issue if you have two clips trying to animate the same object. if the clips animate their own objects it\u0027s worth a try. I haven\u0027t tried using AnimateThrottle for a while since it conflicted with AnimateHeat back in 0.24. it might work fine with ModuleAnimateGeneric considering AnimateHeat does alright with AnimateGeneric."}]}
