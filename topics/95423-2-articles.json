Moho is the toughest due to the high dV required; that plane-change is a real PITA, and even if you optimize your transfer planning and execute the burns perfectly, you need a lot of dV to make a landing and then make orbit and break the SOI again. The transfer back to Kerbin isn\u0027t too bad but the difficulty is so front-loaded that after you\u0027ve managed those first tough parts, the return is anti-climactic. I like Dres well enough - it\u0027s got a very interesting canyon feature and there are transfer windows that aren\u0027t too far apart.
