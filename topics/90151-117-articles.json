The duplicates would spawn \u0022on top of\u0022 the original causing behaviour similar to what you are reporting. But I thought that bug was long dead... Check a quicksave file to see whether vessels are duplicated. They may also show up in the tracking centre, in which case you could delete the duplicates.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe rocket I sent up has four basically identical satellites attached to it but so far I\u0026#39;ve only \u0022launched\u0022 the first (and also primary) satellite. So there are technically identical satellites in play but no identical VESSEL files either in the save game or in the tracking center. And if I activate the omni antennas, save the game, then manually edit the file to deactivate all the omni antennas, everything works fine again. So the problem is definitely not duplicate vessels. It seems more like when the antennas are active (and therefore extended) that they are colliding with each other, though I don\u0026#39;t really see how that would be happening.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: I don\u0026#39;t know why this would be a factor but it seems the issue may be somehow related to the custom action keys. I have the satellite setup so that custom action key 1 will activate the 88-88 dish, the four solar panels, and all eight Communotron antennas at one time. When I use that key to turn everything on, then save and reload (or just leave and return to the craft) that\u0026#39;s when the issue happens. But I pulled a save from just prior to using the custom key. This time I edited the savegame file to remove the communotron antenna from that custom key. I still used the key to activate the dish and solar panels but I had to manually activate each communotron antenna. This time when I saved and reloaded, everything was fine. Again, no idea why the custom action key would be effecting anything but that\u0026#39;s what I\u0026#39;m seeing.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-19T18:26:49Z\u0022 title=\u002211/19/2015 06:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chrisl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T23:52:02Z","Content":"\nUpdated for KSP 1.0.5!\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MAFman","CreatedById":101780,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T02:00:18Z","Content":"\nSo I found an odd bug...KSP loads most of the way, then does a weird black-screen-thing...\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1BXLWa5LPIMSkxJYXpZVWJzZjg/view[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[url]https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1BXLWa5LPIMQUNWdEZXRmR6VEE/view[/url]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-20T17:35:28Z","Content":"\nI have installed the new version of realism overhaul using ckan and it always ends up freezing while loading.

It will also not show/create the little conical fairing that is supposed to be created dynamically after attaching the decoupler.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nyou have to flip the part upside down for it to correctly attach and both show the conical fairing and be integrated into the staging display in the bottom right corner.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut if you do it this way there is another problem. when you launch the craft and finally come to stage the decoupler, the dynamically created, small conical fairing will still show, even after the decoupler has been decoupled. It will be part of the final Explorer probe, which looks weird and wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI had a look at this myself already, and i believe i found the source of the problem (but Im not an expert, so i might be wrong).
