Throttle is up full and no thrust limits are set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I made a new simple test craft incase my odd lander design was the cause, but even this very simple test has the same result. You can see the amount of flame coming out is less than expected when at full throttle. 2nd pic has the context menu open so you can see the thrust isn\u0027t being limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/HrWn7Gd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/HrWn7Gdl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022HrWn7Gdl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/DZ0WWXD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DZ0WWXDl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DZ0WWXDl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOdd thing is I just did a mission to Mun and back and the 909 was working fine.

There is no apparent change in engine output until I limit it right down to almost nothing. The rest of the slider has no effect to either the flame animation or the engines sound effect. It looks and sounds like its on very low thrust. The slider does change the thrust values shown in the menu, but im unsure of that is actually what the engine is giving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve restarted KSP and I\u0027ve tried it in another save (in the same install). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve restarted my machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve installed a fresh copy of 1.0.2 and (without changing any settings away from default) started a new sandbox save.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn all cases the 909 seems to be running at very low thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I still have a copy of 1.0.0 installed and in that the 909 is functioning as expected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this just happened. On one mission it was working ok, then it just starting acting up. The fact that installing a fresh copy of KSP has the same effect is truly strange! That means its something global. Very puzzled!!

So was this change made in the 1.0.1 patch then? (as it was as expected in 1.0). I don\u0027t see it mentioned in the 1.0.1 change log. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/1.0.1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/1.0.1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
