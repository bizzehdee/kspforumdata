To make a long story short, in a career game I have an early-ish stock rocket with the basic \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine. Ascent profile is more or less default -- 15km start, 75km end, shape is 50%ish, 100 m/s speed. Rocket is small, so fairly high TWR and fairly high COG (not high enough to cause significant instability, though). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue: It appears that the gravity turn starts at the lesser of the input speed or the input altitude. With this smallish rocket, speed is the first mark hit by a longshot. (The craft is at 100 m/s by about 5000m, give or take.) The gravity turn starts. The result I expected is that the gravity turn progresses based on the shape from that point until the target end altitude. What actually happens is that the turn progresses, it appears, based on something else. I can\u0027t tell if its speed, or % of desired final orbital altitude (as determined by current apoapsis), or what. I wind up with a craft that\u0027s finishing its gravity turn at about 35,000 m, and is at the desired final orbital angle -- i.e. pretty close to horizontal -- and is accelerating to hit the desired apoapsis. 35km is a low atmospheric density region... but it ain\u0027t zero. I\u0027m getting frictional heat generation, inefficiency in the overall ascent profile, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I set the gravity turn starting speed to be something higher than what I expect to be flying at 15km altitude.... perfect gravity turns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo tl;dr I\u0027m not sure if this is a bug or a feature, and thought I\u0027d report it even though I\u0027ve applied my own fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENiether a bug or a feature. You will have to tune your ascent profile to the ship as there is no easy way to auto-tune it. If you need to start the turn at higher speed then that\u0027s what you need to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think your ship may be a little under powered. If you are only hitting 100m/s at 5km altitude, especially in the new aero, you might want to increase your first stage\u0027s twr. I haven\u0027t fiddled much with 1.0.x yet but on the old FAR 1.5 launch TWR was just about optimal. With the new ISP effects a little lower might be better now but I doubt it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matbev1","CreatedById":143435,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T11:25:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoes this mod work with the 1.0.2 KSP??? becuase mine keeps saying its outdated\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"terahurts","CreatedById":58996,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T11:36:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Matbev1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Matbev1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edoes this mod work with the 1.0.2 KSP??? becuase mine keeps saying its outdated\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUse the latest dev build.
