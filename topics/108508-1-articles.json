Your starter rockets are pretty straight forward. Command module, fuel, engine, fins on the radial outside near the bottom (Center of Lift behind Center of Mass). If it doesn\u0027t leave the ground, you have too much mass for the engine.

The main things to remember are that it should have a fairly sleek form (ie. no sudden flat or jutting bits hitting the airstream on your way up), and that you have to perform the gravity turn procedure gradually starting at launch now if you want it to go smoothly. Having an engine with good gimbal capabilities can help a bit with the trip up, and having fins can help even more (though be careful with that if you\u0027re using strap-on boosters: if you have a non-symmetrical distribution of boosters around your fins, it will make you start to turn in usually unwanted directions!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlanes... well, they have a few basic rules. The first is, center of lift behind center of mass. (You can check it with the CoM/CoL indicators in the vehicle construction scene.) That\u0027s always been true, though, so you may well have known that. The next big point with planes is: have enough lift and control with your wings for the plane you\u0027ve built. You can kind of cheese that right now by having absurdly high thrust for the size of your vehicle, but that\u0027s a bit cheat-y. Just like with rockets, keep the design so the part that\u0027s hitting the airstream (the front of the plane) has a needle-like profile for any and all surfaces. Or a ram air intake, which aren\u0027t particularly aerodynamic but are great for making jet engines actually work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"polan","CreatedById":131811,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T11:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a Mun lander with heavy inspiration from a random pic I found:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/716414774609559191/436298A17C77DB093657D3528003439057B68C1C/\u0022 alt=\u0022436298A17C77DB093657D3528003439057B68C1C\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeat, aint it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s a rocket that just didn\u0027t work, and I went for a smaller design; tell me what was wrong with it, for reasons!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/716414774609565466/5E819BDBE74A5EB470E557BDBEC73E9E960C5862/\u0022 alt=\u00225E819BDBE74A5EB470E557BDBEC73E9E960C5862\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks cool, but it doesn\u0027t fly cool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T13:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022moarpower\u0022 data-cite=\u0022moarpower\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHere\u0027s a Mun lander with heavy inspiration from a random pic I found:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/716414774609559191/436298A17C77DB093657D3528003439057B68C1C/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/716414774609559191/436298A17C77DB093657D3528003439057B68C1C/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeat, aint it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, here\u0027s a rocket that just didn\u0027t work, and I went for a smaller design; tell me what was wrong with it, for reasons!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/716414774609565466/5E819BDBE74A5EB470E557BDBEC73E9E960C5862/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/716414774609565466/5E819BDBE74A5EB470E557BDBEC73E9E960C5862/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt looks cool, but it doesn\u0027t fly cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander looks great. Not sure if you need that large reaction wheel, tho. You\u0027ve got the basics covered: Wide base, compact design, and enough delta V from the looks of it.

If the problem is flipping, this might be the fix, and I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s exactly what is bothering your design, as all the lift will be in front of CoM once you drop the side tanks. If you really need finns on your upper stage, you can replace the lower set with delta wings and control surfaces instead, and place them where the SBRs are. That\u0027s what I do on my larger launch vehicles. SBRs can be placed on the tanks instead. If you haven\u0027t already done so, I recommend disabling gimballing on all but the center engines, as the gimbaling is a bit trigger-happy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome things I would do differently (not implying that my way is necessarily better):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- On the center rocket, I would combine the bottom two stages\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I would remove all RCS ports below the upper stage. You have the atmosphere to help you turn around anyway. If needed, large reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Consider separatrons on the outer engines as well as SBRs to ensure clean separation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Launch clamps\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Move monoprop tanks to the upper stage, as it can interfere with the upper fin aerodynamics where they are now.
