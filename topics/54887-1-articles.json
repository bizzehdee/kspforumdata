Aside from the crew tank and the Cupola, there are not many parts which are designed to look good in a station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI therefore decided to make a set of parts on my own. It\u0027s the first set I\u0027m making entirely by myself, which is why I\u0027d like some input regarding the current state of affairs \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of parts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main concern are the tin can bodies of space station modules. Tanks just don\u0027t look like a modern station and since every modder has a different art style, resulting in slightly different measurements, stations tend to look \u0022unprofessional\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut another essential part of space stations are trusses. I\u0027m not sure yet what kind of a design they are going to have, but I\u0027ll try to have them match the stock trusses.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat kind of an art style?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really like the style of the stock cupola. It resembles what I would like the whole station to look like. All of my new parts are going to have the plated look, which can be found both on the cupola and the ISS itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow lets get to the list of parts I planned out so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tin cans main body will be made up from to distinct parts: A cylindrical 1.25m long central piece and a 0.625 long end piece. Both will be shipped in diameters 1.25m, 2.50m, 3.75m and 5m. This enables the creation of all kinds of differently sized modules, by simply stacking centre pieces on top of each other. A welding plugin may be used to reduce the part count prior to launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the main module pieces, there will be adapters to connect all of the different sizes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.25 -\u0026gt; closed end\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.50 -\u0026gt; 1.25\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.75 -\u0026gt; 1.25, 2.50\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.00 -\u0026gt; 1.25, 2.50, 3.75\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese main pieces would not have any \u0022decor\u0022 around them. No windows, no mounts for berthing mechanisms and no ladders. All of those would have to be added later on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s29.postimg.org/3m1el2q1z/parts2_small.png\u0022 alt=\u0022parts2_small.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe seems on the serving suggestion would not be visible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"XanderTek","CreatedById":92553,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T14:50:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you looked at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/35043-0-20-FusTek-Station-Parts-Expansion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esumghai\u0027s FusTek station parts\u003C/a\u003E?
