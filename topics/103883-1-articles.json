I\u0027m very proud to announce my new life as a modder! I\u0027m making a small part mod named \u0022Souper\u0027s Stuff\u0022 as my first mod ever created, it\u0027s in the alpha version right now.\n\nHowever, i do not have very much of a budget at all ATM, so i won\u0027t be spending a penny on this mod. It will be entirely made by me, built by me, independently over time. The first release is a long ways away, and by that i mean you can expect a download link for version #1 within 3-5 days.\n\n**(This is best read with a British voice in your head)**\n\nMy goal is to create a free, no-budget mod the community will appreciate, to mark my entrance into the world of modding. This thread will more or less be my devblog from now on.\n\nMy resources are highly limited, much credit to [Part Generator V3 by Lando](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/48368-Part-Generator-Version-3-Win-Linux-Mac) for some of my part\u0027s models, and to SQUAD for the models i took from them to make the rest. (Seriously, not having any budget means these are the only way i can get models.)\n\n**EDIT: Just learned i don\u0027t need money to make mods at all.**\n\n**Current build: Alpha 1.00 first release**\n\n**Next release: Beta 2 (GIGANTIC REVAMP)**\n\n**Alpha 0.50 Changelog**:\n\n-Added UHLD Mk.I engine\n\n-Added EFCU-420 explodium canister\n\n-Added OS-3001 science module\n\n-Added new resource: Explodium.\n\n-Added tech tree integration.\n\n-Removed old reject parts.\n\n-Removed Herobrine.\n\n**Alpha 1.00 changelog**\n\n-Added new supercomputer part\n\n-Added new data transmitter\n\n-Added new generator\n\n-Removed Herobrine again. Why is he even in KSP?!\n\n**Planned features (Green = next update, Blue = long-term):**\n\nNew 1.0\u002B parts (mod is starting over)\n\n-Remove Herobrine one more time (Seriously! Why does he want to take over my mod?!)\n\nAwaiting Upload\n\nI have decided to re-start the mod because in 0.90 it was absolutely broken. Perhaps 1.0 will be a new chance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T21:34:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Souper**"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T02:02:43Z","Content":"Umm no pics no clicks?"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T02:09:52Z","Content":"What is it exactly?

It\u0027s not a rule on the rule page, but the community made it sort of a unspoken rule.\n\nPeople are very careful on this site about viruses and malware.\n\nYou can even post your dev pics here, just the bare model to give us an idea of what\u0027s coming, and then final pics when you release the parts."},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T19:22:31Z","Content":"[http://imgur.com/gallery/4T50g/new](http://imgur.com/gallery/4T50g/new)\n\nPart list ATM:\n\n-New explodium fuel system for later career mode\n\n-New supercomputer probe core, WIP\n\n-New science module that packs all 4 sensors into 1 (but for some reason can\u0027t do experiments, workling on that)\n\n-More to come"},{"CreatedByName":"Souper","CreatedById":86003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T23:07:12Z","Content":"Souper\u0027s Stuff v.

To make it more efficient, you have to alter the \u0027AtmosphericCurve\u0027 numbers, not the fuel ratio. Higher numbers are better. The best LFO engines have 390. Nuclear engines in the game have 800, so they are much more efficient."},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-11T23:58:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And i\u0027ve no idea on how to put an Imgur album on these forums\n\nHi Souper,\n\nTo add an imgur album to your first post put the stuff in bold ([noparse][http://imgur.com/gallery/](http://imgur.com/gallery/)[/noparse]**4T50g**/new) into [noparse]\n\n\u003E //imgur.com/a///imgur.com/a/4T50g[Javascript is disabled.
