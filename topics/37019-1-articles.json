Perhaps in the future, this problem could be rectified using artificial muscles, which I believe are currently in development, positioned at joint bends in the suit, that are activated by sensors that detect motion or electrical signals from human muscle movement to replicate the motion of the wearer. I remember reading about the use of sensors to allow movement in robotic exoskeletons being studied currently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrewas","CreatedById":24662,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T12:03:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is, that adds many more points of failure and increases the power requirements of the suit considerably.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think counter-pressure suits are the way forward here, at least on the lower limbs, you could use a conventional pressure suit over the torso and upper limbs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbface","CreatedById":58573,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T12:20:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I guess it depends on how efficient they manage to make artificial muscles. May not be a big deal in 20 years time. And what if the muscles fail?
