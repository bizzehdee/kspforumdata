It won\u0027t return to kerbin. And, if I transmit the data, will I get the science points?

The dialog box shows you what percentage you\u0027ll receive on the transmit button. I think it\u0027s 25% for goo pods, for example. Goo and the Science Junior can\u0027t be reused for new measurements after you transmit, unless you \u0027clean\u0027 them using the mobile science lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the \u0027point\u0027 of probes, they are generally lighter than a manned mission, and therefore cheaper to launch. You can also use them for fly-by or impactor missions, which also saves you the delta v that would otherwise be needed to perform an orbital insertion or landing. You can do this with manned pods too, of course, but it requires rather a hard heart to intentionally send Kerbals to their doom.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heimdall5008","CreatedById":114990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T10:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can transmit the science data back to Kerbin if you have an antenna installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut keep in mind that transmission is way less profitable than return of the samples. Only a Crew Report and an EVA report can be transmitted without loss of science points. All other science experiments will only give you between 20% (Material Study) and 50% (Temperature Scan) of the science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T12:18:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is rather useless to send along the rather heavy Goo and Material Bay on one way missions. Best to send along the Too Hot thermometer for the Explore contracts that don\u0027t require a return to Kerbal. You will at least get the contract award even though you won\u0027t get anything for transmitting the data. And, the rocket needed to launch such probes will cost a lot less.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-05T03:22:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could just leave the satellite in orbit around Kerbol for now, and wait until you get tech for the Advanced Grabbing Unit (the claw)... then launch a ship and go capture it (as you would an asteroid) and return it. That\u0027s a long wait for what little Science you\u0027d get from it however; But, a good challenge!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
