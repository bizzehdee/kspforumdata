So far, I haven\u0027t been able to figure out how to thrust limit anything to 50.\n\nI doubt it makes a big difference having your thrust limited to 50 vs 50.5 or 49.5, but it seemed strange that you couldn\u0027t set 25, 50, or 75. \n\nIs this something thrown in by the devs to mess with people who have OCD? Is there maybe another reason? Has anyone found a way to set 25, 50, or 75?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-29T18:06:06Z\u0022 title=\u002203/29/2015 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aser**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T17:22:36Z","Content":"Probably not, I can thrust limit SRBs to 25/50/75 without any problems."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T17:56:54Z","Content":"It\u0027s just one of those quirks about the tweakable system.
