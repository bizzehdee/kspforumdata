There are a lot of ways in which modern Russia is closer to 3rd world than 1st world. You won\u0027t see it as much in Moscow and a handful of other major cities, but periphery is rather poor. The country mostly has infrastructure you don\u0027t see in 3rd world countries, albeit aging, but that doesn\u0027t really help you buy games. Median salary in Russia is about $500/month, which is about a quarter of median salary in US.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther reasons are historical and have to do with piracy. After USSR collapsed, you had a lot of professionals in various industries with\u00A0not much to do. So games were getting pirated and sold, first on floppies, then on CDs, all over the place. If your option in late 90s was buying a licensed game for $40 (IIRC, back then) or paying something like $3-$5 for a pirated copy that\u0027s been fairly well translated, had copy protection stripped, and possibly even some bugs fixed, which one are you going to chose? Eventually, some companies emerged that would make deals with Western publishers to release licensed games cheap. The price range would be in $5-$10, so a little more expensive, but you\u0027d get better translations with professional voice acting and generally better quality overall. Over time, the prices climbed a bit, but still remained much lower than prices for licensed games in US and Europe.\u00A0This became well established practice, and by the time digital distribution came about, they had to deal with the fact that expectation was for a much lower price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFun little side story. When Star Craft came out, somebody in US managed to swipe a copy while stocking shelves the night before, had it transmitted over the internet, and it was cracked, replicated, and available for sale in Moscow before the official launch.

After USSR collapsed, you had a lot of professionals in various industries with\u00A0not much to do. So games were getting pirated and sold, first on floppies, then on CDs, all over the place. If your option in late 90s was buying a licensed game for $40 (IIRC, back then) or paying something like $3-$5 for a pirated copy that\u0027s been fairly well translated, had copy protection stripped, and possibly even some bugs fixed, which one are you going to chose? Eventually, some companies emerged that would make deals with Western publishers to release licensed games cheap. The price range would be in $5-$10, so a little more expensive, but you\u0027d get better translations with professional voice acting and generally better quality overall. Over time, the prices climbed a bit, but still remained much lower than prices for licensed games in US and Europe.\u00A0This became well established practice, and by the time digital distribution came about, they had to deal with the fact that expectation was for a much lower price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFun little side story. When Star Craft came out, somebody in US managed to swipe a copy while stocking shelves the night before, had it transmitted over the internet, and it was cracked, replicated, and available for sale in Moscow before the official launch. Similar things have happened to other games and movies over the year.
