It will also help to get mutliple boosters to the same number so they burn out simulatniously.\n\nUse scenarios:\n\n- Thurst Slider\n\n- Ejection force Slider\n\n- All parachute sliders\n\n- ALL Sliders.\n\n...\n\nThanks for considering!"},{"CreatedByName":"TinfoilChef","CreatedById":43840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:53:20Z","Content":"THIS.
