Bases launch into the air when the Saddle is not properly bolted to the ground. I find that the best way to ensure that it stays put is to drag the Saddle out of my inventory, drop it onto the ground, pick it up and then press X to attach it to the ground. I will usually then try to run into it. If the Saddle isn\u0027t pushed around by the kerbal, then it is properly attached to the ground.

Its successor, Pathfinder, finally realizes that vision. Similarly, certain templates require a specific skill to reconfigure the module into its new configuration. The new requirements add a new challenge to the gameplay without overly complicating the system. But as always, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s your game, your choice, so **you can disable these requirements if you prefer not to play with them.** Simply press Alt P to bring up the Pathfinder settings window, and uncheck the box next to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Crequires resources to reconfigure.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 If you uncheck the box, the Ponderosa won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t require resources to inflate and outfit the module either. Similarly, you can disable the skill requirement.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The directory structure has changed. Please delete the WildBlueIndustries folder before installing this update.\n\n**NOTE:** Please pack up your Ponderosas before applying this patch.\n\n- The Ponderosa now requires RocketParts to inflate the module and to reconfigure it. Be sure to have an ample supply of RocketParts on your vessel. If you prefer to not use this feature, simply press Alt P to bring up the Pathfinder Settings window to disable it.\n\n- Added the Conestoga Multipurpose Logistics Module (MLM). The Conestoga holds a lot more stuff than the Buckboard, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not very hand-portable.\n\n- Added the Mineshaft Portable Crew Tube (PCT). Mount one on each Ponderosa that you want to connect to, and then link them together, just like the KAS pipe.\n\n- Added the Ponderosa Habitat template to the Ponderosa. It will be helpful in the future, but right now it\u0027s decorative.\n\n- Refactored the directory structure for CKAN support.\n\nSide Note: I\u0027ve published the WildBlueTools separately, and after talking with the folks on the CKAN thread, I can bundle 000WildBlueTools folder with DSEV and Pathfinder, but have a .netkan requirement for the latest WildBlueTools along with ModuleManager.
