Procedural / bigger (surface-area-wise) wings. lets face it, stock wings are tiny. I have trouble building anything bigger than a few parts without tricky part clipping and messing up symmetry. Procedural wings would be even better than bigger wings because it would mean that we would only need 2 wing parts per plane (minus control surfaces, canards, etc.) improving performance and ascetics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.)

Don\u0027t get me wrong, I understand why players would want them. However, KSP is about strapping pieces together to make a thing go.
