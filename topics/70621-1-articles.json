I\u0027ve had corrupted and outdated part files do it too. It kind of reminds me of Firefox updates; a new version of Firefox is incompatible with about half of my addons almost every time. It is the same with KSP: mod developers can only react to the version changes after the new version is available, and sometimes the mods are okay, other times they are broken by the new version. Its not the developers\u0027 fault, and its not the modders\u0027 fault, its just the nature of the beast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027m saying is that it may not even be the fault of your computer. I have a quad core Intel 3.4 GHz CPU and 8 GB of memory and I run 16 mods without any problems. You may try downloading the latest versions of all your installed mods, backup your current game, reinstall the game fresh, then test it stock several times (to rule out your PC), then start adding mods one at a time and testing until it breaks (to rule out the individual mods). Or the fresh install and updated versions of your mods could solve your problem (would mean you had outdated or incompatible mods before). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this gives you some insight on your problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"luizopiloto","CreatedById":97503,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T03:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEnhanced Navball, Navball Docking, Rasterpropmonitor, Kerbal Engineer... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T06:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK.
