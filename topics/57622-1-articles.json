I\u0027ve been pondering this myself and think we could combine a number of these ideas into a better framework - I\u0027m not certain exactly which specific ideas I\u0027m combining here but it feels more like I\u0027m using old ideas in a new way, rather than being revolutionary!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy aim is to keep it light and simple but make it feel more like something is being accomplished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EResearch Projects\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently research is unfocused, we spam each biome with every device to get as much science as possible. IRL research is focused on a specific goal, and I think should be in KSP too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResearching the next node in the tree would be a research project: There would be a cost (when money is implemented) - either static or over time - and importantly, a specific set of device measurements/samples, etc to be collected from across the system that are required to unlock that node - so an advanced materials research project could require surface sample from 3 moon biomes, for example. On return of the correct data to either a lab or Kerbin the research would become unlocked (possibly with a time delay?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBenefits seem to me to be: No research points, no transmission losses, a different challenge for each research node, the economical challenge of actually being able to afford the research.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownsides: The linking of measurement to research might be a bit far fetched (like what would goo research \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E provide!?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDevelopment \u0026amp; testing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo add a bit more depth to the unlocking of new parts, after research on potential parts has been completed there could be a requirement for development/testing of these parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach new part could require launching on a test (non-profit making, when money arrives!) craft, to prove the prototype works. Naturally costs (when around) of constructing these craft would limit when you can test new parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain trying to keep things light and fun, but challenging, there could be certain conditions required to prove the parts fitness. This could be as complex or as simple as people want, such as simply reaching a certain altitude, or achieving an atmospheric entry of over 500m/s. My personal favourite would be crash testing - yes an actual excuse and reason to crash your craft into Kerbin (or the mun) during a careeer mode game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce the part has been proved then it becomes available for use in any vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBenefits: A (hopefully) more involved but fun \u0026amp; challenging way of unlocking parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownsides: Having to test \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E part could become laborious, especially on mods with large no\u0027s of parts (although it could just mean you are more selective in what to prototype)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMisc suggestions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScience devices should be grouped together in specific research nodes, rather than spread across many. Currently there has to be grinding/spamming of biomes every time a new device is unlocked, which is often! Instead there should be a basic group of devices, followed by a more advanced group later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe research \u0027tree\u0027 suffers from becoming very broad very quickly (as you\u0027d expect from a tree structure). This allows a wide range of choices for what to research next and makes it easy for players to cherry pick the best ones. Instead there should be several much \u0027flatter\u0027 (maybe even simply linear) research streams to basically force players to a certain level of progression. If there was an independent stream for each section of parts (Pods, propulsion, control etc) users could still focus on specific areas but have to do so within controlled conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it.

For the record, I worked a while ago on a RPG system based on this concept - \u0022You become what you do\u0022. But there\u0027s something frustrating in this if it doesn\u0027t keep a part of player-handed attribution, because if you just become what you do, you\u0027re equally no more than that. And the points system already exists - in terms feasability, it\u0027s more convenient to re-use it than to just forget about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the goals your mention, seems to me like achievements: shouldn\u0027t we use it as conditions (solar flight under x altitude, moons rock from x biomes, and eventually moon bases or else if you like KAS for example, but we should already start a list \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E ) to unlock the tech in which parts are unlockable?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, using achievements again to unlock parts individually seems quite overlapping (don\u0027t know if I\u0027m explaining rightly there). Instead, if the use of points is limited by the locked/unlocked nodes, and has for purpose to unlock parts individually, the \u0022you-become-what-you-do\u0022 still safe, with the advantage to manage a re-use of the native science points system (without mentionning even that it enable soooo many research to do that you\u0027re pretty sure you can\u0027t just unlock everything by maxing output on minmus and mun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAffecting the points you earn still be quite fun if you can\u0027t go ubber on space planes without having ever use it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, concerning the upgrades.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t really thought about that before reading your crash-test idea - that\u0027s more in this way I were conceiving it. Maybe, upgrade is not a good term - I guess we can see this levelling type as a malus remover more than bonus giver. That was what I meant by \u0022unlocking prototypes\u0022 - some kind of downgraded parts that reach there full potential after some kind of uses (several launches, atmospheric entries, orbital flight, crashes, docking? ...). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELevelling up parts, I\u0027m not so convinced about.

See what I mean?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExactly. That\u0027s why I might have seen it like that: the difference is that you can launch a prototype, and eventually fix it later with the knowledge acquired by experience in the interval. I mean, if KAS can add part to a ship while in orbit, it is necessarily possible to \u0022update\u0022 a part on the same way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is that the crash test idea is really interesting, since it involve a wider range of evolution ingame. But there\u0027s two things embarrassing in the fact that \u0022blank launches\u0022 should be required to make a real use of the parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- redundant gamedesign\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- what about restart?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, I guess I would find it fun to crash some parts sometimes.

Instead, having it seperated from a multi stages launch, observing it\u0027s atmospheric entry and crash to up a little to a more stable state seems more interesting, because more collateral. And it preserve the fact you need several uses, in term of occurencies and times, to unlock a better part having this one as prerequisite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn other word, if we \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E do specific action to \u003Cem\u003Euse\u003C/em\u003E a part after having unlocked it, I think it will become borring in the tenth first ones.

Sure, we should have a list of what is required for a specific part to \u0022stabilize\u0022 it; and in this vision, you can always make a specific prototypal test to rush on a upper tech level (for example with your excedent credits when it will be implemented). But as it is a passive system, even if you don\u0027t specifically make tests (you\u0027re no more forced to since you can use protypal parts in regular ships), you \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E eventually \u0022stabilize\u0022 it without requiring a redundant gamedesign process.
