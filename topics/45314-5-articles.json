It might be harder to do in KSP than FPS games, but DCS A10 has a replay function and it\u0027s certainly at least as computationally heavy as KSP. A big job for sure, but theoretically possible. Tracking the fragments of explosions might be a bit much, probably best to let regular KSP physics take over when an explosion occurs. This does raise possible problems (for example, one explosion might kick off debris that destroys a second object, but when replayed the explosion doesn\u0027t happen quite the same way and so you get a different result from the replay).
