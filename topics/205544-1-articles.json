I\u0027m using VSR, which adds a few of its own parts, so I better mention it. Everything else is just graphics mods like Scatterer or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I want to note at this point that I am by no means a good storyteller.

Please just bear with me, especially in early-game stuff)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe game started just like any other, really. Get some pad science, launch the first rocket, etc. So far, so normal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it\u0027s possible to reasonably reach orbit as soon as the Swivel is unlocked. I\u0027ve done that myself in the past. But I decided to stick to SRBs for a bit and achieve some altitude records - get as much science and money as early as possible without too many risks. Plus, I\u0027ll need those heat shields!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd not having playing KSP for a bit, this was also when I was reminded of how great this game can be. Sort of felt like the first career all over again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yuXBGMk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.50\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/yuXBGMk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, I ended up just a few kilometers shy of reaching space. I limited the engine so I wouldn\u0027t have to worry about heat (and passing out), but that might have made up the missing bit. So I ended up using liquid fuel to reach space... and then come back to the ground a few hundred kilometers downrange. Surprisingly, that used a bit of ablator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022do39SlK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.50\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/do39SlK.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the bright side, this allowed me to test whether the pod would flip and ruin my day when I come back from orbit later (it didn\u0027t).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout reaching orbit... without how high up my apoapsis is, going into orbit turned into a bit of guesswork.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00223X7TJyw.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.50\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/3X7TJyw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTypically, I aim for around 85 km, but this time my orbit ended up over 130km above the surface!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022i2Dq00b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.50\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/i2Dq00b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s important is that I reached orbit and came back safely. And it\u0027s not like the first real orbits were perfect, either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext (and so far last) item on the itinerary was the Mun. And that took more tries than I hoped. At this point, I want to remind you that I don\u0027t have reverts, I paid for every attempt!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven that I know very little about my orbits and 18 tons don\u0027t give a lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, the idea was to just briefly enter the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, get the contract done, and immediately return.\u003Cbr\u003E\nEquipped with a calculator and the vis-viva equation (I mean, how else was I supposed to do this?), I discovered that attempts no.1 and 2 would fall short of the Mun, by less than 100m/s to boot. In terms of distance, that\u0027s, like, two thirds of the way to go. At least I could gather some high orbit science.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAttempt 3 was just a total failure. Fuel management was a disaster on that flight, let\u0027s not talk about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI rearranged the tanks a bit to have more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in the upper stage. I had to stage earlier, but\u00A0 some 900m/s worth of fuel were left.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFinally! At last I could... miss the Mun by what I can only imagine to be a few thousand kilometers, maybe even less. Turns out I was just a little too far ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis being KSP, I decided to wait a few orbits instead of giving up. And sure enough, around 12 days later...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022aQAcIsV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002287.50\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/aQAcIsV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been this relieved about a Mun encounter before. Not even my very first missions felt that tense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mun contract gave me enough money to upgrade my tracking station, but I\u0027m torn between it and the launch pad. Mass is a huge limiting factor right now, and I think I can achieve orbit with only the lines and nothing else. Or I could go into aviation and eventually upgrade both. I cannot wait to fly an aircraft without reverts! (/s)\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the end of that mission marked the end of my session, so I have plenty of time to come up with an answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly look forward to continuing this, that was a lot of fun! I noticed that I\u0027m a lot more careful than usual.

If I can\u0027t make it now, I certainly won\u0027t then. I went for the Reliant instead of the Swivel for this one, the idea being that it\u0027s lighter and provides more thrust, so I could pack more fuel into the stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd while that did work, I probably won\u0027t do that a second time. It took over three times as long just to pitch to 45\u00B0! That kinda put the mission in jeopardy, I didn\u0027t think the Reliant would be this bad to control!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made it into orbit, but I burnt a lot more fuel than expected. I had about 1500 m/s left (I started with around 2600!). That might just be enough to reach orbit and go back? I went for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n660 m/s at the end of the injection. 380 after capture.\u003Cbr\u003E\n... 98 m/s after escape.
