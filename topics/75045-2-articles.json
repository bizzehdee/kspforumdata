Why? Because they can get turned-off at the whim of the weather. Nuclear power can provide huge amounts of power (a.k.a. 1GW per reactor), and it can run continuously. The new ACR-1000 design here in Canada will likely replace our older EC6 reactors, and we don\u0027t usually build just one. A single station with eight reactors will output a whopping 8GW of power, with almost no stoppage. This is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E achievable with solar, wind, or even hydroelectric power (unexpected lack of inflow water can lead to the station needing to run at well below capacity). You need backups, preferably ones that can start very quickly, like gas turbines, to fill the gap, or risk brown-outs and black-outs, which aren\u0027t just an inconvenience, but a serious public safety issue, as well as a huge hit to a local economy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENuclear power gives you a solid foundation to build on.
