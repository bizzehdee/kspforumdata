I\u0027ll try to align my parts to be consistent with stock prices, but maybe a bit higher depending on the total science potential (the telescope and imaging platform have a pretty huge pool of available science because they can make orbital biome-dependent results).

My thinking was to basically match the cost of stock parts, but to add a cost penalty based on potential science gain. So the telescope and imaging platform, which both have 100% transmission and support biome reports from low orbit, are a bit more expensive than the comparable parts (I think I should actually increase their cost a lot more). Whereas the parts that require a bit more work, or have lower potential are somewhat cheaper. The solar particle collector, for example, has a very low transmission rate (you get a big boost from the lab processing though), only allows for four sample to be collected, and doesn\u0027t support biomes, so it\u0027s a bit cheaper.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Universal Storage parts are all quite a bit heavier than their standard counterparts.
