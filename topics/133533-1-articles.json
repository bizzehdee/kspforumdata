(the rate I have seen them use fuel in the past)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any help and suggestions you can provide!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FullMetalMachinist","CreatedById":156531,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-05T15:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off, welcome to the forums! Lots of helpful and friendly people around who will help you out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for your situation, I just want to get the obvious questions out of the way. You\u0027re not using any mods are you? Are you using fuel lines between any of your fuel tanks? There can be some funky fuel flow effects with multiple decouplers and fuel lines.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, while your description is fairly good, a picture really is worth a thousand words. Please post a screenshot or two of your ship so we can take a look.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
