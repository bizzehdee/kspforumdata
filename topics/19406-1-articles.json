You just wait.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is definitely the easiest solution. The fact is that without cheating in your orbits, there is no way that they are going to have exactly the same orbital periods. Even if you did space them at perfect 90 degree intervals, they will eventually drift from those positions too. One test you can do is decouple two pieces of junk from an orbiting ship at the same time, then max out the timestep. Eventually the two pieces of junk will be on opposite sides of the mun from each other, and then at some point in the future the same side of the mun again. If you have enough things in space on approximately the same orbit, they will on average be evenly spaced around the mun as you desire. Another trick you could use is to have one go retrograde. Then they would only be at the same longitude twice per orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have already also suggested, if for some reason you really do want to adjust your position along an orbit relative to another orbiting object, to catch up with that object you need to decrease your altitude at an apsis, and to go slower than that object you need to increase your altitude at an apsis. Once you are at the correct angle relative to that object, do another burn to synch up the orbits. This requires fuel of course, and is not permanent for the reason I described above. This technique is very useful for rendezvous though.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-16T04:51:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2012 04:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by VincentLaw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikkri","CreatedById":40099,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T12:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022togfox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022togfox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou mean like ...
