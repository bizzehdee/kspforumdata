That is, Kerbals don\u0027t do well on floating objects.\n\nI actually found an old copy of this mod on one of the Russian fan sites. It does have a \u0027free to do whatever with license\u0027 so it\u0027s adaptable. But apparently it attempted to fix the problem by changing the status of the entire ship from splashed to landed. And, if a Kerbal fell down, it attempted to push them along with the ship. I loaded it up and tinkered with it and I can say this:\n\nIt doesn\u0027t play nice with hyperedit and it doesn\u0027t appear to work any more. It does appear to briefly change the status but it gets changed right back. Kerbals are still considered landed but the ship is splashed. The code is pretty short and I can somewhat follow it (I\u0027m not a C# programmer by any stretch). If someone more familiar with C# would take a look at it and see if it can be fixed, I\u0027d be more than happy to add it to the pack. I\u0027ve archived a copy here: [SeaSicknessCure_0.21.rar](http://www.kerbaltopia.com/Maritime)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E And of course I have a number of requests ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Side thrusters in the bows and sterns to improve maneuvering.\n\nWhile I\u0027ve already considered this, there are issues I haven\u0027t resolved yet.\n\nHere\u0027s the choices:\n\n1. Thrusters use RCS/Monopropellant\n\n2. Thrusters are bolt on engines\n\n3. Thrusters are built-in engines\n\nProblems:\n\n1: Pretty unrealistic and bolt-on radials already exist in-game. Adds weight with monopropellant.\n\n2: Any bolt on engine is subject to getting ripped off and, if added below the water line, adds some flotation. Requires a fuel that has weight. Creates drag. If it has mass and below the water line, lots of drag.\n\n3: As soon as the user \u0027stages\u0027 the part with thrusters, the engines turn on. If a user isn\u0027t paying attention they\u0027ll be thrusting forward and from the sides burning fuel. They\u0027d have to know to assign them to a hotkey and turn them off and on individually.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Reverse thrust for actually stopping (boats at present seem to coast along at 0.1-0.2m/s forever)\n\nThought of this too when trying to stop one of my ships. I\u0027ll have to look at how other mods, like Firespitter handle this. I\u0027m pretty sure this is custom DLL stuff. AFAIK, the only way to do this stock is to create a second engine pointed in the opposite direction and toggle it on and off. You\u0027d have 2 engine icons for one part. I\u0027m also pretty sure Firespitter is going to be a strongly recommended mod sooner or later.\n\nFor now, here\u0027s a trick to try. Add ONE bitt to the bottom of your ship. When you need to stop fast, turn the compressor on. You\u0027ll be astounded at the results.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* RO-RO bows and sterns, plus hollow cargo hull sections, so I can make LSTs for rovers.\n\nAlready considered this. For a RoRo, It\u0027ll take some time for me to learn Blender and animations. Blender is NOT user friendly. For the cargo hulls, I\u0027ve already created a hollow hull and it promptly sunk. Plus, water isn\u0027t displaced in KSP, it intrudes into the spaces. If I create a hollow hull, you\u0027ll see the water inside the hull.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* A \u0022tri-coupler\u0022 square stern with a row of 3 big, rear-facing attachment nodes, the better to stick a boat atop a rocket to send it to Laythe.\n\nI\u0027ll consider this. Getting a ship to Laythe and Eve via rocket is part of the plan, I just haven\u0027t figured out a good \u0027realistic\u0027 way to do this.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* A hull section with portholes and a small deckhouse entry hatch that can house a company of Marines.\n\nAlready planned. I\u0027ll probably add berthing to the Focsle.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Multiple flavors of intermodal shipping containers that stack and can connect on the ends. Flavors to include KIS storage, tankage for all resources, housing units, and just hollow boxes that small rovers could be stored in.\n\nGreat idea! Other than Infernal robotics, how would you get them on and off the ship?\u0027\n\nBTW, there used to be a mod on the old spaceport with shipping containers. It apparently evaporated in the move to Curse.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Square-rigged masts of several sizes. Poweved by \u0022witchcraft\u0022 (some system to fake the direction and strength of \u0022wind\u0022 based on lat/lon and heavy randomness). Kerbals would have to go aloft frequently to trim the sails to make the boat move in approximately the desired direction based on changes in the fake wind.\n\u003E \n\u003E Nifty ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nYou mean something like the image below?\n\nThat\u0027s part of what inspired me to create this mod. Here\u0027s how that modder handled the problem. The sails are solar collectors and work on the solar panel principle. He created a new resource (solar thrust) and the sails collect and hold a small amount of it. Based on their facing toward the sun you collect varying amounts of solar thrust. As you throttle up, each sail generates forward thrust. The thrust can be turned on or off so that you can collect solar power from the sides. A later version I had jibs and a mizzen to collect when I was moving perpendicular to the sun.\n\nThe problems with this method:\n\n1: The sails generate the thrust. Thus, your ship pitches forward the higher the sail is off the deck.\n\n2: The sails collect solar energy from only one direction. This means sailing into the sun requires a backward facing sail to collect and an opposing sail to thrust. It also means that if you want to collect solar energy from all points of the compass you\u0027ll need a minimum of 4 sails.\n\n3: If a sail gets blocked from the sun by another sail, it becomes drag.\n\nNeedless to say, I had gobs of hotkeys assigned to raise and lower sails depending on which way the sun faced and which way I wanted to go. They were also pretty low thrust (2-4) and I had to add pontoons to make it float. My best speed with great sun was 17m/s.\n\nWithout actual \u0027wind\u0027 there aren\u0027t many realistic choices.\n\nSo, have I thought about this? Oh yes, and I have a few ideas I\u0027m going to test but this is well down the road. Rest assured, hoisting the jolly roger is on my to-do list.\n\n![sailing1.jpg](http://www.datainterlock.com/Kerbal/sailing1.jpg)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Found an effective delivery system:\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/izRaZ5p.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/izRaZ5p.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ...

Kerbals are little engines. If you place a blocky object on the bow of your ship and run your Kerbal into the side of it and keep running... your ship will turn.

Story of my first ship: I decide to make a simple fuel tanker for refueling my crafts that have either landed on water (including other ships) or crafts on the island runway. I have some issues with the launching system at first, eventually having to add bitts to the back of the launching rig so the brakes can get decent traction. Eventually I get it to the water, discover I have to fully fill the rear bitts for the craft not to dip the bow underwater, and throttle up to test the speed. After getting to around 5-6 or less M/s, the jumbo orange tank clipped into the deck explodes, and pretty much all of the bitts and stuff on deck fly off except for the superstructure and what it had glued onto it. The ship pings up to float much higher in the water with the reduced load, and I somehow have some oxidizer on board despite the \u0022oil bins\u0022 (Oscar-Bs to fuel the vernors) flying off in the kraken attack to stop the ship and recover it. I promptly recover all remaining debris and find that beta 0.0.1 has been released. That design is being sent to the scrapyard and I am going to attempt to build a less explosion prone design."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T19:56:06Z","Content":"Did you do anything with Better Buoyancy support though?

These are both easily fixed with some simple part.cfg editing, but it can be a bit tedious to redo it every update.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T20:20:19Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 08:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mike9606**"}]}
