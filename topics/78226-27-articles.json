I figured out why Kerbals were suddenly losing their experience again, despite the fact that I fixed that in 0.90. They\u0027re being killed TWICE now by the stock game (and you lose the reputation twice as well). So StageRecovery was removing only one of the \u0022Die\u0022 events and not the other. Additionally, in the Tracking Station, if you terminate a flight their flight log doesn\u0027t include a \u0022Die\u0022 event and isn\u0027t archived, so StageRecovery fixes that as well in the next version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, the next version of StageRecovery should work in the Tracking Station as well. Powered recovery probably won\u0027t, I\u0027m taking a look at it to see if I can make it work. You have to terminate the flights in the atmosphere for it to work at all though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I\u0027ve added a PSA in the first post reminding everyone to set their Min Pressure to 0.5 and activating their parachutes when they stage. My tests show they deploy around 4.5km, which should be low and slow enough for them to deploy properly. You might need a higher value, do some testing to find out. If you drop the stage above ~10km and are still on your way to space, you\u0027re probably ok not to activate the chutes at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should have a new version out either today or tomorrow with all of these changes (depending on how much else I want to put in it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENew version released, 1.5.7 for KSP 1.0.4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMostly bug fixes and a few quality of life things.
