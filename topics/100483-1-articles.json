The docker maneuvered around the dockee to line up the docking ports.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I had a ship dropping off a base at the Mun which had quite a bit more fuel than it needed for the return flight to Kerbin. As it happened, I also had another ship in orbit waiting to return a large rover back to Kerbin. It probably had enough fuel, but it certainly needed more than the other ship. So I decided to dock the two to transfer fuel, at which point I noticed that neither had any kind of RCS. After a very brief amount of time thinking about it, I figured I\u0027d just arrest all relative velocity between the two ships after they were close enough, then point their docking ports towards each other, and give a short engine burst to get one of them moving (both ports were axial). It worked perfectly. So perfectly, in fact, that I sat there wondering why I hadn\u0027t been doing that all along with all docking operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, not all ships have axial ports, and main engines are worthless for radial ports. But once you control from the docking port, RCS automatically thrusts in the correct direction based on translation controls. Get to zero relative velocity, control from the docking ports, aim towards the target (each ship targets the other), then close the gap. With especially large ships, you need to switch back and forth adjusting the aim, as the slow speeds you want to be using between two behemoths give time for the different orbital paths to change relative orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn particular, it\u0027s shockingly better when docking a large tanker to a large fuel station (\u0026gt;1000t each). Previously, I\u0027d burn up hundreds (if not thousands) of units of fuel maneuvering the tanker into position. Now I just burn at target retrograde until relative velocity is 0, then switch back and forth between station and tanker, pointing each to the other\u0027s targeted docking port, until the two docking ports are facing each other and square. A short burst of RCS to close the gap, a few minor adjustments back and forth, and they\u0027re docked, after using a miniscule amount of fuel. I could even get away with no RCS at all if need be, using just reaction wheels and main engines (with the latter tweaked to minimal output, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, am I the only one that did it the hard way until the easy way became the only way in a certain situation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T01:35:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHuh.
