The docker maneuvered around the dockee to line up the docking ports.\n\nThen I had a ship dropping off a base at the Mun which had quite a bit more fuel than it needed for the return flight to Kerbin. As it happened, I also had another ship in orbit waiting to return a large rover back to Kerbin. It probably had enough fuel, but it certainly needed more than the other ship. So I decided to dock the two to transfer fuel, at which point I noticed that neither had any kind of RCS. After a very brief amount of time thinking about it, I figured I\u0027d just arrest all relative velocity between the two ships after they were close enough, then point their docking ports towards each other, and give a short engine burst to get one of them moving (both ports were axial). It worked perfectly. So perfectly, in fact, that I sat there wondering why I hadn\u0027t been doing that all along with all docking operations.\n\nSure, not all ships have axial ports, and main engines are worthless for radial ports. But once you control from the docking port, RCS automatically thrusts in the correct direction based on translation controls. Get to zero relative velocity, control from the docking ports, aim towards the target (each ship targets the other), then close the gap. With especially large ships, you need to switch back and forth adjusting the aim, as the slow speeds you want to be using between two behemoths give time for the different orbital paths to change relative orientation.\n\nIn particular, it\u0027s shockingly better when docking a large tanker to a large fuel station (\u003E1000t each). Previously, I\u0027d burn up hundreds (if not thousands) of units of fuel maneuvering the tanker into position. Now I just burn at target retrograde until relative velocity is 0, then switch back and forth between station and tanker, pointing each to the other\u0027s targeted docking port, until the two docking ports are facing each other and square. A short burst of RCS to close the gap, a few minor adjustments back and forth, and they\u0027re docked, after using a miniscule amount of fuel. I could even get away with no RCS at all if need be, using just reaction wheels and main engines (with the latter tweaked to minimal output, of course).\n\nSo, am I the only one that did it the hard way until the easy way became the only way in a certain situation?"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T01:35:12Z","Content":"Huh. I\u0027ve always heard of non-RCS docking always assumed it was next to impossible.

Visualize the target\u0027s docking port like it\u0027s main ring is making a plane - you basically want to have your current ship\u0027s port just outside of that plane, scraping along it\u0027s surface. I sometimes do that when changing out stations for improved models, or with specific types of vessels.\n\nUpdate: Oh one thing that helps in this circumstance, if you\u0027re a bit fast while going past that docking port and/or a bit far, you can turn your ship towards the other ship to slow down the relative speed between the two docking ports and bring them closer (or farther apart, depending on the location of the port and the timing of the turn)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I hear that the new pilot/sas thingy will also be good enough in most cases.

I\u0027ve noticed that really early KSPs have TERRIBLE SAS). The newest one is actually a bit worse, I find (and terrible like the ancient one if you tell it to hold a specific target).\n\nIf you take full control during the docking part (no SAS), you can often counteract the shake with the right movements (aim to dampen it). That sort of shimmying nonsense can happen even with nose-to-nose docking and such at times... countersteer ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Indeed.
