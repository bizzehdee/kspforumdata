I know, that you cannot attach stuff to animated objects, as that stuff will just hang in the air, when its parent object moves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i had an idea to make control surfaces as part of the animated model. The problem is- as soon as i describe control surface in the Unity as obj_ctrlSrf, it breaks its animation. The control surface object hangs in the air, while all other parts behave as they should be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any trick to make control surfaces move in space? Or is there any way to make the part use two separate models- one with animation, and the one in its \u0022working\u0022 state?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for my poor English.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Flitter","CreatedById":33550,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T15:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know almost nothing of modding, but making it so the entire wing acts as a control surface, like a winglet, sounds like a quick fix, but that\u0027s just my 2 cents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vertibirdo","CreatedById":76243,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-05T18:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Flitter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Flitter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know almost nothing of modding, but making it so the entire wing acts as a control surface, like a winglet, sounds like a quick fix, but that\u0027s just my 2 cents.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for your answer, but no. Whenever i describe an object as control surface, it cancels any animation, other than animation via key controls in game. So i cannot make it foldable. I guess i should be able to, somehow, make two instances of an object, like one object with custom animation, and another object with control surface animation. But i cannot understand how to make it possible, as i don\u0027t even know, where to start and how to make one part consist of several models.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-06T10:53:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps you could use the Infernal Robotics plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt allows you to attach parts to movable joints, rails and things like that.
