I think I\u0027m doing it mostly right from what I remember such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Thrust\u0022\u003ECOT\u003C/abbr\u003E aligned, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E just higher and behind the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E etc. and as best I can see I\u0027ve put the wheels straight. The problem I\u0027m having though is when I\u0027m trying to go along the runway, the plane is veering off to one side and blowing up. This is happening about 5-10 seconds in, and dropping my acceleration doesn\u0027t seem to do much to help it.
