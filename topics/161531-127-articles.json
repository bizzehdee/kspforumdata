When you want to slow-warp, start charging the warp drive, activate the small power plant (if inactive), then shut down the main power plant. The warp drive will stay charged, and when activated it will go a lot slower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you\u0027re done slow warping and want to use the main propulsion to get a circular orbit again, just activate the main power plant again, and thrust as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis works because the ships ability to warp depends on the size and type of warp drive (larger/heavier = can warp heavier ships), but the SPEED the warp drive can reach is determined by the maximum amount of power the ship can generate in its current configuration (deactivated reactors/generators don\u0027t count).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis allows you to better control the warp drive\u0027s speed, but it requires at least 2 more parts to be added to the ship. Don\u0027t use something like a 0.625m molten salt reactor for this, it won\u0027t have enough power to get a useful speed unless it\u0027s a very small ship indeed (think 0.001c).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Small Molten Salt Reactors are now especially unsuitable for this task now that their low core temperature makes the generator attached to them even more inefficient than before (low delta-t = low Carnot efficiency, because thermodynamics).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I mostly use that tiny reactor for long-duration probes and things with fusion reactors on them (to charge the Jumpstart on the ICF reactor).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQuick question, do the other fusion reactors not have jump-start ability? If they don\u0027t, they probably should. That or add a Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage part which can be used to add that to any fusion reactor (or just store MegaJoules in general).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, why does the Direct Conversion Generator\u0027s efficiency depend on reactor core (aka heat exchanger) temperature?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt should be fixed at whatever upgrade level\u0027s maximum is, because direct conversion doesn\u0027t depend on temperature. Instead it depends on the kinetic energy and charge of the charged particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that efficiency should depend on the reaction being used, not the reactor containing the reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask because I have a smallish probe that has one ICF fusion reactor feeding a direct conversion generator (Hexaborane fueled), and one Molten Salt reactor feeding a Thermal generator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeither reactor/generator combination connects with the other one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have more than enough radiators to keep the whole thing from ever overheating even if 100% of the power was converted to heat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why does the efficiency of the Direct Conversion generator on the fusion reactor read at something like 50%?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a fully unlocked tech tree, isn\u0027t the maximum efficiency of the DC generator supposed to be like 89% or something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps it\u0027s something with the Molten Salt reactors.

High Isp is generally a good thing, except if you try to escape a gravity well. In Kspi, There are 2 kinds of gas core reactors, the open cycle and closed cycle.

These reactor were not ment for power production. The problem is that at full power the produces gases would melt the electric generator. In order to allow the to be used in Bi-model mode, the need lower their core temperature, which consequently lowers their power output.

The bug is happening with hydrolox and hydrazine (haven\u0027t tried any other fuels yet). When I launch with just the thermal nozzle, the thrust when using hydrolox and hydrazine does not increase with altitude. Even in space the thrust is the same as it is on the ground, and that includes using srb\u0027s to get to space. This is making thrust with hydrazine and hydrolox LESS than it is with hydrogen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I\u0027m aware, thrust should be 1.4x hydrogen using hydrazine and 2x hydrogen using hydrolox, so I\u0027m thinking this is a bug with the atmosphere curve of those 2 fuels, and most probably other fuels as well.
