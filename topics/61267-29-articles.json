You can go back in time, tweak the staging, and be on your merry way. So, REMEMBER IT Kiddos. It\u0027s like the Time Stone. Once you see it, you never forget it.

When piloting massive crafts, it\u0027s a big no-no, but when driving a rover, or a spacecraft that just deployed its parachutes, Physics Warp can save lots of time. I mean, who wants to wait 153.84 seconds waiting for your ship to land when going at 6.5m/s a thousand feet in the air? Nobody except a masochist that is. So, use Physics Warp. Simple as that.

If you want a well functioning rocket, spaceship, airplane, spaceplane etc then you\u0027re in for a ride! Don\u0027t expect to have succes in your first try. And don\u0027t expect to have succes on your second (third, fourth...etc) try as well. And don\u0027t panic, you will see explosions anyhow.\u00A0Maybe a helmet comes in handy for the times you want to bang your head against the wall. KSP is in that sense a real trail and error (lots of error) game.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0I\u0027m playing ksp quite a lot for a couple of years now and still manage to fail/crash/explode on a regular basis. \u003Cem\u003E\u0022I was going to make it, but then that planet was in the way...\u0022\u003C/em\u003E The biggest reward to me is when a mission goes according to plan without failure.

This isn\u0027t a game for the light hearted in that sense. Prepare to do a bit of study, even when not playing KSP. A basic understanding of orbital mechanics and aerodynamics is crucial for succesfull missions. Understanding things like \u0022Speed and position are allways relative to something else\u0022 or \u0022When I accelerate prograde at periapsis, my apoapsis will rise\u0022 will help you understand what you actually see in KSP. Try to understand the terminology. If you like you can take this to university levels of knowledge, including formulae for calculating phase angles and the sorts. These real life formulae actually work in KSP as well. But understanding the basics is enough to have fun and understanding in the Kerbal universe. You\u0027ll actually learn a lot by just playing KSP! But if you are willing to expand your knowledge about flight and spaceflight it will help you a great deal in reaching those far away places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A03. The Navball is your biggest friend. Try to understand and memorise what the symbols on the navball mean.

More than once I landed with Formula 1 speeds (=explosion)\u00A0because I was intensly looking at my heading/the navball, ignoring my speed, altitude and....everything else basically. By the way, even to modern standards I think KSP has some very beautiful visuals here and there. Just look away from the navball once in a while.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A05. Use the forum. Don\u0027t hesitate to ask questions. There are no stupid questions.
