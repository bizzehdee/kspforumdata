When the drag overcomes your control authority, you go for a spin. You can decrease drag by staying closer to prograde and building a more aerodynamic rocket. You can increase control using engine gimbals, stabilizer wheels, and control surfaces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that drag increases significantly right around mach one (340 m/s).
