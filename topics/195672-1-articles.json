If needed you can have multiple colliders. Generally the collider will be a simplified version of the model - for example a 24 sided fuel tank typically has a 12 sided collider. And if you can use a collider primitive (box, sphere or capsule) it\u0027s even better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Colliders also need to be convex - in Unity there is a checkbox in the mesh collider object you need to check.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Though I don\u0027t think this is your problem (both the model and collider would be rotated) when Blender exports a model using the Collada exporter the model will be rotated 90 degrees when imported to Unity - I don\u0027t know if other formats do the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cukkoo","CreatedById":204373,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-19T01:12:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy mesh collider has 118 tris\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
