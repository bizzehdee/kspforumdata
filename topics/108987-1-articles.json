Spending too long below 40km (and especially below 30km) can result in considerable drag losses that are very expensive in terms of dV.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Olterin","CreatedById":116073,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T15:05:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the two posters above me said, you should aim for a (25-)30 degree climb by 20 km altitude. My latest ascent profile was somewhat like: go up to 10km while going at roughly mach 2, begin final ascent, go full throttle at 12-13km, switch to rockets when jets cut out. This leads to some overheating issues if the spaceplane isn\u0027t carefully designed though, but it worked for me. Final jet velocity was about 1350 m/s, from there I think I used around 1200 m/s to get a final circular orbit at 80km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_2","CreatedById":63827,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T15:07:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022EtherDragon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022EtherDragon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPart of it might be your flight profile, too.

I\u0027ll go for a 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 climb until 20km when the rapiers cut out, then I\u0027ll pitch up to ~20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0, and at 35km altitude I\u0027ll pitch down again (to 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0). Then I\u0027ll reduce throttle on the way so the apogee is never more than 1 minute in front of me. That\u0027s much more efficient...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I\u0027ll pitch up never more than 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (except for the sub-sonic part of the lower atmosphere but that doesn\u0027t really matter). And I\u0027ll make a very long low power burn \u0027towards the horizon\u0027 until apogee is 70km.
