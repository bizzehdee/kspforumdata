In our mind, cars and aircraft are all pretty nice and solid objects. Even with a high speed car crash against you see that does not work out any more, with the sheet metal very obviously just being that and tearing, folding and disintegrating into nothingness.\n\nThe car industry does a great job of building cars that feel like strong little fortresses ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Too bad the lie works best when people buy the car, not when we most need it."},{"CreatedByName":"SuperFastJellyfish","CreatedById":57985,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T13:12:25Z","Content":"It reminds me of this:\n\n[https://youtu.be/Nl8xTqTUGCY?t=3m18s](https://youtu.be/Nl8xTqTUGCY?t=3m18s)\n\nThis rocket sled was \u0027only\u0027 moving at ~650 mph.
