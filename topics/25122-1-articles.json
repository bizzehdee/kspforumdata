Exit KSP when you\u0027re ready to make the backup. The game saves a new persistent.sfs file on exit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On a PC, right click your KSP icon and select \u0022Open File Location\u0022. (I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a similar option on the Mac.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Go into the Saves directory and open the folder with the name game you want to back up (For example, I have one called \u0022Station\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have a couple of options:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMethod 1 - Organized in uniquely named subfolders:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Make a new folder and name it something meaningful, like \u002201_DockedAtStation\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Copy the persistent.sfs file into that folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. When you want to restore it, just copy it from the subfolder and overwrite the existing persistent.sfs file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMethod 2 - renamed save files:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Highlight the persistent.sfs file and copy it with ctrl-c.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Paste a new copy (ctrl-v), and name it something meaningful, like \u0022persistent_01_dockedAtStation.sfs\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. To restore it, delete the official \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022 file, copy the backup, and paste it back in, then rename it to \u0022persistent.sfs\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I know, quicksave.sfs files are just like persistent.sfs.
