If it was But with 1.0 aero despite all of its infamy has proven well for me. I don\u0027t want FAR, but someone else might want, and here at the 64x community workaround thread we share and discuss problems and sometimes brag, so if someone needs help we, as in, the 64x bit community will gladly give our support, how inconclusive it might be. So no need to get your teapot all fired up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.Hmm, seeming does not translate into seeing, much rarely into knowing.

More to the point. they probably didn\u0027t have liberty to outright test it, and if they did, chances based on gut reaction they would have still taken out.

Unity 4\u0027s x64 player just has issues that are beyond Squad or let alone the mod developers to fix. The base game just being glitchy for most of the people who posted here is no coherent prove for a 64 bit KSP windows build to be stable. The same faults in the engine that lead to the minor glitches on the base game (buildings upgrading, astronaut complex flashing up on screen transitions etc.) could be the reason some mods break on it. It could also be other bugs in the engine, that we don\u0027t know of. There is no telling what exactly causes the problems, unless you\u0027re among the people who developed the engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs it is, a 64 bit windows build of KSP surely ISN\u0027T stable enough for an official release of a win x64 version.

I don\u0027t blame Squad for starting out like that, since the game wasn\u0027t originally meant to become so massive and have such a huge modding community. However, somewhere along the line I wish they had implemented a load on demand system or something along those lines. As it is, the stock game by itself already uses a whole lot of RAM, and doesn\u0027t leave much room for mods. Even with mods like Active Texture Management there is a limit to modding 32 bit in its current state. (Also I personally don\u0027t think compression of textures is a very good solution to the RAM problem, but yeah, we\u0027re lacking any better solutions currently) Would such a load system take a lot of work? Probably. Should Squad have implemented such a system already? Definitely\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any way, further discussing what one thinks the other side tries to accomplish, or reading accusations and statements into others posts, that they haven\u0027t put in there, surely won\u0027t help anyone. Anyone who tries this should have read the OP, and should therefore know that this workaround is EXPECTED to have bugs, and that they can\u0027t reasonably expect it to consistently work with ANY available mod. (And I intentionally worded it like that. It\u0027s not the mod that doesn\u0027t work on x64; it\u0027s the 64 bit version that doesn\u0027t work with the mod)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly there is still always going to be people who don\u0027t understand that, and will bother mod devs about it, and push squad to make an official 64 bit windows build.
