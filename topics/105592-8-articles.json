I did not know people blamed modders for the unstability of of 64bit. Its truly unfair. But, what we have now withn 64bit workaround is the only thing we can enjoy with lots of mods. It works for some, fails for some. We know it is not ideal but it offers better gaming experience than standard 32bit, at least for someof us. I wish I had the skills to play with source codes of those mods you mentinoned and make them work here but I dont have. The only thing I have is the knowledge that this one works for me. This works for lots of us. \n\nI love your mods, I do not start new careers without your mod updates for new versions. Believe me, when I had to abandon your aerospace mod, It was a very hard decision for me. I feel like cheating when I launch vessels without Far. I understand something inherently wrong about game itself when it goes above 4gb ram. We just have to wait for squad to solve problem. Also, I do not expect for you to try adapt your mod for this 64bit workaround. Its not your job to fix failures of game devs. What I want from you is an understanding, all of us try to enjoy the game, try to do with what we have.

The code for mods doesn\u0027t change between x86 and x64; it doesn\u0027t need to, if it did, then all the Linux 64 builds would have had so many problems despite the fact that they never have. This is the same exact garbage that came up before with the 0.23.5 win64 hack; \u0022oh, of course it\u0027s not the win64 build being unstable, it must be the mods.\u0022 This has all happened before, and it is all happening again; don\u0027t take me for a fool and think you can play this off as something different, because I\u0027ve already seen exactly how this mess goes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Anyone that came here knows something can happen to their games that could cause irreparable damage, but we have not had a single case so here or on the second forum for 64x KSP\n\nThere have never been any recorded cases of irreparable damage, but good job trying to downplay all the other issues by comparison.

This is the exact same thing that has happened before, with the same exact blaming of mods and modders (but we\u0027re not, we swear!) and the same exact downplaying of any stability issues. The only difference is now, in addition to convincing Squad to bring official win64 builds back, you need to convince modders to unlock their mods.\n\nI would like to think that having a stable win64 build would be nice. But given the behavior in this thread, and of the community at large when faced with win64 issues (to blame mods and modders for it), combined with the continued issues that I\u0027ve seen and heard about, an official win64 build of KSP would be a greater disaster than the 0.24 win64 release or the 0.25 win64 mod locking."},{"CreatedByName":"scavenger","CreatedById":111989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T02:43:03Z","Content":"I tried 4.6.6 it doesn\u0027t launch the game, OK\n\nI tried 4.6.4 and ...

Allow me to explain a little more carefully. Hopefully we can reconcile the differences \n\nWhat par-takes here is that. \n\n1. The definition of unstable is that the inherent core game-play, the essence of the game cannot run with major malfunction, dubious reliability, repeated crashing and concurrent testing and experimentation, 64 bit in previous versions have fufilled those requirements. However in 64 bit in 1.0.x This forum has not found anything that has caused major crashing, or unplayability. However, conceding the point that 64x can be GLITCHY, we know this, we have known this, and we will always will know this. Believe me, I didn\u0027t want to run 64x bit in KSP, I heard the countless horrors that people have told, but after dozens of hours of causal playing, I feel that 64x is just now glitchy. Do I know how 64x bit is more stable, no, but have I seen an improvement to say the least? Certainly, there is nothing wrong with improvement, even if its all for naught. But in the case that you are right, that 64x bit hasn\u0027t improved, that\u0027s fine, little is lost.\n\n2. Until you\u0027ve tried 64x bit yourself, to much of your distaste, I\u0027m afraid that you point doesn\u0027t hold much water, against the consistent \u0022Hey, I\u0027ve running \u002B4GB for X amount of hours and no crashes\u0022, you gonna need more evidence to refute those claims, at the best. \n\n3. Browsing your FAR forum today, congratulations on the new release for FAR or \u0022Froude\u0022 as you call it, said to fix a lot bugs of the mod. Wonder how many were supposedly fix in the 64x version. Personally, I used FAR before on .25 and .90 it is a great mod, certainly. If it was But with 1.0 aero despite all of its infamy has proven well for me. I don\u0027t want FAR, but someone else might want, and here at the 64x community workaround thread we share and discuss problems and sometimes brag, so if someone needs help we, as in, the 64x bit community will gladly give our support, how inconclusive it might be. So no need to get your teapot all fired up. \n\n4.Hmm, seeming does not translate into seeing, much rarely into knowing. I see that something isn\u0027t getting through, if your mods don\u0027t work on 64x bit, that isn\u0027t your problem. It is my problem now or whoever wants to use your mod. No seriously, if it helps, 100% of all the bugs are completely are fault for using the hack, we get use higher ram limits in trade for potential instability supposedly and no support whatsoever beside own little community, that is what many people call a compromise, I am happy and others to accept that compromise. \n\n5. Great point, quite hard to argue actually. But \u0022One man\u0027s garbage, is another man\u0027s treasure\u0022 for me, all the coding stuff is beyond me unfortunate a side from simple config changes. Instead, my policy is simple with 64x bit and mods, if its considered \u0022broken\u0022, which would classify all attempts of using said mod are denied/unplayablity, that means absolutely nothing to said mod, that does mean in unfortunately the mod is unavailable in 64x bit, but you can stigmatize 64x bit all you want, until we get some real answers/crashes it wouldn\u0027t be the end of the world if we lose some mods, just tricks of the trade, I suggest. Is it great, well that is one\u0027s one call on that.\n\n6.\n\nI stand by what I said, none of this your fault, just so happens that your mod as come (yet again) under the 64x microscope, and you want to come to defend it, no problem. But do know there is always a chance that we might find a real bug in your or any other mod in 64 bit, **but none of that means anything if you creators aren\u0027t supporting it**  **64 bit.** Consequently we are not asking for help with 64 bit, we are at least smart enough to try to reproduce the bug on 32 bit before reporting a bug. Anyone else either doesn\u0027t know better, or is laying their cards down. However, I\u0027d like to read what you said.\n\n\u0022Of course it\u0027s not the mod\u0027s fault! Why would it be, we\u0027re just implying that it is... we\u0027d never say it out loud, no, that makes people very upset. At least be honest and blame me to my face. Have some honor with the accusations you throw around; stand behind them, don\u0027t run and try to say that you\u0027re not blaming any of us modders, because you are. You did before, you\u0027re doing it now, nothing has changed.\u0022\n\nIs this healthy community behaviour? Seriously I respect you as mod author, and generally think you are up there in list. But these types of passive attacks aren\u0027t really helping to change minds it kinda looks like your blaming us from the looks of it for blaming you, because we are not blaming you, but we are bla...see what I mean?\n\n7.\n\nI knew full reason why SQUAD took 64bit out, they are a company, they have to aggregate risk vs reward. It is was a near instinct reaction and quite expected reaction for them to take out 64x bit, because they couldn\u0027t risk it, if 64x bit would have been a bat outta hell it would have huge stain on the game, could have angered Sony, could have gotten slammed by steam reviews, could have generated bad gamer\u0027s press. With the point I don\u0027t think you have business dealings with multi-billion corporations, and if you do, congrats for getting up that high on the social ladder. More to the point. they probably didn\u0027t have liberty to outright test it, and if they did, chances based on gut reaction they would have still taken out. Then again 64x hopefully will come with Unity 5, then hopefully we have wouldn\u0027t to resort this this hack, well technically it isn\u0027t hack, it just replacing files and renaming stuff, guess hack is the coin term. \n\nBut I am not SQUAD, so I had the full choice to install an 8GB game engine to get the files needed to run 64x bit. But really Ferram, is SQUAD going browse this thread and magically say, \u0022Oh, yes finally, the community 64x has done it again! Might as well release\u0022 if so, their game, nothing we can do about it. But all of reality would point to SQUAD is working on the real 64x if at all and that might settle this frivolous issue. \n\nSo if you like to continue this debate, just PM me, there is no need for this to continue, it is what I call a \u0022Unstoppable Force meets an Immovable Object\u0022 debate, neither of us can definitively prove our side is wrong, but I am willing to continue if you need to vent more about 64 bit."},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T09:07:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The 64 bit HAS noticeably gotten better\n\nI will reply to that since I have done some test with the \u0022workaround\u0022. Yes, it is stable and allow to push memory limit to the roof. BUT, and it is a big one for mods (and stock), the engine does not fire some events. It may seems like a minor issue but it means that the game is not aware that some things took place (hello building upgrade) and some mod may not initialize or react properly. For stock it may just be a few minor problems but for mod it can be far more reaching and insidious. You could end up with some numbers of a mod not refreshing properly and things being odd without any noticeable error spam.\n\nIf you know that it can occurs and don\u0027t go bothering the mods author it is fine. But as we saw countless time before this is not obvious to everyone. \n\nIf you want the mods to work build them yourselves. It s more complex than launching an exe that edits all the dll in your install and mess up some of them, but it works and is not that hard to learn.

And we all remember how bad things got when that was out, right?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ...but you can stigmatize 64x bit all you want, until we get some real answers/crashes it wouldn\u0027t be the end of the world if we lose some mods, just tricks of the trade, I suggest. Is it great, well that is one\u0027s one call on that.\n\nAt a certain point, I think you need to acknowledge that win64 is unstable and stop acting like it\u0027s perfectly fine but for a few mods. Win64 is broken as all hell and crashes without warning. Has with the first hack, has with the official versions, has with the current hack, will probably do it with whatever comes out next. Fundamentally, nothing has changed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 6.\n\u003E I stand by what I said, none of this your fault, just so happens that your mod as come (yet again) under the 64x microscope, and you want to come to defend it, no problem. But do know there is always a chance that we might find a real bug in your or any other mod in 64 bit, **but none of that means anything if you creators aren\u0027t supporting it**  **64 bit.**\n\nExcept, as already noted, the people who don\u0027t listen to that and don\u0027t care and the unintended consequences in the common thought processes of the community, and the eventual added crap from when Squad finally caves again and pushes out another busted win64 build. I think you have failed to realize that the issue is not with the mods, or the modders; it is with users that don\u0027t understand, \u0022not supported\u0022 (did you not think that we *tried* that before locking the mods?) and then turn every single mod thread into a win64 argument. There are more consequences to this than just whether you get to play with an official version of broken win64 KSP. Look up how things went before. See how bad things got. Hell, look at the unfixer; that was Cerebrate\u0027s runaround around stupid\\_chris\u0027s win64 locking and license restrictions, all because stupid\\_chris just wanted to not deal with win64 reports from his userbase. Turns out, that\u0027s unacceptable, because he still got tons of bug reports from that.\n\nThe fact that you think declaring that modders don\u0027t support win64 is the end of it basically proves that you don\u0027t have any concept of how things go once the broken versions are out there.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Is this healthy community behaviour? Seriously I respect you as mod author, and generally think you are up there in list. But these types of passive attacks aren\u0027t really helping to change minds it kinda looks like your blaming us from the looks of it for blaming you, because we are not blaming you, but we are bla...see what I mean?\n\nOf course I\u0027m blaming you! People like you, the ones that have pushed win64 with reckless abandon, disregarding all the instability, all the issues, downplaying anything bad and broken related to Unity or KSP themselves, making sure that only the mods are left to blame... you\u0027re the ones that made win64 a nightmare to support (when we did), and then a nightmare to deal with anyway, because no one cares whether we support it or not, they\u0027ll crap all over our threads and bug reporting systems out of spite. You, and everyone else like you, that pushed for the official win64 version, the ones that jumped on modders the second they realized how broken KSP was, you\u0027re the ones that turned 0.24-0.90 into a wonderful hell of trying to deal with a broken game, and then users that were ticked that they couldn\u0027t play the broken version and then crap all over the modders for problems that aren\u0027t their fault, after you\u0027ve set everything up so that they\u0027re the only ones left to blame for anything.\n\nDon\u0027t talk about \u0022healthy\u0022 community behavior when you\u0027re talking about win64 KSP either; this thing is nothing but cancer, and the sooner everyone accepts that it\u0027s broken and a mess, the sooner we can let it die for good and we\u0027ll all be better off.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E 7.\n\u003E I knew full reason why SQUAD took 64bit out, they are a company, they have to aggregate risk vs reward. It is was a near instinct reaction and quite expected reaction for them to take out 64x bit, because they couldn\u0027t risk it, if 64x bit would have been a bat outta hell it would have huge stain on the game, could have angered Sony, could have gotten slammed by steam reviews, could have generated bad gamer\u0027s press.\n\nAs they should have for the time that they spent with the broken builds available. As they should have for the damage it caused to the modding community. If they managed to get away with it, that\u0027s impressive, but the fact that they got away with it doesn\u0027t erase all the damage that it has done and that the hack threatens to bring back. And you should be smart enough to not push for something that will cause a ton of damage, and doesn\u0027t even work either.\n\nI really wish they were as quick to pull it as you think they were. We asked back in 0.25 when it was apparent that 0.24 was a complete disaster. They refused. We locked mods as a last resort to try and reduce support workload because telling users that you don\u0027t support it doesn\u0027t work. Everything went to hell. And now you want to bring us back to that? Why?!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But I am not SQUAD, so I had the full choice to install an 8GB game engine to get the files needed to run 64x bit. But really Ferram, is SQUAD going browse this thread and magically say, \u0022Oh, yes finally, the community 64x has done it again! Might as well release\u0022 if so, their game, nothing we can do about it. But all of reality would point to SQUAD is working on the real 64x if at all and that might settle this frivolous issue.\n\nNo, they\u0027ll release because there are a bunch of people screaming that it\u0027s so stable (even though that\u0027s a lie) and that Squad screwed up by pulling the build then, and they\u0027ll release it under pressure, just like they did before. And it\u0027ll be a disaster, just like before. Because this has all happened before. Nothing is different, it\u0027s the same lies, with the same behavior, the same blind eyes towards issues. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E So if you like to continue this debate, just PM me, there is no need for this to continue, it is what I call a \u0022Unstoppable Force meets an Immovable Object\u0022 debate, neither of us can definitively prove our side is wrong, but I am willing to continue if you need to vent more about 64 bit.\n\nAh, yes. Let\u0027s stop debating publicly after you get the last word and dismissed all of my points. I do think you\u0027re right, there\u0027s no point arguing directly with someone who has seen fit to dismiss all of my points and to ignore what I\u0027ve said when it\u0027s convenient for the argument. On the other hand, continuing for the sake of everyone else is quite good.\n\nI get it. You\u0027d like win64 to be stable. It\u0027s in your interests to present it as stable. If it were stable, that would be great for all of us. But it\u0027s not; I\u0027ve tried it, it crashes just as badly as before. It\u0027s just not worth dealing with."},{"CreatedByName":"Murdabenne","CreatedById":142825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T21:55:14Z","Content":"After trying 64bit (which is what brough me here), I do not use the 64bit substitute 4.6.4 unity client, because despite its obvious advantages in better leveraging my hardware (i7, 32GB RAM, SLI cards) and 64bit OS (Win8.1pro) and despite the arguments to the contrary, it *is* buggy. I enjoyed being able to load all the shiny stuff, and not worry about crashes or having to exit the game every 30 minutes during heavy design phases (hanger-runway-hanger-runway a few times eats a tonne). Don\u0027t spin so much - there are defects and issues no matter how much gloss you apply to cover them. In the end, having some mods I like be unstable due to the 64bit engine and the underlying app (the game itself) not being properly coded for 64bit, well it is **simply not worth the trouble**.\n\nBut neither do I use Ferram\u0027s aero addons, same as Kerbinside, and other apps I would like to always have loaded always. Its the RAM usage and memory leaks that force me to trade off game play (how often do I want to save and restart, or crash?) vs addon value. The 4gb RAM limits of 32bit **are** an issue for players: *no matter how you dance around it 32 bit is inadequate*, and the best solution is 64bit address space. So 64bit should be pushed as a goal for the game for the reasons stated above, instead of simply dismissed. And you should not block efforts to experiment with 64bit -- I refer you to open source manifesto, and someone may just find something you didn\u0027t expect (don\u0027t be so arrogant). Short of a functional 64bit address space, and something that uses more than a single core, well it trying to cram it all into 32bit space and putting up with the crashes is **simply not worth the trouble**. \n\nAnd truthfully, they attitude/ego of both of you makes your argument time and effort wasted - neither of you is actually fixing the problem with this arguing. You may eventually make yourselves **simply not worth the trouble**.\n\nIts a shame you refuse to find a solution somewhere in the middle, the rest of us have a GAME to play.

If you try it, expect it not to work. That way, if it works, it\u0027ll be a pleasant surprise, and if it doesn\u0027t that\u0027s okay, you weren\u0027t expecting it to in the first place. \n\nBut remember, it is technically a hack and not officially supported. Squad discontinued it because of it\u0027s unpredictability and overall bugginess. Some mods may not work correctly, or at all. This is due to bugs in the game engine itself, which cannot be fixed by Squad or KSP modders (until KSP uses Unity 5, which will make this hack redundant anyway) You **will** get some odd bugs and maybe game crashes due to the unstable nature of the hack, but if it\u0027s playable for you, you can add loads of extra mods before crashing from Out of Memory errors. The whole point of the 64 bit hack is to allow the game to use more RAM than the ~4 GB maximum for a 32 bit process, so don\u0027t bother if you\u0027re not using that kind of RAM, or have 4 GB or less of RAM available on your computer.\n\nSo, if you are getting crashes to to hitting the RAM limit in the 32-bit version (usually it will crash while loading if you are) or want to add more mods which will cause that, it\u0027s worth trying the 64 bit hack. If you aren\u0027t, don\u0027t bother; there\u0027s no possible advantage to using it and 32-bit version is both more reliable and officially supported."},{"CreatedByName":"scavenger","CreatedById":111989,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T00:50:12Z","Content":"yes [**TheMoonRover**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/139694-TheMoonRover) is right, the thread is starting to troll...\n\nWhoever is right is not the point.

Each go back and forth from VAB or SPH adds like 50/100MB RAM that will never get freed, this is leakage, whatever you call it. \n\nSO, the real deal is: what do you prefer? Really stable game up to 3,600MB then you have to exit, or \\*almost\\* stable game but up to 6,000MB RAM?\n\nI made my choice, and choose to deal with the unpredictable crashes for the joy not to have to look at the RAM growing stressfully all the time.\n\nI play much longer now, as long as I stay careful not to crash my plane in weird ways, which really avoid the 64bit game freezes.

Unity 4\u0027s x64 player just has issues that are beyond Squad or let alone the mod developers to fix. The base game just being glitchy for most of the people who posted here is no coherent prove for a 64 bit KSP windows build to be stable. The same faults in the engine that lead to the minor glitches on the base game (buildings upgrading, astronaut complex flashing up on screen transitions etc.) could be the reason some mods break on it. It could also be other bugs in the engine, that we don\u0027t know of. There is no telling what exactly causes the problems, unless you\u0027re among the people who developed the engine. \n\nAs it is, a 64 bit windows build of KSP surely ISN\u0027T stable enough for an official release of a win x64 version. And I hope I speak for all of us if I say: We don\u0027t want squad to release a 64 bit version that is that broken.\n\nAlso, yes, there sure are people who don\u0027t understand that the problems with windows x64 KSP are something that is caused by the ENGINE being faulty, not the mods that happen to break on it. And I can absolutely understand that mod devs getting spammed by such people about issues they literally neither caused nor have any option to fix, get upset about that.\n\nTo anyone who doesn\u0027t understand that: Imagine you have a car that is fueld by diesel, and people come around complaining that it breaks if you fill in gasoline. And if you try to explain they go ahead and say: \u0022But it works on that other car, your car must be broken.\u0022\n\nMight not be the best analogy, but I think it shows pretty well how someone saying mod devs are at fault looks to someone who understands that the engine has bugs that are beyond anyone but the unity people to fix.\n\nThe entire 64 bit discussion would be irrelevant if the game wouldn\u0027t use the ancient system of loading the entire game and all assets into the RAM on start up every time. I don\u0027t blame Squad for starting out like that, since the game wasn\u0027t originally meant to become so massive and have such a huge modding community. However, somewhere along the line I wish they had implemented a load on demand system or something along those lines. As it is, the stock game by itself already uses a whole lot of RAM, and doesn\u0027t leave much room for mods. Even with mods like Active Texture Management there is a limit to modding 32 bit in its current state. (Also I personally don\u0027t think compression of textures is a very good solution to the RAM problem, but yeah, we\u0027re lacking any better solutions currently) Would such a load system take a lot of work? Probably. Should Squad have implemented such a system already? Definitely\n\nIn any way, further discussing what one thinks the other side tries to accomplish, or reading accusations and statements into others posts, that they haven\u0027t put in there, surely won\u0027t help anyone. Anyone who tries this should have read the OP, and should therefore know that this workaround is EXPECTED to have bugs, and that they can\u0027t reasonably expect it to consistently work with ANY available mod. (And I intentionally worded it like that. It\u0027s not the mod that doesn\u0027t work on x64; it\u0027s the 64 bit version that doesn\u0027t work with the mod)\n\nSadly there is still always going to be people who don\u0027t understand that, and will bother mod devs about it, and push squad to make an official 64 bit windows build. As per usual, such vocal minorities cast a shadow on the entire community. Frustrating, yeah, but unless someone invents a way to automatically shut up such vocal minorities we\u0027ll have to live with it.\n\nI just hope that unity 5 actually fixed the 64 bit issues. Having an actual 64 bit version of the unity editor, and such. Anyway, we\u0027ll see about that when they\u0027re finished porting to Unity 5, which will be a while.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T16:02:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WWEdeadman**"},{"CreatedByName":"TheRag","CreatedById":144674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T00:43:55Z","Content":"Barely gotten into 1.0.3 but from what I played with it, it seems okay for me, more time will be needed."},{"CreatedByName":"SmashingKirby148","CreatedById":130193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:20:43Z","Content":"![0nKV0MO.png](http://i.imgur.com/0nKV0MO.png)\n\nThis happens for me.
