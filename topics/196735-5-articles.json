I am thinking that your (pl.) reasoning is along the lines of \u0022automation is not fundamentally the same as past technology, automation will remove jobs, and not enough new ones will be created\u0022. Am I close?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOur differences are on whether automation is fundamentally the same as past technology. Allow me to put your minds to rest on this matter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe humans define a thing by what it does. A washing machine washes, a mechanical engineer engineers, etc. Let\u0027s define automation in these terms, and take all the mystery out of it. What does it do? It performs a task on behalf of a human, right? (If you have a better definition, by all means, tell me!) Now, we can apply this definition to the world around us. What does your washing machine do? It washes clothes on your behalf. Even simpler, what does a plough do? (Yes, a plough.) It moves dirt, on behalf of a human!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, what is the definition of technology? Technology is some labor-saving device which\u003Cem\u003E\u00A0does work on behalf of a human. \u003C/em\u003EHere, we see that automation is just another name for technology; they are really the same thing. My reasoning that automation is technology, technology adds jobs, therefore automation adds jobs, holds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, the notion that automation (technology) is not technology is ridiculous. A cannot be non-A. But automation of the sort we mean, like computerized factories, are just technology. To claim they are somehow not is to defy logic. Do that, and you declare yourself a madman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, by\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ereductio ad absurdum\u003C/em\u003E, I will show that the idea that technology (or automation) destroys jobs, if held with any kind of logical consistency, leads to some silly conclusions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFreight is carried between Chicago and Dodge City (or St. P and Vladivostok) on trains. Trains are technology. When they were invented, they surely took away someone\u0027s job. Now, let us remedy this dark, disheartening situation, where evil technology removes the jobs of good people! We can employ many more people carrying the cargo\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eon their backs, through Siberia or the high prairie,\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ethan are, we presume, employed by the railroad. Hooray! The problem is solved! No more unemployment!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAccording to this viewpoint, mankind must have gone wrong as soon as he first used a rock to drive a peg. Let us all, therefore, go back to simpler times! No more of this technology! Go ahead, if you still can hold this view! Go ahead and shatter whatever device you are using to read this post! We shall go back to picking berries and nuts in the forest!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRidiculous, right? But this idea has been around for a very long time. There were the Luddites, the Technocrats, in America. All of them had their theories meticulously dissected and destroyed, but each time, the same idea rose like the mythical Phoenix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the middle of the XIX century, the population of the world has grown. Today, it is more than four times what it was back then. Technology (automation, for they are the same) has permitted this growth. One out of every four of us owes his life, in some way, to the automation of labor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I have, by multiple lines of reasoning, demonstrated that the idea that technology destroys jobs and has a net negative impact on any economy to be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efalse.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EDo I expect to convince anyone?

However, they did sometimes fail to take the short view and the narrow view. The skilled laborers who were put out of work suffered real tragedies, I agree. But many of the modern writers have the opposite flaw; they neglect the long view, or the wide view, concerning the whole economy, all groups involved, etc. Say Joe Smith loses a job due to a new machine. The popular writers will tell you of the sadness of how he lost his job, but they don\u0027t mention how Tom Jones got a job making the machine, or how Ted Brown got a job operating one, or how Theo Gray can buy a new product for half the price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCertainly we should pay attention to Joe and his plight. Perhaps he can get a new job, and maybe a better one. But, perhaps also, he spent a long while training and honing a skill the market no longer needs. He has lost this investment in himself, just as his employer has lost his investment in old processes or machinery rendered obsolete. We certainly cannot forget him, but he is one of the tragedies incident to nearly all economic progress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, for how the market offsets the labor deficit created by the machine. A factory owner buys a new, labor-saving machine which automates a process. People are fired, but other jobs are created revolving around the machine. Assume these new jobs do not offset the job deficit. After the machine has produced enough extra profit that it has offset the cost of its purchase, the employer earns more profit than he did before. At first glance, it looks like only he has gained from the machine, as there are less jobs than when we started. But, it is out of these extra profits that more jobs come.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe will use these profits in one of three ways: 1) he will expand his operations by buying more machines and factories, 2) he will invest his profits in another industry, or 3) he will increase his own consumption. He will probably do all three. So the wages he saved by laying off workers, he now has to pay out as wages to the machine-builders, to the workers of other industries, and to the people who make cars and new houses for him and his wife. Regardless, he now gives as many jobs indirectly as he ceased to give directly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the sequence does not end here; if this manufacturer has become more economical compared to his competitors, he will either expand at their expense, or they will buy the machines, too. This increase in production and competition forces the price of the product down. Consumers benefit, and the living standard is raised.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(If the demand for the product is \u0022elastic\u0022, we may see more people employed making the same product than before the machine, but the argument does not require elasticity.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSay that, though no more products were sold than before the machine, the price fell from $150 to $100. The consumers, though the rate of their consumption has not increased, now have $50 left over which they would not have had before. This increases their consumption in other areas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is paraphrased from Chapter 7 of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EEconomics in One Lesson\u003C/em\u003E, by Henry Hazlitt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn a spoiler so you can\u0027t\u00A0complain about appeal to authority.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore jobs are added.

Hazlitt, acclaimed as he may be, essentially threw the entire Keynesian theory down the drain. He was a die-hard classicist, in other words, up there with Malthus, Adam Smith and Ricardo.

I prefer to avoid associating with any single big-name theorist, because while they might align, I seldom find someone who gets everything right in my view.
