I haven\u0027t done much with FAR, except for a few basic planes, but using the above 3300dV figure we can make some bounding statements about efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s say LKO is 80km. A circular orbit at this altitude is right about 2279m/s. For simplicity, let us assume a uniform gravitational field at 8.5m/s^2 (really it goes from 9.81m/s^2 at 0km to 7.6m/s^2 at 80km). So let\u0027s say that 2279m/s of our dV goes to our orbital velocity and the rest is getting there. Suppose we did two impulsive forces in a vacuum. We would need 1166m/s to blast up to 80km and then 2279m/s to circularize, minus the 175m/s we get from Kerbin\u0027s rotation. Thus the orbital insertion can be done for 3270m/s in this two-step process, which is the least efficient \u0027nontrivial\u0027 (where you actively work against yourself) profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, we know that the most efficient strategy in this vacuum scenario is a Hohmann transfer. A 0x80km orbit at Kerbin requires 2500m/s at the periapsis and 2206m/s at apoapsis. To circularize would then require an additional 73m/s at apoapsis. So we need 2500\u002B73-175=2398m/s in a vacuum with infinite TWR and no atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, the atmosphere greatly complicates both of these matters by inducing drag losses (and thereby incurring additional gravity losses too), meaning that even the Hohmann is not an ideal profile. We could not get away with these impulsive transfers in the presence of an atmosphere because the drag losses would be incredible. But we do know that the gravity, drag, and path inefficiency losses together do not add up to more than 2100m/s in stock and 900m/s in FAR, so we can certainly bound any of those three sources to be below 47% in stock and 20% in FAR (for an \u0027efficient\u0027 rocket).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the curious mind might just ask: how fast one would need to be going horizontally near sea level to coast out to 80km through the atmosphere?
