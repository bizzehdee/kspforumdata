Welcome to the first episode of The Kerbal History Show! Today we\u0027ll be looking at how the Kerbol System was formed! Also we have a special guest! Everyone welcome Bob Kerman Expert on Kerbal History! He\u0027ll be with us for a few episodes of The Show About Kerbal History!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Hello, Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Hello, Let\u0027s not waste anymore time with introductions and get this ball a\u0027 Rollin, Woulden\u0027t you agree bob?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Yes i would.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: First off, Can you tell us how kerbol was formed? Was it like our late ancestors, the humans?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: You could say that Even though earth had 2 beliefs, Ours is only one belief. There isn\u0027t any other beliefs to believe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Hmm, Interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Yes it was a very interesting time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: I can tell already you know a lot about kerbal history! Let\u0027s keep going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Yes. The forming of kerbol wasn\u0027t quick, In fact. It was 20000 Light years until kerbol was finally formed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh, Really?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Yes. It all started a few light years after earth was desolated by a asteroid. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: It all happened when a few debris of earth, Approximately 200 Debris of earth\u0027s crust and surface somehow got on a Trajectory into each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Their distance was told in legend, About 200 Light years away from each other. Thus the reason it took 20000 Light years for Kerbol to be formed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh this is interesting, indeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: So, After the 200 Light Years passed the debris finally impacted each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: So why was it 20000 Light Years?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Because the impact was so hard all of the debris turned into more rocks and they all flew out in different directions. I\u0027ve actually brought a picture created from our scientists when the early days of Kerbal Space Center Was more focused on our legend than space exploration. Thus simulated all the debris flying out into other directions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh, Cool! Let\u0027s get that on our screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kxdOR.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kxdOR.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh, Wowee! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Indeed. And it took the rest of the light years for the big event to take place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Big Event?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Also referred to as, The Kerbol BANG!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh! I thought i learned about that in school?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Haha, Yes jeb. So when the last day of the 20000 Light Years Drew near. There was about 4 days left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: The debris suddenly clustered all together and was pulled into a star. Upon impact the star blew up into a million pieces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Then after 2 days of the pieces wandering deep space, They came upon a medium sized star. Approximately the Size of minmus, But a little more smaller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Oh okay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: The star was bigger than the pieces and they we\u0027re pulled into the star, The pieces we\u0027re so small that they didn\u0027t blow up the star. But made it bigger. Forming our sun. Then the 2 last days of the event...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Continue, Please Thus is so enriching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: The milky way, The galaxy of our late ancestors. Exploded into pieces. Those pieces then flew all the way into the sun we have, Blowing the sun up forming Kerbol. The sun we have is what is left of the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Wow! This was interesting. Well my friends i\u0027m afraid we\u0027re out of time, But we have time to show one more picture before we go! Be watching for episode 2! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: Here\u0027s the picture, Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: Okay, Let\u0027s get that up on the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i49.tinypic.com/33z2tyb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233z2tyb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob: This is kerbol\u0027s sun before The Big Event!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb: That\u0027s way bigger than we have!
