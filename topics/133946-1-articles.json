The egg-shaped shell you see actually folded\u00A0down over the seat itself during an emergency, and it\u00A0came with survival kits, flotation devices, and several over neat stuff built into it. Anyway, I just thought it was a neat part of history and wanted to upload it to see if anyone was interested in re-creating it.
