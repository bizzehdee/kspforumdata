Since the only configuration that makes sense for is landing (more taking-off) from a body with atmosphere, I decided to make the rover for Duna (focused on completing survey contracts). My first test run on Duna itself ran into a huge issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/jsKUy\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

On Kerbin, the rover could drive into the bay without issue, but on Duna the ship sinks enough that the ceiling is too low and the docking ports slam into each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know of a way to make my service bay height over ground more predictable with stock parts? It needs to be low enough the tires can roll over the lip, but high enough to not clip through the floor of the bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a related note: any tips to improve the rovers handling without expendable resources?

Sometimes they sink, sometimes they do not. Sometimes only one foot sinks. Combine that with the height that wheels rest on their suspension is also different on each celestial body, and you just can\u0027t rely on any kind of precision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: nm what I said earlier, I didn\u0027t understand the problem. Anyway, this issue is that you can\u0027t judge wheel suspension height in the VAB/SPH. They appear there as if they are pushed up all the way as if in high gravity. Once you get out into some other gravity, the wheel height will change drastically. So a Kerbin solution won\u0027t work on Duna, which won\u0027t work on Minmus.
