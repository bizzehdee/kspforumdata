However there is one thing that always kinda nagged me and that is, the KW engines seem to replace the stock engines completely. What I mean is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTake the stock T-45 and the KW WildCat V.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey cost the same and have the same mass but the WC-V outclasses the T-45 in Isp and thrust. With the KW pack there is no longer any reason to use the old 45. when cost vs performance is concidered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was wondering: Is there a way for someone not familiar with these things to adjust the price for the KW parts to reflect the better performance?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T09:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could talk to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022129964\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129964-linuxgurugamer/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@linuxgurugamer\u003C/a\u003E, who maintained the community patch for KW Rocketry the last time I checked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-02T11:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKW is a must-have for me as well.

I was more than a bit hesitant to ask you directly as in my book, that would be like nagging you to change the mod which really isn\u0027t what I was after. I will keep my eyes open for any news on KWR.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for IRL, well that was never an issue. The entire point here was the comparison between stock and mod parts as I (and this is strictly a personal taste) would like to see more differentiating\u00A0rather than replacement of stock parts. One way would be to adjust the price, another to adjust the stats, and another would be to move the parts up the tech tree to a later node. As I was thinking this would be a tweak for my own personal taste and use and I have no idea how to tweak any of this, I figured the price would be the easiest for me to tweak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a look in the part cfg but couldn\u0027t find any reference to the in-game price (1200 credits) and how to tweak ModuleManager is well beyond my skills and knowledge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
