A person who doesn\u0027t have your issue spamming the thread with unhelpful posts that amount to \u0022I don\u0027t have your issue, so it\u0027s not an issue. \u00A0Please stop asking about it\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0People who are not devs/staff taking it upon themselves to answer on Squad\u0027s behalf, usually in a variant of #1. If you look at a lot of the threads that devolve into catfights, I think you\u0027ll see this is at the root of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not to say that people shouldn\u0027t have differences of opinions or be afraid to voice them, but if an issue doesn\u0027t pertain to you, and you don\u0027t have a dog in that particular fight, rather than telling the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E and others that they\u0027re wrong for posting, maybe we could try something new and original and keep our negative opinions to ourselves? \u00A0That would be super, and probably lend itself to a much happier community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-28T16:10:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell from my experience when seeing QA threads that devolve into \u0022catfights\u0022, usually the fault begins with the bug report being very negative at it\u0027s own heart and nearly impossible to help. Saying \u0022Your game sucks, [x] problem should already be fixed\u0022 doesn\u0027t help the QA team at all. You leave them with little to nothing to work with. Saying \u0022I experienced [x] while doing [y] and I have/have not experienced it again under identical/similar circumstances. Here is my output log, OS, and version\u0022. That is useful information that they can work with, and others can work to confirm or deny. Now by \u0022deny\u0022 I don\u0027t mean, \u0022your making this up and stupid\u0022, but rather \u0022yeah, I\u0027m not experiencing [x]\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo that\u0027s the first common fault.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second being that someone is quick to deny someone else\u0027s thoughts or experiences. That is something you should likely \u003Cem\u003Ereport\u003C/em\u003E when seen as the intent of the forum is to be open minded. Your right, it\u0027s a mindset that is wrong and as you said yourself, can devolve into greater negativity. So rather than respond negatively, send a report of that post so that the moderators can better explain how that person should respond.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
