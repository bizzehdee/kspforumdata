This was my first attempt to launch parts of a station using a shuttle type craft and complete the construction in low Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe shuttle was enjoyable to fabricate. Finding a solution to lift the cargo and safely return was at times hilarious. There was sixteen launches to furnish the stage with props.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Each piece of the station has function as well as form.

Keeping everything lined up is next up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe four main components for the shot will be placed on a rail so minor adjustments can be made to each item.
