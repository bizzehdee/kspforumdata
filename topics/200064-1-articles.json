It continues tracking this even for parts that don\u0027t have a \u0022More Info\u0022 window and even while you\u0027re not even focused on the part selector. While this window is open, some of your camera controls switch to\u00A0scrolling the window up and down. Or at least they sometimes do. The game is very finnicky about whether you can scroll that window or not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, the solution is to return to the part selector, choose any part with a \u0022More Info\u0022 window,\u00A0and press Square to hide the window.
