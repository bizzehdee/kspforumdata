I\u0027ve tried loading the quicksave, reloading the entire game, etc. I\u0027m thinking now that I\u0027ll have to edit the save file for the first time. My question is about which values I would be editing. If I\u0027m looking to recover the base by putting it back on the surface, would I be modifying the \u0022alt\u0022 value of the VESSEL or the \u0022hgt\u0022 value? Or what?
