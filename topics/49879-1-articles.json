As 0.22 is implemented, the LM would have to return as well to return a soil sample to Kerbin. It could force players to overbuild landers so they can land on Kerbin as well as whatever they\u0027re designed to land on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thinking behind that is if someone wants to do a grand tour with mothership, they\u0027d have to return every single lander to Kerbin to get those soil samples returned. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with transmitting, but I\u0027m really enjoying the challenge of trying to return samples vice repeatedly transmitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think that it would be reasonable to transfer soil samples and crew between docking ports (like they did from the LM to CM in Apollo), so I don\u0027t believe this would be game-breaking or unbalancing. Alternatively, maybe a ship component to store all these rocks that actually gets heavier with each sample taken (implemented like fuel transfer).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T15:00:00Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dapullia","CreatedById":72580,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T19:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could see something like adding a command for a Kerbal to remove the science item (sample, report, etc) and then hold it on the kerbal then deposit it in the new craft.
