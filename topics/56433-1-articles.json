They caught up with the Agena Target Vehicle, successfully joined with it, then promptly detached and made an emergency landing on Earth when they discovered their spacecraft was trying to kill them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/Apollo_11_first_step.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Apollo_11_first_step.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/lunrov_a15_big.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022lunrov_a15_big.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis will be the second most impressive thing they will ever do.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA centuries-long process from calculations on the blackboard, to prototyping, developing and final construction of vehicles, to testing in orbit culminated in the joining of two vehicles in space. This ability to join two craft into one has made possible the Moon landings and the space station programs since, producing more knowledge of both the Earth and the Cosmos beyond than the intellectual cost of making orbital rendezvous and docking possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://galaxywire.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/transfer-to-lunar-module-space-art.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022transfer-to-lunar-module-space-art.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis makes the idea of stuffing two guys into a spaceship that could never survive re-entry, then detaching them from the spaceship that can, seem less crazy.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProject Gemini was all about learning new skills. These new skills made the Moon the most well-understood body in existence, other than the Earth. For example a way we never developed docking. That would make Direct Ascen the only possible mission plan. This mean the lander must dedicate more of it\u0027s mass towards fuel and engines, leaving less for experiments, tools, cameras and rocks. Result: less science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApart from allowing bigger rockets, for father out places, to be possible, and more science instruments to bring with you, how can the game represent the scientific benefit of new abilities?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow about each \u0022special\u0022 part (docking ports, for example) has a significant task, or \u0022mission highlight\u0022 you must perform written to it? When you successfully perform it (first docking with another craft), some of the science you spent on getting the part is refunded to you. If you spent X amount of science points unlocking rover wheels, you get back 1/4, or 1/2 X points when you land a rover somewhere, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, mission highlights, like docking to a spacecraft or testing a new spacesuit, were put under scientific analysis (i.e. to make that certain component better). In-game, the player could design a mission that accounts for the highlight, a sort of \u0022mini-tutorial\u0022 to that area of the game. A shallower learning curve is a needed thing in this game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis can also give rookies some incentive to try out some things they have neglected (I\u0027m a rocketman, and I\u0027ve had no reason to go into planes).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-17T01:26:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/17/2013 01:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Drunkrobot\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptRobau","CreatedById":41695,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-17T01:47:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquad has talked about Reputation points for 0.24, which will reward you with points for doing first like above.

One other way it could be done is to have each tech node have tasks that can be performed in lieu of some of the science cost. For instance, if you successfully make an atmospheric flight of a certain duration, and land safely, that could mean less science needed to unlock better aircraft parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
