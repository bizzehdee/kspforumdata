NOW you could argue that it didn\u0027t work very well. However I am not talking about the VTOL characteristics or the tail sitter design but the wing around it. the Germans (ww2) made MANY designs that were to use the same technology and since they do not have to have a long wingspan they were incredibly efficient in terms of space used to create lift. I just want to remind you that a ducted wing does not clip, does not contain a \u0022skin\u0022 with enclosed wings i.e a box... AND is considered an aircraft.\n\n My point is there are MANY different variables that the conversation you have entered are ignoring and makes the conversation rather pointless..... the rules need to state what format of aircraft are aloud or even better, what ones aren\u0027t. otherwise these types of arguments would go on forever and would just fill this thread up with useless information. Personally I think there should be a ban on enclosed box aircraft as aerodynamically they should NOT WORK. That being said aircraft that use ducted wings are perfectly within the rules of a non clipping wing if done correctly. Also a ducted wing does not need to remain a cylindrical shape you could have ducted squares, triangles hell, octagons remain well within the definition of a ducted wing.\n\nMy take away from everything I\u0027ve said above is that if it is not aerodynamically sound in real life it should not be aloud into these tournaments.\n\nHow would such decisions be made without bias? leave it up to a computer! I personally think we should encompass ferram aerospace into these tournaments to help enforce these rules. This would be beneficial to both the tournaments themselves and the mod and its creator, as I\u0027m sure since we can find ways to exploit the aerodynamics in vanilla kerbal space program we can do the same with ferram and help improve the mod even more. \n\nThis however, is just my 2 cents.\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on this.

If the plane has a larger wingspan, then it\u0027s a bigger target because the massive wings mean it has more \u0027surface area\u0027. The Albatross, for example, has a HUGE surface area compared to the Aeris 3A. The smaller your surface area is, the harder your plane will be to hit because it\u0027s a smaller target.\n\nOh, I see. You\u0027re using \u0022surface area\u0022 to mean the visible area of the plane from a certain angle (i.e., its area when projected onto a specific plane) rather than the total wetted surface area.

Which is the point I\u0027m trying to get people to argue over; the only difference that I\u0027ve been able to see between the box design and any of the other designs is that the box is like a compact biplane from multiple axes, and if that should be banned, then logically all the other types of biplanes/multiple tail designs should be banned as well for the same violation of lowered projected area (surface area) from a given direction."},{"CreatedByName":"CreativeCombat","CreatedById":112338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T02:26:36Z","Content":"The fourth match of the round of 16, dangerouspeople1 vs Mr\\_Hubris is done filming and uploading now.
