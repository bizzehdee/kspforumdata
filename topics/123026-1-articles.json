This weird phenomenon started after I got LLL \u002B LLL Extra. The game had this problem, so I deleted LLL Extra, but keeping LLL, wanting to put windows on my B9 mothership (B9 isn\u0027t the cause as it was working pefectly before this happened). The game loaded, but when I entered the SPH, The building was black, the ground and outside were normal, but the buttons \u002B bars on the left and top where completely white. I clicked a part seeing if the game was still functioning properly. Upon clicking, the game crashed, and this has been happening ever since. I also use CKAN to install my mods, so here\u0027s the mod list on that too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother note is that the game isn\u0027t actually frozen here, as the \u0022witty loading hints\u0022 keep changing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/4Zb9LWc.png\u0022 alt=\u00224Zb9LWc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan someone help me please?
