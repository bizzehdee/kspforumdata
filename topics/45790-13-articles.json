So, with that being said, and given my level of \u0027expertise\u0027 on this subject, here\u0027s my considered opinion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not believe that this vehicle is physically capable of aerodynamic flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s in the real world, mind you. I\u0027m sure you guys will be able to finagle KSP\u0027s and Unity\u0027s parameters, and take advantage of their many flaws and loopholes regarding physics modeling, to get this thing flying in the game. But if you think about how real aircraft are designed today, and the MANY designs that have been tried because they \u0027worked on paper\u0027 but never came close to working in real life, this concept is just too far out for me to think that it might be plausible. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not talking about the engines, btw. I don\u0027t doubt that their design can and will be developed to the point that they\u0027ll be capable of generating enough delta-v to get a vehicle weighing about what the Skylon does into LEO, using about as much fuel as the concept is projected to carry. No, my problem is with the wings. They\u0027re just too small to me, that\u0027s all. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Yes, I get that the body itself will be capable of generating some lift... SOME lift. Not enough, though, and those stubby little wings won\u0027t be nearly enough to make up the difference, IMO. Also, what wing surfaces there are won\u0027t be able to exert nearly enough control authority to allow the ship to rotate for takeoff, or really to have any significant control in any axis to allow controlled flight at all, ESPECIALLY at takeoff when fully loaded with fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEh, anyway, this doesn\u0027t mean that I don\u0027t think that a future version of this design can and will fly, but I\u0027m sure that the final flight-worthy craft will have MUCH larger wings, and while it may be able to take off like an airplane, I still think it may require some sort of supplementary booster system to get it off the ground and up to a reasonable altitude before dropping that \u0027stage\u0027 and heading to orbit on its own engines and fuel supply. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, these are just my opinions, and they\u0027re worth every penny you paid to read them. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more \u0027however\u0027, however. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Even if I don\u0027t think this could fly in real life in its current form, I am very much looking forward to flying this in-game, so I certainly encourage continued work, it\u0027s really looking fantastic!

Also, mass of every segment would have to match real life one. You\u0027re doing FAR and DRE configs anyway, so they\u0027re not a problem (you\u0027d just have to rescale FAR values). I also recommend you take a look at the Advanced Jet Engine mod. With that, you\u0027d have pretty much everything. Maybe add a RemoteTech2 antenna and MechJeb, as they\u0027re also applied by RO.
