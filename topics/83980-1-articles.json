Electrodes are regularly used to let paralyzed people control computers, and it looks they used that here. When you think of moving a part of your body, the motor cortex activates. Different parts of your body are controlled by different parts of your brain (a band along the central sulcus), and with a few electrodes you can distinguish between moving your left foot and moving your right arm. The signal is quite noisy, and not very fast, but it\u0027s cheap and not very invasive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen you have the fancier stuff, fMRI (MRI that looks at the bloodflow in the brain in real time) and MEG (measures the magnetic field generated by the brain, and reconstructs a map of currents, very large and expensive machine, but brilliant). These machines have much better resolution, and can see deeper in the brain. It is for example possible to reconstruct images you see (with a rather poor resolution) by measuring activity in your visual cortex with a fMRI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd once again, if you can get electrodes directly inside the brain, you can get much better resolution. Once again, very serious cases of epilepsy is a condition that require it. To treat epilepsy surgically or by DBS (deep brain stimulation), you need to know what parts are affected, and most importantly what parts triggers the crises (it\u0027s usually a small part going berserk, the crisis then propagating). To do that accurately, doctors sometimes put a network of electrodes directly inside the skull and keep it for a few weeks. At that point, neuroscientists sometimes ask the patients to participate in diverse experiments, since they can record brain activity with an excellent resolution without putting the subject in a scary gigantic machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy combining fMRI or MEG and DBS or TMS, it should be possible to directly transmit the voice in your head into somebody\u0027s head. But that would be more expensive, and not much more useful than this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T20:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks, Idobox, for saving me the trouble of typing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-08T21:11:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for science facts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I love that smiley too much...)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
