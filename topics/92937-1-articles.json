Science at the moment is somewhat frustrating in career anyway. You can get ridiculous amounts through contracting (20% funds-\u0026gt;science blows up even bothering with science parts, though that will get balanced I assume) and I\u0027ve never liked the whole \u0022You need to go back to a biome once you\u0027ve got all the parts open\u0022 feeling whenever I go to Mun or Minmus. It forces you up a particular tech tree line first unless you really like to \u0027waste time\u0027. Yes, that\u0027s in quotes, I know this is a game that you waste time playing, but it\u0027s still horribly inefficient unless you blow out the science tests first, especially since a few of them way up in the end of the tree are for flying around atmospheres like Kerbin. Add to that you need to go to space to get wings to fly around Kerbin even at low altitudes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science tree progression has always seemed odd and contrived to me in some aspects, and while there\u0027s plenty of discussions around rebalancing it, avoiding it entirely and enjoying the tycoon portion of the game could be a lot of fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DuoDex","CreatedById":107061,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-15T20:08:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot a bad idea.
