DockingGoal has changed.. It has the same fuctions now as UnDocking.. These new fuctions have come at a price. Because of the way KSP handles Vessel IDs.. And the way Mission Controller records these vessel IDs to show a player has finished a missionGoal and save it to file.. I had to take out the Vessel ID for both Undocking and Docking. No big deal.. The only catch is that do not put Undocking and Docking into the same SubMissionGoal.. Or bad things will happen. (mission won\u0027t be able to complete) So mission designers beware.. In fact I highly suggest you keep both Docking And Undocking in Seperate SINGLE GOALs... I have tested it and you can mix 1 with any other goals..

Its just a little extra thing I added to my missions to make it seem like it takes a little bit to finish the repair.. If you made the goal without the time, the mission would be finished instantly. And the Kerbal On ladder is a KSP issue and not MC. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E You can even switch to another vessel and it will continue to count down.

It cost way more money to fix a vessel that has a SeaWater Landing then a vessel that does not.. In fact its a hard sell to Reuse any space vessel Pod that has gone through the riggers of Re-Entry and landing at all.. I always thought Mission Controller was pretty forgiving in this aspect. The idea of taking a vessel from space (not just the pod but fuel and everything else) is almost impossible the way its done in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENathan and some of the others would be better at explaining this then me.. But the way its set now believe it or not.. Is still not anywhere near realistic. Giving the player more of a Forgiving nature is the choice we made in these numbers..
