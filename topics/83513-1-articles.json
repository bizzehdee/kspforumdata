Weather could be a gameplay feature, not just a passive thing. It would have effects on launches, of course, but it could also have science value. There could be a couple of science parts (radar and a sensor that takes readings dependent on where and what kind of weather it\u0027s in) that could feed data back to a weather station at the KSC. There could be a map there that updates as you place satellites in orbit to observe the planet. You could also use the sensors on other planets, for that sweet sweet science! It\u0027s got gameplay rewards, as well as that OCD goodness you get from finishing a map with ISA Mapsat or another mapping mod. It seems like it could be a pretty fun idea, either as a mod for the game or a full feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T04:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHaving cloud patterns and storms would be nice, I agree, but consider how taxing that would be performance-wise. There would be ways to do it without melting processors, of course, but it would require quite a bit of tinkering.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Dwarf","CreatedById":67709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T04:19:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe, but maybe not. Rain and stuff would only have to be rendered around the target vessel, and there are tons of ways to do that without using much processor power. Think a combination of how minecraft handles snow and the volumetric clouds from EVE. Appears to be 3d, really just a 2d image projected in a sphere around the camera. It might not look great, but it could work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ac30fspad35","CreatedById":102694,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T05:52:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhy not get the visual enhancement mod. gives you a bunch of weather on kerbol an and other planets.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T10:08:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ac30fspad35\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ac30fspad35\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhy not get the visual enhancement mod. gives you a bunch of weather on kerbol an and other planets.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, but it doesn\u0027t affect the gameplay at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jrolson","CreatedById":77793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T17:46:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe need weather on all the planets!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-01T23:27:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERead the what-not-to-suggest and already-suggested lists before suggesting anything so as not to repeat a suggestion that is already overdone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
