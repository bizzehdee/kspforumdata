I propose what I believe is a better system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach bit of measurable science has four science amounts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- BV - base value\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- DB - delivery bonus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MB - manned bonus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MDB - manned delivery bonus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen measurement is executed by a probe, BV and DB become available. If you transmit data, you transmit BV only. Single transmission is enough. If you return the sample back, you get also DB. If you recover the experiment without previous transmission, you recover BV\u002BDB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen a measurement is executed by a manned mission (Kerbal onboard), all four become available unless they were already acquired other ways. Transmitting the data then sends BV\u002BMB, recovering the experiment recovers also DB\u002BMDB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe amount of science available should be associated with the experiment and should depend on the mode in which the measurement was made. Subsequent transmission or recovery should not change anything on it. The idea is, if the measurement is manned, all four parts of science reward should be available for recovery even if the recovered part is unmanned (people tend to dump their Kerbals on EVA after landing, that should not hamper scientific result).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple measurement records should be storable on the experiment just like multiple crew reports can be stored in a command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExamples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 1:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou send manned mission and recover the craft after measurement\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou get BV\u002BDB\u002BMB\u002BMDB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou send a probe which returns back and is recoveder\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou get BV\u002BDB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen you send manned mission and transmit results\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou get MB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScenario 3:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou send manned mission and transmit results\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou get BV\u002BMB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethen you send a probe which returns back and is recovered\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou get DB\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
