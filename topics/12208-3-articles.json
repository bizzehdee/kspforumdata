I\u0027ve managed to make a few rockets using just those parts but have a few questions and suggestions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, I\u0027m trying to figure out the purpose of the 1m to .5m adapter. I understand the .5m Nosecone fits on top of the Spartacus SRB, but I can\u0027t think of a reason I would ever need to use the 1m to .5m adapter. Any hints? I guess it might be suitable for the Probobodyne cores and fueltanks, as they are also about the only thing that fit without clipping inside the 1m and 1.5m fairings (even the stock landing legs poke out, but if you use the parts for the Odin lander from NP then you can make it fit). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, what made you go with 1.5m parts? I think I\u0027ve heard you roughly quoted as stating you weren\u0027t happy with NovaPunch and that\u0027s why you stopped working on it, does this have anything to do with why you used 1.5m parts instead of 1.75 which already has some fuel tanks and engines (from NP and KW Rocktry respectively)? In regards to that, do you have any plans to add adapters from 1.5m up to 1.75 or 2m? I\u0027ve rescaled the 1.75m to 2m adapter (at 1.07 it fits closely enough) from NP to fit my purposes and then have the 1.75m to 2m adapter for another upscale, but it would be nice to have something that fit nicely and was meant for the pack so it worked easily with other mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, landing legs? As stated above, I\u0027m assuming the fairings are meant for probes and things like that since not much else will fit inside them, but a 1m pod will fit as long as you don\u0027t build out. The original stock legs mostly fit, but they clip a bit on their feet. Is it possible we could get telescoping legs similar to the new stock ones (albeit smaller to fit on a 1m pod inside the fairings) or sturdier versions of the Odin ones?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I enjoy what\u0027s in it so far and your aesthetic style, and appreciate your work both on mods and in the stock game. I will say I had to edit the thrusters that have minimum thrust and cannot be shut off entirely, but I understand why you may have configured them that way. It feels like these parts and engines were meant for a specific payload weight to function as intended, i.e. getting out of atmosphere as the tanks run dry in the larger engines that cannot have the throttle cut entirely and using the smaller ones exospherically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NovaSilisko","CreatedById":3897,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-20T00:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027ve edited the post to get my point across more. \u003Cem\u003EI am not working on any of these anymore and never will again.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
