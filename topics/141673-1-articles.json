Now for some reason it will not drill\u00A0 at a reasonable rate at all. Used to fill a tank in no time(less than a day or so) now it would take years. I even slapped on some more radiator panels to try and help, Is this a bug? The one thing that has changed is that I used to use only the drilling rig and attach it with KAS/KIS directly to my refueler rig. The large rover that is attached in the screens is new. However, when I unattach it still does this. I even tried reattaching the old way, still the same. I then moved to a new ore location about 3km away and tried with drilling rig only. Still the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/440605165244598658/B8CD10ED09B852431F3CDC35D4E31B8D71D49B7D/\u0022 alt=\u0022B8CD10ED09B852431F3CDC35D4E31B8D71D49B7D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
