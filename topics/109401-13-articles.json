The problem is that parts animated via this module won\u0027t affect anything attached to them - a telescoping tailboom, when retracted, for example, would retract, but anything attached to the tailboom, like tailfins/elevators/etc, would remain where they were; only IR can move parts, and any parts connected to the moving part. The other part of cargobays, ModuleCargoBay can be used to turn off things like ModuleLiftingSurface, but can\u0027t function on its self - any folding wing would require two parts - a wingbase/aeroshell/whatever mounting point with a ModuleCargobay, and the actual wing part that is mounted on the base part.

For tailfins, the idea would be to take tall vertical or diagonal tailfins and fold them down to avoid smacking into anything sticking out of the station, and for wings a two or three piece foldup to minimize the distance they stick out (I\u0027ll have to draw a concept sketch for that). Putting things on them like engines or something would obviously be a bad idea, since that would put (relatively) vulnerable components in the way of reentry heat. For a spaceplane, you\u0027d want to keep those high and out of the direct plasma stream on the body somewhere, and keep the wings low if you\u0027re making a folding-wing design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
