In any case the drag may be less but the effect of Eve\u0027s atmosphere on the engines is brutal. At Eve sea level the Mammoth and the Aerospike lose a third of their thrust and efficiency at Eve sea level compared to vacuum, the Mainsail and the LFB have their performance halved, and other engines suffer even worse.
