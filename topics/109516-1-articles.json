I\u0027ve been fighting all week to get the damn new version downloaded. I try downloading the zip files but the download crashes after 400MB. I know most of the problem is because I have a US Cellular 4G router and they do weird stuff with downloads. I can usually fix most downloads when they stall by pausing and resuming but these Kerbal zipfiles cause errors and it doesn\u0027t work. I emailed support and asked them to break the download into smaller chunks but I got no response. I finally get the Windows Installer to download, but it installs this stupid launcher and there is no way to turn it off and stop it from connecting to the internet. That advanced checkbox does nothing but automatically push the \u0027Play\u0027 button. I have a limit of 6gig and I do not want to connect the internet every time I run this program. Yes a US Cellular 4G router sucks but you\u0027re a bunch of snobs who think the whole world has unlimited broadband and you can suck on our bandwidth whenever you feel like."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:33:49Z","Content":"Sorry wnderer but we can\u0027t fix your internet, have you tried a download manager such as DownThemAll or tried to download KSP from somewhere else?"},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:36:30Z","Content":"It might not be his internet it might actually be the store because mine refuses to download."},{"CreatedByName":"tg626","CreatedById":112361,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T14:41:41Z","Content":"Sounds like you might have it installed.

Even if you are frustrated it really is not in your own best interest to take it out on the very people you rely on for help.\n\nMy 2 cents would be trying to use software that allows for intermittent downloading (i.e. download managers) and just trying to download KSP somewhere else.
