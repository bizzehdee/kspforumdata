I can\u0027t get things to snap right, multi-part connections focus on the wrong command module, etc. I read that there used to be plugins that helped with this type of issue, but they appear to be gone so I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s a resolved problem and I\u0027m just missing something in the VAB?

But for one somewhat asymmetric ship it introduced some parallax error when docking. The port was alright and functional, but when following the navball, things wouldn\u0027t line up.
