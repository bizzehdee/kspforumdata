A long, long time ago, with a different aero, you couldn\u0027t make spaceplanes witouth an incredibly efficient rocket motor. Of course, this would be overpowered in rockets, that\u0027s why the aerospike has no attachment points, and other things such as no gimbal(despite that the real aerospike had gimbal). But it\u0027s also logical: how would you safely fix a decoupler RING on the top of a SPIKE?! (witouth using magic). Jet engines used to have attachment points, wich were removed. Maybe again, to prevent their usage with rockets. They had no fairings as well, wich looked quite weird.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T11:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, please.
