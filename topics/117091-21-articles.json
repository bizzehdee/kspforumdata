Instead, it\u0027s even more logical to make it inverted, like a spoon in your hand. Look at my Bf 109 which has a complex wing design because at that time I was tinkering with stock landing gears. Stock 0.90 aero, but until FAR recognizes complex wings fully, don\u0027t bother with them.\n\n![jlV3tW3.png](http://i.imgur.com/jlV3tW3.png)\n\n![Lbtbuzr.png](http://i.imgur.com/Lbtbuzr.png)\n\nAs you can see the leading edge has a 30 deg. tilt upwards.
