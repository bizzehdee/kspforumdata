This creates a more spectacular overall explosion, but also creates the situation that if the failure is determined to propagate all the way to the command pod, even if you manage to get the command pod away (through LES for example), the command pod will still explode no matter what; I actually sort of like this as the command pod could have \u0022suffered structural damage\u0022 from the explosion and even a proper abort cannot save it. I could attempt to remove remaining parts from the doomed parts list if they manage to get a certain distance from the explosions (that is currently beyond my knowledge at the time).

The engine could fail in two ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) It stops producing thrust, which either causes you to not go to space today, or if you have multiple engines causes your thrust to go out of angle and you spin off and you can or can\u0027t recover or maybe break up/burn up under the stock aero model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) It explodes, and you increase the heat of that part to something suitably high before you remove it, and let the stock heat transfer model determine if that should cause the adjoining fuel tank to fail, which gets the same treatment - suitable amount of heat on explosion, and on up the stage.

For instance, you would get failures on engines, because that\u0027s really where the failure would happen. The engine could fail in two ways:\u003Cp\u003E1) It stops producing thrust, which either causes you to not go to space today, or if you have multiple engines causes your thrust to go out of angle and you spin off and you can or can\u0027t recover or maybe break up/burn up under the stock aero model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) It explodes, and you increase the heat of that part to something suitably high before you remove it, and let the stock heat transfer model determine if that should cause the adjoining fuel tank to fail, which gets the same treatment - suitable amount of heat on explosion, and on up the stage. Parts without fuel don\u0027t explode arbitrarily, but may fail under the aero model. Kerbals may die due to g-loading, etc. but the command pod itself wouldn\u0027t spontaneously explode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis gives you both an understanding of the failure and presumably some opportunity to abort, but also possibly some ability to design craft that can better protect the crew. Might be a fair bit harder to code, though.

I think the way I have it coded in the most recent version released is pretty good at mimicking this organic propagation though. I\u0027ve literally spent a couple of hours just launching over and over with various rocket designs using my debug version of the DLL and the explosions are definitely varied, everything from a puny side booster to the entire rocket exploding. If the stock heating model ever changes to allow me to accomplish the same with it, I will convert over to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the parts that are used in the propagation are calculated at the moment of the initial part being destroyed, so if you have a proper abort sequence and are quick enough at noticing the rapidly overheating engine and abnormal thrust from it (or use the auto-abort on failure feature I will have), you should be able to survive (unless you are randomly struck by debris, as I have a couple of times in my testing, but at that point my mod has no control of your Kerbals\u0027 fates).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, my next goal is to create the code to handle the custom settings, which at that point I think the mod will be ready for a proper release.
