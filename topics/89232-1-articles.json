So I was thinking that the material study could have different materials and different types of experiments that take a bit of the material to use. I was also thinking that a new module could be added, a publicity module, where famous kerbonauts could make videos and send them back down to get reputation! I think that this would not only make science more interesting and flexible but also make space stations more valuable and practical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
