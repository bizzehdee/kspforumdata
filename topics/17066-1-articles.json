(Lava-Planet, Desert-Planet, Moons, etc.) Well, i thought that this is SO fu**ing cool, that i wanted to contriubte more, then the money i have spent on buying the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat i did, was the following: I just bought the game again, and it now shows that i have paid the game for $ 33. I guess thats the price of my first purchase and the price of the second one today combined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, i hope the guys behind this game receive that money, because this NEEDS to keep growing. I love Kerbal Space Program, and i want a \u0022Donate\u0022-Button or something on the homepage, so that i can give \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C2\u00AC 5 once i a while, when i feel like it.

They really should, though.

But even if that is not possible, donating would still be a good idea. I dont want to give away free copies of the game, i want to assist the developers because i want this to keep running.
