I can only assume that\u0027s to try to make it so people don\u0027t use MJ, but sometimes manually launching rockets can get tedious at best if you\u0027ve done it thousands of times over the last 2 years. Is there any way I can change this?\u003Cp\u003EI know, some people are going to call me a newb or whatever, but I\u0027ve been playing this game since 0.12 - I\u0027ve been to every body in the Kerbin system with manual control and I just like using MJ - personal preference kind of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb thing is not our doing.

Im pretty happy with the current version of MCE. Things seem very solid now. I have just done a bunch of missions, from Duna to jool and everything seemed to be running smooth as silk. No weird Recycling problems. My current game things are going nice have almost 75% of research tree done. And 1/2 of MCE Research done. Don\u0027t care what anyone says.. MCE makes the research tree harder.
