Both ships should work using stock parts, but I think using cubic girders to attach the engines to a larger tank is silly. These are the planes\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/qxny4w.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qxny4w.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i61.tinypic.com/23vdu9v.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002223vdu9v.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey both reach orbit, and the first one is faster to do it and more nimble. And I was able to use the first one to put a light payload in orbit. I wonder if they can be further improved - are tail fins necessary? Is it ok, better or worse to use winglets instead? Do the wings themselves count as control surfaces?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, these two models work and they allow me to rescue stranded kerbals in orbit and put a few tons in orbit. So I\u0027ve decided to try to build something bigger, although I\u0027m not sure if spaceplanes can put more useful payloads in orbit - say an interplanetary transfer stage or a lander. So I\u0027ve been building this but, even after I got it out of the runway, it just won\u0027t get higher than 2,500 m. Does it need more wings? And if so, is there a statistics mod like KER or MJ that would show how much?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i62.tinypic.com/r2jfp2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022r2jfp2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill stubborn, I changed the concept and built this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i59.tinypic.com/2lc753n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222lc753n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich works, and gets into orbit with... 100 left over delta-v, so I\u0027m still trying to improve it. It\u0027s also hard to maneuver, specially at high altitudes. I\u0027m think about trying to put all turbojets behind the centerline fuselage and put the rocket engines where the outer jets are right now. Or replacing everything with Rapiers, so no engine is dead weight at any given time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the ascend profile for spaceplanes is roughly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClimb in a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 something angle until 20,000 meters; level around 30,000 meters, get the speed close to 2,000 m/s and the periapsis as high as possible (say, around -200 km) before switching the jets for rockets, right? Or I\u0027m missing something?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also read people who likes the aerospikes as engines, but I\u0027m not sure about them: they weight as much as the LV-T30 and T43 and have less thrust. Their ISP remains the same in the atmosphere, but the rocket engines are fired at high altitudes anyway\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen that turbojets have to throttled down when low on air or else they\u0027d flameout. Is there a guideline about how much, and a way to predict when to throttle them down? I\u0027ve been using MJ for that, but I\u0027d rather do it my self. Also, is there a way to restart a flamed out jet engine without editing the save file?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the spirit of doing something different, I was thinking about landing a SSTO in the Mun to rescue a stranded Kerbal - but how are spaceplane landed in a vacuum? With a rocket, I\u0027d lower my Pe near the point I want to land, kill my horizontal velocity and fall from the skies. I could try that with a spaceplane, and make sure I level it when below 100m (and use monopropellant or a dedicated VTOL engine to slow down I guess), but can horizontal landings be accomplished? As I think it, there is no atmosphere to slow down the spaceship, so I\u0027d be coming down at a great horizontal speed, so the ship would have to land pointing to the surface prograde marker - ie, with the tail up front. And a gentle deorbit has to be achieved beforehand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-09T21:58:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first issue I see (And probably where most of your problems are coming from) Is that your aircraft are all very short.
