Don\u0027t know how or when it happened, it just where there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I spent a lot of time, crafts and fuel to park it on a closer and circle-ish kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022screenshot227.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/sjLSkVF/screenshot227.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce parked, there were still some mineral left on the asteroid, so I decided to try to build some kind of refueling space station on it.
