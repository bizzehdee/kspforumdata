Why can\u0027t this heat be harnessed into thermoelectric power? Granted, it might seem cheaty to do so, since a refinery and drills would provide unlimited heat, but it seems like it might be feasible. Perhaps, to keep it from being too OP, the power output could be low-level, with a chance of the generator itself exploding due to overheating. I dunno, I\u0027m not a modder, but I figured I\u0027d throw that out there."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T02:42:53Z","Content":"Why would it be cheating?

I personally don\u0027t think it is, since you\u0027re using something readily available, but it definitely renders solar power obsolete on surface bases with refineries given the ubiquitousness of heat in the game now. \n\nDeveloping the idea further, maybe the generator could also serve as a radiator. Nertea made some heatpipes in his NFElectrical pack, and they act like fuel lines or struts in the way you put them on your ship. Maybe one could be developed using the KAS pipe model, allowing you to build a power generator/heat radiator module for your base, and connect it to your other modules via KAS-powered heatpipes."}]}
