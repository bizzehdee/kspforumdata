In fact, often my nuclear engines explode for some weird reason. It works better if I first seperate the whole thing from the orange tank, hence the extra coupler. At least then it doesn\u0027t all explode. But in whatever way I use the stages (engines first, and then the three couplers), the engines get detached from the upper adapter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to make this work? I just want the three nuclear engines below the ship.

Instead of remaining attached to the decoupler, the two pieces instead go flying off in opposite directions perpendicular to the engine.

This kind of connection isn\u0027t, so far as I\u0027m aware, actually possible in KSP due to the tree structure, so two of those decouplers are most likely attached to the engines but not the tri-adapter (Meaning they get violently shot into the adapter when you decouple.)

You have the white ones inside the main tanks. Then the smallest tanks that exist (5.74 liters of fuel) inside the white ones, and on top of that the yellow rings, mainly for looks. Every \u0022ring\u0022 has a solar panel, except for one at the top which has a small battery. It is the only battery on-board, but with the way the solar panels are attached I don\u0027t need more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that with the nuclear engines, I get to Gilly (turned out I could almost get to Eve with one orange tanker still attached). Then I detach the nuclear engines and only use the top ship, which has 4 small orange thrusters at the sides and 4 small lander legs (should be enough for the low gravity at Gilly). With all the fuel I should be able to get back to Kerbin.
