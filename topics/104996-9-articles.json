I\u0027ll be in touch. I\u0027ll probably work on incorporating this after I get the 3 IVAs finished for the last 3 modules released.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Have you seen ALCOR,\u0022Advanced Landing Capsule for Orbital Rendezvous\u0022 by ASET [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54925](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54925)\n\u003E Spin around in the pod and look at the hatch in it you can open it and think if you want you could even use his prop maybe.\n\nYea, I\u0027ve used the ALCOR pod before. Incorporating EVAing from the IVA, I\u0027ll probably make my own hatch prop so there isn\u0027t any dependency.\n\nWith hieywiey\u0027s idea this is what I\u0027m thinking, but I\u0027m not sure if some of these will be possible:\n\n**EVA:**\n\n-From IVA, click on a toggle switch on a control panel to either pressurize or depressurize, and that would be tied to a LED indicator. \n\n-Clickable internal EVA hatch would need to know the status of the Equipment lock\u0027s atmospheric pressure to know if the door can be operated.\n\n-When the equipment lock is depressurized, the door can be toggled opened or closed. This however will not automatically force you to EVA like the ALCOR pod. Instead it will just expose a void in the IVA model so that you can see into the Crew lock portion, which will be modeled as part of the exterior model.\n\n-Toggling the airlock door OPEN will then enable an invisible collider in the opening so that you will need to click to go out on EVA.\n\n**IVA-Exiting Equipment Lock:**\n\n-Spawning the kerbal inside the crew lock segment might be a bit tricky, and would need them to go backwards on the ladder all the way out. So, I\u0027m thinking for now they would just spawn outside of the crew lock door.\n\n-The Equipment Lock hatch would then be reset to the closed position (unless the animation would automatically reset everytime you exit from the IVA view?). \n\n**EVA Re-Entry:**\n\n-The external crew lock door will need to be toggled open.\n\n-I modeled the proportions for a kerbal with a helmet to fit through the hatch, so I can try to position some ladder colliders so that you can climb on into the crew lock all the way to the equipment lock hatch.\n\n-There will be a control panel with a status LED and pressure gauge that you then need to toggle to de-pressurize the equipment lock (if is not already).\n\n-If the equipment lock is de-pressurized, you can then press  **to board the airlock.**"},{"CreatedByName":"hieywiey","CreatedById":99098,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T01:37:21Z","Content":"Well it should also be visibly open even when you aren\u0027t in IVA.
