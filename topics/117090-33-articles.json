Alternatively, will we be eable to stretch the [COLOR=#333333]Common-Bulkhead like regular fuel tanks? [/COLOR]That would be quite nice for I think.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI keep asking for more...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: I forgot to mention this, the line @cost *= 2 and @cost *= 3 are missing in the config of SC-ENG-F1B[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese new round-bottom/skeletal mounts will all be usable under the engine clusters as well, so in that fashion yes, you can use them below the tanks. As far as tank \u0026#39;end cap options\u0026#39;, I have a bit of other reworking of the custom-fuel-tank code to do to let them use the new engine-mounts system (and make them easier to work with in general), but eventually, yes, you will be able to use any of the engine mounts as tank end-cap options.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, you can stretch both the split tank and common-bulkhead type upper stages; it is even more controllable / finer control than the regular tanks, so you can fine-tune them to your payload/engine setup. Currently I have it setup as two parts in the editor, one for split-tank, one for common-bulkhead. Both are configurable for height, diameter, and mount, and the split-tank type also has a solid-style intertank option/mesh-switch in the editor. RCS is repositioned depending upon what mount is used, and the thrust will be dependent upon the diameter/scale currently in use (thrust-scaling not-yet-implemented). Fuel quantity scales with the diameter and/or height adjustments. There is also a reserve (1.5% total volume, configurable) of monopropellant (configurable) for use by the RCS and fuel cell system, the amount of this reserve scales with tank volume (height/diamter) (yet to be included in the plugin is a scaling EC/battery reserve).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNoted on the F1B clusters, and fixed dev-side.
