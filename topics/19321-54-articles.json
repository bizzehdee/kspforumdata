The dV really doesn\u0027t matter; it\u0027s the mass necessary to achieve it that matters in the long run. I actually think that idea has come up a few times and I\u0027d be very happy to see someone take on the \u0022lower Isps to keep payload ratios low with FAR\u0022-type of project, but it\u0027s not something I want to do myself. Too many part packs that would need to be taken into consideration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI dislike the \u0022make the atmosphere out of soup\u0022 method of adding difficulty since it adds very little to any aspect of gameplay; for launches it just adds a slow, 10km vertical ascent and for planes it adds a nearly vertical ascent to the same altitude. It requires that jet engines to have too much thrust to make flight at sea level possible, which makes reaching top speed at maximum altitude in a plane almost laughably easy; it also makes jets a viable almost-SSTO-stage for rockets when they should be no more than extra boosters in that role, if they should be able to do anything there at all. It also makes exploring the surface of a planet tedious; you\u0027re limited to very low speeds by the large drag forces or you have to burn tons of fuel to move at relatively slow speeds. Finally, there\u0027s almost no challenge landing on a planet with a half-decent atmosphere once you get past reentry; just let the atmosphere slow you down to ~100 m/s and then land from there; no danger of slamming into the ground with a vertical lander or trying to touch down to fast with a plane, since the atmosphere will slow you down more than enough.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem with the drag losses isn\u0027t that they\u0027re there, it\u0027s that they\u0027re way too high compared to all the other loses. There\u0027s almost no fun launching a rocket since so much time is spent waiting for it to be high enough to actually do something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the rocket, I see what the problem is there: FAR uses the size of the attachnodes to estimate some drag parameters and the top of the MkII Lander Can is a size 1 when it should be a size 2 based on the part diameter. There are a lot of stock parts that just don\u0027t use the proper attachnode size. There\u0027s really nothing I can do there since I think using ModuleManager to try and fix that will just cause craft files to break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@egreSS: \u003C/strong\u003EThat is an issue I\u0027ve noticed myself (but probably not to the same extent that you\u0027re noticing it).

Once you so are, burn in a direction that expands your orbit expands while maintaining your apoapsis until your apoapsis turns too far away. At that point, coast to a comfortable distance to apoapsis and circularize.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModifications:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut fins on the bottom stage of your rocket or replace a non-gimablling lower stage motor with a gimballing one in order to give yourself the control authority that you\u0027ll need to keep your rocket straight despite occasional errors of the PID.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR simulates air as air, and objects experience apparent wind while travelling through air. If you\u0027ve ever stuck your head out the window of a moving car or run at a full sprint, then you\u0027ve experienced apparent wind: it\u0027s the apparent motion of air relative to you. Apparent wind applies to rocketry because rockets upwards hurtle through the air at breakneck speed and thereby generate equally roaring gales. When the rocket is pointed straight upward, these gales act on the nose-cone of the rocket and are simply interesting; however, when the rocket turns, they act on the exposed side of the rocket and press the turn outward. Long, skinny rockets are particularly susceptible to this push because their entire lengths act as levers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet the force of the apparent wind is proportional not only to the airspeed, but the density of the medium. Again, we experience this phenomenon firsthand: we hardly mind when a column of air the size of a refrigerator rushes at us at a hundred kilometers per hour, but I doubt that anyone here would stand tall in the face of a column of water that\u0027s likewise hurtling. I\u0027ve studied my Kerbal Engineer readouts and observed that the fluid medium through which we move on Kerbin--its atmosphere--becomes exponentially less dense as we rise past 12km. In this case, the practical implication of this rapid decrease in density is that gravity turns are much easier and safer above 12km than below 12km; the natural conclusion to draw from this implication is to take the shortest route to 12km (a straight line) and then slowly turn over for orbital maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFairings: Yes!

One thing to look at is how the CoM shifts during the ascent; it is always possible that it is shifting back enough for the rocket to become unstable, particularly if the rocket has a first stage containing multiple fuel tank parts with any of them above the CoM, though I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the problem with these rockets. Another thing to look at is the amount of control authority you get from gimbal-equipped rocket engines; if you are too reliant on reaction wheel torque you will probably lose control. A final thing to check is what dynamic pressure you detach the lowest core booster; if the dynamic pressure is high when you do that you might lose control momentarily while waiting for the second stage engine to ignite and give you control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If you have a TWR ~1.4 I\u0027ve found the best option to be to go straight up until you\u0027re going 60 m/s and then angle the rocket about 1-2 degrees off the flight path in the direction you want to turn. After that, try to keep the rocket pointing surface-prograde, and don\u0027t drift outside of the prograde ring during the ascent unless you know the rocket can take it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Putting lifting surfaces on the bottom of your first stage is generally a good idea, since it will drag the CoL further behind the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Yes they do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the differences between your rockets, it is always possible that the drag of the fairing for the smaller rocket is worse than for the larger rocket. Another possibility is that the parts (which are mod parts in both rockets) are not set up with the correct size attachnodes to handle drag properly; 0.625m uses size 0, 1.25m uses size 1, 2.5m uses size 2, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure what\u0027s causing the CoL bug, but I\u0027ll look into it.
