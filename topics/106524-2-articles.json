Essentially the game thinks that I have two joysticks plugged in, and once set up everything can be mapped in game in the usual fashion.\n\nI\u0027m not the best with instructions, so I did a quick search and found the write-up with directions listed at the link below. I\u0027m not exactly sure if it\u0027s the same discussion that I originally used to get myself set up, but after reading through it looks correct. It should get you set up with both of the programs necessary to fix the issues.\n\n[http://www.homebrewgame.com/forums/topic/how-i-got-my-saitek-joystick-working-with-unity-and-thus-homebrew/](http://www.homebrewgame.com/forums/topic/how-i-got-my-saitek-joystick-working-with-unity-and-thus-homebrew/)\n\nOnce set up, the virtual joystick should stay put and never have to be fiddled with again, though there is the slight inconvenience of needing to open/make sure the re-mapper is running before starting Kerbal.\n\n**One last VERY important reminder - once you\u0027ve set up your bindings in game, always make sure that your control device is plugged in and recognized before starting Kerbal,** **otherwise the game will clear all of the config prefs and you\u0027ll have to set them up again** (note-this does not apply to UJR thankfully, just the hardware). You\u0027ll know that this happened when the game re-asks you if you want to submit your log information to help with development upon start-up. \n\nIf this does happen, all is not lost: Ctrl-Alt-Dlt-ing out of the game and shutting it down through the control panel will make sure your settings aren\u0027t overwritten (as they save when exiting using the in-game \u0022Quit\u0022 button). \n\nOk, I think that should do it - my frustration with not being able to get my joystick to work in the early days of my KSP career almost made me shelve the game in frustration before I ever got started, and what a tragedy that would have been. Hopefully these tips can help get others over that hump so that they can spend less time getting their hardware to work and more time exploding their first few rockets.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-05T14:21:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/05/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aurorunner**\n  \nAccidentally quoted the response to another quote rather than the quote I wanted, and just bolded reminder for emphasis."},{"CreatedByName":"jwt101","CreatedById":134071,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-21T19:43:42Z","Content":"I am having the same problems, so it is clearly affecting a wide range of hardware.
