I always leave the torque on, steer and throttle with the keypad, and use WASDQE for torque as needed. A and D work together with KP4 and KP6 to improve steering in tight spaces, while WDQE orient the rover to match the terrain slope on low-gravity worlds. They are also quite useful for landing properly when catching big air ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nSo really, really, remap your rover controls and you\u0027ll be much happier."},{"CreatedByName":"MelonHeadSeb","CreatedById":67347,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T18:26:20Z","Content":"Thanks, I guess I\u0027ll have to remap them then.

Put WASD in as secondary keybinds for translation so that is used for translation while docking mode is active. Not sure about rovers yet though."},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:42:43Z","Content":"Docking mode was changed to make it more useful. Apparently very few people were actually using it at all. (Personally I found it too confusing to have a separate set of controls for docking, and always used the standard mode). It uses the secondary keybindings (for any that are defined) so that is easier to remap it to do, well, anything you want. It\u0027s also less clutter in the settings screen. For example I now use it for rovers in situations where the steering controls would conflict with torque, which was always annoying in previous versions."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:49:43Z","Content":"Yeah, docking mode was awful. It basically said \u0022you should dock like this\u0022 and nobody did.\n\nYou now have full control over what each mode does, so even call it \u0022docking mode\u0022 is incorrect. I use a flight stick (where on a plane, yaw should be twisting the stick and on a rocket roll should be twisting the stick) so I call it \u0022plane mode\u0022 and \u0022rocket mode\u0022. You can still configure it to be the old way, just choose secondary controls and set that for docking mode while setting the primary controls for flight mode."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T01:05:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The very first thing I did after installing KSP 1.0.X was remapping rover controls to IJKL.
