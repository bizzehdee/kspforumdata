I always leave the torque on, steer and throttle with the keypad, and use WASDQE for torque as needed. A and D work together with KP4 and KP6 to improve steering in tight spaces, while WDQE orient the rover to match the terrain slope on low-gravity worlds.

Apparently very few people were actually using it at all. (Personally I found it too confusing to have a separate set of controls for docking, and always used the standard mode). It uses the secondary keybindings (for any that are defined) so that is easier to remap it to do, well, anything you want. It\u0027s also less clutter in the settings screen. For example I now use it for rovers in situations where the steering controls would conflict with torque, which was always annoying in previous versions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:49:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, docking mode was awful.
