The manual throttle control is also locked; I cannot control the throttle. If I abort the maneuver, I have manual control of the throttle. I do have enough battery charge and all of the limit buttons are off, just in case there is a conflict. Circularize worked around Kerbal before I went to the moon. Landing Guidance also does not work on the Mun but it does work on Dune. The circularize was working on another Mun trip. I have tried relaunching the mission, and the same thing happened. Any ideas how to fix this most excellent mod? It Is like the Mun does a whammy on the Mechjeb.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mait3rz","CreatedById":143719,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T06:06:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey I was having the same issue too, it\u0027s a bug with the most recent release of mechjeb.
