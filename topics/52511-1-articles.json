I am completely lost though for modding on ksp. I could not find a single tutorial that stated on how to make a model, even the one on this discussion has the first step as \u0022put in the model\u0022 which makes no sense what so ever, anyways i made it a decent way when i found this tutorial at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.alternatewars.com/Games/KSP/Tut1/KSP_Tutorial_1-3.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.alternatewars.com/Games/KSP/Tut1/KSP_Tutorial_1-3.htm\u003C/a\u003E. I was modding with blender made everything and had my collision meshes and textures then exported the dae file. I then put that in a folder with the mesh folder and the texture folder with the texture. When i loaded the game though it simply did nothing. The person who made this tutorial had an example which i then tried and it worked fine. Things were very strange though. When i removed all the files from the mesh folder which supposedly are supposed to generate on there own the part generated had the same textures as my part! what is going on??? I then tried multiple other things to get it to work and all have failed. COULD SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME OR SEND ME TO A TUTORIAL THAT WILL ACTUALLY HELP ME?!??!?!!? What am i doing wrong???\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E:(\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-09T19:52:35Z\u0022 title=\u002211/09/2013 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by travis575757\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"onkelsiebdruck","CreatedById":63647,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-09T21:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Efirst if i read this right, you did not use unity and your work is based on an older tutorial?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esecond you also created a cfg-file for your parts? did you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethird....use unity...you have more control on what and how you export to ksp \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand for starting with unity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25482-TUTORIAL-Getting-Started-With-Unity-BACK-FROM-THE-DEAD\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25482-TUTORIAL-Getting-Started-With-Unity-BACK-FROM-THE-DEAD\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/34013-0-20-PartTools-GameDatabase-and-new-features\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/34013-0-20-PartTools-GameDatabase-and-new-features\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-22-Last-update-7th-Nov\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25013-Compilation-of-modding-information-links-for-0-19-20-21-22-Last-update-7th-Nov\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand if you are allready using unity and or written a cfg-file...show what you did there, that could help helping you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
