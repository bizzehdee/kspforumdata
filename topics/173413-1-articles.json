certain way so he has to trick it to allow the resource transfer which then allows for kerbal transfer as it is vanilla behavior and mods dont remove vanilla behavior... still the mod can be designed in a more intuitive way... i have not modded ksp before but i know you can create your own GUIs so he should have coded his own resource transfer gui which keeps the ship undocked and then he can set the resource values in the two ships through the GUI... then it doesnt use the vanilla docked behavior... i get it though, the way he did it was quicker to accomplish but it allows for kerbal transfer exploit... i mean it is always up to you to exploit that so even though I could i dont and when connected i only will transfer the resources that would make sense to be pumped through a hose like all the TACS supplies and fuel but not kerbals\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited

Many mods are made to make something in a game more realistic like when deadly re entry was a mod. I have made mods for games before so I know what you mean when a game\u0027s vanilla behavior can\u0027t be changed. A mod could check for when you perform a vanilla behavior that you dont like and act appropriately. I dont know what you can access in the api as i never modded for ksp but changing vanilla behavior is possible by working around it. Which I guess is essentially what the living spaces mod does since you said it fixes that vanilla behavior. I doubt he is preventing the vanilla behavior but rather correcting it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo expecting realism from a mod is not unreasonable, it depends how clever you are when it comes to coding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-04T21:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was probably just being a little over sensitive.\u00A0 \u00A0I just wanted to make the point that the mod \u0022should do\u0022 whatever the author wants it to do.\u00A0 If you\u0027d like it to do something differently, the best course of action is to either politely suggest a new feature, worded as a request, not a critique, or to fork it and make your own version, if the license allows!\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere\u0027s no reason a mod can\u0027t add realism, if that\u0027s what the author wants from it.\u00A0 You\u0027re absolutely right - connected living spaces does just what you\u0027re suggesting, fixes the stock behavior by blocking kerbal transfers without a valid path through the ship.\u00A0 If someone wants that fixed, they can grab that mod, regardless of whether or not they have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E installed.\u00A0 \u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, in fact, has already split into \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, because the author wanted it to be one mod that fixes one need, so that players can mix and match it with different mods that do different things.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0But EXPECTING anything from a mod is the wrong attitude and choice of language and it burns our mod authors out, which is why I\u0027m quick to jump to their defense when someone selects wording like that.\u00A0 I may have misread the connotation - I just heard a bit of entitlement to the mod working the way you wanted.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 And I assure you... \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and KospY are already sufficiently clever...\u00A0 but feel free to fork and clever it on up if you need to!\u00A0 The license allows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"i_like_kerbals","CreatedById":156131,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-04T23:30:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe mod should not do what the author wants if the author is not a logical person\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nit should work intuitively and in a logical way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-04T23:50:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGuys, personal attacks are not allowed here.
