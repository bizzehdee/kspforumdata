A trivial launch stage with Reliant and SRBs \u002B fins, a decoupler, and the actual probe consisting of a nuke, one MK1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E fuselage, the smaller of the two round probe cores (RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit), Z-1k battery, two solar panels, an antenna and the orbital scanner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the moment I dropped the launch stage, I lost all of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E abilities - it became the equivalent of OKTO 1. No Target, no Prograde, no Node - all guidance by hand, just bare stability assist left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems the game disables these when it loses all attitude control authority, and with non-swiveled nuke this might seem as such - except RC-001S has a perfectly adequate reaction wheel which is more than sufficient for the task. Still, I had to conduct the flight like in times of first orbital flights, a step above Stayputnik.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-10T13:17:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145504-sharpy/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022145504\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/145504-sharpy/\u0022 id=\u0022ips_uid_3701_10\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Sharpy\u003C/a\u003E, did you run out of EC at any point?

It might have lost EC momentarily later (though it\u0027s dubious, two 2x6 panels on two sides, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E and 1k battery, which would be way more than enough to carry it through the night side), but the abilities were gone right after staging, scarce minutes after launch, so the 1k battery was hardly affected.
