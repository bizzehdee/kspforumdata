It\u0027s been well established that, on Kerbin, not only can you get SrfLanded in the Water biome but you can get SrfSplashed for every \u0022land\u0022 biome; basically, liquid water is prevalent and spread throughout the planet.

I\u0027ve confirmed that you can get SrfLanded in the Sagen and Explodium Seas on Laythe and Eve, but what\u0027s not clear to me is if every other biome* has at least one spot with an SrfSplash-able area. I\u0027ve combed through the forums and the wiki and it seems like it\u0027s assumed?
