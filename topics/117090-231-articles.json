Going to be two main lines of \u0027landers\u0027.  Vertical (the stuff that is available now, with some minor reworking), and Horizontal (all new stuff).\n\nThe first is the classic vertical lander setup, much as is available now.  Will include the current LC pods (perhaps updated a bit), and a new set of octagonal MFT fuel tanks.  The new tanks will **-not-** include solar, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003Ertg\u003C/abbr\u003E, legs, etc; the old system for those was a giant collection of hacks, and I have no desire to go down that road again.  Instead I am working on a system of \u0027pre-built\u0027 leg sets that will ship with KF.  The new tanks will likely also be less of a \u0027bare tank\u0027 look and more of an enclosed fuel tank segment; makes it far easier to allow for the length/model adjustments used by the MFT module (still undecided on this, might be able to get bare tanks working).  When the tanks are created I\u0027ll also work on creating some octagonal mounts and adapters for them.  One final bit that I\u0027m going to investigate is allowing for standard rigid/animated landing leg setups to be included in the tanks (probably as one of the adapter/end-cap types); these legs, if included, would feature no suspension functions and would be driven to deployment by a standard animation  (WIP support for this kind of a setups is in place for the cargo-bay modules, can likely back-port it to be usable on the MFT modules -- which would also allow for MFT nosecones/adapters that had built in service bays and the like, and possibly other uses not yet considered).\n\nThe second line of lander parts will be designed for horizontal lander creation.  It will likely be a bit of a mashup between several existing reference designs, and my old SC-C design:  \n![0110b.jpg](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2014/01/0110b.jpg)![338b4ff1c5e6a61ae8551a312cddc1d2.jpg](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/33/8b/4f/338b4ff1c5e6a61ae8551a312cddc1d2.jpg)\n\n![Yqaupgv.png](http://i.imgur.com/Yqaupgv.png)![PZsLOYw.png](http://i.imgur.com/PZsLOYw.png)\n\nHorizontal lander, with either squashed octagonal or hexagonal main form factor.  Will include segments with built in legs and/or engines/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E, cargo bay segments, frame-bays, fuel segments, etc.  These parts will likely not include any form of scaling/MFT support, and will be less of a generically usable system.  Still a bit undecided on these -- would like for them to have a wider range of compatibility with other mods, but I\u0027m unaware of any other mods using similar form-factors for fuselage parts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-27T21:56:01Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2017 09:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"rasta013","CreatedById":140002,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-28T01:33:22Z","Content":"There are some wide bodies in B9 and some slightly less wide from OPT Spaceplanes.

KSPWheel is awesome btw, thanks allot.  I was wondering, would it allow a singlepart rover? I am still thinking about the fold-able Munar rover... Anyways, wrong tread.\n\nThe horizontal lander stuff will be quite challenging to mod I think. I personalty find the NASA design flawed, and it was meant to address challenge that we do not necessarily have in KSP.  Here is my analysis for whats worth. I had a hard time keeping it structured enough to be readable, sorry about my bad english.\n\nI believe the lifting aeroshell is the main reason behind NASA design. Mars lack of a real atmosphere kinda prevent semi ballistic decent, not without massive assisted breaking. Slower and controlled decent using lifting surface like the space shuttle do is desirable. Note that SpaceX opted for that too except that do not discard the aeroshell. But I just can\u0027t see how they will flip mid-flight something that huge, but that\u0027s for another tread... I think that a lifting aeroshell l would be desirable KSP as well. But not for the same reason, the extra mass of the structure and overall package does not justify the fuel saving as most KSP part can go trough Duna entry un-shielded, but there is Laythe... and Eve.\n\nNASA design seem suited to at least some horizontal flight capacity before and after aeroshell separation. So accurate landing should be quite easy. In KSP, it might be even more useful as it is kinda hard to land at a specific location. But to be realistic, the frame would have to be quite heavy to support all that horizontal charge. That\u0027s my main critic of NASA design, that and the fact it can only be single use and exclusively a lander. But in KSP it may or may not be a issue and may or may not be used that way.\n\nAnother point that undoubtedly influenced NASA is the necessity of unloading allot of equipment. Unloading stuff from a traditional rocket can\u0027t be done without some kind of tower. The horizontal frame make it easy, specially for rover. (BTW, SpaceX deceptively left that part out of their presentation) This feature translate really well in KSP. I imagine people might also use it to airlift rover and stuff when traveling long distance. Balancing mass will be quite hard with engines spread like that. There is TCA for that I guess but that\u0027s a external dependency. Oh, in NASA design, the horizontal frame is also serve as lunch pad for the ascent vehicle. Not as complicated in KSP, but for destination like Laythe or eve it might be something to think about. \n\nAbout the Ascent vehicle, I am highly doubtful that NASA would have reused landing engines as shown on these image. Not after being bombarded by rock during landing and exposed to environment for six month. In KSP its obviously not a problem. The thing to keep in mind is that player may or may not want to do that. And here I will point back at Laythe and Eve, the frame will need to be highly customizable to be able to carry large enough accent vehicle to these destination.\n\nDepending on the level of customization, I can see these horizontal lander used for anything from miniature probe to massive Eve lander.

I am still thinking about the fold-able Munar rover...\n\u003E \n\nYes, absolutely.  Was one of the base design goals for the system - to allow pre-rigged and welded multi-wheel setups.  If you can rig it and animate it, KSPWheels can put wheels on it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The horizontal lander stuff will be quite challenging to mod I think.\n\u003E \n\nOh, yeah.  Been down that road once already, and had something...mostly usable  (the old SC-C freighter parts).  The real challenges come in making it broadly compatible with other parts / form-factors.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I believe the lifting aeroshell is the main reason behind NASA design.\n\u003E \n\nYeah, I\u0027ve been thinking on that a bit as well.  Not quite sure how I would handle it, if at all.  As you say, they are not really needed for Duna in the stock system.  Could have some use for Eve/Laythe/Kerbin -- the problem is that stock occlusion code is not well suited to non cylindrical setups (there would be no simple way to shield the lander from the airstream properly with half of a fairing)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s my main critic of NASA design, that and the fact it can only be single use and exclusively a lander.\n\u003E \n\nWhy would it be used exclusively as a lander?  My old SC-C parts worked very well for orbital freighters -- just don\u0027t put landing legs or landing engines on it.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Another point that undoubtedly influenced NASA is the necessity of unloading allot of equipment.\n\u003E \n\nYep, this is the main reasoning behind the horizontal lander designs in KSP -- ease of loading/unloading equipment, rovers, base-modules, etc.  Pretty easy to drop things off if they are belly-slung; nearly impossible from a traditional rocket stack. \n\nBalancing -- tools exist in stock (and mods) to enable load-balancing on horizontal setups -- careful initial craft design combined with thrust limiting (either manual or mod-provided).  I\u0027ve done lots of horizontal lander designs for landing base components and rovers, many very off-balance, and have never needed anything beyond thrust-limiters and a bit of gimbal range (and/or reaction wheel authority).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E And here I will point back at Laythe and Eve, the frame will need to be highly customizable to be able to carry large enough accent vehicle to these destination.\n\u003E \n\nNothing says these would have to be used to carry ascent vehicles -- could just as easily be a disposable cargo lander, airdroping/eggdropping base components or rovers, or even used as some sort of rover themselves.  And nothing is going to be big enough to carry an Eve ascent vehicle, so I\u0027m not too worried about that.  Either way, a frame is just a frame -- what people choose to stuff in it is their own choice.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 13 hours ago, RedParadize said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If you have some doubt, I think a alternative design like the Mars Excurtion Module would be quite nice too and would blend well with the rest of SSTU.\n\u003E \n\nThose kind of designs (MEM) are already easily doable with existing parts (the SC-B-CMX or SC-C-CMX work very well as an ascent vehicle; I\u0027ll be using one in my career game in the very near future, will post pics when I get that far).

They are just not something that KSP can handle very well / at all, at least with any sort of accuracy or reliability.  Partially due to the aero model, and partially due to the \u0027collection of parts\u0027 model.\n\nThe problems are:\n\n1.)  Each individual part would need its own custom piece of the aero-shell -- e.g. so that engine-enabled parts have holes for the engines.  Possibly workable, but there would be only a single aero-shell configuration (size, length, whatever) available per part, limiting its general use.  Cannot be done procedurally due to the complexity needed to create procedural meshes (theoretically possible, but I\u0027m not going to do it).  \n\n2.)  There is no simple way to link all of those partial aero-shells from the various pieces together (without massive plugin-side-hacking, which would probably cause larger problems in the long run).  \n\n3.)  KSP does not support partial part occlusion -- either the entire part is shielded from the airstream, or none of it is.  So your aeroshell would shield the entire part, in which case engines/legs/etc would be unusable.  \n\n4.)  If the aeroshell was a separate part(s), there would be no way to configure it for the specific craft design (e.g. holes for engines).\n\nEven if 1 \u0026 2 were to be solved, #3 is still a huge problem that renders them mostly useless.  #3 wouldn\u0027t be a problem in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, but as I don\u0027t use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, that is of no help to me.  #4 only applies to aeroshells-as-separate-parts, but is the entirety of why they are not viable. \n\nEdit:  I\u0027m still going to give them a bit more thought to see if I can come up with a viable method to do both the modeling on them, and how to make them functional in KSP... but I wouldn\u0027t get your hopes up.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-01T20:47:38Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2017 08:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"RedParadize","CreatedById":129285,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-02T21:00:44Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)\n\nI got a idea that might interest you. kinda of a \u0022divide and conquer\u0022 type of solution.
