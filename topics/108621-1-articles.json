I was talking about the ingame ion engine which is overpowered yet still talking about real life solar sails at the same time. Well they both are bad for manned ships in real life unless someone perfects cryosleep. It is always possible to give the game an op solar sail that doesn\u0027t really take as much space and mass as it would in real life and create more thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
