To figure out the actual fuel flow, you can either load your rocket on the pad and fire it to look at the fuel flow, or you can use the equations you can find on the wiki to calculate it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-22T20:11:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt says it when you onep its detail with rightclick. Usually it says something in units (U) that is units per second. To get mass flow multiply by 5 (density). Also you get the same info when opening recources tab at the top of your screen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, power divided by Isp gives you mass per second... Ok maybe there is a factor 10 in there not sure atm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dooz","CreatedById":74263,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T10:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo to the editor mouse over the engine you would like to use You will see things Like thrust and look at ISP at sea level and\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISP in Vacuum now the higher the numbers The less fuel it burns.... ISP at sea level means how much fuel it will burn on the ground the Lower the numbers the more fuel it burns mostly Look at ISP in vac one more thing if your numbers are like ISP 200 in vac thats a Engine that burns alot of fuel if your in orbit if your numbers are like 400 800 1000 Those are engines that don\u0027t burn very much fuel i hope i didn\u0027t over complicate explaining ISP\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"numerobis","CreatedById":62016,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T13:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMass flow is thrust divided by exhaust velocity (exhaust velocity is Isp * g0 by definition, and g0 is about 9.8).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
