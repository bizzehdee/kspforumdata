I wrote it for my own personal use but would now like to release it for others to enjoy. I have never released anything before and so I have suddenly become aware of licensing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have looked around at the various license options and I will admit I don\u0027t fully understand it. I want people to be able to use it freely and do what ever they want to it/with it. The one thing I want to ensure is that if they redistribute this work, they do so under the same license I choose. As i understand it (please correct me if this is wrong) this will prevent someone altering the work and redistributing it under a much more restrictive license (which could be done with a MIT license i think?). I want this to be as available as possible across any version in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith this in mind I settled on the \u003Cspan\u003ECC-BY-SA-4.0 License (but I have no idea if this is a good choice).\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWhere It gets difficult is that the KoS script uses libraries from the KSLib collection. I took the lib_navball and simply removed the ones I didn\u0027t need (EDIT: and i have also added some comments to explain to potential users of my script how the functions in lib_navball work / why they are used).\u00A0 This is licensed under MIT. Am i right in thinking that as long as I distribute the file with its copyright info / license info then I am safe to redistribute it?
