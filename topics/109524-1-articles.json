Are you having trouble knowing where to re-enter to get to the runway or what? Best thing I can suggest is find a few youtube vids of people landing their spaceplanes. Make note of where they burn to re-enter etc. Keep in mind a plane will travel much further on re-entry than a capsule so you need to burn further west of the KSC than you would for a rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:49:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen working on my latest shuttle (rocket ascent, gliding landing) back in the 0.90.0 what I did was try to go for the runway, and if I didn\u0027t feel confident I just turned and took my time with a gentle field landing (to the west or south of KSC). Four or so of those behind my belt and I made a a successful orbit-to-runway landing. The next one was good too. So was the one after that. Then 1.0/1.02 came out and my first flight landed at the runway, first try. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what I\u0027m saying is: practice. Practice and airbrakes. One of my new favourite parts. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: If you want more technique, when I do a gliding landing I generally just choose a glide path after slowing down from re-entry. Turn on SAS, point nose at runway, make sure that prograde marker is slightly downwards (so I am gliding as opposed to stalling \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) and glide on in. As I approach, I use my roll and yaw controls to keep centred, adjusting so as to hit the runway straight on rather than at an angle. Then as you get close (depending on design) you either hit your airbrakes, drogues or flaps (or all three, you rebel) until you\u0027re under 70m/s and from there just try to let your wheels hit gently before you either run out of velocity and stall or out of runway and splash. Apply brakes and taxi over to the hangar for a photo op.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT AGAIN: If you overshoot KSC, just wait until your speed is sane and pull a 180 so you\u0027re heading back west and land that way. No biggie. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T16:59:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 04:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by moogoob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdding details and spelling.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T01:50:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou really need to elaborate on which part you have difficulty with: re-entry, approach, or landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry is composed of two parts: deorbit burn and shock layer. The location and strength of your burn is a characteristic of your ship. Until trajectories is updated for nuStock, you just need to determine it by experimentation. I recommend reckoning it by burning opposite of KSC at a fixed circular orbit and noting either where the orbital trajectory terminates or the height of pe. Once you hit the atmo, you need to manage your re-entry or you will burn up! Air brakes are a really simple solution, but they also reduce the cross range you get. Deployed control surfaces can keep you at a high AoA which give you lift and enough drag to slow you down while you coast up high. This will give you incredible cross range ability, but you will be slow to stop. Having both gives you more options.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get to 1 Km/s you should be free of incineration worries. If you planned re-entry correctly, you should be passing the mountains West of KSC at high mach around 16 Km high. If you are below/behind this, you will likely need jets. If you are ahead/above but have not passed KSC, you can either brake and dive (for maneuverable airframes) or go around, regardless you will be able to glide in. If you pass KSC you need to come around. You may be able to glide it, but you will likely need engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal approach is three things: line up to the runway, touchdown at the start of the runway, and stop before the end. I highly recommend planting a flag or other targetable marker right before the start of the runway (also at the end). With the ability to target the runway start, you can line up to the runway by targeting it and aligning the prograde and target markers on 90 degrees heading. Also you can control your descent by aligning the target and prograde markers on each other (make sure the nav ball stays in surface mode and does not switch to target mode!). If get alignment and descent properly done, your wheels should touch down in the first quarter of the runway. A well designed plane just needs to slam the brakes and keep it on the tarmac. Almost every plane I make only needs a quarter runway to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T01:55:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry gliding around until your velocity is below 80 m/s. That\u0027s usually the safe threshold. After that, come in steadily, and try to keep the prograde marker as parallel to the ground as possible. This will minimize your vertical velocity, and make for a soft landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nfpinto","CreatedById":143049,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T02:40:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you everyone, i could explain more about my problems but i guess you guys gave me a ton of information already.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
