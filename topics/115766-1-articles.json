(i.e. less than 10m/s low) Timewarping will cause it to stabilize, but once you drop out of time warp it\u0027ll start happening again. It is generally caused by some sort of physics instability such as part clipping (parts in service bays are especially notorious), but can also be caused by a lack of structural rigidity (add more struts) and occasionally for no good reason at all.\n\nWhen this instability happens, the amount of time remaining in the burn as well as your orbital path often become jumpy as well.\n\nI don\u0027t know of a good way of fixing it permanently, but since it only happens with very small velocities it\u0027s easy to ignore.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T06:10:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 06:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reddeyfish**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T06:13:55Z","Content":"It also happens with moderate burns a fair amount of time away, outside of timewarp."},{"CreatedByName":"pslytely psycho","CreatedById":62775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T06:16:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The screeching sound sounds like the stresses mod (don\u0027t have a link right now, on mobile) I\u0027m almost positive this isn\u0027t stock cause I\u0027ve never experienced it.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114618-0-90-ShipEffects-Sound-Mod-Dynamic-Sound-Effects-v0-2-6-Alarm-System-in-DEV](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/114618-0-90-ShipEffects-Sound-Mod-Dynamic-Sound-Effects-v0-2-6-Alarm-System-in-DEV)!\n\nHere is the link for the stress sound mod.

Its freaking annoying. \n\nAs for the mod, I was unaware I had a mod like that. It will be deleted ASAP.\n\n@ Kryxal\n\n@ Reddeyfish\n\nI think you two hit the nail on the head. If its rigidity it wants, then I\u0027ll start using struts. I tend to only use struts on my monsters! \n\nI think it may be time to use struts and redesign my creations, with emphasis on more, or less, RCS units.\n\n@ Everyone else.\n\nThanks for your help. I\u0027ll now look into it. I\u0027m guessing that the navigation side of it is caused by not enough struts, badly placed RCS units and maybe a badly designed rocket for starters.\n\nIts not really a problem I could ignore, because the rocket was going nowhere and burning up 90%\u002B of my RCS fuel trying to line up the burn.\n\nI\u0027ll report back ASAP.\n\nAgain, thanks everyone.\n\nEDIT: Just looked, I do not have the shipeffects mod installed. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nWill look for another culprit, especially since I was told its not stock in the game...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-13T06:30:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/13/2015 06:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by kiwi1960**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T11:06:05Z","Content":"I get the metallic screechy sound when I use many of the same engine in a single stage, I think something about how it handles multiples of the same sound causes it (my old Eve ascent vehicle with 19 aerospikes sounded like it was tearing itself apart).
