LV-Ns now seem to be not really worth the hassle of managing their heat. Let me start with the probe.\n\n![nUeiBp2.png](http://i.imgur.com/nUeiBp2.png)\n\nThe LV-N gives me 1752 m/s of dv. However, if I use a LV-45, I get 1687 m/s. That\u0027s only 65 m/s difference, roughly 4%\n\n![FSd7SIx.png](http://i.imgur.com/FSd7SIx.png)\n\nSo maybe LV-N\u0027s work better for larger vessels. Let\u0027s look at my Duna mission.\n\n![iOhT8vK.png](http://i.imgur.com/iOhT8vK.png)\n\nThe orange tank has been drained of oxidizer. The LV-N stage will give me 3300 m/s of dv. However, if I swap over to LV-30\u0027s and refill the oxidizer, I get 2905 m/s and a starting TWR of .54. With the 10k dv of the entire vessel, the 395 m/s difference is again a roughly 4% gain with the LV-N\u0027s.\n\nOnce I throw in the hassle of heat management, I\u0027m asking myself, \u0022Is the 4% gain I get with LV-N\u0027s worth the longer burn times and the heat management issues?\u0022 My provisional answer is, \u0022No.\u0022\n\nAre LV-N\u0027s worth the trouble? I\u0027d like to see what the community has to say. I used to use them for everything heading interplanetary, but now I\u0027m wondering if they\u0027re even worth unlocking. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOK, NathanKell has a good point. I need to be comparing equal fuel masses. Here is the apple-to-apple comparison. First, the craft using LV-30\u0027s and an orange tank:\n\n![xZxpF4t.png](http://i.imgur.com/xZxpF4t.png)\n\nVessel mass of 82.8 tons, dv of the relevant stage is 2905 m/s. Swapping out the 36 ton orange tank for a Mk. 3 liquid fuel fuselage plus 8 of the 1.25 liquid fuel tanks, and swapping the engines over to LV-N\u0027s gives me this:\n\n![s29ZmV3.png](http://i.imgur.com/s29ZmV3.png)\n\n(After posting I realized I needed fuel lines feeding the main tank)\n\nVessel mass is 84.6 tons, dv is now 4934, That\u0027s 2029 m/s difference, almost a 70% gain in dv compared to the LV-30\u0027s. That\u0027s more like it, right?\n\nSo, are LV-N\u0027s worth the hassle of heat management? The 70% increase in dv when doing an actual performance comparison makes me change my provisional \u0022No\u0022 to an emphatic \u0022Heck, yes!\u0022 ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThanks to everyone for their feedback!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-13T14:17:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2015 02:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ArmchairGravy**\n  \nRevised Test"},{"CreatedByName":"Valley","CreatedById":73883,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T02:02:27Z","Content":"I would love to know.
