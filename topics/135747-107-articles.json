I think they have got the approach targeting figured out pretty well, so there isn\u0027t a huge risk of the rocket crashing somewhere it shouldn\u0027t be. The failures have been on the dynamics of the ground contact, which are more complex on a moving platform than they will be on a proper landing pad. I\u0027m pretty confident that the chances of a successful\u00A0landing on terra firma are higher than on a barge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf they go with a landing at LC-1, I\u0027m quite optimistic that they will finally nail it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T00:18:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven this\u0027ll be the first landing attempt with the uprated Merlin-1Ds, I give it 50-50.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rakaydos","CreatedById":101988,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-03T00:34:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222305368\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449101931\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kryten\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 minutes ago, Kryten said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven this\u0027ll be the first landing attempt with the uprated Merlin-1Ds, I give it 50-50.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUprated?

Given they always said they expected to get them to that thrust level, it could just be an engine control software change. They\u0027ve also slightly increased tank size and sub-chilled the propellant for higher density to take full advantage of the higher thrust, and used it as an opportunity to make minor changes to most of the other systems.
