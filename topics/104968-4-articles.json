Nobody\u0027s ever flown an NTR on any sort of mission, they\u0027ve only been ground tested (and only the first generation of NTRs in the US were ever tested, the later, more advanced units were not even built and existed soley on paper).

Real life reaction wheels are about 20,000x weaker than the KSP version and have saturation issues (CMGs are about a thousand times stronger than a reaction wheel, but they have the same saturation issues and are still *20 times* weaker than KSP reaction wheels on a torque/mass basis. That\u0027s why I\u0027m always laughing when I see someone put a tower of the 2.5m wheels on something). Real life ion engines are 8,500x weaker (for next-generation designs that have not yet flown, it\u0027s about four times worse for ones that have flown) in an absolute sense. A real life ion has the equivalent thrust of holding up 0.5 to 2 sheets of heavy-duty laser printer \u003Cem\u003Epaper\u003C/em\u003E in Earth\u0027s gravity. Micronewtons, not KILOnetwons.

Each Bio will randomly generate how dense the ore is in any area. This coupled with a slider for how common the resource is can leave many places with low to no ore. The lower the ore concentration, the higher the effort is to pull it out, as the energy requirements to pull it out from a 1% spot or an 8% will not change, just the amount pulled. The equipment is also heavy and needs a very energy rich system to work off of in order to keep running. That means lots of batteries and solar panels as well. The overall amount of investment into using the ISRU is equal to or greater then actually sending up a fuel tanker, or bringing that amount of extra fuel with you to begin with. (obviously more complex missions will actually profit from this in the long run.) Not to mention very time consuming (though time warp and background processing removes the tedium.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving used Kethane, and Karbonite, I can honestly say that circumstances will be the greatest determining factor in whether you will even use the system, as it\u0027s not going to be the infinite fuel source people think that it is. You are infact trading several resources for a different set. Is it a simple system? Yes, but making it needlessly complex adds nothing to the experience, and would put off most players to that experience. However, if you like complexity, there are mods that can add that complexity to the system, including making the deposited limited in amount that can be harvested. (Again, something Roverdude has mentioned about the openess of the system.) Is the name ore a little confusing and silly? Yes. Though given some of the other options, ore seems like a general enough name that most people will recognize. I simply look at it as I do kethane or Karbonite, It\u0027s an unrefined fuel source that needs a process to make it usable, so names don\u0027t really mater. (And again, the resource is easily modifiable via a .cfg edit if you must have a different name.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly think it is as difficult to utilize as Karbonite, with fewer pieces (only a 2.5m converter.) yet simple to use. I don\u0027t think this could have been implement in any other way and be satisfying. I like that I have to set up a specific orbit to get information, but don\u0027t have to timewarp and not play just to discover the resources. I also like the concept that as you get more narrow fields of scanners, you get more accurate information. I look forward to adding it to my bases and give them a real reason to exist as anything more then contract fodder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temeter","CreatedById":58056,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-26T10:28:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Xavven\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Xavven\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf one were to accept that cheating is only defined by each player by his or her self, then the question, \u0022is this cheating?\u0022 is indeed not a valid one to begin with.\u003Cp\u003EThe fact that someone has asked \u0022is this cheating?\u0022 implies that there \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C/em\u003E an objective way to measure it, that there is a standard against which to measure it, and I argue that the standard is the official ruleset, which is defined by the game developer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, that pretty much sums up every \u0022cheating?\u0022 thread I\u0027ve ever seen on this forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, that is what I ment with sterile ruleset. The game mechanics clearly include ressources, so it\u0027s not a cheat by game rule definition. Strictly cheating would be a unlimited fuel hack, the ingame cheat menu, or an obvious exploit (most famously infiniglide).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is a kinda obvious and bland explanation, though, nothing really to discuss about. I assume OP is asking if ressource mining means \u0027cheating yourself\u0027, e.g. making the game less fun, degrading the learning experience, which means actually judging the game mechanics on a personal level. Which is actually an interesting idea, while cheating threads usually go into the completely wrong direction and argue about the nature of cheating (i\u0027m obviously not innocent).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs said, I don\u0027t see it as cheating. It takes effort, planning and specialized construction. Most notably, the incredibly eficient mothership/lander design won\u0027t really work with ISRU. Or you will need giant fuel depots/refineries capable of landing on low-grav worlds. Which is around as time consuming and slightly more complex than large refueling missions. There is already a way of getting \u0027unlimited fuel\u0027, during lategame you will have enough money to actually send lots of fuel ships around without any real limitation. And ISRU is, in my opinion, a much more fun way of refueling, aside from adding a completely new and versatile gameplay mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I think ressource mining will clearly add to the game.
