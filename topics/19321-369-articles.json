That seems like the best distinguishing charateristic to use, just from looking at lots of pictures of KSP planes. Wings are thin, other parts are thicker. Now actually *doing* that is a different matter, but I think I know a way of doing that too, depending on how your voxels are represented and what they know about each other. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the process I am imagining-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. If the voxels are stored as a graph, find the nearest voxel that is not adjacent and add it to a list if that distance is less than some amount. The idea is to find voxels that are separated by a thin volume. A bit of tuning would be needed to make this work, especially to find the right distance to look for nearby voxels- You could probably use the slope of the line relating voxels discovered nearby to distance searched. When the slope of that line changes very quickly, you have gone from finding flat, thin wing parts to thicker more sloped structural parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are done, each list would represent group of adjacent voxels, all forming a wing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis other way would work if you didnt have a graph and just coordinates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Seed\u0022 the interior area of the voxels with small points, and grow these in all directions that are not constrained by the voxel boundary.

Each voxel only searches until it finds one non-adjacent voxel, and then it stops, because that means it\u0027s on a wing. They all stop once they reach the distance limit, which is whatever the cutoff for max wing thickness ends up being. The voxels need to be in a graph, though, for it to run in log time. You end up with one big list of voxels that are separated by thin geometry, and that\u0027s it. You just pick one \u0027wing voxel\u0027 and follow all of its edges, checking if those voxels are also wing voxels. If it is, you remove it from the primary list and add it to a different one, which represents a single contiguous thin piece of geometry. Once all the remaining edges point to non-wing voxels, you are done with that wing. Repeat on the now-shorter unsorted list of wing voxels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts log time because the number of negative checks on the \u0022is the adjacent voxel part of this wing\u0022 scales based on the boundary of the surface area of the wing voxels, essentially a one dimensional feature. Because it follows the surface of the wing it is almost always a positive check, and then those get removed from the pool for the next go around. Very little re checking a voxel more than once. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be O(n^3) with respect to wing thickness, though, because that\u0027s a 3D volume search. (I think?) If the thickness is very low, it shouldnt be too bad. Because all the searches done are limited radius volume searches, I don\u0027t think anything will scale primarily with the number of total voxels. Know, if it was just a big unsorted list of coordinates, then yea, it would. But hey, that\u0027s why voxels are great!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for polyhedral wings, (or a tail fin sticking straight up out of a wing), you could calculate the angle of vector connecting the across-wing nearest voxel and the opposite wing plane. The opposite wing plane could be approximated from the directly adjacent voxels, and that angle could be used to determine polyhedral or a tail fin. Other wing parts could be split along a vertical plane following the axial symmetry line, too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, if its a 3D array and not a graph, then I am not sure how to use the first method. It really depends on each voxel outright knowing what\u0027s adjacent to it. That way one or two iterations through the list can just sort voxels based on their nearest neighbors into various lists, and then all those lists just magically turn into physically connected geometry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess if you made sure that the maximum wing thickness was less than half the separation between two voxels you could still do it, but you would have to make a pass though the 3D array to build a graph of adjacent voxels. That wouldn\u0027t be a cheap operation, but it still would only really scale hard with the max wing thickness. Otherwise each cheap \u0027voxel.getAdjacent()\u0027 would become a tiny area search, which I guess still wouldn\u0027t be too bad anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you have a little memory to spare, you can give each integer voxel added precision in the form of metadata. When you are building the voxel model, you can attach a few decimal places that represent the offset from the center of the voxel to the actual point on the geometry that you are measuring. All the advantages of integers with the precision of a float! Though you may already be doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I just thought of an even better way to do this, because voxels. You can collapse the step that sees if voxels are on a wing and the step that identifies single wings into one, and if you started with a way lower resolution sample (just to make sure you get atleast a single voxel on each wing) then you could probably make the the whole thing amortized O(log(n)) with respect to voxels. Well, with respect to voxels that arent on wings.

You\u0027re the one talking about how the Cl and Cd are wrong, though you take the long way about it and talk about stall angle and glide slopes instead, so I was hoping that you had actual data on real plane Cls and Cds to work with. Guess not. And yes, the engineers do know those for a plane, it\u0027s how we design them and figure out whether they can do what they need to do.\u003Cp\u003EAlright, so here\u0027s what we\u0027re gonna do to compare your vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ve got 50% more mass than the real thing. So that\u0027s gonna increase your stall speed right off the bat. Looking at just the main wing area (because FAR is slightly stupid and includes the area of tailplanes, even when it shouldn\u0027t), you\u0027ve got 32.7 m^2 to the real thing\u0027s 39 m^2. Alright, so overall, that means if the maximum lift coefficients are the same, you need to go 33% faster just to stay in the air. Now, given that FAR only assumes an airfoil shape for stall angle (the other properties are lost in the drag of the wing itself), and that it assumes a rather low maximum Cl of 1.6, while you can easily get Cls of 2 without flaps on well-designed airfoils, you\u0027re now looking at a 50% faster stall speed. And we\u0027re not even considering whether your comparison vehicle and the real thing have the same lift on the tails; if you\u0027ve got negative lift on the tail, that\u0027s just going to make things worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as for gliding. That might be a problem. Maybe it\u0027s just the difference between jets and propellers. Maybe there\u0027s actually something there. I don\u0027t know, but I do know that I\u0027m implementing the same methods used by engineers to design planes, and these are the numbers I\u0027m getting out, and all of them agree with the literature or are on the high side. And I know that the drag coefficients that I\u0027m getting for a lot of my replica planes are high.

As Mipe mentioned, I might be thrown off by the KSP ratio, where as there seemed to be a lot of wing for the plane, but the KSP parts are incomparably too heavy for them. I wasn\u0027t complaining for not getting enough lift at all, its quite the opposite, I\u0027m complaining is quite hard to get the plane to slow down instead... Now given, propeller planes suffer indeed from heavy drag when tuned down, but mostly sure all planes will almost immediately lose speed and altitude when powered off.
