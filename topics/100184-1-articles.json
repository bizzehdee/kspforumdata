This thread will showcase missions and info on those missions. More threads will be added for projects (Apollo is an example)\n\nThe main difference between the IKRAA and the KSA is the fact that this will be more game based than the KSA. (By this I mean that the KSA mimics NASA, this will be more of a \u0022player\u0027s journey\u0022)\n\nThis will be carrer however if a save breaking update comes out, I will switch to sandbox. (The only reson I\u0027m doing carrer is for mission ideas, and a foundation for this series)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-20T16:22:22Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2015 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MrWalrus123**"}]}
