This thread will showcase missions and info on those missions. More threads will be added for projects (Apollo is an example)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main difference between the IKRAA and the KSA is the fact that this will be more game based than the KSA. (By this I mean that the KSA mimics NASA, this will be more of a \u0022player\u0027s journey\u0022)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will be carrer however if a save breaking update comes out, I will switch to sandbox.
