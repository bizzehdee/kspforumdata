I don\u0027t really think is that much of a coding issue to circumvent.\n\nFlags should REALLY not count as an active flight nor should other future plant possibilities like beacons and such fun things.\n\n Speaking of flags... We Do need some Vanila function to find at least the space center from the map view maybe and adhoc indicator of the possible landing based on our trajectories and athmospheres and such\n\nI do not think modern shuttles have to blindly reenter the athmosphere also they must have some kind of \u0022automation\u0022 or a precise indicator for the parts of the whole flight.\n\nOr is it reality that pilots counting on the fly the necessary math to make a rendezvous? or even to make an orbit?\n\nSo a Mechjeb like feature should be stock... (If you don\u0027t like the idea of an autopilot then not use it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ) But I think that mod is really one of the most commonly used one.\n\nSuggestions?"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T03:37:37Z","Content":"The problem with MJ in stock is that if you just started playing you will use it and never go back and the point of the game is Spaceflight not just building a rocket and not flying it (It removes the controlling part of the game)"},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T10:31:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The problem with MJ in stock is that if you just started playing you will use it and never go back and the point of the game is Spaceflight not just building a rocket and not flying it (It removes the controlling part of the game)\n\nHello.\n\nI just started a new game and it blends in seamlesly. It is integrated into the techtree so at the beginning I had to fly my rockets. And now at the later stage of the game I have the option to let the AI point my rocket to where they should be facing.\n\nIn this way it seems to me real life like. \n\nI don\u0027t suggested to vaniliarize it completely (or maybe ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)), but if you would fly in an aircraft or a spaceplane or even a rocket you\u0027d have more indicator unlike the amount of the stock KSP allows you to see.\n\nAt least these should be stock for example:\n\ndeltaV capability per vessel/per stage, \n\nTWR (on stages at least relative to the planet of the rocket building process), \n\nI do really like the remaining time and remaining deltaV MJ offers,\n\n some kind of a koordinates (GPS is fine with the appropriate presentation inside IVA, or in flight screen (Like waypoint manager))\n\nheading, pitch, roll relative to the surface in precise numbers (and/Or digital HUD style like flight indicator) as well as real altitude relative to the above terrain height (not just sea level). \n\nI do like the idea of the autopilot though (especially the rendezvous and docking because of the lack of docking port alignment indication), but if only the (execute next maneuver node) and the \u0022rendezvous/maneuver planner\u0022 would be in the stock that would be nice (even rookies kinda like it I think)\n\nI learned to fly from looking at MechJeb and Scott Manley ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAs for the autopilot If you don\u0027t like it don\u0027t use it. But if left out completely, then nobody can use it.\n\nMaybe they can be limited to special parts. Planes withouth propper hardware and software won\u0027t allow you to switch to a Robot-pilot. (just like in real life)\n\nSpeaking about autopilots: \n\nThere should be in a stock game something which is \u0022automaticaly\u0022 holds the current heading or altitude by choice. \n\nAS in landing a perfect 5star pilot with a retrogade hold can flip the ship around after it touched down so a successfull landing can be a catastrophe.\n\nEven with SAS on crafts cannot hold a given altitude by itself even VTOLs. Cannot go that precise with the thrust control manually (even with precise controls on)\n\nAnd my first big problem was as a totally newb: WHERE THE HELL IS KSP? Where Should I try to land back from my orbit???\n\nSeriously those waypoints (KSP pad, KSP runway, Island Runway, Old KSP base) should be selectable as target in the stock game by default.\n\nI cannot see it even from map view so I couldn\u0027t made a half-blind style guestimated landing on my first week till I learned to map view as fast as craft on the pad and memorize it\u0027s place. And plant flags around my base in order to find it from orbit ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T11:04:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hello.\n\u003E Snip...\n\nMost of that information is probably planned for 1.0. I know the Delta-V in-VAB option is in. Kerbal Engineer already has the information, without the Mechjeb autopilot. (And there are plenty of streamers on KSPTV that you can watch to get very good tips on how to orbital mechanics too.)\n\nI would *NEVER* recommend someone use mechjeb autopilot-to-anywhere to just learn the game; this game is about making mistakes, and fixing them. It just wouldn\u0027t be Kerbal, without explosions. Using a magic autopilot just removes the entire point of the game, and turns it into \u0022rocket legos\u0022.\n\nReintroduce the \u0022avionics package\u0022 part, with \u0022Hold Heading\u0022 feature.\n\n\u0022Avionics Package also contains a \u0022VTOL Engine\u0022 action group, which would automatically thrust limit to keep vertical speed == 0m/sec; but only when \u0022hold altitude\u0022 is enabled via the heading/aim prograde/etc... widgets.\n\nAdding target-able waypoints to KSC sounds like a reasonable idea, it would also be nice if your trajectory would also account for current AoA, and atmospheric drag. Because planning your orbit with maneuver nodes would be amazing, even in-atmosphere.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T11:09:10Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 11:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KrazyKrl**"},{"CreatedByName":"Ricardo79","CreatedById":128863,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T14:41:37Z","Content":"Thank you.\n\nI found the \u0022help section\u0022 early on youtube: Scott is a good teacher ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nAnd I am glad to hear something (which can add so many value to this fine piece of game) has a chance to get integrated. (I mean the much more indicator)\n\nI know the engineer plugin. But honestly I do not like this modding stuff that much. Memory/incompatibility problems. \n\nI guess it has nothing to do with the modders as they did their wonderfull magic. But individuals never can achive something as flawlessly integrated as a team can do.\n\nThe more the better. That way everybody can use only that he/she likes.\n\nI admit what you say about the learning is the fun way. Agreed on no explosions no KSP. \n\nBut later on some kind of boring it could be to do a daily job to ascend / maneuver node hunting and such. \n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong. I do set up my maneuver nodes by hand, position it accordingly and such, but let a professional AI to precisely do what I said to it. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nI docking 99% the times with my own hand. But that extra 1% when I do not want to, I\u0027ve got the tool for automate it.\n\nAnd the most usefull feature in there: the landing guide. (I use it mostly only for pont me to KSP pad Or to the \u0022Right Spot\u0022 on another planet/moon) After the targeting I usualy do my landings usual trial and error. Just because it is fun.\n\nOR: After I watched enought times how the AI do the rendezvous, I find the rendezvous planner usefull as a \u0022checklist\u0022 of what to do.\n\nI found it very usefull. And my kids got their explosions as well as I wanted to try everything with my hand too. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nSo we can agree then we can\u0027t agreed on this one ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThank you for pointing me to the avionics package I\u0027ll search and destroy (I mean make it explode my VTOLs) at once. I wasn\u0027t aware of that yet.\n\nEdit:\n\n --------------\n\nI do downloaded but never installed it. Silly me. Thanks (You see this is a problem with the mods ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) They aren\u0027t inside the core ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n--------------\n\nAgreed on the last one perfectly. I missed that part about acounting the atmosphere into it I thought it trivial option. So thanks to you for highlighting it. So \u002B1 on that one too.\n\nOhhh I just see this is in a wrong thread...\n\nThis one is about flags to remove from the \u0022flights in progress\u0022 count.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-24T14:45:18Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2015 02:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ricardo79**"}]}
