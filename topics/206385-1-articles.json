I\u0027m wondering how I can make it so that whenever a craft would save the location of it\u0027s parts, as in breaking ground, it does something else instead before saving. I\u0027m hoping to try and counter robotics drift by just turning off gravity and physics so that the parts destress before saving, but I\u0027m not sure how to do this and I can\u0027t figure it out with the documentation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leonardfactory","CreatedById":206655,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-17T02:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure about your use-case, however given your description I can think of\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/class_game_events.html#a0b33d65211d07c100dc51512ac253829\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGameEvents.onPartPack\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0or\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/api/class_game_events.html#a3cf675ae616c541ce70b8696c5e16fa8\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGameEvents.onVesselGoOnRails\u003C/a\u003E.
