I feel more changes to SAS as a whole are needed. As currently the control part panel is pretty thin, and all of them more or less do the exact same thing. Tweakbles and more parts for different functions should help players assume better control over designs of control ;P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance SAS modules that work better in atmosphere, with stronger pulls for spaceplane designs.
