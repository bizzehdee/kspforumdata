From bizarre looking planes to actual trucks that drive. My one question is, why can\u0027t we share our creations within the community? Maybe we can and I just missed something but I don\u0027t see why Squad can\u0027t add this to \u003Cstrong\u003Ean update\u00A0later on to KSP\u003C/strong\u003E on Ps4. This would allow everyone to use eachother\u0027s creations. I don\u0027t see the harm in that. Hopefully I can hear back from someone at Squad soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-29T20:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-29T20:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not on PC either, at least in the game itself. We have KerbalX which allows to share .craft files, but that\u0027s the work of a modder (Katateochi) , not Squad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing able to share crafts in the game seems like a basic thing to do in the game overall, even on PC where you can download separate files. Why this (and a lot of equally basic stuff) isn\u0027t on console is beyond my logic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, since Squad changed the company with whom they work on the console ports for 1.2, they maybe will make things better. Even though it\u0027s not on \u003Cs\u003Eany known roadmap\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0wait, there is no\u00A0roadmap at all;\u00A0so not ever mentioned by the devs AFAIK.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-29T20:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not in the current console version because the porting company did the bare minimum of work necessary. Suggesting it for addition is a nice idea though. On the other hand, consider that any such craft sharing system would require both a server infrastructure and also moderation. If craft sharing is a one-click in-game process then people \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u003C/em\u003E upload genitalia, swastikas, and other such things that really neither Sony nor Squad would want to ignore. Now that can be addressed but it means it\u0027s more involved than just adding a game feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeKerbalGuy","CreatedById":174340,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-30T11:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe Squad would have to work a little more with Sony, which I hope they do so they can add this to the game or at least have a forum to download these crafts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
