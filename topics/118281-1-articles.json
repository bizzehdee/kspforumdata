I downloaded everything, it installed just fine but when I start the game up it A, loads very slowly ( I know it added allot of data but still...) And B, it crashes the moment the game actually starts. It stated that two mods where incompatible with 1.0.4 so I deleted them. They where aaa\\_Toolbar and VenStockRevamp. So I restarted the game again and it seemed to work fine this time, then I want to go to the VAB and the game crashes again.... There are no conflicting Mods left... I\u0027m kinda lost right now ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T14:22:02Z","Content":"Install just the ***Dependencies*** mods and then start adding mods from the ***Recommendations*** and then **Suggestions..** sections, one by one, or in groups, until something goes wrong.\n\nIf you\u0027ve installed all, I\u0027d say you\u0027re running out of memory.... the mods eat memory, and KSP doesn\u0027t manage memory that well.... so you have to monitor your memory usage.\n\nGet a proggy called Process Explorer, which gives a fairly detailed usage of all things on your pc."}]}
