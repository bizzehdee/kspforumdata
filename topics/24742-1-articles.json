I\u0027m the author of the Atomic Rockets website.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI deeply apologize for taking so long to award Kerbal Space Program with the Atomic Rockets Seal of Approval. I had looked at the program a long time ago, but back then my computer was so antiquated that it really could not run the program. Just recently I got a better computer and I tried KSP again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am totally dumbfounded at the elegance of KSP. It is the most astonishing educational astronautical software I have ever seen. Players get an intuitive feel for many rocketry concepts and constraints. Plus the addictive nature of the game keep players coming back for more. Much better at teaching than, say, Orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still a rank beginner at playing the game, but that will change.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyotor Gagarin","CreatedById":36567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T05:57:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t believe I\u0027m the first person who gets to reply!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a longtime fan of your site, and I\u0027m so happy to see that you like KSP as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal space program has regular middle-school kids throwing around terms like \u0022Delta-V\u0022, and \u0022Oberth Effect\u0022 for the first time, and one can only hope that it sparks some careers in aerospace, (and maybe science fiction too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll take this opportunity to say thanks for building and maintaining the Atomic Rockets site.
