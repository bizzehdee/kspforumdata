Not yet requesting \u0022support\u0022, trying to figure out what I did wrong, first.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s what\u0027s been happening: I build a massive ship to go to Duna. Sandbox mode. Assembled it in orbit. Finally bring the crew. Docking doesn\u0027t go as desired, so I load the save I made on approach.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I saved the game, the engine on my little crew transporter was shutdown.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut when the save loads, bam, it also fires the engine - and won\u0027t accept any input to shut it down until it\u0027s done with all the loading thingies. While the craft is already accelerating.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd that is not all. Eventually, I build a simpler, huge craft. Just want to get going, no 2nd round of assembly, plop into orbit with hyperedit. When I leave it there, it\u0027s just sitting there. Pointed to normal, engines never activated in the first place.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen I launch my lander craft, which I DO want to dock in, I wiggle through the transfer orbits and, finally, on closest approach ... my massive ship just zips by, engines blazing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI go to tracking station, switch vessels and shut down engines. Lucky me, the engines were blazing on no throttle. But still, this is too similar to be related.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome setting I messed up? Some way I never found to lock an engine so this won\u0027t happen?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEDIT: Just tried it with switching vessels from the orbital view. Here, too, my big ship\u0027s engines (Emancipator nuclear engines) ignite while the little green messages are zipping up at the top of the screen. Switching back to the lander craft currently in a lower orbit, I was already hammering my \u0022kill switch\u0022 (key assigned to shutdown all my engines through AGX action groups), so the engines didn\u0027t fire there.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTried switching vessels back and forth once again, without touching the kill switch. This time, no undesired ignitions to be observed. I think it may be something when the craft is first loaded during a flight?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-01-27T06:16:34Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2017 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by DerGolgo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFurther observations\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benoit Hage","CreatedById":104585,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-27T17:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe need to know at least what mod you are using.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoctorDavinci","CreatedById":150019,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-27T20:31:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo to your settings at game startup and move the slider for default thrust on load to 0 (I think that is what it is called ... look and you\u0027ll see what I\u0027m talking about)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope this helps\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
