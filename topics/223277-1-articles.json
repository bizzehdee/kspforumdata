And I mean everywhere, even when I am in \u0022Map\u0022 view to plan my maneuvers.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have two space stations orbiting Kerbal (one for staying there and the other is on construction for deeper space) and one probe around the Mun. Can those cause those lags? I honestly cant imagine that because when we follow the missions, we will have plenty of probes orbiting different planets and moons.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am really frustrated with this so I hope you can help me with this issue. I also have the game on a SSD (Samsung 980 pro 2TB)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-26T21:02:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat CPU has integrated graphics so make sure you are actually running the game using the GPU.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the NVIDIA control panel you can tell it to always use the GPU for every application. \u00A0See if that helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KirTyun","CreatedById":232415,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-27T09:31:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224362201\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223277\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221706302944\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022184845\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MechBFP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, MechBFP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat CPU has integrated graphics so make sure you are actually running the game using the GPU.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the NVIDIA control panel you can tell it to always use the GPU for every application. \u00A0See if that helps.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBro... you singlehandedly solved the problem I had over months... especially in Cities Skylines 2 I had big issues with FPS. Sure the game itself is causing the issue,\u00A0 as I have read, but I always felt like my PC is so strong... it still should be able to get at least 40 FPS in it. Now after I did what you suggested, it fixxed the issue. Thank you! Kinda weird tho that I have to go into the NVIDIA Settings to change that.

Ya it really is a head scratcher why it does that. That setting is there so it can uses the integrated GPU on applications that don\u2019t need much rendering power, like Stardew Valley or what have you, as it conserves some power. However as you have seen it regularly picks the wrong one for applications that definitely need the GPU, so it is better to just always use the GPU for all applications and avoid the issue.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-27T18:51:28Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2024 06:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 27\u0022\u003EJanuary 27\u003C/time\u003E by MechBFP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
