Glad you enjoyed it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the nose pitch - As I\u0027ve mentioned before, it\u0027s almost entirely under load. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe worst pitching occurs if you have only a single docking clamp attachment point at the center of the truss. This is also much more pronounced on Kerbin itself and planets/moons with comparable gravity. On the Mun, it\u0027s VERY manageable. I can pick up a DEMV Rat on a center docking port and move it around by using \u0022KEEP VERT\u0022 and having both VTOL and Rear engines going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens on heavier gravity worlds is that you need more thrust on the VTOLs to keep you in the air, and the rear engines naturally are not on a separate throttle, so they\u0027ll fire at the same power setting. The angle that you have the engines is perfect for no-load. But with a non-braced load, something starts cascading very quickly. I think because the load is shifting and the VTOL is overcompensating, thus the rear engines also over-fire, causing more pitch, and the VTOL to fire more, and the rear engines to fire harder, etc, etc, in a cascade that will flip you over if you don\u0027t stop it by turning off the rear engines. On light gravity worlds like the Mun, the wobbliness is still there, but the VTOL thrust isn\u0027t high enough to start the cascade. You can STILL go way out of balance and crash if YOU pitch the nose over yourself by too much - see Part 10 of my Eagles twitch broadcast at the end for a prime example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a braced load, the pitch is much more manageable. I can carry a DEMV Rat to the Mun by docking it in the SPH and bracing it. You still don\u0027t want to let MechJeb auto-pilot to orbit. Because there\u0027s still a cascade effect that will confuse it terribly and nose dive you out of control. But a manual lift to orbit with both VTOL and Rear engines running is very do-able. An upward pitch of 20-30% with a heading of 90 degrees and just under 2/3 throttle is a good way to get up to 70,000\u002B Meters out of the atmosphere. Once there, you can flatten the pitch, throttle down, and if you like, you can use KEEP VERT with both engine sets going and it will - very slowly, but reliably - keep you at AP and circular-ize your orbit. This is safe enough you can walk away from the computer while it does this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou probably noticed that I was having some pitch issues in that vid. But it was manageable and mostly my own doing. That pod I was using is a very light load. No fuel. It\u0027s just hull segments from the LLL pack. And it\u0027s braced solidly at the front and back. Notice that the cascade almost always starts when I\u0027m not perfectly in a flat pitch and I\u0027m angled forward slightly. I think the cascade effect would happen even on a no-load Eagle if you pitched forward just a few degrees while you\u0027re in KEEP VERT mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - except at the very end, I was always in Kill Rotation mode instead of SURF. If I was in Surf mode and pitched forward slightly, the SURF would likely pull the Eagle back under control as long as I didn\u0027t over-do it. But because I needed the maneuverability in the river valley, I couldn\u0027t do that. Even the slightest pitch forward will start the cascade and KILL ROT will NOT stop it. So that\u0027s why I often gave just short bursts on the main engines just to back off just a few seconds later. But notice that on the long stretches when I have a moment to set up a flat pitch and then fire them, I could let it boost indefinitely. (enough that I could do that major camera pullback at the end to show the entire river canyon and feel safe I wouldn\u0027t crash when I\u0027m \u0022off-camera\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Devo","CreatedById":22750,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T03:26:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still amazed at the way you use mechjeb...

No, im not stupid, nor crazy - but it did take a long time to even comprehend building something that big in the game and have it stay together without breaking up. It is hard to visualise the scale of the Valley Forge, as it will be the largest ship in KSP and most likely frought with problems as we construct it. We are talking over 1 kilometer long (thats in kerbal scale.. the craft it much bigger)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo give you an idea, the biggest ship in KSP right now is the venture star, which is 250m, and it has serious trouble staying together, so basically the challenge is delivering all the parts to orbit and then constructing the mammoth vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be honest, The Valley Forge makes the sulaco look like a tiny kids toy.
