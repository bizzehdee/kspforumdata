This should fix that issue and let they grab the wing instead, and pull themselves atop said wing.\n\nNow im tempted to try to scale the VAB building with just a kerbal alone, does this \u0022clamber\u0022 feature work on vertical walls? If not i recommend you model either suction/magnetic boots or give them grappling hooks ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T16:04:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Most of the memory leaks that have plagued the game for years fixed ?\n\nQuite possibly. Maxmaps said during a SquadCast that they had fixed 8-12 memory leaks, including every one that he was aware of.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E - Actual memory management ?\n\u003E - Actual asset management ?\n\nIt sounds like the DDS texture patch went into 1.0, which is going to drastically reduce the amount of memory that KSP uses. With both of these being the case, the only major things that they could really add to improve either the memory or asset management would be detection of OOM issues and dynamic loading of assets. Dynamic assets when your assets loader might have memory leaks could potentially be worse than loading everything once. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E This can end up as a train-wreck and it would be a damn shame.\n\nIt could. It could also end up just fine. Between the memory leak fixes and switch to DDS textures, 1.0 sounds like it\u0027s going to be stable enough.

The PhysX stuff isn\u0027t backwards compatible, but a lot of the other stuff is. In fact, almost every dev blog I\u0027ve seen where a developer said that porting to Unity 5 was easy was for a game that didn\u0027t use PhysX rigid body physics, and the few where developers said that they were having problems with the ports were using that.\n\nExpecting a Unity 5 port to be included as a feature in a version of the game that was well under way in development before Unity 5 was released is less than realistic, but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if we get a 1.1 version in a few months that does include Unity 5, and I wouldn\u0027t be at all disappointed, maybe even happier, if that patch included nothing but the Unity port. \n\nMaxMaps said that evaluating Unity 5 and porting to it if reasonable had a high priority to him (I don\u0027t think he was speaking for all of Squad with that line), so in all likelyhood we will see a Unity 5 port in the future."},{"CreatedByName":"rcp27","CreatedById":129752,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T21:30:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E How can you call it a hype when half the game is changed without a 0.99 pre-launch bug fixing release is still mind boggling...\n\nIt was announced that the final round of beta testing has been running since 3rd April.
