This led to the formation of Build and Shoot, a community discussing the pre-Jagex game. As you know, Jagex\u0027s Ace of Spades was very poorly received, and most of the community stopped playing Ace of Spades altogether.\n\nIt\u0027s been a few years now, and my estimate is that by late 2016 the Ace of Spades community will have completely dissolved. I feel as if I have the chance to change it all, one person to drive the outcome of Ace of Spades away from oblivion.\n\nI am trying to develop a [WebGL client](http://buildandshoot.com/viewtopic.php?f=5\u0026t=13038) for Ace of Spades, the 0.75 version, for various reasons which I will not cover here because it feels like I am advertising.\n\nHowever, I\u0027d also like to assess the effectiveness of my project before I even pass the halfway mark: *how many of you would be interested in such a thing?* My rationale is that unlike the other clients, it would not require any installation at all, and it would run well on most machines without OS-related problems. It could also make it into Google\u0027s PageRank. Thus it should give the AoS community a big boost, and also for the enjoyment of many more players behind firewalls and such.\n\nPlease tell me your thoughts on my endeavor. I don\u0027t want to make this sound like advertising; I just want to tell you KSPers about a project I\u0027ve been working on. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:16:07Z","Content":"I used to play the official 0.75. Then suddenly the site disappeared, and we were presented the current ace of spades (to be honest the new ace of spades is terrible, the old one was MUCH better). I now play BnS every once in a while.\n\nThat was a great game ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif). I used to have the shovel and smg noises stuck in my head at night.\n\nBut idk, it would be nice to have a WebGL client, although I use the OpenSpades client (inbuilt server browser AND better graphics? Instadownload.)"}]}
