This led to the formation of Build and Shoot, a community discussing the pre-Jagex game. As you know, Jagex\u0027s Ace of Spades was very poorly received, and most of the community stopped playing Ace of Spades altogether.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been a few years now, and my estimate is that by late 2016 the Ace of Spades community will have completely dissolved. I feel as if I have the chance to change it all, one person to drive the outcome of Ace of Spades away from oblivion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am trying to develop a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://buildandshoot.com/viewtopic.php?f=5\u0026amp;t=13038\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWebGL client\u003C/a\u003E for Ace of Spades, the 0.75 version, for various reasons which I will not cover here because it feels like I am advertising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027d also like to assess the effectiveness of my project before I even pass the halfway mark: \u003Cem\u003Ehow many of you would be interested in such a thing?\u003C/em\u003E My rationale is that unlike the other clients, it would not require any installation at all, and it would run well on most machines without OS-related problems. It could also make it into Google\u0027s PageRank. Thus it should give the AoS community a big boost, and also for the enjoyment of many more players behind firewalls and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease tell me your thoughts on my endeavor. I don\u0027t want to make this sound like advertising; I just want to tell you KSPers about a project I\u0027ve been working on. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"windows_x_seven","CreatedById":112926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T01:16:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to play the official 0.75.
