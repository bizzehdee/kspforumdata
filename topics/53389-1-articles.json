But then I went there and decided that the proper spelling is \u0022P.O.L.\u0022 or \u0022POL\u0022 because it\u0027s obviously an acronym.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe question thus becomes, \u0022What do the letters stand for?\u0022 I have several theories:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I got into orbit and saw it up close for the first time, I was struck by its hideous shape and nauseating color. Hence, I figured POL must stand for either \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPositively Overly Lumpy\u003C/span\u003E or \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPuked-Out Lunch\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I started my descent. Eventually, the ground scatter kicked in. Up until this point, I\u0027d had faith in my rather new, rather top-end computer and had all the graphics settings on full. But on Pol, there\u0027s a superabundance of scatter objects. In fact, at 100% scatter, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a square inch of actual dirt visible there, just a solid carpet of these things that look like gumdrops you sucked on until they were half gone, decided after all you didn\u0027t like the flavor, and spit them out. Them and their countless overlapping shadows. So a new meaning for POL immediately suggested itself: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPain Over Lag\u003C/span\u003E. Nothing for it but to back out of the game and reduce scatter to 50% and also cut way back on shadows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat done, I picked up where I\u0027d left off and continued my descent. All was going well until I was only about 1500m up. Then there was a muffled boom, a cloud of Kerbaldust appeared around my ship (even though it was a probe), and the controls went dead. Huh? I hit F3 and saw that I\u0027d \u0022crashed into Pol\u0022 despite my ship being 1500m up and still descending. Only dead. And it continued on down to the visible surface, where it smashed to pieces, despite supposedly having crashed long before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s why they made F5/F9, so I picked a different spot and tried again. And this time I reached the visible ground without encountering invisible ground higher up, somewhat to my surprise. So that suggested yet another meaning: \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPray On Landing\u003C/span\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, those are my theories on the meaning of POL. Anybody got better ones?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panfish5","CreatedById":74937,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T05:06:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPol looks like a giant pollen grain according to kerbal astronomers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Destroyer","CreatedById":36109,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-17T05:15:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne user on the IRC chat or live-stream, IIRC said it loked like a grain of pollen.
