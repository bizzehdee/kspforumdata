How do you play?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Well it\\\u0027s Pretty Simple. You manage this space program on the alien world called Earth. And you design rockets, go to varios planets and moons.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Why are their Mun\\\u0027s spelled with two O\\\u0027s?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Because their really weird.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027can I play\u0027 said Bob with a bit of a hopeful tone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027sure\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb handed Bob the keyboard and mouse and Bob started playing.

We\\\u0027re getting close to the surface.\u0027 said bill, sounding Really worried.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Fine.\u0027 said Bob as he Started to maneuver the Ship into a low orbit. \u0027There, now we cant crash.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Several more hours passed and it Which was mostly Floating around a Command pod Listening to Bob crash ships in Human Space Program. When the Radio broke the silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027This is Kerbin, have you landed yet?\u0027 Said the voice on the radio.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027That is a Negative. We are receiving so Weird Readings from the onboard Muon Detectors.\u0027 Said Jeb. Lying to hide the fact that he had been Playing a game. \u0027Probably Just some minor interference. So We should be Landing soon.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Okay. But that lander is worth more than all three of your combined salaries.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Roger that. Over and Out.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He went Back to playing HSP with Bob, When Bob accidentally Bumped the Throttle just enough to lower their orbit. Bob Just turned the Throttle off and went back to playing. Then a little while Later Bill spoke up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Hey. out Altitude is really low, wait. according to the orbital computer, Were gonna crash. Bob!

Bill showed him the Data. \u0027Oh Shoot!\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E He started the Burn, But it was Too Late. They were going too fast. They Crashed on the Muner Surface. The next morning Bob awoke in his bed at the Space center and went to the cafeteria to get some Breakfast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027Morning.\u0027 Jeb said. \u0027So i just got De-briefed on our mission status About our last mission this morning and i have bad news and worse news. The Bad news is that Because we were distracted from completing a proper Mun landing. We are gonna have to pay for the rocket we destroyed on the mun.\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027What could be worse than that?\u0027 Bob asked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027The command Module was destroyed in the crash so the computer was lost. so all our progress on Human Space program was lost\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u0027 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u0027 Exclaimed Bob \u0027All My Ships!!!!!
