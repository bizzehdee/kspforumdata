There is a know problem with part highlighting when CLS and ship manifest are used together. PapaJoe has had a look at it, but no fix yet, and I have also poked about but not got to the bottom of it yet. It is not a bug anymore with CLS or SM, but obviously something about the way they interact. Hopefully one of us will get to the bottom of it soon.
