This can be tricky in stock at times, especially if your vehicle has too many lift surfaces, as there\u0027s a bug in stock KSP aerodynamics that causes lift to constantly generate force on a craft while in-atmosphere (usually referred to as the \u0022infiniglide\u0022 bug since you can exploit it with enough control surfaces and fly with no engines at all by flapping them). It does help to land somewhere flat. Also, during the final sequence, don\u0027t just hold down the brakes; pulse them and stop if your craft starts to tilt. If your craft seems very prone to tilting, your landing gear probably needs a re-balance. The gear should be at least 50% of your total wingspan away from the center of your craft for any paired landing gear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Also, there\u0027s a few tricks to designing a plane that aren\u0027t readily apparent from your typical tutorial, but that will affect your landings more than your take-offs. One of them is controlling your fuel flow so that the craft\u0027s center of balance remains the same throughout. If you just build your typical cockpit-fuel-engine model of plane, it will have a center of mass pushed either far forward or far back by the end of your flight depending on which end is heavier, causing your plane to naturally want to tilt up or down (which depends on the way it\u0027s been pushed). This makes landing difficult, to say the least. You probably won\u0027t run into it with a test flight, but you definitely will on a full-scale one that ends with your fuel levels meaningfully drained.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T15:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figured, that with stock KSP the biggest issue (for me) is vertical speed. So, what I usually do is to give some thrust while landing, what increases horizontal velocity, and with it lift, in order to keep the vertical velocity below 5 m/s.
