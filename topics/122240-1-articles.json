Once you have nukes, you can use nukes to design landers that will land on Minmus (and on the Mun as well, but that takes a bit more practice).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith such a ship designed (and hopefully one that can land back at Kerbin for recovery), you pack your low xp kerbals and take them in a training trip (would it be like a graduation trip for kerbals fresh from Kerbonaut Academy?): reach LKO, land at the Mun, take off, land at Minmus, peek just outside Kerbin\u0027 SOI, return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can pick rescue contracts along the way as well. And while nukes allow you to make a ship with enough delta-v to do all this (returning from outside Kerbin SOI will eat quite a bit of fuel), it doesn\u0027t hurt to land by an ore refinery to refuel at one of your stops. You can combine this with tourists, stations and bases contracts to turn in a profit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re done, your starting kerbals will be at level 3. As for any rescued kerbal, it depends on the stage of the journey you\u0027ve picked them up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, once you nearly completed the tech tree, you will have unlocked the MK3 to 3.75 m adapter. Since it has a 50 m/s crash tolerance, you can use it as landing legs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Srpadget","CreatedById":111267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-06T00:51:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople have explained WHERE to get XP to make more-skilled kerbals.

Ignore the first one, the Stayputnik; it\u0027s pretty much useless for your purposes. You want the 2nd probe core in that path, the Okto. That probe core has the ability to use SAS to keep your rocket\u0027s nose pointed in a specific direction, exactly the way a beginning pilot can. Put one of those on the top of your rocket, above the command pod, and you can fly a rocket with Bill or Bob exactly the same way as with Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, when you get the Hitchhiker module, you can put up to 4 passengers in that. It cannot control a rocket, so you also need either an Okto-or-better probe core, or a command pod with a pilot. (Also, if you have batteries, solar panels, and a docking port on it, a Hitchhiker-plus-command-pod meets the game\u0027s definition of a \u0022space station\u0022, and contracts will pay you piles of money to launch it.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
