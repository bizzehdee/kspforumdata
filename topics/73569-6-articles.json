In the Dragon v2, they will fire for deorbit, and several times during descent, so there will be ample time to discover a faulty thruster before reaching the minimum parachute deployment point. The chance of 2 or more SDs failing late in the mission is very unlikely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the aforementioned \u0022bad luck\u0022 scenario of a double failure on the same thruster pod, they would probably deploy the chute anyway, cut off the opposite thrusters to maintain attitude, fire the others as hard as they can, and hope for the best.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-01T16:17:44Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2014 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T17:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo we have any data how much dV Dragon 2 carries, and how high its TWR is?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T17:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot really.

In his early book \u0022Interplanetary Flights\u0022 Arthur Clarke proposed a lunar lander very similiar in appearance to Dragon v2. Unlike LEM that ship would be single stage to lunar orbit, capable of returning to LEO and being used multiple times (after refuelling and maintenance at space station). Unfortunately Dragon is too small, and carries too little fuel to work as Clarke intended \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-01T22:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also using the wrong engines, because single stage to lunar orbit won\u0027t work with under 675 Isp.

Clarke\u0027s lander was much like Dragon - using chemical engines and liquid fuels. Just a lot bigger apparently.

Yes, that could easily be done with existing technology, and probably in a form factor similar to the DragonV2 (perhaps a bit larger). Though you\u0027d probably use LH2/LOX instead of hypergolics, on account of being more conveniently replenishable on the Moon / from near Earth asteroids, and for their much better fuel economy. A quick look at the Apollo lunar module and a dV map suggests that you\u0027d need between 4 and 5 km/s dV for this profile. The map quotes a minimum of 1.75 km/s for an ideal landing from low orbit and thus twice that for a return trip; the Apollo LM however had 4.7 km/s combined, likely to facilitate a healthy safety margin on both stages.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you could use small, vacuum optimized LH2/LOX engines like the RL10B-2 on the ULA upper stages, with around 462 Isp, you could pull off a 10 ton craft that carries 6.2 tons of fuel and 3.8 tons of dry mass (including payload) with nearly 4.4 km/s single stage dV. A single RL10B-2 with its 110 kN of thrust would offer more than enough TWR for the lunar environment even for the fully loaded craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnsure how much actual payload you can cram into 3.8 tons of fully radiation hardened dry mass, though, especially if it requires life support. I expect the DragonV2 to carry significantly more payload than this imagined vessel. I mean, seven astronauts in full flight gear alone would probably clock in around 0.8 tons, not counting any of the seating, consoles, redundant computers, heating, CO2 scrubbing, air and oxygen, water, food, batteries, cargo, gyroscope, RCS thrusters plus fuel, wiring, hull mass, tank mass, engine mass...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-02T09:03:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2014 09:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
