Then, the Command Module launches and docks\u00A0with the Lunar Module in Munar orbit. The astronauts transfer to the Lunar Module and proceed as in Apollo, with the LM being used for descent and ascent and then being discarded.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EMy question is this: where should the two spacecraft rendezvous for greatest overall efficiency? Should they aim for a high orbit or a low one? A low orbit takes advantage of the Oberth effect, but a higher orbit means it will be easier for the Command Module to return.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EIf such a mission was carried out in real life, would it be better to use a place like L1 or L2 for the rendezvous?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-28T22:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe lander has the highest delta-v requirement so I\u0027d optimise for lander efficiency and rendezvous in low orbit.

There should be no reason to arrive at a higher altitude. Arriving lower may be advantageous, because the command module is doing the work. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_orbit\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find the higher in orbit something is, the easier it is to rendezvous with it, because it\u0027s accelerating less, and there\u0027s more play in designing rendezvous orbits. It may also be advantageous from a playability perspective to place the orbit where you can time warp adequately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
