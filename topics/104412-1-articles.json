Instead of the hey look I put s big rock in orbit, ummm now what we will have large gas stations anywhere we want. It looks like this will become a essential component of anybody wanting to do lots of deep space work.\n\nMining minmas, pol, fully etc will be useful but they are all a fair ways from my regular flying routes but with a handy asteroid in Kerbin orbit refuelling is simple and right where you need it. I guess I will have to brush up on asteroid moving but that ought to be much easier with large stockpiles of fuel right there too.\n\nI for one applaud squad for taking an existing feature and giving it a great refresh."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-19T01:27:07Z","Content":"Orbiting gas stations.
