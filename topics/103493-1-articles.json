So I downloaded BDArmoury and set about making some vessels. It was going to be just a destroyer and some corvettes like in EE\u0027s video, but then I made a river monitor, and it moved rapidly away from EE\u0027s video from there on out.\n\nSo, here\u0027s the contestants:\n\n**SIDE A**\n\n*Europa* Destroyer\n\n![UPHcF0c.png](http://i.imgur.com/UPHcF0c.png)\n\n1x Goalkeeper 30mm CIWS weapon\n\n1x Abrams Tank Turret\n\n2x Howitzer\n\n2x Laser Weapons System\n\n2x 30mm Chain Gun\n\n2x 50Cal turret\n\n3x Boosted Cruise Missile\n\n6x Maverick missile\n\nTop speed: 30m/s\n\n**SIDE B**\n\n*Scratch* Corvette\n\n![APiDeCr.png](http://imgur.com/APiDeCr.png)\n\n1x Howitzer\n\n2x Hydra Rockets\n\n2x 30mm Chain Gun\n\n2x 30mm GAU-8\n\n4x Hellfire missile\n\nTop speed: 17m/s\n\n*Viking* River Monitor\n\n![Qdyvh4L.png](http://imgur.com/Qdyvh4L.png)\n\n1x Abrams Tank Turret\n\n1x Laser Weapons System\n\n2x 20mm Vulcan\n\n2x Hellfire missile\n\n2x AIM-9 missile\n\n2x AIM-120 missile\n\n4x S8KOM rockets\n\nTop speed: 20m/s\n\nOkay, so since I didn\u0027t have HyperEdit, it was a bit boring getting them all into position, but hey, I remember doing it this way back when KSP RP was a thing. I also learned that the *Scratch* needs some more bouyancy up front. As it is, I can\u0027t use the third engine without tipping it forwards dangerously, and the nose is in the water even without that engine running. Slows it down.\n\nBut, finally, I started the match. I was curious about the cruise missiles, and launched one. It fell into the sea a few hundred metres away from the *Europa*, as I hadn\u0027t selected a valid target for it. I launched a second one with the *Viking* selected, and switched to watch it fly in.\n\n![5rSHCP2.png](http://i.imgur.com/5rSHCP2.png)\n\nIt cut the monitor *in half*. It couldn\u0027t be controlled any more, so even if the weapons survived, the *Viking* was out of it.\n\nI switched to the *Scratch*, and fired off a Hellfire. It... disappeared. I fired off two more and switched to them. One hit the sea just short, the other also hit the sea but blew a hole in the *Europa*\u0027s armour. I then had the *Europa* fire off a couple of Mavericks in response, and neither hit. In fact, they fell very short, worse than the Hellfires. After switching back to the *Scratch* and firing off its last Hellfire, I decided to move the *Europa* closer. As it was, the corvette had no more missiles, and the destroyer couldn\u0027t score a hit. As the *Europa* closed at 30m/s, I fired off a Maverick then cut thrust so I could switch to it. Like the others, it missed...\n\n... and then I switched back to *Europa*. It was underwater. *Deep* underwater. When it emerged, I tried using SAS to put it back upright, but it hit the sea too hard when it splashed back down, and wrecked itself.\n\n![42GMkTe.png](http://i.imgur.com/42GMkTe.png)\n\nAnd thus...\n\n... a corvette was victorious over a destroyer."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T03:51:03Z","Content":"Was that with or without Better Buoyancy?"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T09:26:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Was that with or without Better Buoyancy?\n\nWithout."},{"CreatedByName":"Kruleworld","CreatedById":69697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T09:58:01Z","Content":"naval warfare in a space rocketry simulator..... ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T04:04:40Z","Content":"This after-action report has been moved to the AAR section."}]}
