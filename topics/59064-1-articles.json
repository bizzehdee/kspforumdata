I wanted to launch a small satellite to eve (my first journey to eve). But the launch window for an eve intercept was about 300 days away. The only way to switch to the launch window was to put a plane onto the runway and then time accelerate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, I should do several missions at a time, but I like to focus on only one mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a mod for this, or even a vanilla method?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFloule\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-06T14:17:59Z\u0022 title=\u002201/06/2014 02:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Floule\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T13:19:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d recommend using Kerbal Alarm Clock, which can stop timewarp once you reach a specific launch window.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monkeh","CreatedById":72122,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-06T13:25:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve decided that waiting on the surface of the planet is practically the same as waiting in orbit around the sun.
