I wanted to add my 2 pennies worth to what i\u0027d like to see and what i think will help the game. I play with the stock game in career mode and Kerbal engineer ... delta v?!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo begin with there are some great challenges, like launches, landing, docking etc but as you progress and start building large structures and resource mining, doing harder things ...\u00A0\u00A0these initial challenges become more of a chore and a grind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat i think would work is a new layer to the tech tree to improve the game for seasoned players but allow the game to still be great for the new players. The new layer might also be unavailable in sandbox mode due to the fact some of the new science will bypass key things you should \u00A0learn such as docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my ideas are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAutomation\u003C/strong\u003E: Probe Cores that actually can do simple things for themselves such as docking, landing\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3D Manufacturin\u003C/strong\u003Eg: An upgrade to ISRU.
