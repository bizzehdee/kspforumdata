The problem is that occasionally MJ will still activate certain modules even when you have them deselected. There is no \u0022momentary\u0022 switch in MJ. The module is on if there\u0027s a white dot inside the radio button and the module turns green if it\u0027s actively doing something. It\u0027s that simple.

The spaceplane autopilot is pretty terrible.

I\u0027ve used computers for 30 years. There are accepted design elements for how buttons of various types should look and function. For groups of \u0022radio buttons\u0022 it\u0027s supposed to be that only one at a time in a group may be selected, and that each group should be visibly delineated. When you have a group of options where any or all may be selected, they should be checkboxes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll well and good, but it \u003Cstrong\u003Edid not answer the question asked/issue posed\u003C/strong\u003E.

There are more appropriate places to discuss it (like the Dev forum) than inside this thread for this one addon. As it is, as a user of computers for 20 or so years (considering that I\u0027ve only had 31 possible years to use them) and starting with DOS 3.1 and moving from there, I understand where you\u0027re coming from, but I also understand that in the real world, there are pushbuttons that look like radio buttons and operate exactly like MechJeb\u0027s buttons do. This is where the issue comes in - do you follow computer design convention or do you follow physical design convention.
