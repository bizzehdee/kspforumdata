Before the Atomic Age began, before kerbonauts and probes existed... Three Awesome Brothers descended upon the chaos that was space science... Bob, the Brother of Funding, Bill, the Brother of Technology, and Jebediah, the Brother of Approval... Bob, with his massive bank accounts, bought land and created the Kerbal Space Program. Bill, the Brother of Technology, invented the first rocket parts and laid out a \u0022tech tree\u0022 for other scientists to follow. Jebediah, with his social competency, convinced the people that space exploration was worth pursuing and manipulated companies to offer contracts to the Program\u0027s managers. The three cool brothers then departed to retirement. And a poster detailing three \u0022resources\u0022 represented as golden triangles was left in a bag at the bus stop where they left the Space Center. Since then, the three \u0022resources\u0022 have become the providence of our Space Program. And the resting place of the poster is in the Director\u0027s Office.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-- The Great Museum Curator.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-13T10:44:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/13/2014 10:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by gutza1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T00:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGenius man, genius.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gutza1","CreatedById":63510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T20:48:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAdded some back story to go along with the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IndigoCypher00","CreatedById":75029,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T00:47:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like how Bill is labeled as a goddess.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gutza1","CreatedById":63510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-13T10:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022IndigoCypher00\u0022 data-cite=\u0022IndigoCypher00\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like how Bill is labeled as a goddess.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOops..
