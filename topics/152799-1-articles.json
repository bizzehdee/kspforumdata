I didn\u0027t read much of it, but it\u0027s interesting sounding. have they considered a long term compost system and grow some trees/plants to help with the in space atmosphere. Obviously needs containers for the roots don\u0027t get out or damage the ship long term.

Unless the suit is or can be hooked up by a tube to get it back to a compost area... If not I stand by my idea of composting and growing a tree. But inside the suit! Call it \u0022The crappy terrarium suit!\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThinking about it, you might actually be able to find plants that can deal with the smell and other issues... And literally as fast as you can crap it out. Basically, why engineer something when it\u0027s already been done. Just need to find the right plants.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHell, if you did it correctly you could have long term survival suits for really bad situations. A little \u0022food,\u0022 or something that can at least minimally sustain you, recycled water, recycled air, etc. It\u0027s always possible. The difficulty would be more with remaining knowledge of plants to find correct specimens that it would be if appropriate plants exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-01T00:18:53Z\u0022 title=\u002212/01/2016 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wumpus","CreatedById":133850,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-01T16:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChia pet?
