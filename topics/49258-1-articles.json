Only the outer moons have inclined orbits and getting into equatorial orbits of those is fairly easy given the low orbital velocity required to orbit them. You can reach them without doing any plane changes by getting an encounter at the ascending or descending node, and then you can do whatever plane change is necessary to make your orbit equatorial after you have been captured.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T20:37:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe moons are all generally in the equatorial plane, so \u0022zero\u0022 is optimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not beneficial to get, say, \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E arbitrary 8 degree inclined orbit just because a moon you want to visit has an 8 degree inclination.
