I generally work around it like this (let\u0027s say I\u0027m at planet A and want to go to planet ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png):\n\n1. Set up my ejection burn from A so that it takes me to B\u0027s orbit at what I expect to be about the right time/place. ([http://ksp.olex.biz](http://ksp.olex.biz) is a helpful timesaver, but not absolutely required).\n\n2. Fiddle with it until the \u0022intercept\u0022 markers are lined up one \u0022above\u0022 the other (i.e. they\u0027re in the right place, and the only position error is due to inclination difference). I may or may not have an SoI intercept at this point (depends on how big an inclination difference there is, what planet I\u0027m trying to hit, etc.)\n\n3. At this point I can see my ship\u0027s AN/DN markers with respect to the target planet. Go ahead and drop a second maneuver node right at the AN (or DN) en route, so that I adjust inclination to match the target\u0027s at that point.\n\n4. Still keeping that second maneuver node active, switch map focus to the target planet, then fine-tune the node to give me the approach trajectory that I want (usually an eastward equatorial path with the lowest periapsis I can get away with).\n\nYes, it\u0027s not as dV-efficient as if I could see the two planets\u0027 AN/DN markers and time my ejection for when the origin planet is at the node... but then, the phase angle wouldn\u0027t match anyway. And the inclination-correction burn is not *that* huge (unless I\u0027m going to Moho, but then I need scads of dV anyway).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E With delaying intercepts, I was thinking about this in the context of, for example, flying in front of Ike to save delta-v circularizing at Duna.

Was thinking possibly a retrograde burn combined with radial-out, done probably at a midpoint to minimize delta-v.\n\nEasy way to do this:\n\n1. Drop a maneuver node at a point a few days before your Duna intercept (or even earlier; the earlier you make it, the more dV you save, but the twitchier the node editing gets).\n\n2. Switch map focus to Duna and fine-tune the node to adjust your arrival forward/backward in time until you see that you\u0027re intercepting Ike\u0027s SoI (this is pretty easy, it has a really big SoI relative to its orbit around Duna).\n\n3. Then switch your map focus to Ike and do more fine-tuning of the node to get just the Ike approach that you want."}]}
