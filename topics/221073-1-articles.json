Will it handle what parts you have access to by node or by parts previously unlocked or just by crashing the game? Will crafts you could make in an older version of the tree still be launchable or will they grey out like how ksp1 does with temporary unlocked contract parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-03T17:14:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpecial attention is paid to keeping saves working between milestones so it won\u2019t be an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-03T20:12:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it was a bad idea to make that promise.
