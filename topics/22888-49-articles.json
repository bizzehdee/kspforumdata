I could make a perfect replica of a historic launch tower but it would be completely static and only good for a specific rocket. The launch clamps have some weird restrictions on how they are built, and I would like people to use for more than one specific pre-made vehicle. The mesh and texture for the tower have to be square. The mesh stretches and the texture is tiled as it goes up, and this launch complex would work well for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do however plan to make swing arms for fuel and electricity so you could if you wanted to load a completely empty rocket on the pad and fill it up with fuel, Kerbals and whatnot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAha. I did a little research, for the record, and you might be able to do both Gemini and LC34/37 Saturn I/IB-style LUTs with minimal work. The one that swung down at the base was the \u0022white room\u0022 gantry for Gemini; it, like the Mercury white room, clamshelled around the entire capsule, but whereas the Redstone and Atlas gantries for them rolled back on rails (pulled by a bulldozer, no less!), the Titan II version was hinged at the bottom as described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedstone and Atlas didn\u0027t actually use launch umbilical towers--because they were essentially single-stage boosters, they could get all their umbilicals through the booster\u0027s tail. The only exception was a simple hinged pole mast next to the Redstone that carried an external power line to the Mercury capsule, allowed to free-fall away from it on launch (I believe Atlas had a wiring tunnel to keep the Mercury batteries charged).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe basic LUT structure for both the Saturn I family and the Titan II looked very similar to what you have; the big difference is that the Saturn LUT used swingarms (which swung in both directions(!) at launch), while the Titan II used simple hose and cable connections with no supporting arms to them. (In fact, if you look at photos of the Gemini 10 launch, you can see that one of their upper stage umbilicals failed to disconnect from the booster, and instead ripped clean off the LUT, as designed to allow a clean launch in the event of a disconnect failure.) Maybe you could make a \u0022hoses only\u0022 version of the LUT for Titan-based vehicles?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you do make a Saturn V-type LUT, it\u0027d be awesome if you offered two sets of launch clamps, one just the standard clamps used for the Saturn V, and one simulating the \u0022milking stool\u0022 structure added to Mobile Launcher 1 in the early 70s to allow the Saturn IBs used for Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz to launch from LC39 instead of having to reactivate the mothballed LC34 or LC37. (Basically, it was a similar structure to the LUT gantry that sat atop the Mobile Launcher\u0027s platform, supporting a work deck and holddown clamps high enough above the platform\u0027s deck to use the existing White Room, Service Module, and S-IVB swingarms on the LUT with the shorter booster; it was permanently mounted to ML1, and the S-IC swingarms removed, while the S-II swingarms were modified and repositioned to support the S-IB first stage.) That\u0027s not really *critical*, of course, but it\u0027d be a cool thing if you ended up having the time to do it...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frizzank","CreatedById":57210,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-17T16:22:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have found and interesting bug in ksp.

Sometimes on load the rocket jumps to some other position from a few centimeters to almost a meter and then locks in position. This doesn\u0027t work so well with large rockets and the new launch tower because it flexes in the middle.
