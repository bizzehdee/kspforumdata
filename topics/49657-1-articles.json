My plane liked to fly so much it would not land. You can see over half my time was after I exited the fourth gate. I ran into the perpetual glide bug in KSP which would not let my plane go below 50m/s but my plane likes to fly at 40m/s. in short it would not stay on the ground so after three landing attempts I did a crash landing and got the the time in the last pic. Also I stink as a pilot in third person so I went first person for this one. easier to judge distances on the fly, and freed up my right hand to take screen shots.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll give you a place, as the craft is stationary on the runway, and Jeb survived and the rules didn\u0027t say that your plane had to be able to take off again, but I will amend the rules for future entries so that people don\u0027t start crash landing to knock a few seconds off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GamerMitch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GamerMitch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks,I can\u0027t seem to get through gate 3 though, and I\u0027ve tried 3 different designs now...so I raged and decided to kamikaze all of the gates, that also took me 3 designs...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E I\u0027m a noob\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think gate 3 is probably the most difficult, as you can\u0027t so easily use a shadow on the ground to judge your height.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-21T08:33:50Z\u0022 title=\u002210/21/2013 08:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Scarecrow88\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T08:30:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jordanpumah\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jordanpumah\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewell, they guy above me won, maybe I\u0027ll give it another go\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMtLHzPlchw\u0026amp;feature=youtube_gdata\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMtLHzPlchw\u0026amp;feature=youtube_gdata\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice video.
