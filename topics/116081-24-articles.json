Sometimes I throw a few screenshots together, it all works, and it\u0027s ten minutes a page. Sometimes I spend ten times that tweaking things--trimming the dialogue so that the word balloons fit better, lining up the images and re-sizing, etc. Then if I have to do custom art like the \u0022power walk\u0022 one the last page of D,OB all bets are off ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Farex","CreatedById":126838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-14T14:37:31Z","Content":"@Kuzzter\n\nThank you for this series, it\u0027s quite good. \n\nYour design of the M7 made me do some math here at work. \n\nIs it true that the first stage has about 9km/s delta v at Eve Atmopressure 5?
