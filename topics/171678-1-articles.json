title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E lift.\u00A0 For the Dreamer, a hack I used is making the nose piece an aerodynamic control surface... sort of an invisible canard.\u00A0 \u00A0It\u0027s a hacky way around KSP\u0027s simplified physics, but it does a whole lot to let you maintain pitch authority as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of

weight of the ship forward by making the crew cabin a little heavier than it might need to be...\u00A0 thus helping with
