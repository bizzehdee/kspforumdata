I was think of getting the new haswell 4770k and overclocking it. My question is this: Does anyone have any recommendations for processors (or other hardware) to improve KSP framerate that might be better than that? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pa1983","CreatedById":58328,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T16:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E4770K is probably the fastest in real world performance. But the game wont thread and use the cores enough to realy benefit from more then two cores sens the main thread is at least 5x more demanding then the rest combined. For KSP an i5 would be the optimal price/performance. i5 4670K is fast stock with turbo boost and then overclocking if you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHyper Threading is good for multithreded tasks or many tasks but KSP is not that so the slightly bigger cache wont realy help either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAMD FX processors are not suitable sens there IPC is actualy lower then the old Phenoms and KSP realy dont use anything like AVX or SSE4 at least not where its needed like Physics it uses SSE2 with the switch to unity4.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut sure a FX 8320 can be had for VERY little and with some overclocking it would play just fine to. But ignoring the price difference the i5 is just faster sens it also has turbo boost in the 3.8-3.9Ghz range with 1-2 cores in use on most models and have a much higher IPC so Instructions per clock is higher and with clock frequency\u0027s just marginally lower then a higher end AMD FX the overall performance is higher per thread the CPU runs. Pildriver and Bulldozer where realy server chipset from the start and more adapted to multi threading. And as I sad KSP realy dont use much fancy features from am odern CPU so old school single fast cpu core is whats needed the most to get the game running smooth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with an i5 3570K or 4670K and KSP gets physics multithreaded in the future you have some room to grow in with on average 2.5x more power to use sens KSP uses like 120% (100% per core so 4 cores for a quad i5)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-16T16:13:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2013 04:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by pa1983\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
