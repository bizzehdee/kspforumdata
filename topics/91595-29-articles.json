which makes the use of such engines impractical the further out beyond Duna you go. \u00A0The intent behind M3V is to be able to utilize as much of the architecture\u00A0as possible in all parts of the Kerbol system; and\u00A0half of the celestial bodies we can\u00A0travel to are significantly farther out than Duna.\u003Cbr\u003E\n_____________________________\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding some craft specifics, in the process of designing a new lander for Ike, I inadvertently improved on the design of the LV-2D \u0027Cricket\u0027. \u00A0The LV-2E, while intended for Ike, can be utilized on the Mun as well, although with less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E reserves for inclination changes or low-altitude maneuvering around the landing site. \u00A0It\u0027s much easier to refuel,\u00A0and\u00A0requires a pilot since it lacks the autonomous control capability of the D-model. \u00A0In a direct comparison, the LV-2E carries less total fuel and ~200m/s less \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E than the LV-2D, but carries an additional Kerbal, has a higher \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, has less parts, is 5 tons lighter fully-fueled,\u00A0and is 2/3 the price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crobal","CreatedById":181042,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-31T19:13:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi Raptor9,\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E(I am french so i will do what i can with my english)\u003Cbr\u003E\nF\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003Eirst of all, i would like to thank you\u00A0for all of your crafts, they are just amazing. \u003Cspan\u003EI use them for all my save, I learn so much from them.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe wait for patch 1.3.1 is too hard, so much craft standing by.. can we have some sneak peek like the thunder 3..plzz\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EI try to anticipate your craft thanks to the preview, it\u0027s funny to compare\u003C/span\u003E.. i was so close with the thunder 2 upper stage \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThx again o7\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Raptor9","CreatedById":67915,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-31T23:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181042-crobal/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022181042\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/181042-crobal/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Crobal\u003C/a\u003E, bonjour, and welcome to the forums.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0I\u0027m glad you enjoy and learn from the craft. \u00A0Here\u0027s a couple of preview images from craft waiting for the final 1.3.1 release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first is mostly stuff people have seen, the various configurations of the HLV-5 \u0027Porpoise\u0027 landers. \u00A0But you\u0027ll notice that there will be a fourth variant, the HLV-5D. \u00A0Simply a HLV-5B that carries a monopropellant hopper on the front instead of Liquid Fuel \u002B Oxidizer. \u00A0But they can be easily swapped out on the surface if need be, or one brought up to orbit while the other is getting filled at an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E site.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second image is the new LV-4A. \u00A0Again, it won\u0027t have the rover or the materials bay like the current one, but it will be only 70 parts, instead of 240. \u00A0Much more manageable and easier to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe third image is the new EV-5 \u0027Drifter\u0027 Block 2 for going to Eve. \u00A0More ion engines, more delta-V, more cool.

clamp alignment heights and such when under various gravity strengths.\u00A0\u00A0It was assembled with the standard 1.0g gravity of Kerbin, but I\u0027ll be hacking gravity this weekend to test out Duna (0.30g)\u00A0and Dres (0.12g) gravity levels.\u00A0\u00A0Anything in between\u00A0or lower should, in theory, still work.\u00A0\u00A0In the image below, everything you see is still a work in

the solar array clusters on the opposite side facing south so the base modules don\u0027t obscure the sunlight, but whatever.\u00A0 Everything was placed and assembled using a pair of a new type of

case, it\u0027s mounted to the front of my LITE upper stage, with an additional auxiliary service module in place of where the Orion ECLSS components would be.\u00A0 When undocked from the LITE stage, the EV-2L capsule is a self-contained spacecraft, with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E propulsion and solar power generation.\u00A0 As such, it can be landed on Gilly, or mounted to another craft (not pictured here) to become an entirely new spacecraft that can land on small moons such as Minmus.\u00A0 In it\u0027s original configuration, it fits in well with the CisMunar Economy, with enough delta-V to cover the entire Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 In other regions, it can be utilized as
