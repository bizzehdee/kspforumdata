This matches the stock scanner module\u0027s value. My line of thought before was that it took a bit of extra effort to scan with OSP, so you should get more science for it. However, I think double was probably too generous. Even though it does take a bit more work to scan planets to 100% with OSP, I decided to drop the science reward back to stock levels simply because people don\u0027t use OSP to make things easier, but to make things a bit more complex. If you liked extra science, the value is easily tweakable by pulling up the config file in the \u0022Patches\u0022 folder in a text editor and changing the value to whatever you\u0027d like.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nDoes the insta-scanning capability of the M700 Survey Scanner keep you awake at night? Are you thirsty for more realism but uninterested in complex add-ons that ignore or replace the rest of the stock resource system or add lots of parts? You might be in luck! Orbital Survey Plus is a light-weight mod that provides you with a more realistic and intuitive way to perform surveys with the survey scanner while still using the rest of the stock resource system. Gone are the arbitrary inclination requirements and instant full-body witchcraft resource reveals! The M700 will now only reveal resource data for terrain it has passed over and scanned.\n\n**How It Works**\n\nAfter deploying the M700 Survey Scanner and pressing the \u0022start survey\u0022 button, survey of the current body will begin. As long as altitude conditions are met (which are the same as stock behavior) the scan will progress, gathering resource information for the terrain under the vessel and draining electric charge. *There are no other specific orbit requirements besides current altitude.* As the scan progresses, survey data is accumulated, which can be transmitted back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nAs soon as you transmit your first batch of survey data the stock resource overlay becomes unlocked. When you toggle the resource overlay, you will notice that *regions that haven\u0027t been scanned and transmitted will be shrouded.* As your vessel gathers more data as it passes over terrain, the resource overlay will become revealed for those regions after that data is transmitted.\n\n**[Science]** Not only does transmitting survey data back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E reveal planetary overlays, it also yields science!\n\n**[Biome Overlay]** This mod adds a biome overlay toolbar button to go along with the stock resource overlay. The biome overlay will be shrouded in the same way for regions that haven\u0027t been scanned and transmitted by the survey scanner.\n\n**[Background Scanning]** Once you get your scanner going, feel free to leave it and launch more ships! Scans will progress in the background, so there\u0027s no need to stick around and time warp.\n\n**[Settings]** Many of the features of OSP can be tweaked or toggled through the KSP game settings menu. For example, if you\u0027re just here for the biome overlay, the advanced surveying feature can be disabled.\n\n**Download Current Version - 2.3.6** compatible with **KSP 1.4.X** through **KSP 1.12.X**\n\n**[Spacedock](http://spacedock.info/mod/574/Orbital%20Survey%20Plus?ga=%3CGame\u002B3102\u002B%27Kerbal\u002BSpace\u002BProgram%27%3E)  |  [Curse](https://kerbal.curseforge.com/projects/orbital-survey-plus?gameCategorySlug=ksp-mods\u0026projectID=230505)**\n\n*\\*ModuleManager included and required*\n\n**Source code available [here](https://bitbucket.org/ookville/orbitalsurveyplus/src) on Bitbucket.**\n\n**Pictures!**\n\nSpoiler\n\n![aEi0pa3.png](https://i.imgur.com/aEi0pa3.png)\n\n![RwhK6mm.png](https://i.imgur.com/RwhK6mm.png)\n\n![5YZuvnm.png](https://imgur.com/5YZuvnm.png)\n\n![nl1hF42.png](https://imgur.com/nl1hF42.png)\n\n![UOfyqvH.png](https://imgur.com/UOfyqvH.png)\n\n![JMiHygY.png](https://imgur.com/JMiHygY.png)\n\n![WVb1Yc9.png](https://imgur.com/WVb1Yc9.png)\n\n**Video!
