Also, I can get the SOI range from KSP without any additional tools because the maneuver planning shows a trajectory projection including SOI changes.

I can usually get values with less than 5% error for the large numbers. The way I look at the KSP solar system is what\u0027s the point of exploring if you already know everything?
