I\u0027m carlmora18, also known as Carl! I\u0027ve been lurking on the forums for a while now, even replied to threads here and there, so I thought it was time to formally introduce myself to the rest of you fine folks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been into KSP since .14, and played the demo until the monthly living bills let off and I could spend a little money and get it. Then these guys put out the EVA update and I was floored. I\u0027ve been into NASA and space exploration for a years - ever since I visited the Kennedy Space Center when I was 16 (now 24). It\u0027s fun to actually plan out a series of missions as I would imagine NASA would do and to then design the rockets to carry them out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started watching YouTube tutorials and really got into Scott Manly and Kurtjmacs videos! Scott is pretty much my idol as far as understanding how rocket design and astrophysics work, plus you really can\u0027t beat that awesome accent and occasional nerdy humor. They have actually inspired me to make my own videos of KSP with commentary. I only have two videos so far, but it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve put myself out there on youtube and the first time I\u0027ve heard my voice on there. Kinda helped me break out of my introvert shell so I want to thank Kerbal Space Program, its developers and it\u0027s awesome community for helping me with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway! Done ranting, I hope to get to know many of you and talk some rocketry over this games life time (which will be INFINITE).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T18:26:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi carlmora18 and welcome to the community \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a lot of people here just like yourself, and we\u0027d all be interested in seeing your vids, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T18:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carlmora18","CreatedById":39059,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T18:53:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the welcome Sal!
