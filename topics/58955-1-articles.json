It\u0027s been a while, but I\u0027m finally ready to try to put together my own ongoing series of mission reports. This is sandbox mode with many mods installed, including MechJeb, Deadly Re-Entry, Kethane, KAS, RemoteTech 2, Infernal Robotics, and other good stuff.

The Kerbal Space Center was established out of this desire to explore the unknown, but in those days the prospect of exploration was new and exciting. In the years that followed the Kerbal Race had been to orbit, and to the Mun - Kerbin\u0027s closest neighbor in the cosmos. Building those early proud rockets before the days of docking ports and flight computers was Munstak Industries - an early rocketry company that evolved from the dreams of Wernher von Kerman, the father of modern rocketry. Munstak built the largest and most successful rockets used by the Kerbal Space Program, and soon contributed to the political campaigns of many of the kerbals who expanded the space program to answer the call to explore the greater solar system beyond the orbit of Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore the dream could be realized though, the space program suddenly found itself facing a tide of neutral public opinion and lack of funding as the same government the space program helped put into power brought down the infrastructure of a government space program. For years there were no missions, as Munstak consolidated its power and bought up all of the government contracts, and facilities at the recently abandoned space center. Eventually Munstak began running its own missions to the Mun, and the planets beyond. The images recorded from the surface of Duna and its moon Ike spread worldwide and put support once again firmly in the court of space exploration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary colonies were established on the faraway red planet, and its cosmic companion. The Kerbals recorded their observations and sent home surface samples. The findings were pouring in! And then a fateful mission to Eve saw a crew of three crash into its companion moon, Gilly, when the flight computer calculated a periapse that intersected with one of the irregular mountains in its surface. All three were killed, and the public outcry was enormous. \u0022Bring our astronauts home!\u0022 they cried. Eventually public and government pressure forced Munstak\u0027s hand. They closed down the Mun base, and brought home the astronauts on Duna and Ike. The last mission during that era was to send a single probe out of the solar system by way of Jool. One last hurrah for the great giant of industry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe years went by, and the facilities stood mostly abandoned. They were still maintained, and even underwent a reconstruction during the 21st era, but had seen no use until well into the 22nd. The engineers kept pushing new technologies and begging Munstak to use them, but the pressure was on Munstak to keep things grounded. A launch happened here and there to put a clean-up probe into orbit, or send an astronaut on the obligatory PR tour, but no trips to the Mun or beyond had happened for close to 15 years!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile appeals worked their way through the courts for Munstak to gain greater autonomy in the face of public opinion, in secret they were building and designing their rockets without testing them. The day to send them up was coming! As the 22nd era gave way to the 23rd, the appeals came back mostly positive. The concession? One launch. \u0022The supreme court of the United Federation of Kerbal Continents has hereby ruled that Munstak Industries be allowed one manned launch on the third day of Kemberbal, the results of which will determine its suitability to continue operation of the KSC facilities for the remainder of the 23rd era.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo Munstak once again had its foot in the door. They had one launch, and it needed to be right. It needed to show the world that Munstak could still take care of its astronauts. The decision was made to begin simple, with a launch to LKO. But instead of the typical multi-stage launch, Munstak decided to go with the as yet untested for kerbaled flight Crew to Orbit Transfer Shuttle or COTS. A single round trip mission to a 75 kilometer orbit. The crew was chosen - The three most senior pilots Bill, Bob, and Jebediah would fly the mission from the control seat, and a crew of four would be chosen from starry-eyed hopefuls who sent in applications in the months leading up to the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChadmore, Ferdan, Dandun, and Ferdred were chosen to sit the mission. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64356-The-Ballad-of-Chadmore-Kerman-10-Part-Miniseries-COMPLETED\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhile some of the nuttier conspiracy theorists maintained that there was more to the mission than was shown to the general public\u003C/a\u003E, Munstak Industries decided not to pay any attention to them.

I hope you enjoyed reading this! There is certainly more to come, and again I will try to cover all the missions carried out in the list in my OP. Just keep in mind that most of those missions are already completed affairs and while I tried to document them as thoroughly as I could, sometimes I get too excited/involved to take images at every stage in the mission. I might have left some details unphotographed, but in general I try to document every mission I do very thoroughly. Comments and praise are all appreciated!

Although many of the objectives were completed by Crew Flight 1, the opportunity was there to learn more and to try to push the envelope of the design. The same ship used for Crew Flight 1 was retrofitted with an array of landing assist motors that could be used to slow the descent of the spacecraft if it was unable to perform a powered landing on its own. Bill and Bob Kerman were both put onto training assignment, but Jebediah was reassigned to the mission as primary pilot. New recruits: Mergard and Ormon Kerman were hired to fill out positions as pilots, while Calrey, Eldun, Camrick, and Sherlin filled out the crew cabin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time, the ship would ascend directly to 150 kilometers in altitude, and perform plane change maneuvers to test the ability of the spacecraft to reach stations on inclined orbits. After completing three full orbits, each of the crew in the hitchhiker storage unit would EVA, circle the craft once, then re-enter the spacecraft. This mission evolution is extremely important, as it would train crew members in how to transfer between vessels should the common berthing hatch become jammed, or if COTS had to dock with the part of a station that could not transfer crew through to the habitat quarters. Finally, the ship would de-orbit and land back at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UstTqoy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022UstTqoy.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the engines roared to life, the sun bathed the space center in a beautiful morning light. \u0022A positive omen if I\u0027ve ever seen one,\u0022 said Jebediah as he pushed the throttle to maximum. \u0022We now have positive vertical velocity.

Although the quick actions of Commander Jebediah reduced the death toll by 3, the public trust has been betrayed. There will be hearings, and Munstak will fall under greater scrutiny than it has ever been under... But still, the failure of COTS-2 will only serve to galvanize those who believe in space exploration, as noble causes are sometimes stained with the blood of those who boldly go where no kerbal has gone before.
