The same applies to stock craft as well --- many of the craft I download I place in the KSP\\Ships\\VAB folder (or SPH folder as well). This, of course, leads to clutter of the craft loading screen which while not being *completely* a problem, can make things frustrating when searching through that list for a particular craft file. This is why I am suggesting that there be an option to put different crafts into groups --- such as: lifters, spaceplanes, spacecraft, upper stages, downloaded craft, mod craft, etc. You get the point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an idea that I think would improve the quality of play and would improve the building experience, as I know there are many for which their favorite aspect of the game is the building process. Just to see an example of why I feel this feature should be implemented: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mediacru.sh/q3WsMyGJ69wN\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Escreenshot of my Ships\\VAB folder\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to hear your opinions on this! Of course, it\u0027s completely okay if you disagree. That\u0027s why we have this community.
