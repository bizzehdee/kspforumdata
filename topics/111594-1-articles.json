Here\u0027s the basics:\n\nFirst, gravity is an attractive force between any two objects with mass; its strength is proportional to the masses of the two objects and inversely proportional to the (squared) distance between them. So far this would suggest\n\nFgrav = M\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2m / r^2\n\nwhere M and m are the two masses and r is the distance between them. However, the units of measurement don\u0027t work out, so another multiplier is needed. It turns out that that multiplier is the same no matter what objects we\u0027re dealing with, so we call it a universal constant: specifically, the Gravitational Constant or Newton\u0027s Constant, G. This gives us\n\nFgrav = G\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2M\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2m / r^2\n\nMeanwhile: if no force is acting on a moving object, it will continue to travel at constant speed in a straight line. If an object is to move along a curved path, a force must constantly act upon it to cause the curvature. In the case of circular motion at constant speed, the required force is proportional to mass (more massive object means more force is needed) and speed (faster speed means more force is needed), and inversely proportional to the radius of the circle (larger circle means gentler curve, so *less* force is needed). Also, the speed has to be squared to get the units to work out right. This is called a \u0022centripetal\u0022 force, because it needs to be directed towards the center of the circle (perpendicular to the object\u0027s velocity).\n\nFcent = m\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2v^2 / r\n\nIn the case of an orbiting object, the centripetal force is *provided* by gravity, so we can set them equal to each other:\n\nG\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2M\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2m / r^2 = m\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2v^2 / r\n\nwhere M is the mass of, let\u0027s say, the planet and m is the mass of the spaceship orbiting it at a distance r from the planet\u0027s center.\n\nThe variable m shows up on both sides, so we can divide it out, getting\n\nG\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2M / r^2 = v^2 / r\n\nThis is important because it means the mass of the spaceship doesn\u0027t matter: two spaceships of different masses can orbit together!\n\nWe can also multiply both sides by r, canceling out the r on the right side and one of the r\u0027s on the left side:\n\nG\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2M / r = v^2\n\nIf we now take the square root, we have a formula for orbital velocity:\n\nv = sqrt (G\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2M/r)\n\nIn other words, if you want to orbit a planet with mass M at a constant distance r from the center of the planet, you must be moving at that speed. Note that things like the radius of the planet, its density, its surface gravity, the ship\u0027s mass, etc don\u0027t really matter; all you need to know is the mass of the planet and the radius of your desired orbit.\n\nOf course, the game doesn\u0027t tell you r; it tells you your altitude--how far you are from the planet\u0027s surface (let\u0027s call that h for height). To get r you\u0027ll need to add the planet\u0027s radius, R, to h; r=R\u002Bh. If we substitute that into the formula we get\n\nv = sqrt ( G M / (R\u002Bh) )\n\nSo! Look up the planet\u0027s mass and radius (on the map screen, focus on the planet and click the info button), look up the universal gravitational constant, decide what height you want to orbit at (make sure it\u0027s above the atmosphere if there is one or the highest mountain if there isn\u0027t), plug all those numbers into the formula, and you\u0027ll have the required orbital velocity."},{"CreatedByName":"Steel","CreatedById":49317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T09:30:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I understand all the variables required except for G\n\nAlso just on top of what AbacusWizard said, G in this equation isn\u0027t a variable, but the gravitational constant, so there\u0027s no need to worry about it, you just plug in the number into your calculations every time a G comes up.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The moon has a gravity well of 0.49 g\n\nCan you define a little better what this means?

I will show you my work and my answer.

Also, it\u0027s actually pretty close, if not spot on. I made a typo in regards to the Earth\u0027s mass. The first digit is supposed to be 5, but I accidentally wrote it as a 6.
