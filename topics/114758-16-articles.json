I personally feel they come early. I use CTT and the Pathfinder mod mentioned earlier. Pathfinder gives me my temporary mobile scouting base but at the same time I\u0027m getting those parts opened up I\u0027m already getting the Mk 1 Hab and gangway parts. One more node up and I\u0027ve got the adapter which combined with some creative strutting means I can milk the Modular Storage unit for fuel or storage while also getting my first permanent surface pieces put in place. Alongside that idea, at the same time we get the Planetary Lab/Greenhouse we\u0027re also just getting the first true station module from stock with the MPL. This means we\u0027re essentially getting our first station parts and our final permanent base parts at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis just seemed a bit wonky to me so I\u0027ve personally written my own CTT file and moved most of the KPBS pieces 2-3 nodes deeper. I don\u0027t go so far as moving the parts to the end of the tree since I don\u0027t treat these as true end game items but rather more along the lines of a major stepping stone to that level of tech. The way I see it the basic idea is to build using the adapters/I-beams and deliver using the Mk3 or 3.75m platforms and that translates into a need for parts to be moved further up the tree.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nils277","CreatedById":122414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-07T07:25:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SSMI\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SSMI\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not however sure how I feel about ore to fertilizer.
