Of course, right clicking on said buildings lets me know they are fully upgraded. \n\nI\u0027ve noticed CBK was used by OPM to extend tracking station to a fourth level, wich is really helpfull. Noticing CBK was used to mess with building levels, I removed it from my mods (i use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to manage my mods) and, you guessed it, no more bugs. Turned it back on a few game hours later, bug is back.\n\nRunning out of other options than coming to beg for help here, well, here I am. \n\n(apologies for not clearly understanding what \u0022logs\u0022 are or how can i get them)"},{"CreatedByName":"Evco","CreatedById":210694,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-16T22:01:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 10/5/2020 at 6:37 PM, nsgallup said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I am having the same issue in science mode with 1.1.21 and 1.1.20 where connectivity does not work, and I also had an issue where I could not EVA or make maneuver nodes.\n\u003E \n\nI knew it was a long shot but i was hoping and praying that somehow this mod would work in 1.11, but after testing I get this same bug.
