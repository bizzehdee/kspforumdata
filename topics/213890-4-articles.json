A vast majority of these are game breaking bugs, and clearly you dont understand the meaning of game breaking. A bug causing fuel to not stage properly isnt game breaking as there are workarounds, a bug causing the game to think your whole rocket crashed after a stabilizer clipped into a clamp on launch and forcing a ship destroyed screen is game breaking. a bug that could be causing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E to not be applying enough torque/thrust isnt game breaking, the game deleting your stations flight path so when you switch back to controlling it, it is now falling straight back down onto kerbin IS GAME BREAKING. Using docking ports on an Apollo style moon lander and having your entire ship blow up from selecting undock EVERY SINGLE TIME IS GAME BREAKING. I have been a part of many other early access games and this is the first one at this high of a price point to have this many issues after what, 5 years in development?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other issue here is that many people only have a few playstyles on KSP that they actually like to play. And the fact that there are this many game breaking bugs at this high of a price point is very disconcerting. especially because this was very much advertised as more of an open beta while it is now clear that it is more of a PRE-ALPHA release. My advice is to stop being so high and mighty and assuming people are unwilling to work around bugs, as many are impossible to work around right now,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224249101\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213890\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677702347\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022103694\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jacke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Jacke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I do hope they weren\u0027t just doing this on the highest end machines; it\u0027s long been a staple of proper programming to not use the highest end machines so that issues with the market\u0027s equipment will be found during development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wonder if this is the case.
