My question for today is, how to make a slingshot maneuver because I want to save fuel to go to Duna. Any ideas how? Also, include an image if possible with you answer.

Work out what body you want to assist off of. Good candidates have deep gravity wells and are \u003Cspan\u003E\u0022closer\u0022 (in delta-V terms) than wherever you\u0027re going. Eve, for example, is a popular target for missions heading to the outer solar system, since it\u0027s big and easy to get to from Kerbin. In your case, however, the only reasonable choice is the Mun, since it\u0027s the biggest body that\u0027s \u0022closer\u0022 to you than Duna.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E2.

Tweak the transfer until the orbit you\u0027ll end up in after the flyby looks good. \u0022Looking good\u0022 in this case can mean any number of things, but in general means either A: encounters (or get close to an encounter with) the target body, or B: if that\u0027s not possible, at least ends up crossing the orbit of the target body. In case B, you\u0027ll end up needing to wait a few orbits for an encounter to happen.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThese rules apply to any gravity assist in general, but there are some specific transfer routes that have been found to work reliably without too much waiting around. The Mun-\u0026gt;Duna transfer has already been explained in this thread, but also worth mentioning is the K-\u0026gt;E-\u0026gt;K-\u0026gt;K-\u0026gt;J transfer, which is highly reliable and ever popular for missions to Jool. A full explanation of how that one works is a bit off topic, but I\u0027m sure you can find several threads where it\u0027s been explained to death.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
