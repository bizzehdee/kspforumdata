Maybe for a future release though. I could add some extra options like this that would be off by default and would have to be explicitly enabled. I did play around with boosting the jetpack power to ridiculous levels during early testing, and I\u0027ll admit it is rather fun to achieve orbit around Kerbin using just the jetpack :-)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E this looks like a great replacement for tweakable everything\u0027s basic EVA tweakable - the only thing I like about that module is it lets me set a default jetpack thruster value through MM\n\nGood idea - I\u0027ve added a new setting to the config file that will let you set a default power level.

However I just installed QuickStart to try it out and it seems to get along fine with EVAEnhancements. I took a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/malahx/QuickStart) and it appears malah fixed that particular compatibility issue in v1.01."},{"CreatedByName":"eLDude","CreatedById":111795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T20:40:17Z","Content":"thanks for your work!\n\nlow gravity - big fun:D \n\nYEHAW!"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarheel1999","CreatedById":123965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T10:49:43Z","Content":"Loving it.
