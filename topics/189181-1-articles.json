A modified KOL module was propped up on its \u201Cside.\u201D He flipped through the clipboard he was handed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COkay,\u201D he said. \u201CSee if they shave the mass by twenty percent.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe junior designer took the clipboard back. \u201CI don\u2019t know boss.\u201D He flipped to the last page. He frowned. \u201CTwenty percent\u2026 the design margin is pretty thin. We cut that much those margins will probably disappear.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJorcott nodded. \u201CYes. The supply margins are just as tight though.\u201D He gestured to the module. \u201CUntil we can close the supply loops every kilo of dry mass shaved is another kilo of supplies that can be shipped.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe hatch at one end of the module opened. Bob and Bill climbed out on to the adjacent platform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ve managed to partially close the loop on water. But the losses are still pretty bad.\u201D He watched as Bob and Bill climbed down the ladder.\u00A0 \u201CAnd then there is the food\u2026 full loss, no recovery.\u201D He paused and chuckled. \u201CBut, you know all this. The designers will complain for a while, and then they\u2019ll try. I agree though, they probably won\u2019t make it.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CI\u2019ll take what I can get.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob and Bill walked over and stopped in front of Jorcott.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat do you think?\u201D Jorcott said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CTight,\u201D Bill said. \u201CI know it has the same volume as a KOL mod. It just feels smaller.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019re having to think in terms of square meters again, rather than cubic. \u201CBob said. \u201CDon\u2019t tell us that after all the time you\u2019ve be Klik in a can, you\u2019re getting claustrophobic.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob chuckled, \u201Cno.\u201D He ran is hands through his hair. \u201CBut, what about using the three seventy five hull instead?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJorcott shook his head. \u201CIt was pitched. But the time budget didn\u2019t allow for it. Modifying the KOL design shortened much of the design time.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYeah, I figured.\u201D Bill shrugged. \u201CAnyways, best bet is the pipes and heavy electrical in the floor and data-comm and light electrical in the ceiling. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard to refit the cargo pods for more useable space once they are empty.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes,\u201D Bob said. \u201CSince we\u2019re building on the KOL frame, much of the existing equipment should work. We may even be able to shave some mass since they won\u2019t have to be rated for micro-grav.\u201D He scratched the side of his face. \u201CThough thinking about some of the stuff they\u2019re working on up on the KOLs and coming out of agronomics and hydroponics\u2026 they figure they can hit ninety percent recycling on air and water, and maybe get some food besides.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CThey\u2019re probably over-estimating but even then as supply pods land we can re-fit them. If we stack enough of them we can get what we need for recovery.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJorcott looked at the module then at Bob. \u201CYou think they can figure it out?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBob looked up through one of the frosted skylights. \u201CWell\u2026\u201D He scratched the side of his face. \u201CHe looked back down. \u201CThe science says \u2018yes\u2019.\u201D He gestured through the walls of the hall. \u201CThe question is how much space? A couple of experiments suggest it would take about six square metres of wheat to produce enough oxygen for one kerbal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill looked over at another module mocked up in another part of the hall. \u2018Yeah\u2026 could manage six maybe eight square-ems. One unit per kerbal.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJorcott nodded. \u201CThe retro kits will eat supp space.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CBut,\u201D Bill said. \u201CSpending now to save later.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe young engineer chuckled. The rest looked at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CSorry, \u201C he said. \u201CI was thinking of my father. He was never higher than the top of his silo. The thought of him standing in the hatchway, a piece of straw in his mouth tending his crops, up there\u2026 on the M\u00FCn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-22T21:26:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAhh - a Tale of the Groundbound is always a treat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
