I simply want to get this rocket into orbit but It\u0027s just impossible. First, when I try to get into an equatorial orbit, it starts veering south etc. When trying to get into a polar orbit it starts veering east. Also, it gets affected by aerodynamic forces like crazy. I even tried adding a second huge reaction wheel, guess what it did: NOTHING.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the craft file.
