Only the Archived Contracts in the Missin Controller Building!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis should be the last time I do any major update to existing contracts. So hopefully the last time on purpose at least this happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhats new?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. New GUI editor cost breakdown list: While in editor you can select the Mission Controller Icon and the new Parts list will be shown. This parts list will show you every individual part that is on your Constructed vessel \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat the time. You can also filter in and out Resources and Mass Values. Please note that due to a bug in KSP This GUI Editor actual updates quicker with total cost of parts with Procedure Parts. For instance you might \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eplace a Procedural Fairing on your vessel and the Total Cost of Vessel in the KSP window will be wrong. The total cost in the MCE window is the correct value. The KSP values update on the next part added, or moved \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon the vessel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Added new Contract: The new Custom Supply contract is Mission Controllers newest custom contracts. Like the ComSat Contract you can edit this contract to your hearts content. This contract is meant to supply your \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBases and Orbital stations with supplies. Right now it supports Stock Resources and Tac Life Support Resources. If you think I need to add anymore please give me a shout. The contract works by selecting what vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou want to supply (any vessel of type Base or Station will show up in list). Selecting the type of resource, and the amount. And then turning on the Contract (can be on or off). Then actually selecting the contract in the\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission Control Building. Like the ComSat Contract you will have to cycle through a few Contracts for it to show up. If any changes are made you will have to cancel out old contract for new contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Major changes to Repair, Satellite Delivery Missions. Now satellite delivery contracts have new goals. Including Mass and Electric change. Customers want thier satellites to be a certain mass and have a certain amount\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eof electric charge on them! Also Satellite delivery missions can now be assigned to the Mun and Possible Minmus. Its rare but can happen. The contract payments are adjusted. Also all satellite contracts are adjusted in\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprice for distance traveled. So they basically pay more if they want Higher Orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Repair Missions have also changed a little bit, they also pay a little more, and will adjust for different planets they may be located at. Also repair missions are a lot more RARE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Last note on Vessel Mass: Nifty little trick you can do with the new Ship Breakdown GUI window and Mass. Testing your final satellite for correct Mass when its in space (thats when its tested in mission) can help\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eto take out the fuel and see if it still passes. The Mass Reading on the GUI window Updates automatically. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Added a new settings window. Now you can edit all the settings in the config file from within KSP itself. Located in the MCE icon in SpaceCenter screen. Please not a lot of settings you still have to RESTART KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike difficutly levels, and If you want kerbal rescues on or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Message helpers in settings is a display that pops up in lower right hand corner while doing Satellite Contracts. They display Orbital Period and ApA and PeA. You can use these or just use Engineer or MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour choice!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Has Been Fixed?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The names of vessels no longer display (unloaded)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Fixed Repair mission not showing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Fixed many values in contracts that were broken or didn\u0027t work, like celestrial bodies not saving correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Titles of contracts no longer display the count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Fixed message helpers. They should not in most curcumstances cause issue. But can\u0027t promise anything. But they now include Orbital Period, ApA and PeA values for MCE Missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo install new version\u003C/strong\u003E I highly suggest you delete your old MissionControllerEC folder! And install the new version fresh! This helps to make sure everyone is on an even playing field with issues. You can now set up \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyour Settings in game, so this should not be a big deal. Its highly recomended!
