I\u0027ve been flying Kerbal rockets with fair success for quite a while, but now I cannot seem to build a rocket that doesn\u0027t start spinning wildly at some point in its flight. If thrusters are on as well as SAS, they fire in the direction that makes it spin MORE, not less. If I leave the thrusters off I still get the spinning, though later in the flight. \n\nI suspect this is a simple problem of the relationship between CG and CP (that after I\u0027ve burned enough fuel it goes backwards and causes the problem). I understand CG/CP relationships in real rockets (I\u0027ve built and flown hundreds of them), just not how to maintain the necessary relationship in KSP rockets. Anyway that doesn\u0027t explain why the automatic stabilization fires the wrong way. I don\u0027t know how to solve that.\n\nI also suspect that this has something to do with the change in physics that came with the recent update. \n\nRegardless, I no longer have any idea how to make rockets that fly reliably. Any hints?"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T17:47:06Z","Content":"I can often solve this problem by flying slower and to stay closer to the flight direction."},{"CreatedByName":"sylvie369","CreatedById":71074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T17:51:08Z","Content":"It seems to be something much more than that. I could be flying nicely in orbit, engines off, stabilization on, holding me in the direction of the flight path, and all of a sudden it starts tumbling end over end. Several times I was stably in orbit with engines off when it started happening.\n\nOof. And just now it started doing it in a capsule that had already safely splashed down in the water. That suggests that it has nothing to do with CG/CP relationships (it\u0027s just a capsule) or the thrusters (since there aren\u0027t any). \n\nHmm. And if I turn SAS off, the water starts splashing like mad. ...? The water calms if I turn SAS back on, but the capsule keeps spinning.\n\nThere\u0027s clearly something in the rocket that is forcing it to spin. It doesn\u0027t seem to be related to the rocket\u0027s environment, since I\u0027ve now seen it start in the atmosphere, out in deep space, and in the ocean. In the ocean case right now the rocket (capsule) wasn\u0027t even moving when it started to spin.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-28T17:56:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2015 05:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sylvie369**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kaos","CreatedById":110849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T17:56:11Z","Content":"I once had the game in a mode where everything started to wobble and turn around. After restart (complete close of the program), everything worked fine again.\n\nAnother reason I can think of is that if there is a lot too much control stuff in the rocket, SAS can start to destabilize it by overcompensating minor errors. Does it work without SAS and only manual control?"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T18:42:48Z","Content":"Sounds like phantom control inputs, perhaps.\n\nWith SAS off, what are the pitch, roll and yaw indicators showing? If they\u0027re not centred hit modifier-x to cancel trim (modifier is alt on Windows)\n\nDo you have a joystick?\n\nAlternatively, this sounds a bit like the \u0022universe gone mad\u0022 that I\u0027ve heard described after using the klaw causes a game-breaking bug (klaws are kraken-bait), but I\u0027ve no experience of it myself."},{"CreatedByName":"sylvie369","CreatedById":71074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-28T23:24:54Z","Content":"I\u0027ll try that.

My first thought was part clipping, but that\u0027s a neat trick with just a capsule and maybe some chutes.\n\nIs it using battery charge to make you spin (or monoprop as the case may be) or is it just happening without resource use?"},{"CreatedByName":"sylvie369","CreatedById":71074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T22:57:47Z","Content":"Oh, I just lost another one - one that had been flying normally - to this \u0022phantom control input\u0022 problem. I was able to slow the spinning down by rotating the rocket 180 degrees so the control forces were working against the spin. I didn\u0027t think to look at whether or not it was using battery change. Hopefully I\u0027ll remember that next time. \n\nAs the thrusters and SAS were causing the spin, the attitude indicators were showing forces. Before I manually rotated it, the pitch indicator was pinned to one side. After rotation, the yaw indicator was the one pinned. \n\nIs this \u0022part clipping\u0022 something I can fix? Or should I forget about that as a possible cause?"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T23:15:16Z","Content":"The way to design a rocket for sustained atmospheric flight now in more realistic aero is first to make sure it is tall and slender. Second the front must be heavier than the rear. You are probably well up on these two. The third factor is it must be more aerodynamic at the top than at the end. Otherwise drag will pull the nose of the rocket around. There are two ways your nose gets more drag than the tail, by being un-aerodynamic to start with, and having no fins to create drag at the end, and second speed. If your rocket has a TWR higher than 2 and you start flying faster than the speed of sound (around 260m/s at SL I think) the drag on the nose rapidly increases, where the tail because it is occluded does not. Eventually the nose becomes more draggy than the tail and the rocket flips. Use the Kerbal Engineer mod, keep your TWR around 1.6 and stay slower than 300m/s until around 10000m."},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T10:01:51Z","Content":"Just on the off-chance...\n\nYour command pods always face the right direction right? As in, the \u0022up\u0022 of the command pod is the intended direction of flight?\n\nDo you use multiple command pods?\n\nI think I remember building a rocket once with an inverted command pod - this caused the flight controls to also be inverted, causing similar problems to those you describe.\n\nAre you running stock or with mods?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mars Mullo","CreatedById":110160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T10:04:25Z","Content":"I found that there are two simple things to that work.\n\n1. stay in the prograde bubble all the way to about the 30 -50km altitude.\n\n2. place stabiliser fins or even wings on the lowest parts of your main rocket (don\u0027t waste them on your SRB\u0027s) (Don\u0027t use the rudder wings as they almost seem to over - do the correction and buffet the rocket back and forth)\n\nThat\u0027s it and it worked for me.\n\nEasiest way to keep the speed appropriate to do those things above is to have all your rockets in the lower stages with a TWR of about 1/ 1.2 \u003E 1/1.5. Reason being is the rocket will get a hard time at the time it passes from sub to super sonic. If you slowly pass through the band it seems to keep your rocket on target instead of giving the control surfaces a quik flip into a direction outside the pro grade bubble on the UI."},{"CreatedByName":"sylvie369","CreatedById":71074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T20:51:07Z","Content":"Yes, my command pods are facing up. And it\u0027s clearly a matter of the thrusters/SAS pushing the rocket into the spin, not a matter of instability. I just watched a rocket flying just fine and suddenly the thrusters just knocked it over (and the SAS seems to be doing the same thing - killing the thrusters didn\u0027t help much). \n\nI know the aerodynamics models were changed recently, and I suppose that might have something to do with it. I\u0027ve been flying KSP rockets for a few years now without ever having seen this problem before. If it\u0027s a matter of those rockets being unstable, they\u0027re unstable in a way they didn\u0027t used to be. All of these rockets would have flown fine six months ago.\n\n==================\n\nJust now I noticed that if I send a Kerbal EVA while it\u0027s spinning, the spinning stops, until the Kerbal reenters the pod. Then it starts spinning up again like mad. I was able to cycle through that several times before finally the spinning pod flung the Kerbal off into space. Each time when he went EVA, the pod quickly stopped spinning. This was on a rocket that I\u0027d flown out to a parking orbit about 1.1 million meters out without incident. Once out there it orbited just fine for a while, then began spinning end over end. Again, it seems to have nothing at all to do with rocket design or aerodynamics.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-03T21:15:11Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2015 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sylvie369**"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-04T15:55:34Z","Content":"Are these all happening to the same ship design or lots of different ones?
