I\u0027ve been flying Kerbal rockets with fair success for quite a while, but now I cannot seem to build a rocket that doesn\u0027t start spinning wildly at some point in its flight. If thrusters are on as well as SAS, they fire in the direction that makes it spin MORE, not less. If I leave the thrusters off I still get the spinning, though later in the flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect this is a simple problem of the relationship between CG and CP (that after I\u0027ve burned enough fuel it goes backwards and causes the problem). I understand CG/CP relationships in real rockets (I\u0027ve built and flown hundreds of them), just not how to maintain the necessary relationship in KSP rockets. Anyway that doesn\u0027t explain why the automatic stabilization fires the wrong way. I don\u0027t know how to solve that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also suspect that this has something to do with the change in physics that came with the recent update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, I no longer have any idea how to make rockets that fly reliably.

Second the front must be heavier than the rear. You are probably well up on these two. The third factor is it must be more aerodynamic at the top than at the end. Otherwise drag will pull the nose of the rocket around. There are two ways your nose gets more drag than the tail, by being un-aerodynamic to start with, and having no fins to create drag at the end, and second speed. If your rocket has a TWR higher than 2 and you start flying faster than the speed of sound (around 260m/s at SL I think) the drag on the nose rapidly increases, where the tail because it is occluded does not. Eventually the nose becomes more draggy than the tail and the rocket flips. Use the Kerbal Engineer mod, keep your TWR around 1.6 and stay slower than 300m/s until around 10000m.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-03T10:01:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust on the off-chance...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour command pods always face the right direction right?

Each time when he went EVA, the pod quickly stopped spinning. This was on a rocket that I\u0027d flown out to a parking orbit about 1.1 million meters out without incident. Once out there it orbited just fine for a while, then began spinning end over end.
