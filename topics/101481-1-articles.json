In the space center all of the buildings have the models of them being fully upgraded and right clicking on the building states that they are fully upgraded (no option to upgrade). The features are that of the tier one buildings though. I can only accept 2 contracts at a time, launch \u0026lt;18 ton rockets, and play as if I had tier 1 buildings. It\u0027s literally impossible to upgrade the buildings beyond their lowest levels. Creating a new career save does not help, and re-downloading the KSP client did not help either. Help, the game is unplayable like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/V5ISfv2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022V5ISfv2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GdZeW3F.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GdZeW3F.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-07T22:24:36Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2015 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Duban\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T22:46:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am going to take a wild guess that you are running 64-bit version of KSP.
