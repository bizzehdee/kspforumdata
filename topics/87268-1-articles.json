Something as basic as EVA shouldn\u0027t be so disastrously unpredictable. For instance.. I was Orbiting Kerbin just a moment ago and I EVA my astronaut only to have him fly off the pod and into a vital instrument. Why do you have them bounce so violently? No matter how I positioned my ship the astronaut would go flying off of the pod. And then there\u0027s times when EVA works fine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is something so commonly used and critical (in some cases) so neglected?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shiva","CreatedById":42474,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T07:06:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I find this bug very annoying as well\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bobbydylan","CreatedById":95531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T07:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\u0027s always been precarious, but since .25 it seems every time the kerbal goes belting off into space.
