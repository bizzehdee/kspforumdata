Well, that\u0027s a bit unclear.. I learned some of it from the wiki, but couldn\u0027t understand many terms. It was a long time before I managed to do so.\n\nI learned going to Minmus from watching Scott Manley\u0027s tutorials.. and that\u0027s where I learned maneuver nodes!\n\nLearning how to land on other planets was a bit hard, as I couldn\u0027t understand Scott Manley\u0027s tutorial of it.\n\nWhat I DID learn was about this website named ksp.olex.biz, and found out about launch windows. I practically guessed at how I was going to do it.\n\nDocking..? Well, I mostly learned it from Starwhip\u0027s tutorial \u0022Docking; From Navball to First Station, and beyond!\u0022 whoch I found very in-depth and easy to understand comared to ther tutorials.\n\nWhat about you guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T17:44:07Z","Content":"I took this post away since it seemed to offend some.

I learned more advanced mechanics/rendezvous/docking in KSP (again self-taught).\n\nI did watch two Manley videos. One was a documentary about the fuel pumping bug (I watched it as the wiki documentation on fuel transfer is or was (at the time) rather un-user-friendly), and the other was a basics of spaceplanes so I could see a visual representation of a good distance for the CoM/CoL separation.\n\nI also read about that constant-altitude type landing (it\u0027s basically just an extended version of my own \u0022Apollo-style landing\u0022 however).\n\nI also TRIED to read about the maneuver node, but the documentation just didn\u0027t click, so for the longest time I just laid courses by eye on the navball, and slowly figured out the maneuver node through trial and error. And now, I actually tend to do a lot of maneuvers by eye, which saves quite a bit of time vs. fiddling with the blasted thing.\n\nFinally, I saw some posts long ago about the time even LONGER ago when there was no maneuvering node, and the \u0022Mun on the horizon\u0022 rule of thumb. That helped somewhat when 0.90 was released~\n\nBy and large, I felt that reading up on the techniques was cheating myself out of figuring them out for myself. It\u0027s much more rewarding to do it in the latter fashion, and I feel that my understanding is stronger because of it. The only \u0022downside\u0022 is that my jargon is a bit weak.

Later, after joining the NASA astronaut corps, I spent time translating complex orbital mechanics into relatively simple flight plans for my colleagues \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 they thanked me (with a mixture of respect and sarcasm) with the nickname Dr. Rendezvous."},{"CreatedByName":"Quote","CreatedById":15230,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T16:18:44Z","Content":"Trial and Error for the most part.
