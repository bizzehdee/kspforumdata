As a rule of thumb, I\u0027d make the area of that chute (in m^2) 4 times the vessel mass (in tonnes) for Kerbin re-entry. This worked beautifully; by the time I reached the sort of altitude where chutes would burn off, I had already decelerated enough that the drogue stayed intact. In particular, this let me land long thin vehicles which otherwise wouldn\u0027t bleed off enough speed in a naive stern-first re-entry. \u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHowever, as far as I know, no-one actually does this in reality. Is there a reason why it shouldn\u0027t work? If there is, I\u0027ll stop doing it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI still don\u0027t know why the forum eats all paragraphs when I post, giving me a wall of text.

Deadly Reentry will no longer inflict damage on chutes. At least, not on Real Chutes because SC has implemented chute damage himself. I think stock chutes also have deployment limitations now too but I might have imagined that. (in which case, I\u0027ll reimpliment damage for stock chutes.
