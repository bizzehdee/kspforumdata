This is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe then claims that this is off by a factor of 2.5. I assume what he means is 6%*13 psi = 0.78 psi, and 0.78 psi * 2.5 = 1.95 psi, which is close to the 2 psi deflation the league officials found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, he should not be using 13 psi, since this is gauge pressure; he needs to use absolute, which requires adding 14.7 psi.
