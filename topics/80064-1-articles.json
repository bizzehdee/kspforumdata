At a density of 1.00 g/cm^3 - around what would be expected if it had a large core - it would have a radius of about 10,000 km. According to \u003Ca href=\u0022http://astro.unl.edu/naap/atmosphere/animations/gasRetentionPlot.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis little widget that plots whether an object will retain gases\u003C/a\u003E, it could only retain helium up to the temperature of Saturn, and hydrogen would escape into space below the temperature of Neptune. On the other hand, if we take the radius of 6,000 km and scale the mass to give a gas planet like density, it would be unable to retain either gas even at the temperature of Neptune.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we use both Jool\u0027s \u0022canon\u0022 mass and its \u0022canon\u0022 radius, it could actually retain helium up to a little below the temperature of Jupiter, but hydrogen would escape into space. However, with a density of 4.68 g/cm^3, it wouldn\u0027t really be a gas planet anymore. That said, a rocky or icy planet can acquire an atmosphere so thick that viewed from space it LOOKS like a gas giant. The obvious examples are Venus and Titan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, Venus\u0027s atmosphere is only about 0.01% of the planet\u0027s mass. But we can imagine a planet with an atmosphere that\u0027s, say, 1% of its mass. For Jool, this atmosphere would have a mass of 2.23*10^22 kg, spread over a surface area of 4.52*10^14 m^2, with a gravitational acceleration of 7.85 m/s^2. This gives a maximum atmospheric pressure of 3800 bars (as opposed to 92 bars on Venus, or 1000 bars at the bottom of the Mariana Trench). Such an atmosphere would crush any spacecraft before it could reach the surface, and might even trap enough internal heat to get rather toasty at depth. Such a planet would be rather similar to Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, if we \u0022scale up\u0022 Jool to realistic size (multiply radius by 10 and mass by 100) we get a planet the size of saturn, but only 71 earth masses as opposed to 95, and a density under half that of water. This would imply an extremely light, fluffy planet, which would require the planet to be almost entirely hydrogen and helium an extremely small rocky and icy core. That might start to stretch the limits of planetary formation theories.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, probably not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T03:42:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eeven a gas giant has considerable rocky material at its core. on a smaller gas giant you might see a higher ratio of this material and the gases and ices that make up the rest of it. so essentially what you get is a super earth with a very thick atmosphere. the line between rocky and gas is kind of fuzzy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T12:25:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eeven a gas giant has considerable rocky material at its core. on a smaller gas giant you might see a higher ratio of this material and the gases and ices that make up the rest of it. so essentially what you get is a super earth with a very thick atmosphere. the line between rocky and gas is kind of fuzzy.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing planetary geology terms, it\u0027s not fuzzy at all. Rocky means silicates and metals, gas means hydrogen and helium. Huge terrestrial planets will still have a solid surface and a thick icy (nitrogen, methane) atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas giants are huge blobs. Gaseous envelope with icy clouds, gradual transition to supercritical fluid (gas/ice in variable ratios), highly compressed plasma with increasingly rocky content towards the center.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere can\u0027t be a gas giant the size of Jool. Considering normal matter we encounter in the universe, the densities aren\u0027t enough to cause one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
