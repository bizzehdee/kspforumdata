But sadly, the research lab says there is nothing you can gain from exploding things. So I suggest that we should be able to gain a certain amount of science from crashing and blowing up stuff depending on if something is watching and what you crash it into and how big it is, mass, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhadya think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T22:23:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInterstellar Pack recently released an update that included impactors for science.
