I got the probe and its booster stage into orbit just fine, and launched at what I thought were the optimum angles needed. Ejection burn occurred without problems, and I was able to perform a proper correction burn to put my probe in the same orbital inclination as Moho. That burn - and the time it took - told me two things: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. My choice for Planet-1\u0027s booster engine (the LV-909) was a poor one. More thrust would be needed for faster (and hopefully more accurate) burns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. While I factored in enough fuel for Kerbin orbit ejection and Moho orbit capture, I didn\u0027t factor in the inclination orbit correction burn. I wasn\u0027t going to have enough fuel to complete the mission, leaving the probe to circle the sun for eternity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think I missed the launch window by a small margin, meaning I would have needed more correction burns to get Planet-1 to its destination even if I had the fuel. Well, better luck next time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second failure was the first test launch of my Sigma-V Medium-Lift launch vehicle. While I think I have enough fuel for ascent and orbit, I had problems with control during ascent (rocket started to roll as soon as it cleared the launch clamps, and started to yaw a few kilometers up) and the six external boosters \u003Cem\u003Eflexed\u003C/em\u003E on ascent. Solution: winglets on the boosters to control the roll and more struts to keep the boosters still.
