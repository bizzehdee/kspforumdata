Shortly after reaching a stable orbit it went dead and I can\u0027t control it any more, I\u0027ve got electricharge remaining as well as solar panels.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only mod I\u0027ve got installed is Advanced-Fly-By-Wire.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe satellite is controlled by a Probodobodyne OKTO for remote control and Mk1 command pod! I\u0027m wondering if these two are causing some kind of conflict for reasons unknown. (maybe I should check the atmospheric pressure :O)\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs mentioned before there is electricharge left on the onboard rechargeable batteries and command pod - The Probodobodyne OKTO is left with 0 electricharge though, although the info-window (when right click on part) says it is operational.
