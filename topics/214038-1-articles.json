It appears that when the medium decouplers are not decoupling it\u0027s due to the engine fairing . I built a test stand and made medium and small decoupler tests with 4x symmetry.\u00A0 One\u00A0 of the medium decouplers\u00A0 would always have a decoupler stage stick and not work proper. Finally I figured out if you turn off the engine fairing the issue seems to be resolved.\u00A0 Can someone back this up with their own testing and spread the good word.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tasuit","CreatedById":8988,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T12:42:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have had a similar experience! Spend hours debugging my launcher, until I turned off the fairing. Also only with the medium decoupler - although I haven\u0027t tested the largest decouplers, so there is potentially the same issue there.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
