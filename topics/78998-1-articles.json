One executable module can launch any number of threads. The challenge with multithreading isn\u0027t splitting things into different files (in fact, in many cases where multithreading is useful, most threads are running the exact same code on different inputs, because that parallelizes really well), it\u0027s making it so that the different threads don\u0027t mess with each other (e.g. changing the value of a variable while the other thread is actively doing something with it).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-22T16:17:20Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2014 04:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T18:03:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027ve sort of covered this in another thread. In general, threads within the same process share memory. However, if you want them to run on different cores, memory sharing becomes complicated. Asynchronous access is an issue, for example. It\u0027s something you have to work around. If the two different threads do completely different things, and they don\u0027t share memory, then it\u0027s pretty straight forward to set things up to run in parallel. Running physics and rendering in two different threads that run on two different cores, for example, is pretty straight forward. Only locations of entities have to be shared between the two.
