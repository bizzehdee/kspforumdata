It\u0027s kinda annoying to build new vessel, set up action groups like I want them to be and when I use them during mission I find that action group also triggers stuff that I definitely didn\u0027t need and didn\u0027t set up in VAB (like pressing \u00221\u0022 and expecting to have extended solar panels and instead getting solar panels\u002Blot of scientific reports).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod seems to be better at other things (like quickly setting up new groups in flight; even though its interface seems a bit non-intuitive, but it just needs to get used to), so of all action group mods I\u0027m trying to use this one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-14T19:52:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/14/2014 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 14, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mystique\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-14T20:26:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@Mystique: To keep track of what action is bound to what action group is the reason the Current Actions window exists. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you press 1 (or whichever action key), all the actions shown in the Current Actions window for that group should execute.

My understanding is that everything defined for action group (I\u0027ll play with #6) stays with the group no matter what is in control. If someone has group 6 toggle an engine, clamp-o-tron release, or decoupler, and a station has group 6 set up for some lights... someone flipping a light switch on the station with that ship attached could be disastrous.
