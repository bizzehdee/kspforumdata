The launcher has a Mainsail fed by Jumbo-64 \u002B a white \u0022hockey puck\u0022 for the core, with radial Skippers mounted on Jumbo-64s for boosters, which all feed into the central tank during the first stages of the flight; it had no need for any fancy asparagus staging to put me in orbit, so I didn\u0027t set that up. The Munar Injection stage has a Poodle, and it has enough \u0022oomph\u0022 to get me to the Mun, circularize, and get a nice head start on the landing. The lander itself has an LVT-45 (which is probably overkill on the thrust for the Mun and Minmus and definitely less efficient than the LV-909, but I wasn\u0027t thinking about that at the time I designed it) and enough fuel to land, take off again, and get back to Kerbin. The LES isn\u0027t strictly necessary, but I like to add a dedicated abort system to my crewed vessels \u0022just in case.\u0022 (Efficiency experts might undoubtedly notice some other areas I could tweak this design to get it to perform better, but it works well enough to suit my purposes.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, the same principles apply as they would for any rocket. Make sure your initial engines can actually lift the ship off the pad. Try to front-load as much of the total weight as possible onto stages that drop early so that the later stages don\u0027t have as much to lift. The lighter your final payload, the smaller your total launcher can be... And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want to delve into the nuts and bolts so you don\u0027t have to purely rely on trial and error, I\u0027d highly advise learning how to calculate your rocket\u0027s performance statistics (delta-v capacity, thrust-to-weight ratio, etc.) yourself.
