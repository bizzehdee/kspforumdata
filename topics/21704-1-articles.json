And then saw people with tons of parts that did not come with the game I purchased. Are all of these custom mods people made? Ion Drives, Solar Panels, Moon Rovers, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan the Kerbals move between one ship and another?

Yes, a lot of people use mods that add new parts and features. I\u0027m not one of those people, I prefer legitimate, stock parts \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The Kerbals can most definitely move between ships. Simply use the EVA mode to get your Kerbals out and about in orbit or on the surface of a planet/moon. They can then go and board another ship, which is handy for rescue missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. With mods, I\u0027m pretty sure a Mun base can be expanded easily. As for just stock parts, send a couple of landers to a site of your choice \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. As far as I\u0027m aware, solar panels provide electrical energy for certain systems including ion engines, but you\u0027d have to check with someone who actually has a solar panel mod to be sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Not a clue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. There is no campaign/career mode yet, just sandbox. I suppose that\u0027s a good thing really, seeing as we\u0027ve only just got the planets and many of us are still trying to get there. I\u0027ve only managed Duna and its moon, Ike so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully you find this useful for the most part, and good luck in your future missions!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T18:40:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, so:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Career mode is not yet implemented\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-New parts are from mods (you should check them out!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If you hover over the picture of your kerbal and click EVA, your kerbal will come out of his ship.
