For some reason my computer doesn\\\u0027t realy like that plugin. Going to Minmus is pretty easy with the patch-conic system, although I am still learning the timing. I usualy make a quicksave when I\\\u0027m in Kerbin orbit, then when I think I\\\u0027m in a good position I make a transfer orbit till the conic system shows that I\\\u0027m going to reach Minmus\\\u0027s SOI. If it becomes obvious that I made an error about the transfer orbit and I will never reach Minmus\\\u0027s SOI I quickload and correct my error.
