I of course figure that the more thrust output it produces would mean faster fuel consumption, but is this always true, or does it depend specifically on the booster or engine itself?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-01T22:51:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I\u0027m gonna move this to Gameplay Questions And Tutorials. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhoo, you can get that by looking at the engine\u0027s ISP.

The reason for this is because as the efficiency of an engine doubles, the energy requirements quadruple, but the thrust only raises linearly.

The thrust:fuel-rate varies because engine efficiency varies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you can calculate it if you really want!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEngine Power = Isp * (Fuel / Seconds) * 0.052\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 0.052 is a factor I arrived at empirically.

For example, the LV-909 has a power of 50 and an Isp at sea level of 300.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s build a simple ship out of a Mk 1 command pod, FL-T100 fuel tank, and LV-909 engine. The FL-T100 has a total of 100 units of fuel (45 fuel and 55 oxidizer = 100 units total fuel mass - as of right now, there is no separate fuel and oxidizer tanks so you will always have the proper proportions available). We can plug these values in:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 = 300 * (100/t) * 0.052\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Et = 31.2 seconds\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo burning at full throttle, this rocket will burn for 31.2 seconds and use up all the fuel. Alternatively, you can plug in \u00221 second\u0022 for time and solve for the Fuel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E50 = 300 * (Fuel/1) * 0.052\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel = 3.21 Units/second\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that Isp is different for in-atmosphere and for in-vacuum, and will actually change as you ascend.
