So instead of going to the boring Mun i decided to stay on Kerbin and build the most ridiculous rockets that the engine could hold at the time.

My brother had told me about the game and I was skeptical (X-Plane user since 2001) but I wanted a spaceflight simulator badly. X-Plane kind of simulates space travel, but with some serious, serious caveats. It\u0027s coordinates aren\u0027t truly polar, so when your on orbit, you go straight, and then when you leave the map edge and it loads terrain the whole flight engine grinds to a halt, forces you down onto the new horizontal vector, and continues on. This results in orbits naturally degrading in random directions over time as floating-point errors build up in translation. All that was needed for me to give KSP a shot was Harvester talking about rebuilding Unity into a polar system so that orbital dynamics could run in their native equations - I was hooked before the download bar was done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Back in 2013 I had a map view, but when I bought the game and made rendezvous for the first time, all the calculations were by hand (no maneuver nodes.) When those two spaceships floated up next to each other, that was a marvelous moment, unequaled since in the thrill of discovery and the amount of effort I had put into it. So many things followed - landing on the moon, reenacting the Apollo missions at least a dozen times and so much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I love the latest version of KSP, especially career mode and am very excited for .24 but I miss the old tanks.
