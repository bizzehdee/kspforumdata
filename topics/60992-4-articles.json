As a first stage, if we left it up to the user to handle x/y balancing, the code would only need to manage up/down balancing. AFAIK you can tell the Z value of any given tank, so whether the Z position of a tank is above or below the desired CoM point should be all you really need to know - the code could pump from low to high and \u0022walk\u0022 the CoM onto target. If you did manage to achieve something like this, it would also be nice to be able to issue a \u0022High CoM\u0022 (Puts CoM as high above designated CoM as possible) / \u0022Low CoM\u0022 (Opposite) option.
