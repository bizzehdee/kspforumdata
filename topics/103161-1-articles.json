The first took my interest for a bit, but then the horrible FoV made me feel ill and I never played it again. HL2 just seemed a standard FPS. Mechanically sound, and I enjoyed throwing toilets around with the gravity gun but it just felt like a gimmick really. Nothing particularly special or memorable about it.

Portal 2 was very good, but maybe a bit bloated by comparison. And \u0022Still Alive\u0022 is indeed the superior ending song. Possibly my favourite song in video gaming.
