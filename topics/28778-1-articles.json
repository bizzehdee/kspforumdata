Any ship I\u0027ve had prior to .20 I\u0027ve not had too much problem getting the ship to rotate. Now, it takes a good two minutes to haul a ship around from pro to retrograde. Right now I have MechJeb trying to get into an orbit with nothing but a probe on an orange tank, and it just cannot rotate fast enough to catch the node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2nd\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat difference, besides labeling, does the SAS and ASAS have?

So I started reworking my lifter stage. I slapped on the Stayputnick on top of an SAS, ASAS, orange fuel tank, and the Mainsail. At launch, everything worked as I expected. Left it all up to Mechjeb to get me there to validate that the ship works. However, once it got into orbit, it was routinely missing nodes because it wasn\u0027t moving, or couldn\u0027t keep up. I thought it was electrical, so I slapped on some thermo-generators, but still ran into the same problem. Threw more SAS and ASAS at the problem and got not much more out of it, which led me here with my OP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I upgraded to what I thought looked bigger for a command point, and slapped 8 more on the end of my structures.
