They come into near contact with other atoms already in the room and are repelled away from one another creating an interferance pattern. The compostition of matter in the actual oxygen around the slits effects the individual photons. Everything has a mass including light and the photons create that pattern due to bouncing off other atoms. Maybe the equiptment used to observe the process actually interferes with the rotation and deflection of paticals making the photon behave like a wave... if this is true they have accidently discovered a way of altering a particals state!\u00C3\u00AF\u00C2\u00BB\u00C2\u00BF \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone dissprove me...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-05T05:31:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis appears to be an accidental post.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
