We have no news on 0.24 or anything beyond that; The ARM update has brought lots of new parts, mainly even BIGGER parts- Probodobodyne parts, based on NASA\u0027s design -the co-operated with KSP- have been added, ranging from huge engines to massive boosters. The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) is using \u0022The Klaw\u0022 that can attach to ANY object in the game- its used to redirect asteroids, detected in the Tracking Station, to where-ever you want. Major tweaks to the Science tree and a few other things- people, feel free to fill in the gaps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T12:39:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpgraded joint strenght \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Now you have actually try to build wobbly rockets \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-04T13:37:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sigma117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sigma117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ve been a bit lax on keeping up the ARM update.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sigma117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sigma117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor some reason the idea of it never quite grabbed me\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh the glorious puns!
