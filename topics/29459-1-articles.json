It\u0027s about 4500m/s to get to LKO.

The atmosphere is so thick it\u0027s ridiculous. And the almost double gravity makes it works. Overall you need 12000m/s of delta V to get in low Eve Orbit. Now, if you would use some mods like Kerbal Engineer you could easily know how much delta V is on your lander, but since you\u0027re a purist, you\u0027re gonna have to manually calculate it. I don\u0027t know the equations by heart but you can probs find them around the forums. As for tips to do it: Take it slow. Eve\u0027s atmosphere is five times thicker at sea level. Terminal velocity there is about 58 m/s, going up really slowly as you get up the atmosphere. And you might not want to start your gravity turn before 35ish km up. And do it very gently. Your best bet is aerospikes. Tons and tons of aerospikes. And a lot of staging tanks. You\u0027re gonna want to stage pretty much everything by the time you\u0027re in orbit. You\u0027re gonna need something in orbit you can dock to to get back to Kerbin, cause you\u0027re not gonna make it in one go. Just calculate your delta V correctly and you should be good. And make sure your TWR stays above 1.6/1.7. You\u0027re gonna have to calculate that too manually.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yuming","CreatedById":57851,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T11:41:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI recommend reading Brotoro\u0027s \u0022Exiting Eve\u0022 for an idea on the size and style of a lander you are going to need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.mindspring.com/~sportrocketry/ksp/exitingeve.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.mindspring.com/~sportrocketry/ksp/exitingeve.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T14:05:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you use the balloon mod, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/hooligan-labs-airship-parts-and-plugin/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/hooligan-labs-airship-parts-and-plugin/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit becomes far easier to get out, just a bit below 6.0000 m/s,\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"birrhan","CreatedById":62148,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-27T19:11:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022aleccim15\u0022 data-cite=\u0022aleccim15\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have tried so many times to get an orbit around Eve after a landing.
