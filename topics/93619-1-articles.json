That\u0027s an oversimplified example, but the point still stands, and who knows, maybe Porkjet purposefully made them the same shape so they would be compatible? I don\u0027t have B9 installed, so I don\u0027t actually know if they match up perfectly like you say, but I wouldn\u0027t be complaining. Also to repeat what Nertea said, Texturing is easily the hardest and most important thing when it comes to parts, creating the basic shape for a fuselage takes under a minute if you put some thought into it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell fine he spent time on retexting... but it did happen... *sigh* must I get a SCREENSHOT for you guys to believe this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso- I credit Squad for making what they have made.
