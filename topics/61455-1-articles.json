There are ways to get around it, and they usually involve lots of trick techniques and clipping. The best simple thing you can do stock is to build the ascent stage first, and then build the descent stage as four radial boosters attached to the ascent stage (if you use a 2.5m lander can with a 1.25m ascent stage, it looks pretty decent). For a good example, go look at the stock two stage lander. I myself haven\u0027t done it but seeing the request, I\u0027ll try to build an example. In the meanwhile, I suggest lurking on over to the spacecraft exchange and looking at some of the apollo style replicas there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Speeding Mullet","CreatedById":62635,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T03:54:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^ An example of what Captain Sierra is talking about would be this, which is a very basic Apollo style mission, with radial boosters on a two stage lander, with a little bit of part clipping thrown in as an introduction:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s297.photobucket.com/user/Speeding_Mullet/media/screenshot104_zps4612876e.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i297.photobucket.com/albums/mm214/Speeding_Mullet/screenshot104_zps4612876e.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot104_zps4612876e.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T03:59:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually no, that\u0027s not at all what I was talking about.
