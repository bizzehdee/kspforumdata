If I use the inline docking port and attach any other docking port of the same size (which is open if it has a shutter) anywhere on the vessel, I get spams of null ref errors at launch. I did a little digging and I think its due to the fact that the inline docking port is missing the node transform with the name \u0022dockingNode\u0022. I also noticed that if only the inline docking port is attached to a vessel and another docking port of the same size comes within around 200m of the inline port, the null ref errors start. If the stock inline docking port is used, the above does not happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to recreate this issue is to build a vessel like the one in the screen shot and launch it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an amazing addition to KSP and wish many of these parts were stock!
