Possible?","CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:31:21Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:31:21Z","Content":"So here\u0027s an odd question (I suppose).\n\nIs it possible to make parts that are functional in-game, but not selectable in the VAB/SPH? Particularly in existing saves? (which negates just placing them in an expensive tech-tree node, which also isn\u0027t a solution for sandbox games).\n\nThe reason I\u0027m asking, is that I\u0027m making a save-breaking update for Fuel Tanks Plus. It would be fantastic if it would be possible to make the old part IDs still function for existing vessels (with the old stats and everything), but have only the new part IDs be selectable in the menus. \n\nSpecifically, the mod is taking all fuel tanks of the same sizes, and consolidating them into single parts that will use a tweakable to select the color, instead of having them in the menus as separate parts.\n\nShort of having a plugin that can translate the part ID\u0027s and remap then to equivalent parts, I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s a way to get around this.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T21:08:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones**"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:38:04Z","Content":"In the CFG files for the obsolete parts, set category = -1"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T02:37:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In the CFG files for the obsolete parts, set category = -1\n\nAwesome.
