Particularly in existing saves? (which negates just placing them in an expensive tech-tree node, which also isn\u0027t a solution for sandbox games).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I\u0027m asking, is that I\u0027m making a save-breaking update for Fuel Tanks Plus. It would be fantastic if it would be possible to make the old part IDs still function for existing vessels (with the old stats and everything), but have only the new part IDs be selectable in the menus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpecifically, the mod is taking all fuel tanks of the same sizes, and consolidating them into single parts that will use a tweakable to select the color, instead of having them in the menus as separate parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShort of having a plugin that can translate the part ID\u0027s and remap then to equivalent parts, I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s a way to get around this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-26T21:08:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/26/2015 09:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the CFG files for the obsolete parts, set category = -1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T02:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sumghai\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sumghai\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn the CFG files for the obsolete parts, set category = -1\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAwesome.
