There\u0027s obviously something I do not understand here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, my problem is NOT achieving rendezvous. That\u0027s both boring (playing catchup across several orbits) and fraught (final approach with RCS jets), but I can do that. What I CANNOT do, for the life of me, is get the flippin\u0027 docking ports to DOCK. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStory time: I have flown two \u0022docked\u0022 ships with the docking ports bumped up against each other, (apparently) totally motionless--after I saw a sudden shift in position that sure looked to me like the magnetic catches had grabbed each other. However, the two vehicles continued to act like, well, like two vehicles--I could not command the parts of Ship A while acting as Ship B, I could not transfer fuel from one to the other (or possibly, \u0022I could not figure out HOW TO\u0022), and over time the two ships slowly drifted *sideways* in the plane of the docking ports, until they detached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I decided to try the quicker and simpler method of doing it on the ground. Build rover with docking port, target to dock it to. Launch rover, drive off launchpad, launch target. Do some rather touchy driving around on the pad to get things aligned without driving over the edge. Eventually get it all lined up, sllooooowwwwly roll the rover\u0027s docking port up to the target\u0027s, and ... *bounce off*. (This was doubly disappointing, as this \u0027rover with docking port\u0027 project had given me all kinds of cool ideas for a refueling station on Minmus, with tanker-truck rovers transferring fuel between storage tanks and visiting vehicles getting topped off before heading out into interplanetary space...and that\u0027s not gonna work if I can\u0027t use docking ports as fuel-transfer pumps....)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am at my wit\u0027s end, here. It seems to me as though there is some simple-and-obvious user-interface thing I am missing. Is there some command I need to issue to the docking port itself to tell it \u0022power up, I need you now\u0022, or \u0022clamp down NOW\u0022? Can someone walk me through all the steps (i.e., keystrokes) involved in just getting the dang ports to ATTACH to each other...??\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-28T07:55:27Z\u0022 title=\u002206/28/2014 07:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 28, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Srpadget\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-07T01:41:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat mods are you using?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else you are saying sounds on the right track.

When you get near enough to see it, right click on the port and select \u0022set as target\u0022. Also, try turning off SAS and RCS. They work against the magnetic attraction of the docking ports unless they\u0027re perfectly aligned. Lastly, the difficult in making the connection is proportional to the mass of your ships.
