As an example, if the orbit time is 4 hours, I would burn a new orbit that takes 5 hours; if the original is 6 hours, I would burn a new orbit that takes 7.5 hours, and so on. (Don\u0027t circulize this orbit, it will end up sort of egg shaped with the periapsis lying along the orbit you want)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, I release a probe just before what ends up being the periapsis and have the probe circulize it\u0027s orbit which brings it\u0027s orbit time back down to the original amount (4 or 5 hours in this example). Then as my main ship moves through its longer orbit, I release another probe when it returns to the periapsis and follow the same steps. When done, I end up with four probes each spaced 1/4 of the whole orbit from one another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: This will work for any circular orbit.

Then from your second sat, click the first one in the map view and choose \u0027set as target\u0027. Next, set up a maneuver node to raise your apoapsis to the geosync orbit. You will now get two markers that show the location of both satellites at closest approach.

The eyeball part is the fact that the initial burn is directly over where you want to be in KEO, such as directly over KSC. This is less efficient than a two burn Hohmann transfer, but in practice, only by a small amount (40 m/s delta-v).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t necessarily recommend this method, particularly if setting up a multi-spacecraft constellation. Like I said, I\u0027m just doing this for kicks. I like equations as much as I like explosions. I just figured some people might like a method which is easy to eyeball. As a warning, I haven\u0027t fired up KSP yet to test this out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe method is the following:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) From circular LKO, perform burn 1 to raise your apoapsis to some radius r1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Orbit an odd number of half orbits, ending up at apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Burn 2 brings the periapsis up to KEO altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Orbit an odd number of half orbits, ending up directly above your original maneuver location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Circularize into KEO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 3 free parameters here to play with: the number of complete orbits before the final half orbits in steps 2 and 4 above, and the number of times Kerbin rotates during the process. Call those integers n, m, and l, respectively. Picking n, m and l, you can solve for r1, the apoapsis for your initial burn, to make sure you end up back over your starting location. Basically, solve for the value of r1 such that the time for (n\u002B1/2) orbits in the initial transfer orbit plus the time for (m\u002B1/2) orbits in the second transfer orbit equals the l times the orbital period of Kerbin, so that Kerbin has rotated an integer number of times by the time you get to KEO after also orbiting Kerbin an integer number of times (n\u002Bm\u002B1).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBegin in a circular orbit at altitude 80.000 km above Kerbin sea level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerform the first maneuver directly over the location you wish to be in KEO above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn delta-v1 of 622.94 m/s to raise your apoapsis to 2312.348 km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit 1 and a half times to apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn delta-v2 = 470.65 m/s at apoapsis to raise the periapsis up to KEO altitude of 2868.741 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrbit 0 and a half times to apoapsis directly over your target location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBurn delta-v3 = 44.99 m/s at apoapsis to create a circular orbit with period 21599.912 seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal cost: 1138.58 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEquivalent 2-burn Hohmann transfer cost = 1099.34 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my matlab code if anyone wants to play with it.

Here the basic premise is to have satellites on widely spaced, highly eccentric orbits and operate under the statistical average that \u0027one of them\u0027 will be high in the sky \u0027somewhere\u0027 over KSC at any given time. The more eccentric the orbits, the less likely it is that \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E of them will simultaneously be found at periapsis and unreachable, and the more likely they are to be contactable from the ground. A handful of pseudo-random elliptical orbits generally provides coverage that is so close to being perfect that you don\u0027t worry about it - and you don\u0027t have to deal with orbital drift. At an extreme, go polar, and put the AP somewhere between Mun and Minmus, and the PE at 71km.
