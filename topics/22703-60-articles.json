I\u0027ll explain better here - \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a landing gear glitch that the Eagle has. I\u0027m not sure what it is. But it does make the gear \u0022spaz\u0022 out. Sometimes to the point of breaking something on the ship if you let it go on too long. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick is to \u0022cycle\u0022 the gear. By that I mean, you\u0027ve got to raise them up then lower them again. 99.99% of the time this clears the bug and makes them stable. When I launch, I simply do so quickly and get into a stable hover and then raise/lower the gear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to do this would be to launch initially with the Eagle attached to a launch clamp suspended above the ground just a little bit. Then you could cycle the gear at your leisure and then release the clamp and drop the Eagle down. Obviously you want to set this up so that the Eagle is not clamped too far above the ground. The Eagle\u0027s landing gear is pretty robust. But the cockpit and the rear engines won\u0027t take a lot of abuse, and if you drop hard enough, you\u0027ll clip something besides the gear (usually the engines) into the ground and break it. I suggest setting this up in the SPH so that the Eagle appears to be hanging just off the hanger floor. Say - just enough for the Hanger Kerbals to walk underneath without clipping their heads into it? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - this landing gear bug will \u0022reset\u0022 after a time. When coming in to land after any flight - always cycle the gear once before you set down. I usually try to remember to do this at about the 1000 meter mark as I\u0027m descending. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m on the subject - Another issue with the gear that I personally have - I do wish Devo had made the gear at full extension a little longer. Not only would it make the Eagle more like the source material, but it would allow more forgiveness in landings so that you didn\u0027t have to be super careful not to bang the rear engines or the bottom of the cockpit pod into something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso - I kind of wish that there was a way to set a \u0022stop\u0022 on the retraction so that they did not retract all the way. But only retracted down to the level of the VTOL engine bells. That way when the gear is retracted, it still is supporting the Eagle rather than forcing it to rest on the VTOL engines. That way you could \u0022crouch\u0022 the Eagle to pick up a pod without the worry that you might break something - especially if the ground isn\u0027t perfectly level. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese issues are less a problem on low gravity worlds. Really - when you get an Eagle to the Mun, it\u0027s in it\u0027s most natural environment and many of the above issues aren\u0027t nearly so much of a problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich makes me wonder if maybe part of the problem might be the \u0022springiness\u0022 of the gear? Maybe there needs to be less of a shock absorber effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-01T07:27:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DigitalProeliator\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DigitalProeliator\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou where right on the money.

Most of your stuff still works in .22 Sandbox mode as-is. The models are mostly fine. Other than placing everything along the tech tree, there\u0027s only a handful of minor issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- One is that you made a great set of wheels. But when they break, Kerbals can\u0027t repair them unlike stock wheels.\u003C/strong\u003E They\u0027re broken permanently. Two ways to address that I can think of: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make the breaking force so high that they just never break\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Make the wheels repairable by finding the appropriate bit of code. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the latter I tried looking in the Part CFG that squad uses for its rover wheels and I don\u0027t see anything useful that I recognize. Is it the actual model.mu files? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe newly re-sized PX Shuttles are fantastic and fly great. Especially so once you fix the issues with the reaction wheels in the cockpits and SAS units. I just have some questions/observations: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- 50 Power on the linear RCS?\u003C/strong\u003E Really? I\u0027ve experimented by replacing all those units with standard RCS ports - but just used more of them and placed all over the ship rather than on just the nose. It seemed to work okay. If a bit sluggish. Using the Eagle RCS pods was a better compromise (16 Power) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve run into some problems in trying to place/attach payloads in the dorsal mounted cargo areas. To be fair - this is a problem I\u0027ve also had with B9, LLL, and anything else that is bounded on 5 out of 6 sides. It\u0027s just that these cargo pods are really DEEP. That\u0027s both a plus and a minus. If you ever get the urge to re-visit those designs, just a suggestion: maybe look at modeling a payload module frame that someone could attach their payload to, and then that could be placed in the bay? Just a thought. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I kinda have similar issues with the WT-51, but there it\u0027s mitigated by the fact that it\u0027s SO FREAKING HUGE that it\u0027s easier to muck about with the camera view inside and get what I want.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- The Ventral cargo module\u003C/strong\u003E with the \u0022Thunderbird 2\u0022 style loading pallet works just fine except for one thing: It\u0027s nearly impossible to drive any rover up onto the platform. This was not a problem on the old PX. But with the scale up of the PX as a whole, the sides of the platform on these pods became too much for normal rovers to scale. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to illustrate my point: On the old PX it was possible for a Kerbal to make a jump and get themselves up on that platform. On the new PX? The upper lip of that platform is ABOVE THEIR HELMET. The only way they are getting up on that thing is on a low g world and using their RCS pack! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to make that platform skinnier or re-model it so that it has sloping sides so that stuff can drive (or Kerbals can walk) up onto it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- The Rotating engines on the PX work great. But -\u003C/strong\u003E The front ones in the example models might need to be moved slightly. They are pointed at the leading edges of the wings in horizontal flight. I\u0027ve gotten around this issue by dividing the action groups up so that I can keep all the rear engines on and turn off the front ones. I\u0027ve also experimented with changing the position of the front engines a little. But I often don\u0027t like the balance when I do that. All in all, I don\u0027t think the PX Shuttle NEEDS those front pivoting engines. I\u0027m doing some experimenting currently with a combination of the static VTOL engines up front and keeping the rear swivel mounts. This is less an issue with anything you need to do with redesigning the parts really. I just thought I\u0027d point that out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E- What\u0027s a more serious issue is that the PX Shuttles have this weird tendency to lose their airbrakes.\u003C/strong\u003E I don\u0027t know WHAT is up with this. But it seems I cannot keep an airbrake in its mount through an entire flight! Somewhere along the line the suckers break every time and then come floating out of their mounts once orbit is reached. Or maybe they weren\u0027t ever actually attached right in the first place? No idea! Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Cstrong\u003EWARNING:\u003C/strong\u003E The following is \u0022nit-picking\u0022. None of the following points change the fact that the Eagle VTOL engines are AWESOME in their effectiveness and utility. I\u0027m just indulging in some petty \u0022pet peeves\u0022.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother minor issue is the placement nodes for the Eagle VTOL engines. They work fine for the Eagles. They work... less fine for everything else. Why is the attachment point SO FAR off from where the actual engine is? Why can\u0027t they just be centered on the middle of the engine? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill on the subject of the VTOL model. Is there any chance you could change the texture? The bells look like unfinished pig iron that was beaten into shape with a ball-peen hammer. I LOVED the smooth look of the engine bells you created for the main rear engines. It would be great if the VTOL engines looked as nice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd - to combine thoughts from the previous two points: If you did both of the above, could you maybe just get rid of the wide circular base of the things altogether? There\u0027s nothing like that in the source material. And if the model were slimmed down to JUST the engines and if you could place them more precisely in smaller places for some really creative uses and they\u0027d look fantastic!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhem. As I said. Nit-picking. Don\u0027t think I don\u0027t still love the things. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_happy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022^_^\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOn the WT-51, everything works right with one glaring exception:\u003C/strong\u003E The doors on the cockpit pod are broken. They won\u0027t close. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong there but I figured you needed the heads up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Aliens Dropship.\u003C/strong\u003E Well that\u0027s going to need some work obviously. A lot. That\u0027s probably the one that has the most issues. Reaction wheels, RCS balance. Fixing the rotating engines etc etc. And the APC... er... just doesn\u0027t work. At all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne useful thing I can think that might make an interesting change if you want to implement it: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that \u0022Damned Robotics\u0022 has been changed to Infernal Robotics and has been updated and works right. You can update the Dropship engines as you did for the PX shuttle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT - what about doing something similar for the WT-51? This idea was sparked by the fact that you used the same model (just scaled down) for the Dropship engines (probably as a \u0022temp place-holder\u0022). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMake the main VTOL Thrusters on the WT-51 have rotaters like the PX shuttle and the Dropship? \u003C/strong\u003EThat way you could really get the power of those engines into a ground to orbit flight profile without having to tilt the entire ship 80-90 degrees! How about it? Is it a good idea? If you do - I do suggest keeping the STATIC engines in the pack.
