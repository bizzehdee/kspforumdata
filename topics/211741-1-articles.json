One idea I have is\u00A0to shine a colored light in front of the camera. The light will be about 3-4 inches away from the nearest pole, and the second-nearest pole will be about 2.5 feet away. This light will hopefully cause the pole to different than other of those yellow poles.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy first question is, what color of light do you suggest I choose in order to get the illuminated pole to stick out against the other poles? There may be red and/or blue objects in the distance, but I can crop those out. The second question is, where can I find LEDs of the appropriate color and brightness that don\u0027t need any more than 5 volts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-01-29T00:16:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndigikey, mouser, ebay. pretty much everywhere. there are units available that are so bright they require active water cooling. wavelengths available are wide, though some are less bright if you need specific wavelengths, the big ones are intended for lighting and projection applications and are usually white (though ultra bright red, green and blue are probibly available for dlp projectors). my personal favorites are uv leds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-29T00:20:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2023 12:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
