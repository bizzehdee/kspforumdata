I have a weird issue and I hope that you can help me\n\nI have installed KER (KerbalEngineer-1.0.16.6). Everything works fine, except in career mode. If I\u0027m in the vehicle assembly building I see KER interface and works fine (shows normal and compact mode, delta-v, everything)\n\nWhen I build a ship and click in launch button, I see KER button but it doesnt work. No HUD, anything is shown, just the KER button like grayed out and not working\n\nBut it works fine in science mode and sandbox mode perfect. I also have tried to create a new career mode, but error is the same\n\nDo you have any clue to solve this weird issue?? ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nafter testing, I realized that if I use kerbal enginieering system or ER-7500computer flight unit in the vessel it works fine, as usual\n\nI don\u0027t understand why it has to be used in career mode and not in the others.\n\nWell, at least I found a solution, hope it helps to someone like me ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T15:39:09Z","Content":"The default behavior is to require a KER module or an engineer kerbal in career mode for inflight data; both of these can be disabled in the settings in the VAB."},{"CreatedByName":"sinpro","CreatedById":119813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T17:02:33Z","Content":"thank you for the info"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T17:15:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The default behavior is to require a KER module or an engineer kerbal in career mode for inflight data; both of these can be disabled in the settings in the VAB.\n\nA level 3 tracking station will also enable it in flight for all vessels.
