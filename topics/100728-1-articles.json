Some of them are global maps, and some are smaller regions. I also have some photographs from space missions, several prints that were made of Lunar Orbiter V images when they were new, and the same for other planets and moons. \n\nSome of it is fairly generic, in that it is only a copy of a book or map or photo.

On several occasions I was lucky enough to work with some educational packs that NASA issue that contain samples of moon rocks, including thin sections for examining with a petrological microscope. For those of you who don\u0027t know, thin sections are slices of rock cut to a thickness of 30 microns so the crystals become largely transparent. By using cross polarised light (which produces vivid colours) they can be examined in detail to determine their mineralogy. I took photos of the thin sections through the microscope and here are some of them:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  Apollo 16 anorthosite \n\u003E \n\u003E ![ncjukh.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/ncjukh.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Apollo 12 basalt:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![16bh7at.jpg](http://i61.tinypic.com/16bh7at.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Apollo 17 coarse grained basalt/gabbro:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![r0pf7n.jpg](http://i57.tinypic.com/r0pf7n.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Micro breccias in regolith.
