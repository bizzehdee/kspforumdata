Sometimes these realisations are simple and other times it\u0027s absolutly brilliant. Sometimes you found out you\u0027ve been doing things the wrong way, other times you\u0027d noticed slight changes to enhance your launches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets share them!

When burning into a high orbit, I do not do the make an AP above the atmosphere and burn from there to circularize. When I need to get a satellite into lets say a geostationary orbit. I keep burning when my AP is way above the atmosphere, I keep the pitch of the ship at 0. This way I\u0027m burning radially and raising my PE (and lowering my eccentricity). When the PE hits about 20-25 KM. That\u0027s when I cut the engines of. This way I utilized my fuel as efficient as possible. (And I do not have to restart my engines, which is no problem in KSP but can be in real life).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second trick I found out is a cheaper and faster way to get to Minmus. Because Minmus is in an inclined orbit of about 6 degrees you\u0027ll have to do an inclination burn to make up for the difference. Off course you could wait for a window when Minmus is on the equator at the time of arrival. But it dawned me that 2 times a day the Kerbal space centre is on the Ascending or Descending node of Minmus orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I just timeshift till KSC is directly underneath the path of Minmus and launch in a heading that makes up for the tilt of Minmus (either 96 or 84 degrees). This way I don\u0027t have to do an inclination burn and can fly straight to it as if it where the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IndigoCypher00","CreatedById":75029,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T01:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERealizing that interplanetary transfers can work the same way as orbital rendezvous\u0027 was HUGE for me.

Not alone here, but I figured out a transfer that works really well for reaching targets in an inclined orbit, especially since you can meet it at the Ascending or Descending node. I call it a \u0022timed transfer\u0022 since you set a location first, then adjust your arrival time to coincide with the target. Basically you set your Ap (or Pe if going down), to intersect with the target. Then adjust the Pe height to set your arrival back at Ap to rendezvous.
