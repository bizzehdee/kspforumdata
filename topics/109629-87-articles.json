Keep up the good work.\n\nLike Mike said, it would be constant releases still. Although I may know some programming, having it automatically update from online as a new update comes out is rather complicated. Considering the amount of updates and the amount of people going to download this. There is no way on this earth my computer or Mikes could handle all the internet traffic. We\u0027d need to purchase server space and bandwidth with a company. Best thing we can do is come up with increment downloads with the installer of parts that work and run with that. Maybe update the installer every few months. The rest of the time would probably still be chaotic updates via the forum and dropbox."}]}
