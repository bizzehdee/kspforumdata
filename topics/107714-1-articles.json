This is a basic tutorial with just text for now, pictures to follow if I think of it later or something needs clarity. It also ignores how to go and get the results because earlier tutorials from past versions still cover that part in fine detail.\n\nFirst, some terms as I\u0027m using them. \n\n- **Science** is the blue currency you spend in the R\u0026D building to unlock the tech tree.\n- **Data** is the raw material used to make science in the lab.\n- **Experiments** are the physical science parts themselves.\n- **Results** are the part you can take out of the experiment with a Kerbal and move around from pod to pod.\n\n**How the lab works (now)**\n\nAt the most basic level, the lab analyses a result, makes data from it, and converts data into stored science over time (even when not on the focused vessel). At the command of the player, it will take its stored science and transmit it back to Kerbin and into your science bank account. Generating data from a result does not destroy the result, once a lab has made data from a result that result can be used in other ways. It can be returned to Kerbin for the full payout or transmitted for a fraction, just like before. The transmission bonus for processing in the lab is gone now, replaced by this new system.\n\nA lab can still be used to reset the goo and science jr. experiments as before, but now a scientist on EVA can do that job so it\u0027s mostly a matter of convenience. A lab needs to be manned by two scientist kerbals, and their levels affect its efficiency and yield, so level them up any way you can. They will not level up from doing their work in the lab, you need to take them places to grow their levels.\n\nA lab can produce data from one unique result exactly once, but it\u0027s tracked per-lab. Meaning, you can take the results from one goo canister, transfer it to a lab, process it for data, then transfer it to another lab and process it for more data, but you can\u0027t take a second goo measurement (or crew report or surface sample or whichever) from the same biome and altitude and get more data in the same lab. The amount of data you get from an experiment is determined by where the lab is when you process the result. There\u0027s a bonus for being on or around the same body as the result is from, and being landed is more valuable than being in orbit (this is reversed on Kerbin, a landed lab there yields almost no data). The data yields scale with the raw science payout from the result, so surface samples are big and crew reports are small. Also remember, a lab can get full data from a result even if it\u0027s been returned to Kerbin and all its direct science yield is depleted. Doesn\u0027t matter what the blue bar says, if this particular lab hasn\u0027t seen it it\u0027s valuable!\n\nA lab can only hold 500 data in reserve. If you have extra results and try to process them, it will refuse if it can\u0027t hold the data. The lab can hold an arbitrary number of stored results just like any manned part, so you can hold onto results for the future without processing them. When the lab is processing or researching it consumes a lot of power and converts data to science in a 5:1 ratio. The rate of conversion is based on how much data is in storage so it falls off over time. A lab with full data and two one-star scientists yields about 1 science every 4 days. When the lab\u0027s science buffer is full work stops. You must switch to the vessel with the lab and manually transmit the stored science to resume work.\n\n**Some important things to note**\n\n- The kerbals in the lab must both be scientists. Their level matters. Other scientists on the same vessel will also contribute.\n- The lab draws a lot of power. Load up on solar panels and batteries.\n- You can still return experiments after the lab has analysed them, so make it a point to get all your results into labs if you can.\n- The stored science in a lab has to be transmitted, returning and recovering a lab does nothing, so you need to have an antenna on a lab vessel.\n- Check on your science bases periodically since they need to transmit manually. Smart use of renaming vessels and assigning categories can make this easier, if you\u0027re doing this aggressively you might have a lot of stations and bases.\n- The Mun has a long night, so expect your solar-powered science base to be shut down half the time. It doesn\u0027t need to be on to produce science in your absence but it needs to be on to transmit. It might be worth it to fill the lab with data on the ground for the bonus but then let it do its work in orbit.\n- Being on the surface or on a more distant body increases data yields so the lab\u0027s data buffer will fill up sooner, but it still takes the same amount of time to process it into science no matter where it\u0027s located.\n- The science per day is determined by how much data is stored, so it slows down over time to a trickle. Keep the lab topped up with data to keep the yield high.\n- Some contracts will pay you to put lab-bearing stations in various places, so don\u0027t waste the opportunity if someone else is willing to foot the bill. If they ask for a station in orbit of Kerbin, put on some extra delta-V, complete the contract for the payout then fly it to Minmus or Munar orbit (or land it, if it\u0027s really overbuilt).\n- Do the rescue contracts, getting enough scientists to fill out the bases can get expensive if you pay for all the hiring but if you aggressively recruit via rescue you get about a third scientists, and they gain a full star of XP in the process of being rescued.\n- Remember that the lab isn\u0027t a command pod, so you can\u0027t do anything without a command pod (with a third kerbal in it) or probe core (and then you can\u0027t do anything when the power runs out.)\n- EVA reports in orbit are biome-specific when almost nothing else is, so an easy source of early-mid-game data is to pop one of the scientists out for EVA reports from the ladder as your station orbits Kerbin. You can transmit those for full science afterwards.\n- Don\u0027t put two labs on one vessel, it doesn\u0027t work the way you expect. You can have two parked near each other, just not docked.\n- Labs are still useful after the tech tree is fully unlocked because your administrators can convert science income into funds and reputation. High-end parts are pricey and everyone needs a little PR once in a while.\n\nI\u0027ll add to this as I learn more.

I used to run a research lab irl. Multiple labs working on the same problem, each with slightly different approaches is a good thing. The second lab working on one problem might even get a slight boost, reflecting the competition/synergy that happens between labs. 3 or 4 labs working on the same problem should still produce a pretty high return, but after that it should drop off considerably.
