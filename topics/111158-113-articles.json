The users we think are the best choices are invited to become a moderator.\n\nWe do look for users with clean infraction histories.

I don\u0027t just mean \u0022avoid malicious people\u0022 (though obviously a \u0022rogue\u0022 moderator would be a Very Bad Thing)-- it also calls for a variety of qualities.  Long-standing and frequent participation in the forums (we want someone who will stick around, and who\u0027s around enough to be able to do the job).  A wealth of evidence showing that they\u0027re dedicated to helping people.  Great communicator.
