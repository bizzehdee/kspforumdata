He didn\u2019t name any specific threats, but his comments come among recent concerns that there is a \u201Cbubble\u201D of investment in technology firms in general that could soon burst.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe counsel all of our companies in this sector to brace themselves for the potential for that,\u201D he said. \u201CYou read about these private space companies doing big rounds, but they\u2019re probably not spending a lot of that capital. They\u2019re storing it away for the potential of winter.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now, however, there\u2019s little sign of a slowdown in space investment. A report published earlier this year by The Tauri Group concluded that there was a record $2.3 billion invested in space companies in 2015. Of that total, $1.8 billion was venture capital funding, more than the previous 15 years combined.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s also growing interest among so-called \u201Cangel\u201D investors, individuals who often provide the initial funding for startup companies. Chad Anderson, managing director of Space Angels Network, a group of angel investors, said his group\u2019s membership has grown from about 20 people in 2012 to more than 160 today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose members are continuing to invest in space companies. \u201CIt shows no signs of slowing,\u201D he said. \u201CThe data we\u2019ve seen so far in the first quarter is already outpacing 2015.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a slowdown, however, at the opposite end of the investment spectrum, among those companies that are going public. Chris Quilty, senior vice president of Raymond James and Associates, said that only seven companies have gone public in the U.S. market overall this year to date.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThe picture is not so great,\u201D he said, adding that 71 percent of the companies that went public in 2015 are currently trading at below their initial price. \u201CWhat we\u2019re seeing is a pretty strong downturn.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDespite his cautionary note about the future, Porteous remained optimistic about investment in space companies. RRE Ventures has invested in several, including Accion Systems, Spaceflight Industries and Spire. He felt there was still significant growth possible in space investment, thanks to developments ranging from improvements in space access to the use of open standards in the design of spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMarkets generally break later and faster than you think they\u2019re going to,\u201D he said. \u201CWe tend to overestimate how soon things are going to happen, and then when it happens, it tends to happen faster.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently investment in space is growing rapidly, but only in startups.
