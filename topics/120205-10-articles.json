P-47 maybe?). For the Brits, the Spitfires are turn fighters, but Hurricans and Typhoons are more biased towards energy fighting like the Americans. Also, I think they list some altitude stats don\u0027t they? A lot of the earlier American planes for example are complete and utter garbage at any significant altitude if I remember correctly, and I think some of the British planes have the same issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep in mind, if you are playing arcade mode...none of this really matters. The flight models in arcade are so washy washy that basically everything except the non Beaufighter attack planes can do anything. By that I mean that energy fighting (BnZ) is basically impossible in arcade, because things like the zeros and spitfires can just stand on WEP and they\u0027ll basically accelerate to match you in seconds. By the same token, you can totally out dogfight a spitfire in a P40, or fly circles around one in an F2A. I don\u0027t know which mode you are in though. If you get shot down every time you engage a plane, that sounds like realistic, and that is expected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a thought, if you are playing without mouse controls, particularly in realistic mode, take a plane out in arcade mode with mouse controls on and pay attention to how the computer flies for you. Turning a fighter using only the ailerons and elevators is wrong. You \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E use the rudder as well, or you\u0027ll scrub speed in your turns, which is bad for all combat styles. If you go in the cockpit on any plane with a slip indicator, it\u0027s really easy to compensate; you simply turn the rudder to zero out the slip indicator (I think most of these planes have that indicator. It\u0027s honestly been so long I can\u0027t remember if I just had to wing it). Also, never make a level turn in a dogfight. It\u0027s harder to explain without pictures, but basically you can execute a tight turn by flying up for the first half of the turn, and then going back down through the second half to end up at the same altitude. It\u0027s sort of the flying equivalent of banked turns on a race track. I think they have a wiki with a bunch of maneuvers on it. Some of them are extremely useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-28T20:39:27Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2016 08:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Randox\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"V7 Aerospace","CreatedById":156062,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-03T10:54:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222733663\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022120205\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472416683\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002218034\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Randox\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 28 August 2016 at 9:38 PM, Randox said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EIf you get shot down every time you engage a plane, that sounds like realistic, and that is expected.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I\u0027d disagree with that claim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you can get shot down in your first engagement, but it shouldn\u0027t be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexpected\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm not the best pilot, and I often find myself making rookie mistakes, but I like to fly by these words: \u0022Speed is life, altitude is life insurance\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, having the altitude advantage over your opponent means you have a much higher chance of coming out on top. While you are above the opponent, you are the one who controls the dogfight. Also, if you look after altitude, speed normally looks after itself (Unless you enter the dogfight finishing your climb, in which case you\u0027ll normally be slower than the enemy). Sometimes the enemy will be too eager, and stall climb up to you, this is the perfect opportunity, but be aware, they\u00A0will be able to get some good shots towards you, and it is your responsibility not to get hit. After\u00A0this, the enemy will begin to stall, and when this happens, go in for the kill.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are a turn-fighter and find yourself being dived upon, pull a corkscrew manuever, or something similar. As the enemy is going much faster than you, they\u00A0will not be able to turn as well, and won\u0027t be able to follow you, at this point they\u00A0will probably overtake you, giving you a small chance to shoot them\u00A0down as they\u00A0pass\u00A0by. Keep in mind that corkscrew manuevers are more effective in a plane with good roll rate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese, plus a plethora of different manuevers, tactics, and play styles, will give you the edge in RB, I learnt these things by watching people play WT on YouTube, such as PhlyDaily, or even the WT official channel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe in-game encyclopaedia is also a great source of information, so I recommend\u00A0that everyone checks it out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, I\u0027ll be back later with some nice screenshots \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-03T11:03:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2016 11:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by V7 Aerospace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randox","CreatedById":18034,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-04T17:10:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222740464\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022120205\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221472900082\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022156062\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022V7 Aerospace\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/3/2016 at 7:54 AM, V7 Aerospace said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I\u0027d disagree with that claim.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course you can get shot down in your first engagement, but it shouldn\u0027t be\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eexpected\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s fair, and I should have qualified that better.
