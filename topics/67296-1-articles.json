If mars ain\u0027t habitable for us right now, Same for martians they are organics like us, Only advanced but so would we be advanced. And hey gliese 586 i think thats the number is a galaxy trillions of years away and top that, in light distances... count this: 10000000000000000000000000000000000000 Years away, So i think the martians would think about tunin their spaceships before coming that long... And while were on the topic is gliese 586 that star system that was said to have been a past homeworld to aliens or is that some other star sytem? I thought there was a planet in there that was said to be a past world to aliens?
