I should introduce myself accordingly in the correct section...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going straight to the issue: I\u0027m having problems with the \u0022save X kerbal and recover X scrap on kerbin\u0022 missions. The AGU is definitely not attaching to the object to be recovered. It works with other parts or ships.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe king of thing that frustrates me most of this game is rework, so the game kind of teaches you to rethink objectives and designs so you don\u0027t have to load previous saves often.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve made an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E with a cargo bay and a movable grabbing unit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m quite new but I have 239 hours on steam plus hours and hours of youtube (including Scott Manley) videos.

Arming and disarming the Arm.

You may have just gotten lucky in the past. For a klaw to grab something, the klaw has to touch the surface at close to\u00A090 degrees. A klaw can grab anything except a wheel. So I guarantee that it can grab the pod that contains your rescue kerbal. If the pod has a flat surface on it, try grabbing it right there. If it\u0027s spinning, you can turn on a little bit of timewarp and then turn timewarp off again -- that always cancels all spin. It\u0027s harder to grab a curved surface, because it\u0027s much harder to touch it at 90 degrees -- but it can be done if you have patience and try many times. You do not have to jump between ships. I think you have to rearm the klaw between each successful grab and the next one, but you only have to do it once.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaking your approach so that you touch at 90 degrees is just generally difficult. It is necessary to quickly memorize which keys move the klaw in which direction. It is usually necessary to move the camera around a lot so that you can see the approach from several directions. It is often necessary to start your approaching craft rotating slowly, and time it so that at the moment the klaw touches it happens to be as close to 90 degrees as you can judge by eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-13T23:24:44Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2018 11:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by bewing\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-13T23:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen where the missions would spawn parts that simply couldn\u0027t be grabbed... like wheels.\u00A0 That bug was supposed to have been fixed though, but I gotta ask.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat part are you trying to recover?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-14T00:48:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also seen people recommend closing speeds of 1-1.5 m/s, but I\u0027ve had better luck around 3m/s.\u00A0 Usually if the part has to spin a bit to be grabbed, this faster impact will still carry enough force to grab it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Woodsielord","CreatedById":193211,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-14T22:19:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone for your answers,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI kept trying and I think I got it when the claw was 90\u00BA (almost perfectly 90, not 85 to 95 as I thought it was enough)\u003Cbr\u003E\nI Took some screens:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/Fna4ELi\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/Fna4ELi\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tibrogargan","CreatedById":91949,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-20T06:26:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223486837\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022179784\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221542156494\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264714\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gargamel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/13/2018 at 4:48 PM, Gargamel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve also seen people recommend closing speeds of 1-1.5 m/s, but I\u0027ve had better luck around 3m/s.\u00A0 Usually if the part has to spin a bit to be grabbed, this faster impact will still carry enough force to grab it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I was playing a few versions ago it seemed to only work at speeds above about 1 m/s, but the behaviour seems to have been updated - you can now go as slowly as you like and as long as the angle is reasonably close to 90\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffffff;color:#353c41;font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u00BA it should connect at very low speeds.\u00A0 (\u00220.0 m/s\u0022).\u00A0 Haven\u0027t really tested it, but it seems that going too fast doesn\u0027t work now - but perhaps the few times I tried that the angle was the issue.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
