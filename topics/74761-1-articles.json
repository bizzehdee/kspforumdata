I am not familiar enough with the history of the JT9D and B747-100 certification programs to know which obtained its type certification first, but it wouldn\u0027t really matter. Boeing would be obligated to notify P\u0026amp;W and the regulatory authorities about their flight testing findings so that any problems that emerge with the engine\u0027s type design could be fixed. Again there would be no room for sweeping anything under the rug. \u003Cp\u003EAnd I sincerely doubt that it played out the way that you described it. If they did find a problem with the JT9D engine in flight testing, Boeing would very likely have worked closely with \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003EGE\u003C/span\u003E P\u0026amp;W at that time to determine if the problem was a consequence of a problem with aircraft systems or with the engine itself. Engineers and mechanics on both sides would have worked together to address the problem. In my professional experience, engineers and mechanics in the airline industry pride themselves on their commitment to safety and cooperation.

Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid movements of the throttles and distortion of the turbine casings after a short period of service.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this is a slight understatement. The engine had passed all airworthiness requirements, such as maximum thrust, sustained thrust, endurance, etc. However, when Boeing attempted to actually use the engine in the aircraft, they found that certain routine engine movements involving changing the thrust would repeatedly cause the engines to explode, particularly with the distorted casings. P\u0026amp;W insisted the engine was fine, as it had passed all tests, so the senior engineers grabbed the main guy and dragged him out to a test stand, where he couldn\u0027t blame aircraft systems. And then they started performing that failure condition, again, and again, and again, blowing up many engines in front of this guy, until he eventually conceded that yes, the certification wasn\u0027t everything, and the engine did need improving before it could be allowed to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis of course ignores a few problems the 747 itself had during development, such as landing gear being torn off during taxiing, but the whole engine debacle did occur as described.
