But to LAND on Eve...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow, before everyone else sets me on fire let me explain...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elanding a small or medium crewed craft on eve is extremely easy. Just a parachute and it will practically stop the damn thing in mid air as it falls in that thick soup of an atmosphere. But landing a 500t beast... Not so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elots of parachutes and engine power in the last tens of meters is required for hyper-soft landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eno landing gear will hold it, 9 out of 10 times the entire ship brakes in small pieces when landing on legs, wheels, you name it. The trick is landing on the engines, which will have to be mammoth for the first stage, and those engines will have to be attached to the fuel tanks with lots of struts for extra rigidity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egetting out means refuelling, if you used the engines for softening the descent. you-ll have to land a drill, or tanks on wheels, if you want to make it harder, or an even bigger ship... Anyway, using the drill or tanks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edock it with the main ship (this is a very hard design problem, recommend using a hose made of mutiple attached small docking ports) and fill up the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe ascent is somewhat tricky, climb \u0022very vertically\u0022 and from the 10000m the atmosphere behaves like sea level on kerbin (sort of). Have a very light final stage, monopropellant and some puffs will do nicely, for the final m/s you\u0027ll need to get out of the gripping hand of eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eanother problem is to get that big ship on eve. A ship big enough to get off eve should SSTO on kerbin, at least mine did, transferijg the fuel to the final stage to keep those mammoths burning without staging. Another boring and expensive and time consuming problem was to refuel the entire thing on orbit before ejecting to eve though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, a career mission to plant a flag on eve costed me around 2.500.000 credits....

Getting them back to kerbin will cost me another 100-200k but it\u0027s a nuclear ship and is reusable so...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is data from a real mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe point of landing so low on eve? I had to land near a rich mining vein so i could setup a mining operation for future manned lfights to eve.
