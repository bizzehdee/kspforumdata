You won\u0027t likely be off more than \u002B/- 200 deltav..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if you plan your ascent from kerbin, calculate roughly 4500 deltaV, then add about 950 deltaV for leaving kerbin, add 110 deltaV for your orbital insertion at Duna. 1380 for landing.

You can land on kerbin with 250 delta V no matter what speed or angle. Duna is more difficult because of the less dense atmosphere. With a fairly flat descent and the right parachutes you could still land for free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, this is a perfect world calculation. Bring 10% more for random errors and losses, this brings us to 7634 which is only a bit lower than the recommendation you found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return trip isn\u0027t on the chart, but in my experience it\u0027s a lot cheaper than the trip to duna, first of all, takeoff is only 1380, escape from duna to kerbol orbit should be about 300 (I\u0027m just guessing here) return to kerbin 110 and landing on kerbin is free with the parachutes you didn\u0027t forget to pack. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E So add 2000 deltaV for the return trip. 10k for a round trip is more than enough and doable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
