Some ideas: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) \u0022Do Science!\u0022 Kerbal puts on a Lab Coat (over his EVA suit, baa ha), and a table with flasks and stuff just appears. The Kerbal shakes his arms and panics for about 30 seconds, then the table and lab coat disappear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) \u002225 Hour Fitness\u0022 Kerbal puts on one of those \u0022muscle t-shirts\u0022 (of course, over his EVA suit again), and begins doing push ups/sit ups/jumps and does \u0022pull ups\u0022 on nothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.) \u0022Phone Home\u0022 Kerbal conjures up an 80s cell phone, mashes the phone with his fist, then sticks it to his helmet. He pounds the phone on the side of his helmet for a few seconds, before giving up and putting the phone away. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.) \u0022Pale Blue Dot\u0022 (Only available when Kerbin is unobstructed) Kerbal pulls a telescope out of nowhere, and stares at Kerbin through it. Has the awestruck face the entire time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.) \u0022The Corned Beef\u0022 Kerbal produces a sandwich out of his EVA suit, and attempts to eat it. Of course, he can\u0027t through his helmet. Then some random chatter comes over the comms, the Kerbal becomes panicked, picks up a chunk of ground, and \u0022hides\u0022 the sandwich beneath it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.) \u0022One small step\u0022 The Kerbal produces a door out of nowhere, and makes a majestic step onto the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.) \u0022You Blew It Up!\u0022 (Only available at an anomaly) Kerbal acts out the classic Planet of the Apes scene, silently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.) \u0022AYYYYY\u0022 Kerbal produces sunglasses, puts them on, and does a double thumbs up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.) Obligatory Robot Dance \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.) \u0022The Exorcist\u0022 The Kerbal turns his helmet 180 degrees, and his head follows it. His eyes go wide, then the Kerbal turns the helmet back to the normal orientation like nothing happened. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.) Obligatory \u0022This goes to 11!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.) \u0022Taxes\u0022 A desk filled with papers just appears, and the Kerbal suddenly wears reading glasses. Interplanetary paperwork ensues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13.) \u0022Fine Dining\u0022 A table appears out of nowhere, with a 7 course meal prepared. Kerbal is now wearing a monocle and a Tuxedo (both over his EVA suit and helmet, baa ha)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust having some emotes would be amazing.
