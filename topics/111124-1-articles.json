I put it on and then open the base bit, move the next section up, click endlessly to try to get it to accept the position, it very rarely does and will not get any further 99% of the time. Just will not accept the clicking of the left mouse button.\n\nSwear swear swear!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T17:10:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Claw**"},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T10:24:39Z","Content":"If you\u0027re talking about fairings, try rotating your view around a bit.

Off centre mass or drag is a terrible thing in rocketry, it\u0027s a major cause of control issues and failure. A wider and heavier faring would almost certainly be a much better idea than an off centre fairing, or significant off centre payload, if either of those are what you did to fix it."},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_the_Plumber","CreatedById":111986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T12:01:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hmm, \u0022off centre\u0022 sounds a little concerning, to be honest, but it depends just what you mean.

I\u0027d then flare the fairing outwards below it to clear the widest parts of the rover, while keeping the fairing perfectly centred. You shouldn\u0027t really need the next size up of fairing for that (which I guess is what you\u0027re meaning by needing more tech), rather just expand the existing fairing outwards, unless the rover is really huge and hits the max expansion width of the fairing. If need be, move the fairing base down the rocket, or place spacers on it to give sufficient vertical distance between the fairing base and rover, so that it can expand sufficiently to clear.\n\nI\u0027m just thinking \u0022gee, I really don\u0027t fancy Tim\u0027s job flying a banana shaped rocket into space\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u0022 ;-)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_the_Plumber","CreatedById":111986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T09:59:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Well, if I was building it, I\u0027d adjust the position of the rover if its mass was low enough to allow that.

It is currently attached to the low orbit collection of empty fuel tanks and stuff. The tug is now also there and I have to reassemble the correct stuff from the station to make the passage to the Mun and possible Solar orbit happen. Maybe a refuel from Minimus.... \n\nNice to have a well worked out plan before you set off."},{"CreatedByName":"Vectura","CreatedById":119212,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T10:41:09Z","Content":"Why do you write in blue?
