I guess I don\u0027t really see the need, as someone can easily make any SM from a functionality standpoint (not \u0022replica\u0022 clearly) in SSTU. Use one of the upper stage tanks that includes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/APU, and there you go. Perhaps add a new mount type that provides a different appearance? The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E requires a mount, I suppose. You could make a new mount that has no mount, and that moves the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E up onto the tank?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current plain tank (MFT-A) has a large jump from A-0-5 to A-1-0... adding a step in between that would cover the stubby SM. Another issue is the external pipe on those. Perhaps could one or another of the MFT tanks simply not have that external pipe detail? Then, if looks demand not using it, you use the other tank, even if it is a little less optimized (which doesn\u0027t matter much in stock, frankly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only thing missing would be the solar panels (you already added the antenna).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022block%20V.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/block%20V.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPretty darn close, uses 10\u00A0parts... I\u0027d lean towards fewer \u0022unitasker\u0022 parts. If you wanted to make a generic SM part that could stretch, perhaps with an older style \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E block mounted on the tank vs the mounting ring setup on the existing upper stages that would make sense to me. If such a tank had a couple solar panels, that would be awesome (in the same 45 degree offset from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E). That would mean our replica would take 4 parts with a high gain (and would allow engine/propellant options).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLatest renders and greeble:\u00A0Looking nice.
