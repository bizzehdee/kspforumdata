While it is called SSTUInflatable (for lack of a better name), all it really does is block of the playing of an animation until a certain number of resources are consumed.

In short -- that module controls an animation, and does **not** do any form of module-switching.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The only (stock compatible) way to do that would be to replace the part wholesale; rather than play an animation it would destroy the current part and create/insert the replacement part (where the replacement part has all the functional modules, the base pre-inflated part only has the inflatable module).  Would be hacky as hell, result in tons of extra parts in the editor and research tree...  not really anything I\u0027m interested in implementing.\n\u003E \n\nThats more than good enough.

At which point it will be a complete re-do/reworking on all of those parts (pods, tanks, legs, accessories).\n\u003E \n\nYeah, sorry I mentioned it, but I was playing with the parts...\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Texture swapping on other parts (CM/SM/Etc) -- possible, but would quickly result in a 500mb download.  Each extra texture set for those parts adds 3-5mb per part (they are not small textures); multiply that out by 3-4 parts per series, 4 series of parts, = 4\\*4\\*5 = 80mb per additional set of textures for the ShipCore parts.  If I added 3 texture options for each ShipCore part, you would have an additional ~250mb of textures.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t really have a problem with the download size... bandwidth is not as much of a problem as it was a decade ago.  Rather I\u0027m worried about overall GPU memory use... it is a finite resource that must be shared with stock resources and all other mods.  I\u0027m pretty sure KSP loads -all- textures into the GPU, and there is only limited GPU memory available.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If someone can provide verifiable proof that Unity is smart enough to dynamically upload textures to the GPU on a per-scene/as-needed basis (and thus the memory limit is per-scene, and not global), I would be much more willing to support further-reaching texture-swapping capabilities for other parts (still don\u0027t have time to make the textures... but at least I would be willing to if/when the time is found).\n\u003E \n\nYeah, that makes total sense. I didn\u0027t realize the crew part textures were so large. I don\u0027t really think the US parts need it at all, to be honest (unless mirror finished is an option ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022) ). Maybe just a white option for the Soviet parts? In that way, mixing and matching when that happens would not look so busy.\n\nRegarding the small Apollo SM... I guess I don\u0027t really see the need, as someone can easily make any SM from a functionality standpoint (not \u0022replica\u0022 clearly) in SSTU. Use one of the upper stage tanks that includes \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/APU, and there you go. Perhaps add a new mount type that provides a different appearance? The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E requires a mount, I suppose. You could make a new mount that has no mount, and that moves the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E up onto the tank?\n\nThe current plain tank (MFT-A) has a large jump from A-0-5 to A-1-0... adding a step in between that would cover the stubby SM. Another issue is the external pipe on those. Perhaps could one or another of the MFT tanks simply not have that external pipe detail? Then, if looks demand not using it, you use the other tank, even if it is a little less optimized (which doesn\u0027t matter much in stock, frankly).\n\nThe only thing missing would be the solar panels (you already added the antenna).\n\n![block%20V.jpg](http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/tatersw/KSP/block%20V.jpg)\n\nPretty darn close, uses 10 parts... I\u0027d lean towards fewer \u0022unitasker\u0022 parts. If you wanted to make a generic SM part that could stretch, perhaps with an older style \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E block mounted on the tank vs the mounting ring setup on the existing upper stages that would make sense to me. If such a tank had a couple solar panels, that would be awesome (in the same 45 degree offset from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E). That would mean our replica would take 4 parts with a high gain (and would allow engine/propellant options).\n\nLatest renders and greeble: Looking nice. I have to say I tend towards minimalism, because it makes the parts more generic in terms of non-replica use.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-31T18:07:15Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2016 06:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-31T18:02:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 57 minutes ago, falken said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On the subject of the stubby eyes turned skywards Apollo CSM, if you\u0027re reluctant to make a single use part that uses a texture like that, **how about as a compromise another semi-procedural tank that doesn\u0027t have the piping on the side**?\n\u003E \n\nThis popped up as I was typing...

Both would feature integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, configurable tank diameter and length, selectable mounts (top/bottom), configurable tank contents (VolumeContainer resource handling), and integrated lower fairings (basically the existing MFT tank functionality, using MUS textures/geometry, with integrated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and possibly solar panels or fuel cell).  Would -not- feature integrated engines, as those only make sense on fixed-function parts (and engine-swapping isn\u0027t an option/extremely difficult for technical reasons).\n\nEither way I won\u0027t be even looking at further this until KSP 1.2 (more specifically the PBR shader or custom shader) is available -and- all of the station-core parts are completed.  I\u0027ve already got my hands plenty full with what I\u0027m in the middle of.\n\nOn the note of \u0027MFT-0-5 is too short, MFT-1-0 is too long\u0027 -- you realize that there is a vertical scale slider that allows you to fine-tune the height of the tanks?  It was implemented to solve that exact problem.  I know it isn\u0027t as ideal as a specific tank-length model, but it should allow you to get the length you desire.\n\nOn the subject of tanks with integrated radial decouplers -- would be pretty easy to add those to the existing MFT tanks with a simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch or config edit.

For current/historic spacecraft a 0.3m/1ft window is... still pretty big; for reference a scaled-down ISS-Cupola would have a main window size of 0.5m/20in.

We\u0027ll see how it looks from there, I can still do another model-update pass if needed.\n\nTextures -- Yep.  Texture swapping is already built into the plugin for all main model bits (top, core, bottom), as can be seen with the top/bottom adapters.  The \u0027core texture\u0027 buttons merely don\u0027t show up as they don\u0027t have any textures yet ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nInitially I\u0027ll have (at least) two variants - a beige/cream colored cloth look in the vein of the Mir modules, and a grey/silver metallic texture closer to Tantares/Kosmos textures.  I kind of want to do a dark/black set as well, similar to a few of the Salyut renderings (perhaps black/green, or black/dk-gray).  A green/white set (cloth or metal) might also look decent, but I\u0027m not set on it yet.  It is (currently) a 2048x texture which is quite large, so I would like to keep the number of sets to reasonable levels. \n\nThat is a 2048x for all 6 parts at ~170px/meter, most of which is due to AO baking/shading requirements and unique UV mapping.  Still works out to less than 1024x per part while allowing for different detailing on most parts and for sharing UV areas everywhere possible.  If I were to do them individually they would still need at least a 1024x texture each in order to hit my texture-scale preferences (128px/m min, up to 256px/m preferred for crewed parts), and would actually end up with lower px/m from inability to do UV sharing.\n\nThankfully I think many of the other station parts will be a lot easier to keep smaller while still maintaining decent detail levels.  The COS parts will be very easy to share textures as they are simple cylinders and can all be mapped to shared spaces.  The HAB parts will mostly consist of repeating segments, with the occasional \u0027odd\u0027 segment (hab windows, torus arms), all of which can use UV sharing to various extents (okay, so the 50m torus will probably still need a big texture... but its a -very- big part)."},{"CreatedByName":"StickyScissors","CreatedById":144204,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-01T00:07:07Z","Content":"Space Station Vucari, my latest attempt at building something using a majority of SSTU parts that at least slightly resembles a space dock in...space.

This would bring each set of 3-part solar trusses on this station down to 2: the solar panel and truss as one part, and the docking part as another.\n\n-The 1.25 crew tube with swapable ports on either end is made, which could also potentially save parts by having one of those colorful multi-ports swapable on the ends (which, IIRC, is\u0027\u0027nt possible?)\n\n-Each one of the colorful multi-ports already on the station could be welded to each other (which seems way too complicated/impossible). For example: Dock something to the red port, weld them together, dock something else to the green port, weld that together, etc.\n\n-Modular fuel tanks have the option of having integrated/swapable docking ports at either end of them. This would bring 3 parts down to one n this situation.\n\nTo get to 4 parts, assuming all the things i listed are cable of co-existing peacefully, all the crew tubes/parts/pods(including a new 1.25m crew tube), and by extension the docking ports that attach the panels are welded into one big part, fuel tanks gets integrated docking ports, and the solar panels and trusses get welded to each other/integrated like mentioned,\n\nThis may be very far reaching or downright impossible from the get-go, but i can\u0027t halt my rampant imagination and armchair coding/engineering. i feel like i have some sort of condition or something O\\_o This also may well be gibberish or hard to understand.
