Some groups don\\\u0027t respond to change well, such as the RADICAL MUSLEMS or the RADICAL CHRISTIANS (religions are not wrong, nether are they right though, but non of them preach the violence of the radical groups)(just so you know, I used christian and muslem radicalist as I know the most about these. I am not religous (though I do say Godess every once and a while). These groups don\\\u0027t want to move forwards, instead want to stay still or the world to be there way, so they become terrorist orginisations. These terrorist orginisations could, if done correctly, destroy humanity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T18:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a spell check on forum posts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T21:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mincespy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mincespy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, I think we are alone in the galaxy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll the evidence points to it, and the arguments against are mostly all purely hypothetical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, there\\\u0027s not a single shred of evidence to support that.
