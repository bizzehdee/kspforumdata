After many years of calculations and Construction the Proton-Suhoi company have been the first and most successful in creating the very first orbital construction and espionage station which houses a staff of 37 Kerbal Engineers and Military Personnel. The Station offers state of the art Tracking Satellites for signals from Kerban and Beyond. With its Mk 421 \u0022Kerbaina Eye\u0022 it can zoom in to about 4million Kixels producing the most detailed photos of enemy emplacement, troops and bases on kerban. Also Due to the conflicts with other kerban nations such as the K.S.A and Dangers of space junk the P-SU-OCE is Loaded with a Experimental \u0022Sunbeam Laser\u0022 which can destroy any incoming objects that can harm the station. Due to the high amount of solar panels the station can have its energy costs in the positive meaning that work can be done efficiently and without unexpected halts even if some of the Solar panels are Of need of repairs the internal battery Storage should keep it going until the repairs are complete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Off topic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi there I\u0027m warguy142 and I\u0027ve just begun playing kerbal space program for a while now and this is also my first post and build of a space station.
