Those that do, please correct any misconceptions I labor under.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt strikes me that the development of modern physics was assisted greatly by the apparent truth of the Cosmological and Copernican Principles: the ideas that space is isoptropic and homogenous and that there is no special location in space. These principles were axiomatic to the development of modern cosmology for a couple of hundred years, but have only been verified observationally in the last decade or so. The apparent near-uniform distribution of stars in the night sky, however, does suggest them. But a major reason that the sky \u0027looks\u0027 uniform is that the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peculiar_velocity\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epeculiar velocity\u003C/a\u003E of visible cosmological artifacts (e.g. the cosmic microwave background and visible stars and galaxies) relative to our own is several orders of magnitude less than the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m curious. Imagine our sun was an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergalactic_star\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eintergalactic star\u003C/a\u003E, far from any gravitational influence, travelling at 0.9c relative to the cosmic microwave background. For half of the year, the night sky would be generally pretty dark except for the motion of planets and other local phenomenon (asteroids, comets, etc) and during the other half of the year, the night sky would be (I think) pretty bright and blue, but not uniformly. There would be a bright spot (rivalling the moon?) and stars would be clustered toward that spot, getting sparser and dimmer out to 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 or so from the center. How would this situation have affected the development of cosmological physics? Note that humans on this Earth would have no notion that they\u0027re moving at any special velocity; this would be just how the universe looks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-10T21:58:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eo_O My exploded just brain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have a lot to say on this, but here\u0027s what I do have: for one thing, if we were in intergalactic space, there wouldn\u0027t be any stars to see (except maybe one once in a blue moon).

I\u0027d think at least a few would be visible all the time. (There are 10 or so visible from Earth with the naked eye.) And you\u0027d be able to see the planets and the moon pretty clearly. (All of the planets, except Neptune can be seen unaided.) But think of that; since planets would be the most visible things in the sky, it seems likely that heliocentric cosmology would have been discovered earlier.

Would we have discovered relativity, even Galilean relativity? To someone on Fast-Earth, it definitely looks like the universe has a polarity. I\u0027d think there would be considerable effort trying to figure out why the sky doesn\u0027t have uniform luminosity. Why, once telescopes are discovered, it seems like Fast Earth is off in the distance, far away from everything else in the universe, which is clustered in a corner of the sky. How utterly counter-intuitive and mystifying it would be that if you were to leave in a spaceship and travel at near light-speed away from the heart of the universe, that the universe would actually suddenly spring into homogeneity all around you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-11T15:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother speculation: It might be difficult, on Fast-Earth, to come up with the idea for an expansionary universe. I\u0027m not sure what degree the relativistic motion of distant galaxies toward Fast-Earth would be balanced out by the expansion of space-time, but it\u0027s possible that all the galaxies visible from Fast-Earth would actually be approaching, not receding away. They might have a blue-shift that is significant compared to the sun\u0027s color spectrum. Fast-earthlings would have every reason to believe that their place in the universe is special.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess the point of this exercise is to perhaps sort of elucidate that kinds of suppositions that might underlie our own understanding of cosmological reality. Fast-Earth\u0027s perspective would be entirely valid, and the laws of physics would function exactly the same in their frame, but it\u0027s hard to imagine that they would come to the same conclusions about the cosmos that we do.

The visible universe has a rest frame: the frame of the cosmic microwave background. (Note that relativity states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames, not that there are no special frames. Earth travels at something like 600 km/s relative to the CMB, which manifests itself as a polarity in the radiation due to Doppler effects; it\u0027s hotter in one half of the sky.) Nearly all visible matter is travelling at speeds several orders of magnitude less than the speed of light relative to the CMB (plasma jets erupting from quasars and probably a few other phenomenon excepted.) If our sun had a velocity 90% of the speed of light relative to the CMB, it would also have near speed-of-light velocity relative to everything visible (except local solar system objects like other planets and comets.) Thus, from any point in the solar system, aberration effects would pull all the visible cosmic phenomenon (i.e. visible galaxies and the CMB) \u0027forward\u0027 into the direction of the sun\u0027s travel. From Earth, for half of the year, these phenomena would be in the direction of the sun: only within our horizon during the day, so swamped by the sun\u0027s light.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-13T15:27:05Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2014 03:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Acemcbean","CreatedById":108779,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T14:47:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI... er...
