The angling on your control surfaces prior to the race is very important. Too much angle will cause excess drag instead of providing negative lift to keep your car on the ground.

However, the structure of the space frame has been altered. Beams have been replaced with struts and molded into a nicer shape. Heavy reactors were removed and replaced with an altogether new and radical solution - photovoltaic panels. This allows me to keep the weight down whilst allowing for full power to all wheels, even in sub-optimal lighting. Readjusted spoilers and added extra crumple zones for better protection of the driver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECentre of gravity is so low that I have trouble flipping this car in corners. when it DOES flip, the roll cage begins to peel off bit by bit, absorbing impacts and protecting the driver from any nasty collisions. Wheels can snap off as a result, however, you wouldn\u0027t honestly hope for a good lap time after a crash - car can be rebuilt, but there is only 1 randomly generated Camrod Kerman.
