It would be more likely to end up with today\u0027s system than a four-gas-giant scenario. So I was reading some stuff about outer, eccentric Trans-Neptunian Objects like Sedna, and I thought about why it might end up like that. People say there must be another planet-sized object (I don\u0027t say planet because it obviously hasn\u0027t cleared its orbit) orbiting far beyond Neptune. Its mass is supposed to be between Mars\u0027 mass and Saturn\u0027s mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway.
