Venus has twice the escape velocity of Mars and four times the Moons, and while Venus has nearly twice as much energy per meter squared at the 1 atm of pressure compared to earth, mars and the moon don\u0027t have a quarter of it blocked by 1 atmosphere of pressure, so mars while in total mars has slightly more than a quarter as much energy, and the moon has only slightly less energy per meter squared compared to Venus, but due to the tyranny of the rocket equation, (and unless you can get it done in a single stage, which for a 10km/s acceleration plus capture velocity combined with severe air braking/additional 5km/s deceleration you probably wont) mars would be easier, and besides all that if all you want is to bring material to LEO, all you need for the moon is to achieve the 2.5km/s escape velocity and then do a manageable air brake, followed by a couple 100m/s delta V and you\u0027re in LEO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T01:04:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo matter what we would need titanic amounts of hydrogen, either as water or hydrogen it self. Enough to make oceans on venus, best by converting all of its existing supply of CO2 into water and carbon. Just a negligible fraction of Venus\u0027s CO2 converted into oxgyen would be enough to make an atmosphere with breathable oxgyen partial pressure (roughly 1/400th venus\u0027s CO2), so the rest would need to be converted into water. Venus\u0027s atmosphere weighes 4.8*10^20 kg and is 96.5% CO2, that would mean we would need to import at least 4.2*10^19 kg of hydrogen to turn all that into water (and coal). This would make 3.4*10^20 kg of water, or about 23% of the water in earth\u0027s oceans, and probably two to three order of magnitude less then all the water on earth and inside earth. So even if we converted almost all of venus\u0027s CO2 to water venus would still be a dry planet with at least 1/5 the surface water of earth and probably less as it is slowly absorbed into venus\u0027s extremely parched regolith. Mind you much of venus would then be covered in several hundred meters of carbon soot, which I would hope is compacted under the water and does not absorb much of it like a sponge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would we get all the hydrogen there? We would need to extract it from one of the gas giants, likely need something really crazy advanced like antigravity tractor beam atmosphere suckers or wormhole atmosphere pumps. Fun question, what happens to potential and kinetic energy when you have a wormhole on jupiter hosing out hydrogen gas on to Venus? I would assume to prevent violation of physics and making portal like proportional motion machines possible the wormhole would need to make up the energy difference, either that or the hydrogen comes spraying out at 22 km/s! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps it could be done by thousands of titanic ships that skim the atmosphere of say Uranus (the smallest gas giant) harvest cubic kilometers of hydrogen, cool and compressed it into a liquid, and then fly over to Venus where it is dumped into the atmosphere somehow and the cycle repeated. The propulsion system would at the very least need to be nuclear fusion. One thousand of these ships reaching venus a year, each moving a cubic kilometer of liquid hydrogen would take 20,441 years to move the required amount of hydrogen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow would hydrogen make water? That part is simple thermochemistry: venus\u0027s own superheat atmosphere would do the job, converting CO2 to Methane and water via its own heat and pressure near the surface, bio-engineered microbes inoculated into venus\u0027s clouds could then back converted the methane into carbon (soot) and hydrogen. Eventually the clouds would become made of water (rather then sulfates and sulfuric acid). The clouds would start to rain down once the surface temperature got low enough. Depending on how thick venus\u0027s very thin crust is, and thus how well it convects heat, it could take decades to thousands of year to bring venus\u0027s surface temperature down even close to liviable, not assuming the time it takes the bring all that hydrogen of course. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs the surface termpature drops on venus more and more of the conversion of CO2 and hydrogen to water would need to be taken up by cloud microbes. At first this process would consist of organisms utilizing CO2 and hydrogen to make water and biomass, then eventually dying or getting too heavy and falling to the surface where the heat and pressure pyrolysis the biomass into coal and the hydrogen floats back up. But once the temperature drops, organisms would need to be designed to produce pure carbon, either that or the surface would be covered in hundreds of meters of biomass, taking a good percentage of hydrogen with it, I would say roughly doubling the hydrogen requirement. And making venue\u0027s surface truly alien covered by a gigantic living \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cthing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 hundreds of meters thick and covering all the low lands of the planet! Mind you it can be dead biomass or it would rot, oxidize and suck up all the oxgen and covert it back into CO2. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that assumes that eventually an orbital sunshade is made, For what will be left of venus\u0027s atmosphere consisting of 3 times the amount of nitrogen as on earth (three times the final air pressure of earth roughly) and with venus\u0027s closer proximity to the sun, bring down venus\u0027s surface temp will eventual require cutting down the sunlight reaching venus. A sunshade 4 times wider then venus at a point out at Venus\u0027s L1 would eclipse the sun completely, how to deal with solar pressure and the like I don\u0027t know, perhaps a stable point beyond L2 where solar pressure, the sun\u0027s gravity and venus\u0027s gravity cancel each other out can exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming all that, the at least 4.2*10^19 kg of hydrogen, the at most 50,000 km wide sunshade with light controlling apature. holes or vairable diameter. All of that Life on venus would be very different from earth (besides the the planet size bioroid or coal producing microbes). Venus\u0027s gravity is 90.4% that of earth\u0027s so gravity would be nearly the same, unlike on mars, but that residual atmosphere would be roughly 3 times as thick as the earth. Scuba diver\u0027s experience that pressure at roughly 30 meters under water, that pressure is were nitrogen necrosis starts to become noticeable, via scuba\u0027s divers \u0022Martini\u0027s law\u0022 that pressure is equal to one martini, so everyone on terraformed Venus would be the roughly physiologically equivalent of drunk (mildly high on Nitrous oxide would be a closer analogy) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully, probably human neural chemistry will adapt to the increase in nitrogen\u0027s partial pressure, so that they won\u0027t be \u0027inebriated\u0027 for the rest of their lives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce one adapts to the drunken phase of life settling on venus, and setting up settlement need the few places of open water (or drinking off the gigantic teets of the planet size superorganism) the next thing to get use-to will be the day, for venus\u0027s day is \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BC of a year long! Venus\u0027s has a solar day that is 116.75 earth days long, with daylight for 58 earth days or 2 earth months, and nighttime for another 2 earth months. Noon, dawn, dusk and midnight would replace summer, spring, fall and winter as seasons. Venus\u0027s atmosphere will hopefully, even at just 3-4% its present thickness, still superotate, and thus bring heat from the daylight side to the nighttime side, keeping the winter-night bearable and the summer-day from baking hot. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnimal and plant life on venus\u0027s would need to be heavily engineered to handle 2 months of daylight and 2 months of nightime. A very different kind of ecosystem would need to exist, for example migratory animals that stay in the daylight, all they have to do is keep moving east at an average speed of 6.5 km/h. Perhaps flying migratory plantimals that keep in the sun for photosynthesis, Hyper-evolved from the first cloud seeding organism used in the initial transformation. Besides that all the same strategies on earth for dealing with summer and winter might work on venus: hibernation, seasonal transformation, etc, except in just 4 earth month long cycles instead of 12. Growing cycles for plants would need to be short, at most 2 months, or they curl up for the winter-night to open up again for the daylight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo add all that together and terraforming venus is a tall order, and after all that work the resulting world maybe livable by human standards but nothing like life on earth, it would be... well...

First few hundred K would boil off all the water or any volatiles in it, even chemically bound water. Hydrogen gas would be added to chemically reduce the feedstock into metals and hydrides. Oxides would reduce to metals and water, the water would be electrolyzed back into hydrogen, with oxygen as the product. Carbon would convert into methane, excellent starting material for making any kind of organics. At different temperatures different elements would boil off and could be caught in cold trap collectors. If the floating molten glob of raw material can be heated to 4000 K every element would boil off eventually.

Sure it would require a lot of power, for example boil a metric ton of Iron would take roughly 100 kw continuous for a whole day (8.53 GJ) (also assuming very little heat lose) to convert a metric ton of water to hydrogen and oxygen would take 155 KW continuous for a day, (assuming 100% efficiency, quadruple that 600 Kw for a reasonable 25% efficiency from sunlight to electricity to electrolysis, or 50% efficient, 310 KW for a thermal cracking process).
