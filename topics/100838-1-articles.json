The first step is done: confirm that it is actually possible to generate a new kerbal on board a ship. I\u0027m working this as it\u0027s actually possible. The pipeline idea I had before (where you build pipes on a planet) is scrapped as it seems i can\u0027t get resources off a ship unless its loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe answer is that it\u0027s possible.

In order to build a population on your base or station there will be 3 types of parts you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Civilian spacecraft dock: This dock will be how civilians actually get to your station. This is a commercial subcontractor dock which will receive new civilians at a rate depending on where the base is. You don\u0027t need this if you plan to launch them yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Food: There will be new garden modules and biodomes (like my farm biodome) which will add a \u0022food\u0022 capacity to your ship. Food will be required to support a civilian population\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Housing: A house module will be available (that actually stores the civilian resource) in different sizes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Kerbal Resource department (pictured above): Finally once you build up enough civilian population you can recruit from it. This spawns crew in-situ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your station or base has enough food and housing and a civilian dock you\u0027ll start to receive civilians. The rate you receive depends on where your base is and how big the current population on it is. Within kerbin system would be the order of a few hours at a time. Out by Eeloo would take years to get them there. You can of course launch a ship with civilians on it to seed your base. That ship will need the necessary parts to sustain the population.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T17:40:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 05:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by michaelhester07\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshwoo70","CreatedById":111345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T05:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI read your food resource\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can us TAC LS to add the food resource. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot potential! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tommygun","CreatedById":41293,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T05:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou could also have In situ Kerbal reproduction for off world colonies with this too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith all the mods for new star systems, resource gathering and off world launch pads this is the one resource you can\u0027t generate off world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEdit:\u003C/strong\u003E I didn\u0027t see that last part of your post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbal Resource department, I guess that\u0027s where you are going with it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T05:40:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 05:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tommygun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:46:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last part about how big the population is: This is where you can start to get kerbals reproducing.

This is because I don\u0027t have a plugin to play movies. I\u0027ll look at that but there is something more pressing to solve in 1.4: to set out and create the actual namesake for the pipelines namespace: pipelines. Being better at modding now I can make the pipelines mod. It will become part of Civilian Population 1.4. Here\u0027s the design plan:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pipeline system will implement a network. A scenario config will be used to track the networks on a planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Each ship which wishes to use the pipeline has a pipeline installer part. This part allows a ship to register on the planet\u0027s network. The initial node on the network does not have to do additional setup work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Subsequent nodes which will join it will have to pay a cost in rocket parts and build time. Network will likely cost between 1-10 rocket parts per meter distance to the nearest node. During install the rocket parts from an existing network may be used to expand the network. This expansion is processed on the new node. Maximum network connection range will be 10 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Installation for a 10km pipeline will likely take 1 kerbin month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The pipeline is severed if a ship leaves the landed state for more than 3 seconds. Severed pipes need to be rebuilt for the full construction cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Once a ship is connected to the network it submits its resources and delta-resource rate to the network. It then gains the full network resource capacity and delta resource. It will be desirable to have the network node part on landing legs of some kind. I\u0027ll have to update the mass of the part to adjust for the resource change. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Gaining the full network capacity will be the tricky part as it will have to combine almost all in-situ resource generators in existence through every mod. I\u0027ll initially have support for regolith based converters and stock generators. Solar panels will be assumed to be on a duty cycle of 50% of their full rated output (to account for planetary rotation). Other generators will submit their current production to the network as is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All resources will be capable of being sent through the pipeline network, even civilians \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Planets may have multiple networks on them.

It\u0027s a bit more complicated than the usual part.requestResource() thing. The last part for pipelines is simulating the resources that are changing on the unloaded parts in realtime, down to the modules in use on it. This is fairly difficult as I need to simulate every generator in every existing mod. To be frank, there\u0027s a strong chance that most mods that make their own generator won\u0027t be supported in live unfocused resource updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPipelines will support generators in stock, MKS, and Regolith. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s how unfocused resource modification works...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe FlightGlobals variable has to carry certain data about ships so that they can be loaded and unloaded properly. It has a list of Vessel objects for all of the current vessels. Each vessel has a variable \u0022IsLoaded\u0022 which tells if it\u0027s loaded. If the vessel is loaded then I can get resources directly from it with the part.requestResource() method. If the vessel is not loaded then there is a \u0022ProtoVessel\u0022 which contains the information I need. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProtoVessel contains ProtoPart which contains the resource definitions, stored as a config node. To get resources from the unloaded vessel I parse that protopart, grab what I need, then write back what\u0027s left. The result is live access to resources on all ships, regardless of whether they\u0027re loaded. This part is working properly as expected even. I setup 2 ships outside of \u0022local area network\u0022 range (2.4km) and was able to use resources on the unloaded ship from my main ship. The last part is simulating the resource changes on the ship. This is the tricky part. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring my test for this I zeroed all of the resources on every ship in my sandbox from my loaded ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result is two types of network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022local area network\u0022 (LAN) contains the loaded ships. Loaded ships will process in realtime, so I don\u0027t need to simulate anything on them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022Wide area network\u0022 (WAN) contains the unloaded ships. Unloaded ships will need to be simulated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027ll end up doing is each \u0022live\u0022 ship registers the state of its generators on the pipeline network part module. This keeps me from having to cross reference generators on the part with its config. I don\u0027t know how savegame loads do that. I surmise though if one were to swap the order of modules in the save file (or in the config) that one could break their ship\u0027s modules as modules don\u0027t have IDs stored in the savefile. If they did this paragraph would be way different. I\u0027ll see if I can get an initial version working tonight. If I can then for at least regolith supporting mods the modules on the pipeline network will update constantly, even while away, rather than simply simulating what happens when you get back.
