Trying to land while coming straight in from Kerbin is a great way to lose entirely too much fuel and smash into the surface at high speed or strand your kerbonauts there for a while if you do make it down safely. Getting into a stable orbit also gives you much more control over where the final landing site can be as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, bring landing lights, just in case you need them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
