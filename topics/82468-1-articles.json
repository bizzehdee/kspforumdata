Here\u0027s what I came up with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas mentioned before, while the conditions for a chemical explosion with methane or another combustible gas is possible, a violent decompression or some other form of physical explosion is more likely unless the miners are very, very careless and thoughtless in their base construction and operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKialar\u0027s comment regarding a hydrazine explosion caught my interest. Hydrazine is commonly used as rocket fuel, often in monopropellant engines. However, pure hydrazine is NASTY. It is dangerously unstable, incredibly toxic (lethal dose lies somewhere in the parts per million range) and some very nasty long term effects even in sub-lethal doses. Imagine an explosion in your hydrazine storage on an asteroid base. Not good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it gets better. My interest being piqued, I looked up the properties of hydrazine. A lot of info is readily available on the wikipedia page, some other info I remembered from my classes back at university.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydrazine is, as mentioned, unstable. When exposed to a metal catalyst (more precisely, iridium compounds) it violently reacts with itself. So violently in fact, that in a rocket engine it heats up the reaction chamber to 800\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C in \u003Cem\u003Emilliseconds\u003C/em\u003E. Now, iridium is an extremely rare metal here on earth. In fact, quite a bit of the iridium we nowadays use in catalysts doesn\u0027t actually originate from earth. It comes from, you guessed it, impacted asteroids. Now of course iridium in its raw form won\u0027t be as finely dispersed as it would be on a catalyst specifically made for the job, but it can still be a huge pain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo say you store your rocket fuel outside of the base. Seems sensible right? don\u0027t want to risk something that toxic getting into the enclosed atmosphere. Now say you spring a leak in one of the cannisters. Hydrazine starts venting into space, encounters a patch of asteroid with a larger amount of exposed iridium.... Next thing you know VERY bad things are happening.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if this will help the OP in any way, it might be too technical or far-fetched, but I just wanted to share.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kialar","CreatedById":60893,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T16:52:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECirocco, you deserve a reputation point for this idea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA star from me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Janet","CreatedById":119513,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-22T17:41:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cirocco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cirocco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Edepends.

Okay, to start, am probably staying with methane and the scenario they built the living quarters interiorally and cheap so that there\u0027s an eventual contact and spark (the above persuasive comments notwithstanding!). That minimizes the need for technical narrative--people would be familiar with the concept etc and the conditions that ensue following such an explosion--like any mine on Earth. But beyond that I need something else for the plot. I have good guys, rescuers, coming which the asteroid mine management BLOCKS from rescuing the trapped, so that a thrilling fire fight ensues. But, why would management do that? I was considering something like, they\u0027d rather not risk the expensive equipment (let\u0027s say right outside the blocked area) to another explosion.

The farther from the sun, the lower the temperature of the dust and gas, and the lower the temperature, the more volatile the makeup of the dust and gas that sticks to your growing asteroid. Lots of asteroids contain ice, and as methane is a very simple, light molecule, it makes up a large amount of non-H, non-He constituents of the gas giants and their moons with atmospheres (especially Titan). I don\u0027t see it as far-fetched at all for asteroids (especially those forming farther out and migrating into the asteroid belt or elsewhere) to contain a large amount of methane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do think that Cirocco\u0027s hydrazine slant has a lot of merit, though, and it might be easier to come up with a logical accident with that than with mining methane. Though if the methane found in the asteroid is relatively concentrated, it would be in ice form, so there\u0027s a few angles you could take with expansion of the methane from sublimation, improper storage of the ice, etc. Despite the plausibility of hydrazine problems, leaking the gas to space would not result in high enough concentrations to ignite in vacuum, \u003Cem\u003Eunless\u003C/em\u003E it was kept together, i.e. leaking into an enclosed pocket between the tank and an iridium-rich surface.
