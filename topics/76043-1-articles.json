Since parts are added to the .craft description in order of placement, it matters what order you place the parts on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my example of the two engine, eight intake design, the way most of us would put it together is to place all the intakes at once, then place all the engines.

This produces asymmetrical flameout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf instead you place half the intakes, then an engine, then the rest of the intakes, then the other engine, the .craft description looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntake\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when the program runs the IntakeAir calculation it gets to the first engine with four intake\u0027s worth of air, which the engine then takes.
