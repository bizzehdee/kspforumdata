The ITV started out with 14,000 km/s, but only shows about 3500km/s when docked to the base. I think that might be an error due to the number of parts and various fuel tanks.

I Start the burn at t-9:11, but the deltaV immediately starts climbing, as does the burn timer. It gets up to around 1000km/s and the timer freezes at about 20:00.

To make this relatively simple: look at the navsphere, the manuever marker in there. look at the prograde marker. the more distant they are, the less efficient the burn. efficiency is roughly equal to the cosine of the angle between them. at t-9, your prograde is roughly 90 degrees away from the manuever node, meaning a burn there is practically wasted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1b) you can mitigate this by splitting the burn into several smaller burns. the first orbit you burn from \u002B2 minutes to -2 minutes, you raise your apoapsis a bit in this way, but not enough to escape. that\u0027s good, because on the next orbit you repeat the manuever, this time you\u0027re already going faster, so you will burn some more and raise apoapsis even better. repeat for how many orbits it takes. it\u0027s much more efficient. unfortunately, this meddles with the manuever node. ideally, you should make a new manuever node at every new orbit. keeping aligned for the gravity assist is going to be nigh impossible, but fortunately you can wait 6 days for mun to be in the right place again; jool transfer windows are generally long.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyou could also add more engines to your contraption; it would probably be more efficient, and easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) your idea of going in solar orbit first, and then raising apoapsis from there, is horribly inefficient. you miss on all the oberth effect, and you may end up paying over twice the deltaV you\u0027d need otherwise. the most efficient point to make the manuever is in kerbin low orbit, a single big burn for 2000 m/s will get you directly to jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nof course, you already have problems with burn time, this will exacerbate them. i tell you, it is quite possible to make such a long burn in an efficient manner. but it takes practice. on the plus side, even if your burn is inefficient, it\u0027s still going to be better than the same burn in solar orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Irihi","CreatedById":211283,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-05-15T15:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
