I ended up force-quiting KSP to prevent it from re-autosaving, and just loaded my game back up. I went to the tracking station, flew the craft, and it immediately spun out of control and exploded. \u0022Well, ok, force-quit again, reload again, SAVE THE GAME,\u00A0turn on unbreakable joints, go to the tracking station, etc\u0022. This time, the craft immediately spun out of control but didn\u0027t explode because of the cheat. Reloaded the save\u00A0and tried turning \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E off, no improvement. Reloaded the save and tried turning off rigid attachment (something necessary to get it to launch), no improvement. I eventually gave up and figured that since I knew (well, was pretty sure) I\u0027d have had enough fuel to complete the mission, I\u0027d just cheat myself into the correct orbit, run the tests (pro tip: time warp to make everything calm down, select the part, then turn off time warp and the \u0022log whatever\u0022 button will appear in the menu that\u0027s already open from when you selected the part), and called it a day. There weren\u0027t any Kerbals on board or anything, so I just left it to explode next time I try to load it without the cheats enabled. Maybe I\u0027ll try to mount a \u0022rescue\u0022 mission for the science on-board that couldn\u0027t be transmitted back, but I completed the contract, so...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still don\u0027t know what the issue with my craft is, other than being long and skinny, so\u00A0I guess what I really need\u00A0is\u00A0a mod that gets rid of the Kraken.
