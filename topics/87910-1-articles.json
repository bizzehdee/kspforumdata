Till now!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI always wanted to make a design like this but before 0.25 stock never had the parts I wanted. I\u0027m still working on it, changing minor details (those lander legs..) etc but I\u0027m pretty happy with it now. You launch it from the pad, go with a 80 degree angle till 5000 or so, then go to 45 degrees. at 10.000 put it on 20 degrees and then slowly end up with 15 degrees at 20.000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that when air runs out I switch the 2 horizontal engines to rocket mode and change pitch (slowly)to 30 degrees. once the intake air runs out I also switch the other 2 engines to rocket mode and slowly go to 45 degrees. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can make it to 120KM with 1700 m/s remaining (using mechjeb it\u0027s only 1500) so I suppose that technically I could make a one way trip to the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding I just slowly coast back into the atmosphere towards KSC and use the jet engines to reduce speed. It\u0027s still a little bit tricky to get rid of horizontal speed but with the parachutes it\u0027s really safe to land this as long as you pay attention. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the wing design makes it really, really stable during flight and when changing course. The heavy behind is a bit problematic, but much less so than you would think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EItems for improvement? I\u0027m also making a cargo version once I improve this version a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NetHawk","CreatedById":126510,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T23:21:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome craft design!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to see the cargo version. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Can you share the craft file?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reimad","CreatedById":33625,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-20T15:23:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would, but I\u0027m not really sure how..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea came from this old comic book my father had.
