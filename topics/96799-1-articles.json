A quick read of the forum shows various solutions being used, ranging from mods, to mapping the abort action to perform the necessary engine switch. It is simply not practical to wait for the air-breathing jets to flame out on their own, or rapiers to automatically change mode, since your spaceplane can end up in a death spiral due to this happening asymmetrically. You cannot manually click the engine and toggle it because you will get exactly the same issue. Single-jet designs are vaguely possible, but not useful, since they lack the thrust to lift significant cargo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, the VAB does not require tier 3 to get to LKO because rockets, frankly, are simpler. Action groups are not a luxury that can be deferred in the SPH, they are a requirement from the start - although it would be practical to restrict it to one or two at early tiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I\u0027ve started using \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74195-0-90-%28Jan04-14%29-Action-Groups-Extended-250-Action-Groups-in-flight-editing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAGX\u003C/a\u003E, and I\u0027ll be sticking with it because it\u0027s nice that it has so many options and buttons, not to mention that it overrides career mode and gives me engine control back - but for those who prefer not to mod their game, stock really should make the spaceplanes workable \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively; if an engine is placed with mirror symmetry, make it act as such!

I have a couple of designs of spaceplanes from 0.25 using Mk2 parts, turbojet engines and relatively basic rockets. I have used these in 0.25 to launch satellites and space probes, and to rotate crew to and from a LKO space station. I imported the craft file to a 0.90 career mode I have been playing through. With the tier 2 but not tier 3 R\u0026amp;D centre, I can unlock all of the parts required. With the tier 2 SPH and tier 2 runway I can construct the planes and launch them. Without custom action groups, though, I can\u0027t actually fly them without fudging the default action groups to switch between air breathing and non-air breathing modes. In a real sense, for a space plane action groups are as necessary to make them functional as staging is for rockets (and staging is available in the tier 1 VAB). Perhaps a default action group (so that it comes with tier 2) in the SPH for \u0022air mode\u0022 and \u0022vacuum mode\u0022 would allow functional spaceplanes with the tier 2 SPH without breaking the concept of custom action groups as a tier 3 feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T18:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think unlocking more action groups per tier is a great idea (rather than all or none).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever on the plane building I disagree.
