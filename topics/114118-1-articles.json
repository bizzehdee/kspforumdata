I was looking for a way to get surface sample and reports from kerbin faster. The answer was in aircraft but I had to land, reports,take off, land etc... so I thought about a probe which is loaded on an aircraft (1-6 probes) and that would be dropped around kerbin biomes and then to takes the data and be recovered in the space center.\n\n**What it does ?**\n\nIt is basically a probe that can collect surface sample and do EVA reports without a kerbal. It\u0027s only purpose is on Kerbin usage.\n\nFor Science and Career games, the parts comes in Advanced Exploration techtree node.\n\n**Images :**\n\n[http://imgur.com/gallery/RFJBV/new](http://imgur.com/gallery/RFJBV/new)\n\n**HOW TO INSTALL :**\n\n1.
