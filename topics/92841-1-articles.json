I mean the editor overhaul alone just blows me away.

And I have to give you props, and let you know how amazed I am at how well you guys have handled this game. More developers should look at the way you have developed this game and learn, because I have been here since about .13, and its been one heck of a ride. Please continue to add more awesome things and make the game even better.
