Copilot Wehrton started to get a little giddy at the thought, while engineer Megta broke into questions immediately. \u00A0\u0022Is the descent module intact? Is it true that the flag was knocked over in ascent? Why, I can\u0027t wait to see the effects of the m\u00FCnar heat cycle after so many years!

Now can we finally get out of this tiny car and get a look at it on foot?\u0022 \u00A0Jeb\u0027s laugh came out as static. \u0022Ha-hah, just my style! Bring out the camera too, this is a milestone!\u0022 \u00A0EVA suits on, the crew depressurized the rover and stepped out. \u00A0The regolith under Valentina\u0027s feet was unlike the virgin soil she was used to. \u00A0It felt packed; she looked down and saw a bootprint, under her own boot. \u00A0She looked back up, and there it was. \u00A0Kerpollo 11. \u00A0Jebediah interrupted that thought.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Look at the TV, Bill!

\u00A0\u0022Well, one small step for Kerbal, one giant\u00A0leap for Kerbalkind.\u0022 \u00A0Jeb was about to add that he said \u0022a\u0022 in there somewhere, but was muted by the clapping and cheers. \u00A0Jeb decided to make a small speech. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u0022I\u0027d like to thank you all for coming here tonight, on this, the 30th anniversary of our\u00A0famous landing.\u0022 \u00A0Jeb flashed his famous smile. \u00A0\u0022I\u0027d like to thank Von Kerman, for designing our little craft.\u0022 \u00A0Von Kerman waved from his wheelchair.\u00A0\u00A0\u0022Bill, for saving both our\u00A0butts on the way down. \u00A0And for Bob, well, let\u0027s hold him in our hearts.\u0022 \u00A0At that, the crowd\u00A0started to bow their heads in respect. \u00A0\u0022I am also stepping down as senior training instructor at\u00A0the Kerbal Space Center. \u00A0Im gonna enjoy that fat\u00A0pension now, and I\u0027m sure Jerdus would love\u00A0to have my spinny chair.\u0022 \u00A0Plenty of laughs at that. \u00A0\u0022Its been a wonderful time with KASA, and\u00A0I\u0027ve glad to have been with you all!\u0022 \u00A0He was escorted back to his seat by a throng\u00A0of\u00A0fellow\u00A0kerbonauts. \u00A0Jebediah helped himself to a glass of sparkling grape juice, then turned to Bill. \u00A0\u0022Bill Kerman, how have you been?\u0022 said Jeb. \u00A0I need to talk to you outside.\u0022\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u0022Do I have to, these saltines are delicious!\u0022\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Jeb snapped. \u00A0\u0022Yes! \u00A0I need some fresh air!\u0022 \u00A0A few kerbols turned to face the outburst,\u00A0but Jeb flashed his smile, more and more so forced, and walked Bill outside. \u00A0It was summer at\u00A0the KSC. \u00A0The air was warm and muggy, even at night.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022uWFyplo.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uWFyplo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u0022Bill, I think I\u0027m turning into a cynic.\u0022 \u00A0Jeb\u0027s smile was gone now. \u00A0\u0022Well why is\u00A0that?\u0022 said Bill. \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u0022I\u0027m tired of being the posterboy for KASA. \u00A0KASA is half dead already. \u00A0KASA\u0027S never\u00A0going to do anything useful involving manned spaceflight in our lifetimes.\u0022 \u0022Its underfunded,\u00A0and constantly getting stripped down. \u00A0The missions they\u0027re planning are either underambitious,\u003Cbr\u003E\nor too relliant on uninvented technology\u00A0to ever get support.\u0022 \u00A0Bill was quick to respond. \u0022But Kongress\u2014\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u0022Dont get me started about Kongress! \u00A0Take for example the Star Shuttle. \u00A0Before, it was\u00A0a way to get back into space, and maybe even go to Minmus or Duna! \u00A0What did it turn out to be? \u00A0A plane built by commitee, unable of even saving OrbitLab. \u00A0And if a mission reaches prices equal to how much the Army pays to keep its toilets\u00A0clean, its too expensive!\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u0022I\u0027ve never seen you like this. \u00A0You okay Jeb?

\u00A0It\u0027s just one project, and I\u0027ll\u00A0come up with another one. \u00A0Look, Bob wouldn\u0027t want to see you like this.\u0022 \u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u0022What do we have to lose?\u0022 Jeb paused a bit. \u0022Kerpollo is slowly leaving the living\u00A0memory.
