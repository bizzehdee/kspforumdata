The way i\u0027m designing this will make it easier to customize later down the track - all the animation is rooted around the inner structure of the shroud, and the different variants are just parented to it (ie: told to follow the root in the chain).

What I learned from the development of the Dangit toolbox (that nobody\u0027s released yet...) is that complicated door animations with multiple parts really spike the drawcall count to the GPU, and slow the game down about 10fps when they\u0027re playing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach door segment is pretty loaded (no more than the current US parts, but I don\u0027t want to make the performance \u003Cem\u003Eworse\u003C/em\u003E), and the more segments i have, the worse the cumulative effect is. For each uniquely animated door segment, there\u0027s over 4 drawcalls. Increase that further with every customizable skin on top of that, and for a model that folds open as much as this will, it\u0027ll be a nightmare of lag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to have the doors have a smaller opening profile, but for the potential performance hit I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the best move.

Personally I would like something with a smaller radius, but I see your reasoning. I think the thing that looks most off about them right now is that they look too thin. Do you plan on making them thicker, like the current US? Also, do you have any wedges ready (textured or untextured) to put between the girders, to give us an picture of what the final model would look like with the new doors?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd just thinking out loud - part of the point of US2 is to be able to extend the wedges vertically to reduce part count, right? But now with those wide doors, have you thought about being able to extend them \u003Cem\u003Ehorizontally\u003C/em\u003E as well? In this case, the two exposed girders between the wide doors would disappear, and then the wide wedge would fully wrap around between the two door edges. In combination with being able to vertically expand wedges, it could save a decent amount of parts. I could see it being used for fuel wedges and life support wedges for those long journeys or space stations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this would limit the radius of the \u0022wide-wedge\u0022 parts, so they would only fit on the 2.5m storage rack.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
