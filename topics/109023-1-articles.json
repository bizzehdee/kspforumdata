Specifically:\n\n- I\u0027m having a hard time choosing between RT2 and Antenna Range. I\u0027m personally inclined to RT2 as it seems more realistic, I like the delay issue for probe communication, the added layer of having to use satellites to establish uplinks, etc. But I really don\u0027t want to micromanage satellites every hour because the orbital periods within a given constellation isn\u0027t perfectly synced. Also I\u0027m not 100% sure how much busywork is involved in pointing the conic antennas in the right direction for there to be an uplink. I don\u0027t mind having to do it once but I really don\u0027t know if the antenna keeps pointing at the right spot after you set it or if I have to adjust it as it goes on its orbit. **TL;DR: My perception is that there is a lot of busy work and micromanagement on RT. Is that true or some sort of misconception?**\n- The other mod I have some questions about is Deadly Reentry continued. As of 1.0 I don\u0027t know (and can\u0027t seem to find) the main differences between stock reentry and deadly reentry. What does DRE add to 1.0? As far as I can tell I can still use the stock fairings (which I enjoy for the scorched effect) so that\u0027s not an issue but what are the key differences between DRE and Stock?\n\nIf anyone could give me a hand about this it\u0027d be pretty great! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Minwaabi","CreatedById":91050,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T13:18:24Z","Content":"Remote Tech: There will be some micromanagement but not a lot. Yes, satellites will move around a bit and you will have to resync their orbits. If you get their orbitals to be nearly identical, you will not have to do this every hour. More like every week in game time if you are using a small number of LKO\u0027s. Using more satellites than you absolutely need and/or using Synchronous orbits (which you should be using anyway for that task) will mean that you shouldn\u0027t have to adjust orbits more than once a month in game time or so. (At least in my experience). It doesn\u0027t matter which way your satellites point. So don\u0027t worry about that at all. Conic antennas have a button you click and then select a target, it could be the KSC, another craft, or a planetary body. If it\u0027s a planetary body, you will hit all craft in its cone. One of the tricks is to launch comm sats with lots of antennas. (Since you have to have at least one antenna pointing at probes traveling to their destinations (preferably 2). Once they get there, you can just use the antenna (or 2) for that body. Hope that helps. \n\nDRE: If you look through the posts on DRE\u0027s page you will find lots of info about what it changes. However, here is a quick summary from Starwaster:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Mainly that only a portion of a part\u0027s mass is used when applying heat. That\u0027s the skin. (or hull if you prefer that term) \n\u003E If one thing has more mass than another (and all other factors are equal) then the more massive thing will heat up more slowly. This is a large part of why stock reentries feel weak.\n\u003E \n\u003E The other reasons are \n\u003E \n\u003E Slower reentry speed over Kerbin than over Earth.\n\u003E \n\u003E Less time spent in reentry\n\u003E \n\u003E To correct these two problems, convectiveFactor was increased to 50. This means things are subject to convective heating 50x faster. (you could also think of it as 50x the heat, but in practice, part temperature and skin temperature act to limit this so that things will heat up only until they reach equilibrium or explode)\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, the amount of heat produced in reentry has been increased so that it is comparable to an Earth reentry\n\u003E \n\u003E radiationFactor was also increased to 50 so that it\u0027s still possible to reach thermal equilibrium after convectiveFactor was increased.\n\u003E \n\u003E Also: OP was updated to remove any confusion as to what to do with ModularFlightIntegrator."},{"CreatedByName":"Broax","CreatedById":109333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T14:19:03Z","Content":"Thanks...
