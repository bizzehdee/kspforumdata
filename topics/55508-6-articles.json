In RAM it occupies the same space. The reason is that GPUs only understand uncompressed textures and that compressed with DXT1, DXT3, DXT5 etc. So, all PNG, TGA, JPEG etc. textures exist in RAM either uncompressed or get converted to DXTn. TextureReplacer and TextureCompressor (aka Active Memory Reduction Mod) look for uncompressed textures in RAM (only those loaded from GameData/ dir) and compress them to DXT1 or DXT5 when possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shaw","CreatedById":64788,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T14:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9508397/TextureReplacer-0.10.2.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E0.10.2\u003C/a\u003E released.
