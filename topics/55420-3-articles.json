For example, if your toolbar is currently a single row, and some other plugin decides to add a new button to it, that single row will be extended to the right, maintaining the single row. If you had it in a single column before, the toolbar will extend to the bottom, maintaining the single column.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, some plugins will create their buttons \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter\u003C/strong\u003E the toolbar has initialized its screen position, provoking the above behaviour. If they created their buttons before that initialization, the same behaviour would take place, but would be \u0022overwritten\u0022 by that initialization in a later step. (I hope that does make sense.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the third-party plugins are not at fault here. Some of them don\u0027t need to be started right when the game starts, so they just don\u0027t and of course will not create their buttons right away. The Toolbar Plugin cannot differentiate between \u0022plugin has been started and creates its button\u0022 (but the button has been known in previous game sessions) and \u0022some plugin creates a new button.\u0022 So it doesn\u0027t really know whether to keep the current toolbar width or not. In the case of a single row it will never keep the current width, in all other cases it will.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I have an idea on how to fix this, will need to test it of course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-23T17:45:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022blizzy78\u0022 data-cite=\u0022blizzy78\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I have an idea on how to fix this, will need to test it of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.
