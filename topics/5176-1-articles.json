In some sort of absurd anti-piracy idea the dumbfckus at EA games decided to only allow 2 installs per registration key, EVEN IF IT\\\u0027S THE SAME REGISTERED OWNER INSTALLING THE GAME. I basically said, \u0027F. U.\u0027 to EA at that point. My external HD died (that\\\u0027s where I kept Spore) I reformatted and re-installed everything, and then the laptop died a horrible death (along with the HD). So instead of bending over backwards to play a game I legally bought and registered just to fluff someones scrotum at EA games I said enough with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.thesedayscontinue.org/images/smilies/fuckyou.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022fuckyou.gif\u0022\u003E Thanks EA Games, get fckued.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
