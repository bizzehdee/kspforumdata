Obviously the transmit speed would be something like 90% of the lowest bandwidth for the fastest satellite \u0022route\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eits just something i was thinking now. if there is a mod or someone asked the same, please show me the thread. ill be glad to read it\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T04:28:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely check out the AntennaRange and RemoteTech mods.
