How would one go about calculating said moment if the center of mass changes as a function of time? Would an approximation using the regular 1/2*m*r^2 formula be decent enough? Anyways, sorry if its a dumb question, its just that I really need to know if my rocket will be stable.

If the rocket is a box shape of course it is not decent enough.. If the mass is not distributed evenly neither..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general approach to these problems is to split the rocket in several parts which can easily be calculated (at least solveable integrals, preferably rho gets outside of the integeral so it becomes a constant - and better yet if the shapes are also some of the known inertias). Calculated each of those parts around the part\u0027s centroid and then use the parallel axis theorem to get the sum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as for rocketry: most of the mass is indeed fuel, so a first order approximation can be done by a cylinderical shape. However do realise that the mass is dependent on t. And for solid fuel the burn generally goes from inward to outwards, so for solid rockets a better approximation is a thin walled cylinder, where the thickness is dependent on the time (I = m/2 (r1^2 \u002B r2^2) ). Where r1 is (in a good build solid rocket where the amount of propellant burning is constant) a square root of the time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-26T02:29:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAfraid not. Moment of inertia is a functional of mass distribution, and you have mass distribution changing in this problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to recompute the moment of inertia, but there is a shortcut.
