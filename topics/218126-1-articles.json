The more crowded space is, the cheaper interstellar travel is, and the lower technology your average civilization possesses, the easier it gets to provide such justification. The key thing is to provide some sort of relatively rare resource that every civilization heavily benefits by. This does not need to be heavily consistent with what would likely be the case in real life, it just needs to be consistent with the rest of the story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor territory, you could have an active setting to where not all of the active players aren\u0027t to the level of technology to where they can\u0027t fully terraform planets, and semi habitable planets (ie has volatiles on it, and good gravity) are super valuable as you can toss one trillion people on them and have the economic output of such. This has a few implications, that being that lives are very valuable. This implies that AI is either not sufficient enough or not safe enough to replace all of labor. This also implies that living in space/on non habitable planets is more expensive then living on a hiveworld, this would mean that most of the people in space are either there for specific jobs that need to be done there, or are rich enough to afford it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s hard to imagine an interstellar civilization fighting over elements that support life, light elements are pretty common, and are relatively easy to generate with fusion in a worst case scenario. Not to mention, you\u0027d likely lose more light elements just transporting the stuff interstellar. Heavy metals are really the only thing that makes sense here, as they\u0027re rare enough to where they could be worthwhile to transport, and with stars having different metallicity (plus some of those possessing especially lucrative metallic\u00A0chthonian planets), some stars would be much better at mining heavy metals then others. This would very likely be more energy intensive then mining the trace amounts in whatever solar system you live in, so throughput would likely be the priority here. You\u0027d need to have something that drives up the demand for these metals, be it exponentially expanding fleets of ships or a massive race to make matrioshka brains. I\u0027d err against making every faction heavily expansionist, but having a few that are can definitely drive some conflict.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-01T04:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe can upgrade the SETI equipment to send them messages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot those stupid childish pictures, of course, but serious literature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002250419391.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022159.91\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u0022938\u0022 src=\u0022https://cv9.litres.ru/pub/c/cover_max1500/50419391.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThus we\u0027ll explain them that capitalists exploit their proletarians, and this is very wrong,\u003Cbr\u003E\nTheir proletarians will rise, defeat the exploiters, and join the Communist Union of the Multiverse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SunlitZelkova","CreatedById":206402,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-01T06:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224298854\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218126\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221688172802\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s look at this as a microcosm shall we?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt work there are people we tolerate only because we have to, and people we actually like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWar in nature with animals is often about dominance, who gets to have control over this or or access over that.

Sci-fi with heterogenous civilizations is often the result of a transplant of a historical era into a sci-fi setting, whereas people who work on an organic narrative of the space era tend to impose their understanding of the required levels of development - including economic, societal, and political - as a minimum requirement, thus locking out any alternative system. \u003Cem\u003EId est\u003C/em\u003E an American writer can set out to worldbuild a Galactic Empire with a God-King and then strech some fluff to explain its evolution, but absent a set end goal, working from the bottom up, they are overwhelmingly likely to end up with a Space America or a Space European social democracy, depending on their preferred political animal, and it wouldn\u0027t even be an act of conscious soapboxing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a drastic example, consider the Fourth International (Posadist), a splinter Trotskyist group; they spell out in official doctrine that UFOs are spacecraft of alien communists that would help them conduct a global revolution - because only (their one true branch of) Communism can achieve interstellar flight. Soviet sci-fi operates under broadly similar assumptions - once you go beyond near-future stories with their German/Japanese/Angloamerican/global capitalist villains, you find planet-wide Earth governments with post-nation, quasi-post-scarcity societies with small and efficient democratic governments implying achievement of Communist Nirvana. Conflict comes from occasional internal renegades, from untamed natural threats, from primitive or hyperadvanced alien socities (often the aliens are human for no good reason), but never from a peer faction.
