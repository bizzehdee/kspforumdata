I WAS planning on doing some drives for KSPI after I finished up my 2x1 reactor, I think that I will have to physically scale my reactors instead of using tweakscale because there are a lot of things that would have to be tweaked, but its a simple matter of changing some of the values around and using a scale command for the different sizes, I think I will have a 2x1 and 4x2 and then also a 1x1 and 2x2. After I finish the 2x1 model I will apply it to the 1x1 and then run off the scales... I am still trying to decide if I want to apply an emissive layer to the reactor as suggested... I am not sure they would have that style of radiation, as I do not know the specifics of it. I read up on it in Wikipedia but I don\u0027t know under what specific circumstances in the real world application that this sort of radiation is visible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways there are new alcubierre drives in the latest KSPI and I thought that some LLL versions would be killer so I may look into if if lack has not already.

The white hull piece that encases that is the sealed room that the Kerbal actually use to monitor the reactor. I may build an IVA for this eventually, but as it sits right now, I am leaving the internal passable but NOT livable as no one wants to live next to a Reactor Core. The game does not have a way for us to walk around in the ship, and I know that the pods are \u0022livable\u0022 even though they only have chairs so I may change this once I actually figure out how to make an IVA scene but for now I am leaving it as is. The skin will have a panel in the recessed area that has light up buttons and a interlock or something to turn to activate the decoupler, but since all of that is fake until I can get it to work the way I want within the confines of KSPI it will all just be dummy skin stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWizerd","CreatedById":106063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T10:35:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELack got my juices flowing for an idea to modify the reactor housing...I\u0027m going to have to chop some more of the 2x1 hull up though to add more bits\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lack","CreatedById":47978,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-31T12:57:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GregroxMun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMOARz Please?

My only other comment would be that it might be cool to put a little radiator grill piece on each side below the reactor part, maybe you could steal one from the vents on the various LLL engines. Perhaps it could even glow red underneath the grill when the reactor is cookin\u0027 - that might be kind of neat!

I will have to build a thermal rocket engine too. As for the reactor housing, your the second person to say something about making it glow... the reactor housing keeps all of that kind of stuff contained so vents wouldn\u0027t be very... containment minded, however it did give me another idea and since I have to build an emissive layer anyways I think it wont be too much of an issue... the Pipes for the molten salt heat exchange could feasibly become hot enough to glow with heat similar to the engines. The water not so much because it would be steam, that is under lower pressures but making that one pipe glow a low orange I will look into.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that visually this reactor is fairly boring, very little effects and that is kinda how these things are if there running safe you know? I am trying to come up with stuff to add to it that will give it a bit more of a kick, and make it less like the vanilla parts trust me it was originally just a 2x1 hull piece. The generator just has been upgraded from blank hull to a hull with a warning sign. So I am getting ideas as I go and you all helping me by throwing out ideas is defiantly helping! For the generator, I am thinking of having an animated part that spins outside of the 2x1 hull piece a little bit. The idea here is to have just SOMETHING on it that is doing something because really a generator house is mostly going to just have a big huge electric motor in it that is being spun by a turbine to create electricity instead of consume it.
