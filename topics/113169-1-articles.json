Just dead silence from Squad for the last month after lots of talk of fixing reheating, drag, and memory leaks in 1.0.3? Wow. I know they\u0027re kind of standoffish with the community but man. I guess we can assume no more fixes until 1.1. (Or 1.1.2 etc ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )"},{"CreatedByName":"softweir","CreatedById":2795,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T03:17:46Z","Content":"That\u0027s excellent news!\n\n\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s great and all but what about the existing game, the existing bugs, your existing customers?\n\nFirstly, why talk about bugs before KSP1.0.3 is out and we know what, if any, bugs remain?\n\nSecondly, Unity 4 runs on Playstation, so porting it will be relatively easy. It can be hoped that doing so will create a disproportionately large additional revenue stream which will provide funds to support the debugging of KSP for everybody. And that\u0027s assuming Squad do the porting, for all you know it may be a company who specialises in coding for Playstation (and has a relationship with Sony, which makes the process easier). In which case - no coding work for Squad, just extra dosh.\n\nFinally, this is advance hype. Note that there is no date mentioned and no details about retail outlets etc, so it is likely that this signals a firm agreement to proceed and that (whoever does the work) the actual porting isn\u0027t due to start for weeks or months. Plenty of time for Squad to work on patching and fixing.\n\nEDIT: My points answer several other excessively negative comments. More cash means more scope for future development. And who cares if the Playstation can\u0027t cope with KSP as we know it? (I must admit I would like some you know, actual dev notes. An announcement like this really ought not replace our time-hallowed traditions. We have an Announcements forum for that!)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T03:22:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 03:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by softweir**"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T03:18:06Z","Content":"Who over there thought that we would be excited about this announcement?
