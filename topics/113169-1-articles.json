It can be hoped that doing so will create a disproportionately large additional revenue stream which will provide funds to support the debugging of KSP for everybody. And that\u0027s assuming Squad do the porting, for all you know it may be a company who specialises in coding for Playstation (and has a relationship with Sony, which makes the process easier). In which case - no coding work for Squad, just extra dosh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, this is advance hype. Note that there is no date mentioned and no details about retail outlets etc, so it is likely that this signals a firm agreement to proceed and that (whoever does the work) the actual porting isn\u0027t due to start for weeks or months. Plenty of time for Squad to work on patching and fixing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: My points answer several other excessively negative comments. More cash means more scope for future development. And who cares if the Playstation can\u0027t cope with KSP as we know it? (I must admit I would like some you know, actual dev notes.
