You seem to forget that if you need a Shuttle capability on 10% of the launches, you are paying for that capability on \u003Cem\u003Eevery\u003C/em\u003E launch, used or not. Every launch you are paying for 90\u002B tons of orbiter to orbit, which is just a crew box.

ISS habitable volume is under 3 skylab\u00A0volumes, for example. 3 launches vs dozens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo one is comparing a subcompact with a FS PU. We\u0027re comparing a taxi cab with a pickup with a dump truck. If you are hauling people, take a taxi. if you are hauling something tiny that needs a guy to unload it and do something, take a PU. If you need a huge load of stuff just dumped someplace, use a dump truck. If you need a huge load put someplace, then a few guys need to shovel some of it, I would ask is it better to make 30 trips with the PU, or 1 dump truck followed by a taxi?\u00A0If the latter is cheaper, then the latter wins, if the former is cheaper, then by all means, use the PU. I think in the modern world, most stuff could be delivered in an automated fashion, and if the first payload is a crew compartment, then you send the crew there, and now you don\u0027t need the crew/cargo vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be clear, you compare all costs to properly determine what gets the desired job done most cost effectively.

Its was a Future Rocket. Korolev instead had plans to use Gyroscope to control all the engines in the stage in situ. But his death was a major impact. There were 30 engines, no problem we could put 50 or even 100, but to control each engines was a problem at the time. We can build an N-1 today and go to a Round Trip of Mars instead, but Life Support in place of LK Lander. Engine Stability was a major Issue, Korolev\u0027s death caused his Engine Plate Idea to Fail. Even Saturn V had this Problem of Vibration and Instability, see Apollo 6. N-1 instead of Mechanical (Best) was Computerized (Worst) and wires, pipes failed it. An Advantage to Saturn-V was its Less no.
