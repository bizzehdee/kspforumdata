But when the kerbal is out of the capsule, and the remote guidance unit should be working, whenever I try to do something (such as transmit crew reports) I get \u0022no connection to send command on\u0022. Note that all of this happens while there is a solid yellow line between mission control and my rocket, showing an active connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tested remote tech on stock KSP and all worked as expected, this issue only comes up in RO.

This was at a shallow angle, low G forces. Its possible I would have skipped out of the atmosphere again, but at the time of the destruction the heating should have been modest.

Do you have anything installed besides what is listed on the Required/Recommended/Supported list? If you do, then I can\u0027t and won\u0027t guarantee you anything. Furthermore, we could tag stuff (Actually we do, however there is nothing that shows at this time in the VAB), but if some other mod overwrites something, if it doesn\u0027t remove that tag, then you\u0027ll still show the RO tag, even though it\u0027s been modified elsewhere. That is why the list of mods in the OP is so important, we have specifically designed things to run with that list, and that list only.\u003Cp\u003ENow personally, I use PartCatalog. It does separate parts into what mod it\u0027s from, very handy, and organizationally just plain smart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast, if every part you use is failing, maybe some more than others, then you need to look at your technique. Like I said earlier you stated you were using a perigee of 55km, that is way too shallow and I\u0027m not surprised you are burning up. You\u0027ve gotta raise that 2-3x what you\u0027ve been doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedAV8R","CreatedById":94171,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-11T19:31:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@night81:\u003C/strong\u003E Great bug report.
