I just wanted everything to be restated and more elaborate than what I\u0027ve been seeing. I understand that there is science modules and that there is the tech trees and that they unlock new parts and the subassemblies, but what do they actually MEAN? How do they WORK?

The first available one is a crewed capsule. The existing temperature, pressure, and gravity sensors will also produce science points. There will also be new science parts. Different parts have different requirements as far as altitude, biomes etc. Doing the same experiment in the same kind of place as you\u0027ve done before will have diminishing returns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your vessel has produced the science points, you have to cash them in by either landing on Kerbin, or transmitting with an antenna. Different antennas have different ranges, and there will be some new ones in .22. There\u0027s a penalty of some percentage when transmitting instead of landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027ve cashed in some science points, you can spend them at the R\u0026amp;D center to open whatever node of the tech tree you like, not dependent on the kind of experiments you\u0027ve been doing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lheim","CreatedById":62665,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-12T06:19:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI watched a bit of the preview podcast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou get science points through crew reports or eva reports or science modules you can pop onto your ship, which can be done via right-click context menus or staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery different type of location you access will provide different results for these experiments. Repeating the same experiment in the same location will have diminishing returns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can just transmit data back to Kerbin, which may take a hefty penalty in how valuable it is, depending, versus actually returning the experiment back home. Transmitting takes a significant amount of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have your research points, you can unlock new selections of parts in the R\u0026amp;D building, in a tree of options. This will only apply to career mode; you\u0027ll start off career mode with a really limited selection of parts and develop from there. But in sandbox mode all will be available from the start.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubassemblies don\u0027t have to be unlocked; they\u0027re just a new feature in the vehicle editor. What it means is that you can create things like satellites or lifters or rovers, save them seperately, then bring them in as whole chunks to just plug together. So you might create a new lander and then just plug it on top of a standard lifter you\u0027ve already designed before.
