Please be only slightly offended as there\u0027s a reason why I must thank you by insulting you. It all started last year when I purchased your very fun game and started my own abortive attempts in creating spaceships to plunge into the depths of space and boldly go yadda yadda yadda. It was in the middle of one of my attempts that my young son Charlie (aged 2 1/2) saw the spaceship suffer multiple staging failure and plummet like a brick onto the launch pad creating a ginormous explosion that killed all 3 kerbals onboard. He thought it was hilarious. Thus began a period of Charlie wanting to play \u0022Spaceships\u0022 where his job was to act as keyboard manager and push the buttons that Daddy directed. This necessitated frequent saving but was fun. Charlie would sit on my lap, we would count down and then he would push space (or more accurately he would push space several times causing explosive failure on the launchpad) to start a rocket journey. We\u0027ve been to the Mun and Minimus and back and set-up a Space Station. Right now we are working on a re-usable Shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly though this is where it all begins to go pear-shaped. He now, thanks to you, is absolutely fixated on Spaceships. Any spaceships. I\u0027ve seen him stick several duplo blocks together and then watch as he counts down and then runs round the room going \u0022bwaaaaaaa\u0022 in the style of your rocket exhaust with the rocket in his hand. Some may think this sweet but sadly I know better. Whenever we go to the shops he looks for Spaceships, any spaceships. Anything that smells of NASA or space exploration is played with. He now ignores all his other toys (except Minions from Despicable Me) and wants only spaceships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you know what you have done? You have bankrupted me. I will now inevitably face the burden of having to support him through schools that teach electronics, science, aviation, astronomy and astro-physics. This means a private education. Do you realize how much this costs? By planting the seed of awesomeness in his young mind you have doomed me to years of watching him doing all sorts of extra-activities such as scuba diving, gliders, Russian and Chinese lessons, staying up at night so he can star-gaze through some ridiculously expensive telescope, pilots licenses, sending him to SANDHURST so he can become an officer, join the air corps, join the ESA and become a Spaceship Driver (or Astronaut to use the common terminology). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I would like to thank you for inspiring young Charlie and making him spaceship mad. that you have also doomed me to working flat out to afford all the stuff and more importantly the education background that is needed for someone to become a Space Captain of tomorrow is however why I am also calling you sods. I hope you understand where I\u0027m coming from though and please keep up the very excellent work that you have done with this game. That it inspires children in becoming spaceship mad is something truly singular among the legions of games out there.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T10:04:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 10:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Keepbro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EProfanity is a no-no, censored or no. :)\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T09:57:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey, hey.
