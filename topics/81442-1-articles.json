Assuming I have to do the maneuver at instant t0, when it is the best moment to start it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) I suppose I cannot apply the same answer in case of big delta-vs, can I? The time required to achieve the required delta-v is so big that in the meantime the rocket angle changes alot compared to the required ejection angle. So how do you plan your transfer maneuvers when using ionic thrusters?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T19:10:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) The most commonly accepted approach is to try and burn equal times before and after the nominal manouvre. Except when landing, then you need to \u003Cem\u003Efinish\u003C/em\u003E the burn by the nominal time or you\u0027ll crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) If your burn will take too long, sometimes you can split it. Do some one orbit, go round the primary, do some more. There\u0027s a limit though, since your ejection burn has to be single.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LordCorwin","CreatedById":114256,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T19:18:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, so small ammount, then circularize the orbit, then another ammount, etc...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that the game doesn\u0027t allow to use rockets when time-accelerating even when using ionic thrusters, right?

Set up your manouvre node, but only start burning two minutes before and keep until two minutes after. Note down how much is left to burn - around 800 m/s or so. Delete the node and set a new one at the next periapsis for that amount. Make one (elliptical) orbit, then do the same thing again. Make another orbit, another burn, and you should be on course for Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murph","CreatedById":90837,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-11T19:48:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LordCorwin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LordCorwin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, so small ammount, then circularize the orbit, then another ammount, etc...\u003Cp\u003EI understand that the game doesn\u0027t allow to use rockets when time-accelerating even when using ionic thrusters, right?
