You may have a hard time with lag and performance in general.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a solution for you guys. I found a Graphics Card that will get your FPS from 10 fps up to 70 fps. I know the frustration of playing with 10 fps on any game. But the GT 710 is good enough to get 70 fps. I recently got it because of that and I had a freaking NVS 300 with only\u00A0512 MB DDR3. I specifically got the MSI 2GB one and at times I got 100 fps. I even put it in all high settings and it still got to 70 fps. And I am not a paid advertiser (even though this sounds like I am)\u00A0I just thought this would be worth sharing.\u00A0I know this GPU isn\u0027t a GTX 1080 Ti but it will do you good on other medium demanding games.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
