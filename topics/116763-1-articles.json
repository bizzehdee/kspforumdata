It has been bothering me, so now I\u0027ll bother the rest of you with it. I expect that this will be a rather uncomfortable question around here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat, in space, is there of value that anyone could make a business or economy out of?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is there, either not on Earth or so rare on Earth as to overcome initial launch costs, that found in space that that humans would want more of? Or is there something that can only be made it space that would be useful to one or all of us? Can you make a business case for space?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big business of satellite communications is a good example of what I mean with that question. There is a market for it, and it can only be done in outer space (specifically LEO or GSO orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, scientific missions are not good examples of what I mean. Knowledge of outer space (and it\u0027s various parts) is essential, certainly. My question couldn\u0027t be answered without knowledge of what is in space. But scientific surveying and analysis can only be done once or twice per question and subject/object, limiting continuous viability. Not to mention that scientific knowledge, although valuable, is not really sellable. Put another way, if you would just give grants for scientific studies of something until your curiosity was satisfied, it\u0027s not really a business and you should not expect any return on your investment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to start by limiting discussion to existing or theorized to exist possibilities. Yes, there are plenty of examples in fiction. No, we don\u0027t need to discuss them here. By the same token, there is no need to discuss \u0027the potential infinite of space.\u0027 We know there are things in outer space, could you narrow it down to one thing, please?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, to save discussion time, if you propose businesses that already exist on Earth (ex. mining for platinum, real-estate), please include in your post how your proposal is expected to be competitive with those businesses while handling the costs of space-travel or what is different in the product that justifies the price tag. As well, any proposal that depends on a demand that doesn\u0027t yet exist must also explain how such a demand should come to exist. For example, please do not discuss mining ice water on Mars to sell to Mars colonists unless you can say why there should even be a colony to sell ice water to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease keep discussion of spaceflight relevant to your proposals. There are other threads to discuss the cost of rockets. I want to know the cost in context to the money to be made. There is also no value in any statement about the cost of spaceflight is too expensive to make any business viable. Instead, try to think of something that can only be found in outer space that\u0027s worth any cost of any rocket. Finally, any post that can be summarized as \u0027there\u0027s nothing of value out there, stay home\u0027 will be considered trolling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this doesn\u0027t just have to be about business. If you can think of any other reason to visit outer space that can overcome the massive price tag, feel free to explain. But please stick to social factors, \u0027exploration\u0027, \u0027because it\u0027s there\u0027, and \u0027because it would be awesome\u0027 are not good examples. Additionally, I must regrettably pre-empt discussion of Earth-wide extinction events. That has, and is discussed in other threads.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, why go to space? Is there anything you\u0027d want out there? Please discuss...any body outside of Earth, manned or unmanned. What would make people want to go to outer space?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DBowman","CreatedById":122106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T21:28:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbital Solar Power Stations - avoids 50% losses through atmospheric absorption \u0026amp; \u0027cosine\u0027 / tracking in exchange for have to microwave / laser the power down.

Once you have \u0027something big\u0027 going on in earth / lunar space - for example lunar mining/manufacturing \u0026amp; orbital assembly of thousands of square kilometers of mirrors / PV cells etc. then it can be worth taking advantage of deltaV economics. It\u0027s deltaV cheaper to get to LEO from Mars or Luna than from Earth. There might be enough convenient water on Luna for shipping to LEO, but maybe not. If you \u0027exclude setup costs \u0026amp; supply chain length/time\u0027 then you can ship water \u0026amp; carbon feed-stocks for plastics - mylar mirrors etc to LEO from Mars cheaper than you can from Earth.

These people would teleoperate the equipment from Earth. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the business plan :\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Develop self replicating factory technology\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Use the factories and the land rights you can get on Earth to stripmine large chunks of the Earth to make more factories\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use the factories to build a lot of rockets, enough to launch a complete copy of the factory to the Moon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Land the factory on the Moon in a series of landings. It would have to be at the poles so that parts of it are always exposed to sunlight, and parts always exposed to darkness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Have the factory copy itself...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure, this would be colossally expensive - but in the long run, you\u0027d have covered the entire Moon with factories. You\u0027d be able to make back your investment thousands of fold. You would either send the manufactured products back to Earth with a mass driver, or put them into Lunar orbit and use them to build gigantic centrifuge wheel habitats. People would live in these habitats, supplied with a constant supply of equipment and materials launched from the Moon, and would pay rent, paying back the initial investment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"55delta","CreatedById":101735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T23:48:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s some ideas here...good. Time to see if some of these are viable. I\u0027ll start with the easiest one first: space tourism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis business is \u0027easiest\u0027 mostly because the trail has been blazed. In 2001, Dennis Tito, former JPL scientist and businessman paid about $20 million, made it through the necessary training, went up to the ISS as third passenger on a Soyuz TM for a seven day visit. There have been six others since then. This isn\u0027t even counting that in 1990, Tokyo Broadcasting System paid to have a reporter, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown to Mir for seven days. However, he didn\u0027t count as a tourist because his daily broadcasts apparently made him a business traveler. I\u0027ve seen prices paid between $20 million and $40 million, which makes it all the more regrettable that I can\u0027t figure out the price on both a Soyuz-U and Soyuz TM. The reason they stopped adding tourists in 2010, when they expanded the regular crews and so filled that third seat. There was some talk of adding tourists again in 2015...although I\u0027m not so sure if that will happen at the moment. So there is certainly an industry here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you know, many people are looking at providing sub-orbital flights. It\u0027s not hard to see why. Sub-orbital hopped have the least fuel requirements, which means possible SSTOs with plenty of passenger room, while still providing that full experience of both a big view of Earth and several hours zero-g. Divide the costs plus margin amongst say...10 passengers to knock a zero or more off the usual ticket price, and you should have a successful business with good market demand. It\u0027s only that no one is at that stage yet. Word has it that Virgin Galactic\u0027s VSS Voyager is expected to be flown in 2015. I have no idea if it\u0027ll happen on then or 2016 though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside of sub-orbital hops, things aren\u0027t quite as rosy. Both fuel and provision costs rise with distance. Still, there are efforts, such as plans for an inflatable space hotel or circumlunar trips. I expect much bigger ticket prices there, but I would expect that about 9 days of travel to and from the Moon wouldn\u0027t seem unreasonable to anyone who has a $100 million to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I expect tourism to other planets to be a rather hard sell with current technology. I believe it is 9 months to travel to Mars, and 4 months to travel to Venus (halve those if you can arrange a constant source of thrust), same to come back. That\u0027s less a vacation and more a sabbatical and you\u0027d want less a space capsule and more a cruise liner if you were to travel that long. So I\u0027m not expecting to hear about tours to Mars or Venus anytime in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, space tourism has great potential involving travel to outer space.
