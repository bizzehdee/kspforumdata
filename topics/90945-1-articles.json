Im looking for some help, and since well i can, i propose a challenge to the community, to help me make the best SSTO design that utilizes a similar engine setup to that of my \u0022Tri-Fighter\u0022 lineup to help me replace my aging designs that are as of now a little bit short range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some pics of my HK-203F Tri-Fighter III design, my most recent one, being able to make it to the mun, land, and return to kerbin without refueling (on a idea trip, if i dont make the ascent/timing perfect it wont make it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/wAbbe#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(the last picture is a bomber variant based on the same hull style)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow id like some assistance from the fellow SSTO designers here, so im looking for someone who can make something of similar appearance, and rebuild it so that it can go to duna, circularize, and return to kerbin in one piece. I dont mind if the shape changes here and there, so feel free to change stuff like hull, length, width, wing layout, ect, but try to keep at least the engine cluster somewhat suimilar, with 1 engine elevated with respect to the rest. My best variant can make it to mun/minmus, land, and return home alive. I can also make it to duna, but i wont have anywhere near enough fuel left to land there let alone return home in one piece. Now anyone here who wants to help me fix my build, or perhaps make a new one from scratch is welcome. All in all, i would prefer to keep the basic style there (3 engine rear, with say some extra stuff clipped inside, like say the nuke, cant get that to look good at all unless i clip it). It has to be stock as i dont really use mods yet (FAR subs are ok, so long as it will fly in the stock game somewhat) but you are welcome to use any mods to make it look cooler for screenies ect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, i mostly made this thread as no matter what i tried, i just couldnt get my designs to get anywhere but close range. Ofc i tend to build a frame that i feel looks nice, and then cram the internals full of something, so maybee my designs are all doomed to fail, but still, id like to see what teh community can come up with, maybee get me something to replace my aging designs that just dont have the range and features id like. Ive also managed to get my BEST version of this to go to duna and have about half the fuel to return to base, so it is defenetely possible, just seems im not the best engineer and cant seem to go that one final step.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-23T00:16:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2014 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"i like turtles","CreatedById":169426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T07:31:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI dont think you know how to insert images directly into the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst you have to upload an image/image album to imgur. then you copy the URL of the image/image album.
