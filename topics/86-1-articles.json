It\u0027s a game with a lot of potential, and I look forward to playing it more and more as more features are released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seem to be having some difficulty with rocket construction, though. Specifically, there seems to be a limit to how large I can make a rocket due to the camera. In this thread: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=78.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=78.0\u003C/a\u003E, I can see that some people have made some very large rockets. When I try to make a rocket that big, I move the command part to the top of my screen and attach parts beneath it, but after adding some parts, the last parts I can add seem to be going through the floor. No matter which angle I rotate the camera to, there are only so many parts I can fit on the screen at once. It seems that if I could zoom out or move the \u0027center\u0027 of the screen up, I could use more parts. Am I missing something here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I\u0027ve made sense in this post. Clearly this is a difficulty that others have not experienced or have found a way around. Someone please let me know what I can do to get around this camera problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jangofett287","CreatedById":25,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-11T19:33:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ein VAB, scroll wheel moves the camera up and down. the middle mouse button (press scroll wheel) allows you to move the cam closer and farther away from the center\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"illectro","CreatedById":763,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-07-13T18:59:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy laptop doesn\u0027t have scrollwheel functionality on the touchpad, instead I have to build big things by detaching lower stages and inserting new ones, the game needs some alternative camera controls.
