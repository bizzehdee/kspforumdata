If I find myself veering off course north or south I set up the appropriate yaw trim until I am back on course.\n\nAny-one else doing this?"},{"CreatedByName":"JoCRaM","CreatedById":84138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:00:20Z","Content":"Or use CAPS-LOCK to switch to fine control."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T16:39:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E We all know by now that tall thin rockets that start a gravity turn very early on in the flight is the way to go to orbit. \n\u003E But we have probably also all seen one of our tall thin rockets, that works fine going straight up, turn to spaghetti as soon as you touch the controls.\n\nSo don\u0027t touch the controls. =)\n\nSeriously, when you about 100m/s velocity use a little bit of control to get your rocket tipped over to about 5 or 10 degrees off of vertical.

I\u0027ll have to give it a shot when i get home. I also didnt know about the Alt-WASD thing either, I swear I learn something new about this game every week.

Use trim!\n\nThe rockets I am building are very tall. if they are nice and stable all i need is two notches of trim before launch, then hit alt-X when I am 5-10 degrees of vert and job done. If I try to turn when I hit 100m/s with SAS enabled then wild oscilations will occur as the SAS fights the aerodynamics and joints start to flex. SAS is completely unnecessary in lower atmo"},{"CreatedByName":"Voidryder","CreatedById":57308,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T17:35:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So don\u0027t touch the controls. =)\n\u003E Seriously, when you about 100m/s velocity use a little bit of control to get your rocket tipped over to about 5 or 10 degrees off of vertical.

Also, SAS was added as a game benefit back when rockets would turn, yaw, and rotate unexpectedly because of the inaccurately modeled aerodynamic forces. Now that aero is much more accurate - SAS has largely lost its usefulness in the atmosphere. I routinely leave it off until I\u0027m at 45km altitude, these days."},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T18:44:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Reducing the gimbal range is another way.

I now launch like this even with rockets that don\u0027t need it. Generally I do lock the gimbals when I have more than one gimballing engine.

In 1950s flight testing, a lot of work was in adjusting the control system to get the right amount of control movement."}]}
