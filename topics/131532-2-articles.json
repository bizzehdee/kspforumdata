The ribbon is slowly lowered (over the course of a couple of years) till it meets the ground station (an equatorial floating platform). In the meanwhile addition ribbon has been delivered to the satellite and crawlers start down the cable with the next ribbon, welding, gluing and spinning the reinforcements cross-overs as they go. Over a few of these mission cycles the cable is finally strengthened to the point were a single climber from the ground station can climb the elevator, deploying more cable as it goes. The entire construction period would take more than 10 years. Once it was done the cable would remain in a constant of maintainence and repair. This is not a product that is ever \u0027finished\u0027 - just like long steel suspension bridges are permanently being repainted with anti-rust paint.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the event of a cable failure the lower portion of the cable does fall to earth, but because it\u0027s mass is only kilograms for kilometres and not the tons described by KSR it falls to earth as so much black confetti, not a death dealing planet slicing blade of destruction. With the criss crossing reinforcement compromised and the tension gone\u00A0the cable will quickly come apart.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously problems remain.

Why bother with an elevator when your regular space plane design is now 25% stronger and 50% lighter, or your standard disposable rocket stage is now light enough and strong enough (and empty enough) to fly itself back to the launch site?
