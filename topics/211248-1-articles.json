Doing so is fairly work-intensive, as you\u0027ll likely have to adjust offsets on the flame to get it to sit in the right location, which requires repeated testing and tweaking. But it can be done.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ELook for the EFFECTS { } node in the part config. Most engines have one of them. A few really old ones, like the LV-T30, don\u0027t. In that case there\u0027ll be some entries directly under the PART { } node. I would recommend patching those out and introducing an EFFECTS { } node if you decide to mod it, as the node can simply do much more than the old way.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
