At the moment the game tries to physically model everything. What if one allows parts to be \u0022locked\u0022 once connected to certain things. Example: if one connects \u0022a\u0022 to \u0022b\u0022 it becomes variable \u0022c\u0022 and no longer two separate parts. I am no programmer and thus have no idea how easy (or not) that is to do for this game, but I do know that whilst I can understand that the physics is part of what makes the game great, one has to balance the fun/frustration factor. Sure, it can be fun having glorious spacecraft meltdowns, but too often the \u0022strut more\u0022 thing is just pure frustration. (note: I am not complaining. I love the game)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Having just thought about it some more: IRL most rockets are long, thin multi-stage things with or without some SRBs. The problem I usually experience when trying to construct that sort of thing is that breakages occur between upper stage engines and decouplers and/or engines and the tanks. Thus, if the engine attachments are made \u0022unbreakable\u0022 (between what connects to the top and bottom of an engine) it would solve tons of problems. Strutting in this case is finicky at best since it is very difficult lining up struts from a bottom stage to connect to the actual engine, since with the engine shrouds only a TINY portion of the engine is actually visible (the top rim). On my bigger rockets I have to sometimes plop 12 or more struts just to have some sort of stability between one stage and the next (which doesn\u0027t always work even), and since part count is what kills performance, I have had to totally rethink the way I design rockets in the first place. For example, my current rocket (an interplanatery satellite delivery rocket) has only 165 parts, but a whopping 59 of those are struts!!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-04-28T17:49:11Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2013 05:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Murchadh\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EExample added\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoY","CreatedById":57294,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T17:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would love it if fuel tanks did that when you connected them. that would save on strut count too!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Murchadh","CreatedById":57567,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T17:55:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPrecisely.
