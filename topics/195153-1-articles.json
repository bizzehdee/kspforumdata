I have the setting that allows aim camera to be available (forgot the name). But when I try to plant a flag I have to turn on the GUI\u2019S and that kind of messes it up. So does anyone know if we are able to add action groups to Kerbals and how to get better cinematic shots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note: I am trying to do this without the help of mods.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-29T23:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStock KSP really isn\u0027t set up for cinematics.
