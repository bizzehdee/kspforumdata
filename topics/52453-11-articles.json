Agreed that that should be part of the original post, maybe even a \u0027stock only\u0027 mod that simply removes most of these tanks. All of these tanks together is a rather large amount of parts clutter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I think it would also be prudent to make all tanks slightly super-stretchy. Take for example the -500 and the -625 (I think). Obviously one is .5m and one is .625. The difference between those is minor enough that I don\u0027t see why it wouldn\u0027t be feasible to combine them into one tank that has diameter limits of .5 minimum and .625 maximum... especially since the career integration gives you both tanks at the same time anyway. The only real purpose of having both sizes is compatibility with esoteric part packs.
