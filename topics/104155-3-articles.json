Other than being a fuel tank, it has nothing in common with the Oscar. Sure, both hold only a \u0022small\u0022 amount of fuel when you consider the entire range of existing tanks. But when you are building something small, it makes a huge difference that one of these tanks holds almost twice the fuel than the other, and has a completely different form factor.\n\nBoth tanks are needed and complement each other just fine.
