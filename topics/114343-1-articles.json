From what I ve seen there was a clear progression up till I reach 99%. There was those early game contracts indeed. Then the game released some contracts labelled grand tour but only evolving fly by. As mentionned once I reached 90-92% I got the one called Ultimate Challenge ( which was fly by everything) And then finally grand tour contracts involving landing. But now I don\u0027t receive anymore of those at all. Even though I was expecting an Ultimate ultimate challenge one with landing on everything.

I know very well there is no end game contract ( my choice for subject wording was probably wrong) but if you read my posts that is not what I am asking and talking about exactly. There is a clear pattern of the game unlocking certain type of contract at certain points. Like you don t get the ultimate challenge right after landing on the mun.. And there is another clear pattern I will repeat again regarding \u0027grand tour\u0027 contract.. first the fly by then the ultimate fly by then the landings.. my question is am I wrong to expect an ultimate landing grand tour challenge.
