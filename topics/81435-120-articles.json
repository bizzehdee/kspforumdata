While we all know nothing is truly invincible, my new ships can eat so many missiles its not even funny. I think ive found the single major downfall of every warship, inertia overloading joints. Basically when a rocket that has sufficient mass hits a ship, it transfers its force (regardless of if it exploded or not) into teh part it touched. If that part happens to be very heavy, it means that the parts connected to said heavy part will take massive amounts of force usually ripping their joints apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe armor iev developed (still testing but sofar looks VERY promising) is a hybrid between normal structural armor and spaced armor. You place all heavy things externally and or farther away from teh primary frame, and connect them to the frame with low impact tolerance parts. When a missile hist the tank, instead of transfering all that energy into your root parts (such as the ibeam core many ships use), the energy transfer is broken by the weak part in between. Now aside from making your fuel more vulnurable to about anything, this makes it exponentially less likely for anything to 1 shot you (the only way to 1 shot is to have a shell phase into your core structure, which is a matter of luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce i get some working ships using this technique ill post one for you gusy to try it out.

If the wings are both large and carry LFO, i feel they MIGHT be useful as sacrificial tanks, something like what i do (place fuel tanks externally on weak supports so if i get shot, better that fuel tank then my entire ship) on some of my more armored craft. Actually i tend to place every single non-essential component externally, as it is IMPOSSIBLE to fully protect weak stuff such as fuel, engines, reaction wheels, ect, and loosing a few here and there wont ruin your ship, whereas placing this stuff internally tends to not work out too well as it increases the force transfer to the root parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIve actually come to the conclusion that redundancy is the ONLY way to make an effective damage tanking capital ship. Im actually working on a ship right now that not only takes advantage of my force transfer blocking techniques, but is for all intents and purposes 3 self sustainable ships stuck together that each has dedicated engines, fuel, control systems, weapons, ect. one gets wiped out, who cares, whatever is left is like able to do the same function of the entire ship minus a few weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ideal solution would be a procedural ship, that can be put back together after being damaged, but they have a few issues: very high part count, excessively heavy, more vulnurable then normal craft to ibeams and weak junk. Ive pretty much settled for the best of both worlds, a standard ship that is composed of multiple smaller self-sustaining sections. With this new thing i might not be indestructible, but it can take some hits without being damaged, and ontop of that it can function even if two of the sections have been entirely obliterated. This makes it IMPOSSIBLE to 1 shot (unless i use a Tripedo-H on it, that thing when fired at the correct angle will tear through anything in front of it\u0027s trajectory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think ive made a ship now that is both lowish on part count (under 200 hull only), has incredible staying power especially if damaged, and seems to have no obvious weaknesses aside from the fact that it just doesnt have the armor to reliably stop some higher performance weapons. This ship design actually comes from lessons ive learned from a game called robocraft (dont play much anymore as they ruined uber warp drive exploit!), redundancy beats almost every specialized armor or any other design style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, what do you pro warship builders come up with as best armor layouts?

The biggest issue (and one that neither me nor anyone else that im aware of has solved) is the fact that outer armor is worthless against hypervelocity phased ammo. With some skill and i guess luck, you can split the toughest ship in half with a 0.9t torpedo. While im not claiming the 1 shot cut on half is common with 0.9t weapons (my Tripedo-S is 0.9t right now, splits anything ive tested it on sofar with some luck and good aim at its core parts), the fact that such a light/low part count missile is even capable of cutting massive behemoths in half shows that pure armor is worthless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is why ive switched to redundancy over armor. The first lesson ive learned when it comes to capital ships is to spread out your weapons, with multiple hardpoints in different areas. This is because as cool as the so called barrel with all missiles in the front is (which quite a few developers utilize including me), all it takes is 1 accurate shot to wipe out most if not all the ammo (and a ammoless ship is just useless unless you legalize ramming). Then i started using vernor spam to make sure that every section has propulsion even if it is damaged or other sections are vaporized. More recently ive given each segment of the ship its dedicated engines, dedicated fuel. dedicated missiles/weapons, and control systems (probe cores and or pilots). Basically against such a ship there is very litle you can do with a single shot. Im not saying the things are all that strong, but you are forced to fire multiple times at each respective section to actually disable such a ship (not to mention that if you happen to cut it in half i just got myself 2 ships that have less firepower/fuel then the original).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill, if you dont insist upon having what is essentially multiple craft duck-taped together, at the least you should spread out weapons, fuel, and have multiple vernors all over as they dont require fuel lines to work, they have enough thrust to move damaged ships, and best of all they have such a small hitbox they never seem to get shot off (aside from garbage ISP, they have no downsides as a backup engine).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as for fighters and stuff is another story, and for those ive found simplicity and best of all low mass/high firepower to beat any other designs. You cant armor a fighter reliably anyways without going into bombers/light capital ships territory, so i go with fuel tank, control system (reaction wheel\u002Bprobe core or cockpit), engine with 2000ish dV armed (thats enough to get to almost any ship in orbit around the planet carrier is around), and a gun. I found 1.25m weapons to be best on fighters as they can take down capital ships with a single lucky shot to midsection. As for redundancy and all that, its a puny fighter, might as well make them as light and small as possible to deploy them en-mass, quantity when it comes to fighters always beats quality, to a certain limit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what ive learned about space craft combat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as for weapons, NOTHING and i mean NOTHING can survive a hit from a Tripedo-H. Its a little heavy at 7ish tons, 10 parts, but its guaranteed to wipe the floor with anything you fire it at (provided you hit it front-rear or rear-front, its so powerful itll create a debri cloud thatll tear the ship to pieces. It isnt always guaranteed to instakill enemy ship, but it sure is guaranteed to do massive critical damage every shot. While i have seen ships survive it with redundant systems, anything near its trajectory is basically dead. Now for my more practical weapons, the Tripedo-M is good for general purpose stuff, accurate, phasing capable, 3t weapon. And the smaller Tripedo-S is for use in corvettes and lighter craft, weighing under 1t, weak, but ive managed to 1 shot dreks with it before (luck and good aim), and like the M, it can also go fast enough to phase through outer hull armor on most craft. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i ever show my Tripedo-H in public (its classified as OP right now), im prolly going to challenge you guys to try to counter it without using redundancy (redundant ship can technically survive as parts may still function after a hit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, there is just no way to counter some of the most powerful missiles. Generally speaking, any missiles above 5t are very hard to counter (especially if they actually have high velocity on impact), with 10t missiles (assuming they are made well) are like 90% guaranteed to tear any ship apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-22T16:06:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2015 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-23T02:23:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy newest corvette and or frigate construction (class depends on how many sections are there).

It utilizes flex armoring, Ibeam-proof spaced armor, excessive redundancy (each section has propulsion, power generation, weapons, and is fairly well armored), and has plenty of firepower. Thats not even mentioning the fact that this thing can actually take hits with minor damage too. Its virtually immune to Ibeams luckshots aside, has a very rigid frame (flexible enough though so that joints are less likely to fail), and has absurd dV too (the frigate gets over 5K dV without droptanks, 8K with), and the corvette looses some fuel tanks to keep the weight down and accommodate extra missiles in place of the fuel tanks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit can also be a 100% modular ship, with docking ports connecting sections, but i just dont like to use those, and it actually makes it easy to split it apart, not to mention flexing becomes a massive issue. With KAS struts that can be applied after connecting a section, its quite neat, but until some sort of modular apply in space struts are added to teh game (or i have mod active), i think ill stick to avoiding 100% modular ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe coolest part is that i can actually swap weapons out depending on mission, as each section comes with options as to what caliber and how much of it. You can normally arm 2 1.25m stubby missiles (configuration in picture is compact mode for stubby torpedoes, but you can also have them extend out and fit almost any length missiles while sacrificing appearance). It can also accomodate like 10\u002B 0.625m missiles (long ones, like over 20 stubby ones), and it is technically capable of surface mounting 2.5m missiles, although it looks like crap, and the craft is just too small to bother mounting Tripedo-H \u0022Drek-Buster\u0022 missiles on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the only downside is that right now i was not able to integrate dedicated main engines for every segment without compromizing structural integrity or blocking the weapons bay. That said, the whole craft (not shown in pics) is pushed by e dedicated engine module at the rear, and has a frontal section with a cockpit for kerbals (while i tend to like droid ships more then kerbal ships, its nice to have some eva interaction here and there), which is also armed with multiple weapons stacks. Im also developing an alternative section that can mount 6 1.25m torps, which will be slightly weaker and heavier, but will have more firepower if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and the entire thing (with weapons included) is under 300 parts, hull is a hair over 200. At that part count, and considering how it refuses to die, i think i just made a rather good ship (and i managed to keep it in my aesthetic style of flattened hexagon hull that i like for some reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid some more testing, and the bloody thing REFUSES TO DIE! I cannot kill it with the shredder missile (the stuff the Drek-27 arms stock) worth my life. The MOST ive managed to do with a single shot is destroy the fuel and ammo in 2 segments, or destroy the engine compartment, or destroy the cockpit area where the kerbals sit. I just CANNOT split it in half sofar with a missile that i can quite reliably split every drek in half with with a good hit. Now im not sure if the dreks are that great ships (the only drek comparable ships ive yet to find are a few of the Reacher Industries ships), but until proven otherwise im considering the dreks to be the best ships in public domain in terms of armor. Then again, with the sheer armor the new AKS S-FGT-I has, and the fact that not only that but it has incredible redundancy, i think i might have finally created a ship that can take on dreks as equals, and in certain regards its even superior.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI managed to split it in half ONCE after firing 37 shots (ill make an actual documented test later), even then it could still fight perfectly fine (each half had both engines left, and weapons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some preliminary pictures of the things, not only do they have absurd armor, redundancy, great dV (above 3-4K depending on armarment), but i have to say these things dont look half bad either.

If you want a 100% serious game with no weapon limits im loading nothing but Tripedo-Ms and Tripedo-Hs, the M being a similar weapon is size and lethality to zeke\u0027s popper-H (the think on the drek 12p), and the Hs being instakill anything i come across weapons that are kinda heavy at 7t. Personally id like to use Tripedo-S and the drone/ibeams, as these weapons are more fun to play with, but are both lightweight and often end up doing lowish damage. If you agree to the limit i proposed earlier of 2t max per weapons, im switching to my pure fun loadouts, more ibeams and weak junk, less 1 shot kill torps.
