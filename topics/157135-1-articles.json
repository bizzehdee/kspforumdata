Specifically landing gears and maybe even a cockpit? I\u0027ve recently started building a lot of WWII styled aircraft, like P40s and P51s, Bf109s, Yak1s, ect but I\u0027m running into issues with stock parts not looking right, or there simply being no mods that even come close. My other issue is that I have no idea how to mod, at all, so I wouldn\u0027t even know where to start lol\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, just wondering if someone would be interested in making something like that?
