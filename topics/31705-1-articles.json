Then, I assumed I was gold and launched a bunch of Kerman\u0027s into orbit with the idea of building a space station. I got my rockets all set up with docking ports and some base items that I felt the little screamers needed to survive. I launched them. The first 3 Kermans ran out of fuel and got stuck into an eternal orbit. So now, I decided I needed to send a rescue mission to dock with them and return some back to the home planet, kind of like a bus, but that guy got stuck into orbit too and he was off....so next, another rescue mission....3 more, stuck.....then another, and another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the guilt is consuming me and I have at least 16 Kerman\u0027s stuck in Orbit and I need to mount a rescue mission and get some fuel up there so I can round them all up and bring them home!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe political pressure at home to do this is mounting as the public sees my ineptitude and is calling for my head on a pike, I can hear the crowds assembling, smell the sulphur from the lit torches and hear the clanging of the pitchforks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have locked the doors to the control room and VAB and I am trying to fend them off for one last mission....hep me, before it is too late...I fear for their safety and now my own.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asdier","CreatedById":32526,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T16:29:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t want more kerbals stuck in space, use an unmanned craft with an hitchhiker cabin with an 2m probebody and some parachutes on it and rescue them that way.

Just search for \u0022kerbal space program docking\u0022 on youtube. Next, it sounds like your rockets could use some tweaking for more deltaV. If you post a screen shot of one of your designs I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll get a lot of recommendations (moar boosters and asparagus staging). One excellent tool for improving your designs is Kerbal Engineer Redux (\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u003C/a\u003E). That will let you actually see whether a change will help or not. You could consider sending up some probes with the crew canister rather then sending up even more brave Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Poison Penguin","CreatedById":68377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-06T16:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a design that shouldn\u0027t run out of fuel in Kerbin orbit, and it can carry hefty payload such as more fuel or simply capsules to put the Kerbals in to bring them back.

This cuts down on weight to start because you only need one capsule. So here is what you do, use one fuel tank with a nice and efficient engine, non nuclear.
