It\u0027s uterly unrealsitic that a fusion reactor can produce 50% charged particles for energy production and 0% thermal heat. The Utilisation should be the maximum of both. Although this allows you to breed tritium more easility, a consequence is that a lot more thermalheat and therefore wasteheat is generated. But on the other hand also makes D-He3 fusion, and He3-He3 fusion much more intresting as most or all of there energy is charged particles, meaning, much less wasteheat is generated. Also since, the percentage of neutrons emmited in a fusion reactor, has a direct impact on the percentage charged particles, the extra wasteheat is also good anolog for all the Neutron radiaton you have to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the next release, this will be corrected allong with rebalance of tritium breeding which currently breeds the same amount of tritium, independant of the amount of neutrons produced in the fusion/fission reaction\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-20T13:53:59Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2015 01:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hazelnut","CreatedById":146815,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T23:21:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hazelnut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hazelnut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m talking total amount, not just in one cryostat.

I need the particle gen to run the double vista\u0027s, so no breeding while using them. I will have to run the magnetic nozzle quite a bit to get some Tritium bred I think then. This engine was only ever intended to help get near other craft without killing everyone with the vista\u0027s and only gives 192kN thrust at 100% which is rather low for a big ship.
