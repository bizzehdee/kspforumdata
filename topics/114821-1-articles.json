The chart from which I based this graph actually has results of 3 tests. Only the 60% payload test is graphed. The other two tests: one was of efficiency and used one small Oscar B tank for LFO engines and the fuel mass of a Sepratron (or as close as I could get with the larger) for SRBs. On the other hand I maxed out the load using fuel tanks for the LFOs and the SRBs were full of propellant, for the \u002290% propellant\u0022 test. So for the \u002240% propellant\u0022 test which is graphed, I drained the SRBs of half their propellant. Recall that an empty fuel tank has roughly 10% of the mass of a full one, so the empty tank mass is counted as part of the \u0022dry\u0022 payload mass. The percentages may be technically crude, but in practical terms it was easier to do this than go into the config files and change them. These were single stage tests with a starting atmospheric dV of from 1 to 1.04 due to practical variation. The air breathers did spool up before lifting off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/437/19343018161_9723f9f846_o.png\u0022 alt=\u002219343018161_9723f9f846_o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-05T14:49:27Z\u0022 title=\u002207/05/2015 02:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded explanatory commentary.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
