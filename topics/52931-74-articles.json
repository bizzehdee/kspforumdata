I had the same thing happen 2 versions back (a few days ago that is). As near as I could tell it was the 6 death Kraken as described on the wiki page. I too struggled with it as I had a few other mods. I removed realchutes as an experiment having read an old post from 2013 by a person ascribing a similar issue to realchutes. Having nothing to lose I removed the mod and my problem went away. I relate this as it seems to be a problem once fixed has returned! I hope that helps in tracking it down as I love this mod. I will reinstall this latest vers and get back to you if anything changes.
