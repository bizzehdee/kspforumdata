Sorry to butt in with reality in a game that\\\u0027s supposed to be a simulation... I tend to take my sims rather serious, and while I do not have a degree in astrophysics so far, the game really makes me ponder getting one. Then again, who has the time?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, I\\\u0027d enjoy very much to be unable to reach light speed in the game, and the game behaving in sync with what we consider real physics. For me, part of the fun is to calculate trajectories and fuel consumption, to plan and prepare missions and then enjoy watching them unfold and go according to plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\\\u0027ll never be Jebs love child, especially since \u0027more boosters\u0027 isn\\\u0027t my solution to everything (more often than not it\\\u0027s \u0027less weight\u0027) but that\\\u0027s how I like it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
