When I first started the game, I was the former. I have quickly transitioned into the latter as I have began to grasp the underlying concepts that drive orbital mechanics. I wish I had found this game when I was like 12. I probably would have pursued a much different career path haha.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
