Which means that you can\u0027t use it as a lander engine. Use parachutes and airbrakes to bleed off speed, and strap a couple of Radial Liquid Boosters to that tank. These little things is often ignored, but they can do wonders if used right.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bloodbunny","CreatedById":67274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T18:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome!
