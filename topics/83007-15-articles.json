However it would likely be stored at a colder temperature to increase its density. At -180 C (still warmer than Liquid Oxygen\u0027s boiling point of -183 C) liquid methane has a density of 448.25 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. Since one major use for Methane is to burn it with LOX, it\u0027s quite likely that you would want to store it as a similar temperature to increase its density and minimize heat-leakage from the methane tanks into nearby LOX tanks...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- What temperature is the density of LOX supposed to be based on? \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.peacesoftware.de/einigewerte/o2_e.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAccording to the Peace Software Thermodynamics Calculator\u003C/a\u003E at a pressure of 25 psia (approximately 1.7 atm, and the density NathanKell said the Saturn V LOX tanks were at) and a temperature of -198.4 C you get a density of 1141.75 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, which is close enough for comfort to the density of 1141.00 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E currently being used. However at 1 atm and -196 C the density is only 979.25 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, and a 1 atm and -200 C the density is 1223.00 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. The density of LOX is highly sensitive to even a few degrees of temperature-increase, so the current density of 1141.00 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E for LOX might be a little optimistic...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The current density of LqdAmmonia in the working document is far too low. What\u0027s more, I don\u0027t even know where it comes from. The density in the release of CRP included in the latest KSP-Interstellar 0.90 port is 681 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, but the density included in the current working-document is 604.00 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. Neither density is high enough. The ambient temperature of LEO is around -40 C, and deep space is -80 C or less (the freezing point of ammonia is -77.73 C, so in deep space you actually face the amusing problem of needing to heat the ammonia to keep it liquid, or thaw it before use...) so you\u0027re clearly not going to be storing it any warmer than -40 C. At -40 C and 1 atm the density is 690.2 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E according to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.peacesoftware.de/einigewerte/nh3_e.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPeace Software Thermodynamics Calculator\u003C/a\u003E, and at -50 C and 1 atm (the lowest temperature the calculator will go for Ammonia, but probably still warmer than you\u0027d want to be storing it) the density is 702.1 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. Even at -34 C and 1 atm, just below its boiling-point, Ammonia has a density of 682.78 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E, which is higher than either the old or new density for it in CRP...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENOTE:\u003C/strong\u003E I provide multiple links to the Peace Software Thermodynamics Calculator because it has different pages for different molecules. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.peacesoftware.de/einigewerte/einigewerte_e.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHere\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E is the english-language home page from which you can access the different molecule calculators (note that there are some typos in the spellings, such as of Oxygen, as the software was originally written in German- which I do know how to read- but the calculations yield numbers, which will be the same regardless of the language used...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-11T04:02:16Z\u0022 title=\u002203/11/2015 04:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-11T04:50:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAt -180 C (still warmer than Liquid Oxygen\u0027s boiling point of -183 C) liquid methane has a density of 448.25 kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E.
