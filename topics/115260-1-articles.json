It seems way promising. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also never considered that an orbital model would harm current planetary orbit in KSP (either because of their huge mass or because they are locked in railed orbits), so I am really considering all approaches before I dive in and spend a huge amount of time on a game where all planets end up crashing =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wouldn\u0027t mind learning as much as I can about it so I have been researching.
