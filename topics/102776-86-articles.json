Got a research station orbiting Serran with an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E shuttle for science runs to the surface, although landing a plane on the surface with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E is pretty difficult. I\u0027ve been looking at the other different planets with atmospheres that I\u0027d be interested in visiting like Titanus and Tidus and also Arin and to my surprise the tracking station indicates all of their atmospheric pressures at 0.6 atm (this also goes for Serran), despite the description of Titanus having huge atmospheric pressure.\n\nIf it\u0027s a display error, can it be fixed somehow? It would be nice to have some sort of estimate from the tracking station from gravity and pressure how hard plane flying will be on a particular planet. I\u0027ve dug into the config files and found that they have different molar masses for their atmospheres and pressure curves, how do I estimate how well lifting surfaces will work on a planet from pressure and molar mass? It would also be useful to have the reference values for Kerbin, which I could not find anywhere in NH or Kopernicus\u0027 config files.\n\nEdit: So I scoured the KSP wiki and it looks like it has some info on pressure at different altitudes and also lists the molar mass for the stock planets, I am still curious if/how to combine those two to estimate lifting surface effectiveness relative to Kerbin though.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-16T20:27:00Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2017 08:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Lyneira**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lyneira","CreatedById":149515,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-25T09:32:48Z","Content":"[@KillAshley](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128696-killashley/) I\u0027ve had a recent update of Kopernicus to release 1.3.0-5 (Full disclosure, I am using NH 2.0.1 from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E) and it took me a while to notice but while looking at Vanor I noticed Tidus was no longer there.

That way you can find out roughly how much delta-v it\u0027ll take to get to that planet once you\u0027re at the transfer window, though actually finding the transfer window is more challenging. Alternatively, you could plan to start most interplanetary missions from Sonnah orbit, which would be more efficient if you\u0027re using a reusable multi-mission transport as the large vehicle wouldn\u0027t have to get to Kerbin orbit each time and you\u0027d be able to park it in very low Sonnah orbit to make good use of the Oberth effect. For finding the delta-v from that situation, use a satellite in the starting orbit and find out the delta-v with the method I suggested earlier with maneuver nodes.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 22 hours ago, Plummet said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m struggling to put an Ernus mission together. One basic problem I have is that my Kerbal heat-explodes on surface Eva, even it I land when the Sun is low and keep him in shadow.\n\u003E \n\nThough I have yet to test this, I can think of a few options:\n\n1. Rather than a conventional lander with a crew capsule, use an EVA seat and keep several radiators (the extendable ones) on the lander. If I\u0027m not mistaken, a kerbal in a command seat is treated as a part and will be cooled by the radiators. This won\u0027t allow independent movement on the surface, however.\n2. I don\u0027t know how surface temperature on Ernus works, but have you tried waiting until night and doing the EVA then? It\u0027s possible that it\u0027ll be cooler at night and you\u0027ll be able to do an EVA safely.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-03T11:17:26Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2017 11:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane**"},{"CreatedByName":"septemberWaves","CreatedById":160814,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-03T12:08:56Z","Content":"I\u0027m having some difficulties attempting to run the game with New Horizons installed.
