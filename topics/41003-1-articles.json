It\u0027s the differing rates of acceleration that causes damage to the materials. In a slightly more detailed explanation, when the stress exerted in a local area due to the force differential from the acceleration causes a deformation (or strain) exceeding the material\u0027s yield strength, it will cause a permanent deformation. Prior to hitting the yield strength, the material can always return to its original shape. Exceeding that stress level, it will reach its ultimate strength and its rupture point, at which it will break/snap/etc, depending on the material.
