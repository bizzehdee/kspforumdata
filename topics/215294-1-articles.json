It eventually responded, but when I touched the maneuver node again it froze again for minutes. This essentially makes it impossible for me to use maneuver nodes completely now (prior to the latest patch, there was no issue).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, when I manually saved my game, the game went unresponsive again and froze for between 1-2 minutes receiving the windows unresponsive application pop-up.
