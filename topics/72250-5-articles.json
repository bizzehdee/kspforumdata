This is not the Soyuz ferrying passengers from all over the world to. Isn\u0027t that what Atlas V does? Military satellites and equipment? The \u003Cem\u003ERussian\u003C/em\u003E space industry was making it \u003Cem\u003Epossible\u003C/em\u003E for the \u003Cem\u003EAmerican\u003C/em\u003E military to put things into orbit more efficiently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now, we\u0027ve become \u0022OMG RUSSIAN BEAR GONNA TAKE AWAY OUR ENGINES.

At face value, it was a \u003Cem\u003Estupid\u003C/em\u003E decision in the first place, born out of the economic collapse of the immediate post-Soviet era. Is it really a bad thing for the American military to count on its own domestic manufacturers to put up all that expensive equipment? Wouldn\u0027t this be a good area for economic independence? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s how it sounds \u003Cem\u003Ebefore\u003C/em\u003E you consider the sanctions side of the issue: with American interests charging that the RD-180 shouldn\u0027t be used anyway. This time, American and Russian interests coincided! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s just something hilarious about the military aspect of this, as though the Russians \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be content to help American military in space and Americans \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E be content to pay Russian manufacturers for it. The reality is probably a longtime coming: NPO Energomash will have to downsize and streamline their manufacturing processes, and US manufacturers will have to serious push for a replacement and become more comfortable with the current alternatives.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say this as a foreign national living in the United States, but at its most literal, this seems like a case of, \u0022Wow, the sane people finally spoke up.\u0022 A little discomfort builds character.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Too bad about the ISS, and I hope this doesn\u0027t efefct Soyuz launches, but those present their own complicated geopolitical issues.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-16T16:38:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, just realized that\u0027s factually what each of them want. US needs to be on it\u0027s own support (maybe launching the ICM can be done on Delta IV, seeing it can have the same upper stage with Titan IV).
