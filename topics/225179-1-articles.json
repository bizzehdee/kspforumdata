Several companies rather are investigating hypersonic air-breathing vehicles. These are vehicles that draw the oxidizer from the air like jet engines. Reaching hypersonic speeds would be to Mach 5\u002B. The easiest approach to these speeds is to use ramjets. Scramjets can reach even higher speeds but are a much more difficult technological task.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI found the most promising approach that taken by Hermeus. They were able to keep costs down by using already existing turbojet engines and modifying them to operate in a ramjet mode:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jdKUN2V0PMM?feature=oembed\u0022 title=\u0022Building the World\u0027s 1st Hypersonic Airplane | Hermeus\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut a key fact about the hypersonic air-breathing vehicles is how much they can subtract off from the delta-v needed to reach orbit.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMach 5.5 is about 5.5*340 m/s = 1,870 m/s. But ramjets can also operate at quite high altitudes, well above standard turbojets, to about 30\u002B km, 100,000\u002B feet. The equivalent delta-v for that altitude is about 800 m/s. Then ramjets can supply 1,870 \u002B 800 = 2,670 m/s delta-v to orbit. It turns out the trajectories that use aerodynamic lift can subtract some amount from the needed delta-v to orbit, so call it 9,000 m/s needed for orbit using lifting trajectory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen the delta-v that needs to be supplied by the upper stage would be 9,000 - 2,670 = 6,330 m/s. For expendable rockets the first stage commonly supplies about 4,000 m/s total delta-v speed\u002Baltitude with about 5,000\u002B m/s being supplied by the upper stage. But for rockets for which the first stage will be reusable like the Falcon 9 and the Superheavy booster, they supply a smaller total delta-v speed\u002Baltitude\u00A0 to the flight of about 3,000 m/s. This is so they can boost back to the launch site more easily.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen this means the air-breathing hypersonic vehicle can supply about the same total delta-v, speed\u002Baltitude, as the reusable booster. But the majorly important advantage is the air-breathing vehicle can be reused thousands of times, compared to only a few ten\u0027s of times for the rocket booster. Since the first stage by virtue of its large size commonly takes up 75% of the cost of a launcher, this means the cost of\u00A0 launch will be greatly reduced when that first stage can be reused thousands of times.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe implications of this will be immense. It means for example despite SpaceX spending billions developing the SH/SS it may already be obsolete just by 2025 when hypersonic vehicles become operational and are used as the first stage of an orbital vehicle.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0The implications don\u2019t seem to be recognized by these companies developing the hypersonic aircraft. They only discuss using them for hypersonic transports or hypersonic missiles. The applications to low cost, high reusability first stages does not seemed to be realized. \u00A0If Hermeus succeeds, then it will become important to recognize how that success can be repeated by other companies in the aerospace industry. The adapting of existing turbojet engines to hypersonic turbo-ramjet hybrids as described by Hermeus is not particularly advanced technology nor of high cost. \u00A0Other companies can repeat it as well. I advise though not just adapting the existing turbojet engines but also adapting existing supersonic aircraft. Hermeus built their own hypersonic test vehicle. Costs could be cut further by adapting an existing supersonic airframe as well as its supersonic capable engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0The result will be the democratization of hypersonic transport aircraft, and thereafter the democratization of spaceflight.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0I think the hypersonic advance will be successful, and it will thereby be used to launch payloads to orbit as a first stage, greatly reducing costs.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, I think it possible it will also make possible another key advance: combined air-breathing/rocket\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s. The designers of Skylon have argued this will be possible with their Sabre engine able to reach Mach 5.5. The problem with Skylon is it\u0027s projected $12 billion development cost. But by adapting already existing turbojets to ramjets, and utilizing existing airframes plus an existing hydrolox stage for the rocket portion of the flight this cost can be radically reduced, perhaps to only 1/100th of that, a few hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSee discussion here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLow cost approach to winged, air-breathing and rocket\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, Page 1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://exoscientist.blogspot.com/2024/06/low-cost-approach-to-winged-air.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://exoscientist.blogspot.com/2024/06/low-cost-approach-to-winged-air.html\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRobert Clark\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-21T20:03:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2024 08:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 21\u0022\u003EJune 21\u003C/time\u003E by Exoscientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited for readability\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NFUN","CreatedById":78715,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-19T17:52:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat\u0027s quite an invisible wall of text\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-19T18:51:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that you still need an second stage you have to release at hyper sonic velocity.

I\u2019m a fan of Peter Diamandis series of books on \u201Cexponential technological advance\u201D. He makes the point that some tech advance can seem very slow, in fact stagnant. This was the case with nuclear fusion research for example for decades, and also with hypersonics. But then it reaches an inflection point and the technology advances exponentially. I believe that is where we are at with fusion and hypersonics.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0Future Is Faster Than You Think: How Converging Technologies Are Transforming Business, Industries, and Our Lives (Exponential Technology Series)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.amazon.com/Future-Faster-Than-You-Think-ebook/dp/B07TD6GPVR/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.amazon.com/Future-Faster-Than-You-Think-ebook/dp/B07TD6GPVR/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Bob Clark\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-21T20:43:34Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2024 08:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 21\u0022\u003EJune 21\u003C/time\u003E by Exoscientist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-21T22:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224400386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221719001156\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227117\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exoscientist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Exoscientist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe technology advances exponentially\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI posted a thread a while back looking for the \u0027killer app\u0027 of the current period (much like the railroad, electricity, internal combustion engine and microchip were the killer apps of decades past).\u00A0 The technology had to be disruptive but also allow / enable advances in other areas -

But ramjets can also operate at quite high altitudes, well above standard turbojets, to about 30\u002B km, 100,000\u002B feet. The equivalent delta-v for that altitude is about 800 m/s. Then ramjets can supply 1,870 \u002B 800 = 2,670 m/s delta-v to orbit. It turns out the trajectories that use aerodynamic lift can subtract some amount from the needed delta-v to orbit, so call it 9,000 m/s needed for orbit using lifting trajectory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen the delta-v that needs to be supplied by the upper stage would be 9,000 - 2,670 = 6,330 m/s. For expendable rockets the first stage commonly supplies about 4,000 m/s total delta-v speed\u002Baltitude with about 5,000\u002B m/s being supplied by the upper stage. But for rockets for which the first stage will be reusable like the Falcon 9 and the Superheavy booster, they supply a smaller total delta-v speed\u002Baltitude\u00A0 to the flight of about 3,000 m/s. This is so they can boost back to the launch site more easily.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThen this means the air-breathing hypersonic vehicle can supply about the same total delta-v, speed\u002Baltitude, as the reusable booster. But the majorly important advantage is the air-breathing vehicle can be reused thousands of times, compared to only a few ten\u0027s of times for the rocket booster. Since the first stage by virtue of its large size commonly takes up 75% of the cost of a launcher, this means the cost of\u00A0 launch will be greatly reduced when that first stage can be reused thousands of times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only hypersonic aircraft that has ever been reused, the X-15, used rocket-based propulsion and required a drop from a carrier aircraft. No attempt has ever been made to reuse scramjets. The fastest actually-reusable aircraft capable of taking off under its own power, the SR-71, had a maximum speed of Mach 3.5 (1.2 km/s) and flew an average of 540 times each across the 32-craft fleet, with at least a week of maintenance required between each flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is much easier to build a reusable rocket stage than it is to build a reusable hypersonic airbreathing vehicle. Hypersonic airbreathing makes full-flow combustion look simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso notable that the payload fraction for a hypersonic aircraft is extremely low. The SR-71\u00A0 had a max takeoff weight of 78 tonnes and carried just 1.6 tonnes of actual mission payload (let\u0027s round up to 2 tonnes to account for the pilots and cockpit weight), a payload fraction of 2.6%. Compare this to Falcon 9 -- the first stage has a mass of 443 tonnes compared to the second stage mass plus payload of 131 tonnes, a payload fraction of 22.8%. To loft a second stage and payload comparable to the Falcon 9, your notional hypersonic launch vehicle would need to have a rolling takeoff mass of over 5,000 tonnes, nearly nine times the size of the largest plane to ever leave the ground, the Antonov An-225 .\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-25T18:38:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2024 06:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 25\u0022\u003EJune 25\u003C/time\u003E by sevenperforce\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforum glitch\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-25T21:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224400818\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221719113789\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002227117\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Exoscientist\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 6/22/2024 at 11:36 PM, Exoscientist said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nif Hermeus succeeds at their hypersonic \u00A0test flight in 2025 it presages hypersonic transports within a few years\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho\u0027s to say that hypersonic jet transport is any more feasible -- as a business case -- than hypersonic rocket transport?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"farmerben","CreatedById":190194,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-25T23:40:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224401589\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221719352536\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWho\u0027s to say that hypersonic jet transport is any more feasible -- as a business case -- than hypersonic rocket transport?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously it does better by not carrying oxidizer.\u00A0 Surely that\u0027s cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-25T23:44:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224401612\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225179\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221719358819\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022190194\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022farmerben\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, farmerben said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously it does better by not carrying oxidizer.\u00A0 Surely that\u0027s cheaper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot when your vehicle has to be ten times larger because the engines have a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E that is a dozen (or more) times smaller.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-06-26T02:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s the challenge of getting air (only 20% oxygen, remember) into the engine at hypersonic speeds, still flowing smoothly and without melting things.
