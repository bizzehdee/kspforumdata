This kind of thing happens in x64 sometimes, but I haven\u0027t seen it x86 before, and the crash log doesn\u0027t really tell me anything. This is happening right before it gets to the main menu? That\u0027s what it looked like, but SCANsat shouldn\u0027t start doing anything until after it gets to the main menu.\u003Cp\u003EDid previous versions of SCANsat work? You could try rolling back to an older version, or just re-installing this version.
