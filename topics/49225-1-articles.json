If you\u0027re just trying to get it to be there long enough to scan for a few days, then you want to burn normal or anti-normal (toward the closest terminator) when you\u0027re over either of the poles. That should rotate the orbit around to where you want it. Note that if you\u0027re trying to rotate it by more than a few degrees, this could be a very long burn. (deltaV = 2 * sin (angle/2) * velocity) If it\u0027s more than about 50 degrees, you\u0027ll actually save fuel by raising your apoapsis (over a pole) out to near the edge of Kerbin\u0027s SOI, rotating it there, then lowering it again. Might be better to de-orbit the scanner and launch another one north or south-ward at dawn or dusk.
