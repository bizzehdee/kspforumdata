Where are useful places to take it to do experiments? Would I get science by hauling into Munar orbit or is that still just considered \u0027deep space\u0027?

I understand that it takes 2 Kerbils in there to run it. My question is - how do I get them in and out or are they stuck in there forever? I assume the whole point of this lab is that it does NOT need to be returned and recovered to be valuable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for any answers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CarlosMaximus","CreatedById":99289,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T19:09:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1. Every planet, moon, and Kerbol (the sun) has high and low orbits, from which science can be gathered. The surfaces of Kerbin, Mun and Minmus also have \u0022biomes\u0022, or areas (such as mountains, grasslands, oceans in the case of Kerbin, all the big craters on the Mun, and the different \u0022flats\u0022 on Minmus) from which more science can be gathered, whilst the other planets (apart from Kerbol and Jool) also have the surface available (landings). I\u0027m pretty sure Eve and Laythe have separate biomes for the oceans and land too...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You can either put the Kerbals in the Science Lab before launch through the Crew tab (next to Parts and Action Groups), or you can EVA them in space, by grabbing the ladder on either side, and getting them in through the hatch. To get them out again, either left or right click on the hatch (I forget which), a crew list should pop up, and then just click on the EVA button next to the crew member you\u0027d like to leave. I\u0027ve discovered that the lab can hold multiple samples/science experiments/reports from the same biomes, as opposed to the command modules, which can only hold one of each, so if you return the science lab, it\u0027ll net you a whole lot of science (4 Science Jr. reports from a single biome, as opposed to just 1). Also, the Lab can reset one-shot experiments, such as the Science Jr. and the Goo, so they can be reused. To reset them, simply EVA a Kerbal from elsewhere, collect the experiments by right-clicking on the modules (Science Jr. and Goo) and selecting remove results or similar (I\u0027ve forgotten the exact wording), drop off all the experiments in the Science Lab, and them right click on the Science Lab, and at the bottom of the drop down menu should be a button marked \u0022Clean experiments\u0022, along with a number for the available experiments to be cleaned. Note that the experiments need to be attached to the lab for this to work (Either directly, or by having a lander with the experiments attached to a command module with the Science Lab, for example.) I\u0027ve found this incredibly useful, since instead of repeated trips to the Mun/Minmus, I simply send up a command module with a 1-Kerbal pod attached to a Science Lab, with extra fuel and monopropellant, launch with Bill in the pod and Bob in the lab, get into orbit, EVA Bill to the lab, and then send up Jeb in the lander with all the experiments to perform about 5-6 landings, docking between each one to drop off the experiments, refuel and clean the experiments ready for the next landing! Once I\u0027ve got tird of landing on the same body/ran out of spare fuel, I EVA Jeb to the command module, get him in the pod, and return with Bill and Bob staying in the lab, and re-enter with the lab and the pod on Kerbin, netting a healthy chunk of Science. (Note this takes a Mk-25XL and 8 radial chutes arranged on the pod/lab combo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for the waal of text, hope it makes sense (it did to me when I read it through, but I\u0027ve been told I\u0027m a bit weird, so what do I know?)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-27T19:12:10Z\u0022 title=\u002201/27/2014 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CarlosMaximus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dave Kerbin","CreatedById":78777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-27T19:15:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can discover things by examining the Science Jr in Munar orbit or the orbit of other bodies, including the sun. The results will even vary depending on if you are in high orbit or flying closer to the surface (you must be \u003Cstrong\u003Every \u003C/strong\u003Eclose to the sun to learn something you didn\u0027t learn from a higher orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science lab doesn\u0027t find any science by itself. If you bring data or experiments to the lab then kerbals can \u0027process\u0027 the information in order to gain a higher transmission value. However if you have kerbals you might as well bring the data back with you for 100% credit. The science lab can also be used by kerbals to clean and restore the one-use experiments like the Science Jr. and Goo container. So you can use a Goo container, take the data, then dock it with a lab and the kerbals inside will restore it for another use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally to get kerbals into the lab use the same method as capsules, while on EVA press F to grab the ladder then climb down to the hatch and press F again to board.
