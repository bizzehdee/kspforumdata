On real aircraft, tail planes have negative lift to counteract the CoG being in front of the lift vector. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually I end up making aircraft with canards instead which do have positive lift. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way that I don\u0027t know of to make negative lift tail planes? With the new aircraft parts in 1.0.5 I tried making some realistic aircraft, but they ended up with the CoG so far in front of the lift vector that they hardly had any positive pitch range in flight. I suppose KSP somehow takes into account the negative lift of the tail plane while flying, just not when building in the SPH. Otherwise the aircraft would be highly unstable in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T13:29:07Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spaceman_Spiff\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Boris-Barboris","CreatedById":133181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T10:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECoL indicator in SPH is true when your control surfaces are at 0 action (neutral).
