Far away from any perfect orbit. All my attempts to land on Mun\u0027s surface ended in a complete destruction of the vessel, everything I send down there is too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow long did it take you to land your first self-built spacecraft on Mun?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T14:15:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there Icelflame and welcome to the forums! I can\u0027t remember how long it took to set foot on Mun but I can assure you it was one of the most tense things I have ever done in KSP. My advice would be to keep your craft small so that you need less fuel to get into space and your engines have a better thrust to weight ratio so you can decelerate faster. Good luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
