If so, please let me know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The two most common landing techniques are the \u0022suicide burn\u0022 and \u0022zero descent rate\u0022 approaches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The suicide burn is a reverse vertical ascent-then-circularization burn. On the plus side, it can drop you in the neighborhood of where you want to be, but relies on perfect timing, high thrust to weight, and is hugely wasteful of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The zero descent rate approach is the most efficient approach and doesn\u0027t require a high thrust to weight.

That\u0027s a given.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cstrong\u003Ezero-descent rate / constant altitude burn\u003C/strong\u003E is especially efficient for low-TWR craft because it gives time to kill horizontal velocity, only gradually adding a vertical vector until the very end, when TWR will be high enough to finish with what is in effect a suicide burn. In that sense it is very much like a reverse gravity turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, you want to lower Pe to just above the surface, and only start to burn when you get there. As with any orbit, your speed at Pe will be fastest and you benefit most from the Oberth effect. The start of your burn keeps you in orbit but lowers Ap until you deorbit, and during all of that time you are shedding only horizontal speed and gravity hasn\u0027t really affected you since you\u0027re following the curvature of the body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom then on, the speed at which your impact point approaches will depend on TWR, and therefore automatically corrreponds to your ability to slow down in time to avoid impact. It is therefore a self-correcting system in a sense (i.e. your TWR defines how long this stage will last, which with a high TWR will be hardly any time at all), and by maintaining altitude you will ensure that the vertical vector to your thrust is the minimum necessary to avoid crashing. This phase ends when horizontal speed is low enough to turn the maneuvre into a low-speed suicide burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe disadvantage is the difficulty in aiming for a specific point on the surface, and the impossibility of doing this efficiently if there are mountains in the way at any point from Pe to your final landing zone. By extension, if you\u0027re wanting to avoid having aliens randomly land in your backyard, your best place to settle is just to the east of some big hills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your TWR is high enough, you can simply lower Pe a touch more so that it is below the surface, and this becomes a simple \u003Cstrong\u003Esuicide burn\u003C/strong\u003E. The risk of hitting mountains is lower (since you\u0027re coming in at an angle) but you\u0027ll never reach peak Oberth-effect efficiency. A \u0022pure\u0022 suicide / retrograde burn will cause the point of impact to approach you quite quickly, and has to be planned for (or you die).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you can\u0027t plan for the change in trajectory, then you need to turn this into what might be called a \u0022constant-descent\u0022 burn which is very much like what GoSlash27 is describing here: you add a vertical component to the burn to keep your point of impact close to its initial position.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any event, all these methods seem to converge to much the same thing at around the point that the initial Pe skims the surface. The thing I like most about GoSlashy\u0027s method is the increased accuracy of the approach while minimising the deviation from the maximum-efficiency retrograde-then-suicide burn which basically coverts a non-impacting orbit into touchdown in one single, pure-retrograde burn...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-01T14:29:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222431649\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002294318\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456537828\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022145678\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nich\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 26/2/2016 at 2:50 AM, Nich said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery interesting. \u00A0I guess I am confused as how the zero decent rate is the most efficient? \u00A0I would have thought an actual gravity turn would have been more efficient or are cosine losses minimal?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe OP is confusing.
