Practically speaking you should use FEA for a problem like this. But the yield strength for most polycrystaline metals takes an \u003Cstrong\u003Eepic nosedive\u003C/strong\u003E once you get above 0.6 of their melting temperature. Material strength also depends on things like strain rate, and the specifics of the material\u0027s annealing process. Anyway, here is my guess at it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAssuming\u003C/strong\u003E the tank is perfectly insulated, there is no heat transfer via radiation at the boundary, conduction is steady state and everything is in thermal equilibrium, and the ambient pressure is a vacuum. There is no loading on the pressure vessel apart from the internal pressure. No stress concentration factors such as notches or geometry changes. No factor of safety. I know that some of these factors interact in complicated ways, so I\u0027m naively going to go with the basic distortion energy theory (I\u0027m assuming that tungsten behaves ductile-ly at these really high temperature for low strain rates). Suffice it to say, take this calculation with a bit of salt: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETrying be a little realistic I\u0027ll say that this is wrought tungsten at 2200C...
