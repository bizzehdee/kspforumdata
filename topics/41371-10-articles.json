That would be artificial and generally meaningless, but worse still, it would require us to make arbitrary decisions about the science value of this or that action. That\u0027s a bad road to go down. Instead, we can let you \u0027do science\u0027 as part of your missions, and get your science points for yourself. Here\u0027s how:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe already have a few science sensor parts, which apart from a context menu readout, are largely decorative. We can put those to some use now, along with a couple other scientific parts we\u0027re going to add. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that science parts work as one-shot experiments. That is, they\u0027re activated by action group or as part of the staging sequence, and once deployed, they to their thing. This is essentially deploying the experiment to gather data. This data isn\u0027t science yet though, because you need to get it to your resident experts over at R\u0026amp;D to crunch the numbers and make some sense out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo do that, you can recover the experiments (or whatever is left of them). That will convert the data you gathered into scientific knowledge, provided you don\u0027t already have it. This is done by us storing where each experiment was run and what it was, and using that \u0027source\u0027 as a key to a multiplier value, which starts at 100% and gets progressively lower the more data on the same subject you gather. The more you spam the same type of experiment in the same place, the less science you\u0027ll get for the data it generates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if we\u0027ve learned anything this far, it\u0027s that recovery is by no means guaranteed. So here\u0027s where the antennas and comm dishes finally get a purpose. Once available, you can use comms equipment to transmit science data back down and gain science immediately. Of course, you can\u0027t expect to get as much knowledge for the same experiment data if you beam it back as if you had recovered it hands-on. How efficient the data-for-science rate is depends largely on the quality of the antenna being used, as does its power requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibilities for what the science-gathering parts can be then are pretty huge. They could be anything from experiment canisters filled with some mystery goo, a camera array, a mass spectrometer, anything really. Functionally it all works the same way, and better yet, it works \u003Cem\u003Ewith \u003C/em\u003Ethe game rather than over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s about it in a very tightly packed nutshell. I\u0027m pretty happy with this idea now, it should fit any style of playing. You could focus on running as many different experiments as possible in Kerbin\u0027s lower atmosphere, or rush into discovering the different properties of Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 across the farthest reaches of the solar system, and hopefully any point in between as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: Mystery Goo\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 is not really a planned feature (yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just have one question Harv. Before we get comms antenna\u0027s would we have to physically go and get it? For instance if we landed a probe/rover on the moon or say the North Pole would we have to send a misson to recieve the data that it has collected, because if we do that would be one of the biggest reasons to send missions to Duna or Eeloo.

Picture a lander probe on the back side of the Mun. It has data to send back. If they enforce line of sight on radio communications, then that lander can\u0027t directly send back the data (or maybe they even go so far as to enforce short range vs long range communications). But you\u0027ve got a comms satellite in low Munar orbit. When the probe establishes communication with the satellite, the satellite is also on the back side of the moon (a satellite in a higher orbit wouldn\u0027t have this issue) so the data can\u0027t be transferred in one pass that way. One solution would be to relay the probe\u0027s data to the satellite and then have the satellite transmit the data to Kerbin (or to a satellite in kerbin orbit, but this would require the requested ability to basically store the data in craft other than the one that gathered the data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOoh, there\u0027s another handoff that will need to be done for science, though I think someone else mentioned it here as well.

I want to explain it better with an easy solution to the problem without many words: science parts are too light, like this will be possible with just one launch to have 20 ionic science satellite ready to infest and gain points from everywhere, so if the science parts will have more weight ( and maybe some other cool add as you said like cameras and ground rocks analyzers to make harder ) will be a better challenge.
