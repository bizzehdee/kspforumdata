Then, use the aerospike to get out of the atmosphere. The main problem is that the oxidizer gets eaten up really fast. If I try and fly lower and gain more speed, the plane burns up. So I am asking for assistance. Any suggestions to improve the design (without radical changes), or changes to the flight plan would be infinitely appreciated \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Exothermos","CreatedById":41827,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T01:18:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDancing that line between burning up at low altitude vs. being too slow at rocket switch-over is the name of the game. \u00A0In the case of this design, my guess is that you have way too much thrust below 12k, and no where near enough between 15k and 25k\u00A0where most of the speed is gained. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry switching to 2 rapiers and dropping the spike entirely. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChange your wing angle so that the angle of attack on your main wing is 5 degrees or so. \u00A0This will allow you to keep your nose flying more-or-less directly into the path of the wind, while still gaining altitude.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFly at 10 degrees the entire\u00A0time below 30k. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThose things should do it. \u00A0I bet if you just changed the wing angle and flew at that profile you would still make it into orbit better with the design the way it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-27T10:19:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike Exothermos said, a low Thrust-to-Weight-Ratio is good for an SSTO. While rockets need a TWR of 1.x,\u00A0a\u00A0SSTO spaceplane can successfully reach orbit with a TWR below 0.5. It only takes its time to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA key point in your ascent profile is breaking the sound barrier. This can be quite a challenge, if you fly a low TWR craft. Once you pass Mach 1 and reach altitudes above 10.000 m, the R.A.P.I.E.R engine really wakes up. If you cant pass 330 m/s while going up, it is no crime to take a little dive to build up speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe design you have there,\u00A0already looks capable. Try to exchange\u00A0the two jet engines and your rocket engine for a single R.A.P.I.E.R. I dont want to fight you, Exothermos, but a single engine\u00A0should\u00A0be enough for such a small craft.

It\u0027s awesome because it has the highest cutoff speed of all airbreathers, and that \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E makes things easy for the rocket part of the ascent. \u003Cem\u003EBut...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is always a \u0022but\u0022. It is perfectly reasonable to make a SSTO with any airbreathing engine, even Junos. The trick is to understand that the crappier your airbreathers are, the more your SSTO will look like a \u003Cem\u003Erocket\u003C/em\u003E SSTO, that is, something which has 3,5km/s of dV on LFO (therefore, is mostly fuel by weight), and high TWR to waste littel to gravity losses (\u0026gt;1 at least). In this case, you are using turbojets, which are almost as good as RAPIERs, so your SSTO only has to be a bit more \u0022rockety\u0022 to make it to orbit. Increase the \u003Cem\u003Efraction\u003C/em\u003E of your weight that is LFO mix, increase rocket TWR if you need to (unlikely, really, turbojet cutoff speed is already high enough that gravity losses are low form there), and you can probably just go with the airbreathing TWR you have now. As Frank and Exo say, TWR when flying like a plane is much less of an issue, anything that allows you to go over Mach 1 at ~10,000 is something you can work with. However, the minute you turn into a rocket (stop using air for ridiculous effective Isp), TWR becomes important again, and it\u0027s all about that, and of course your fuel fraction.
