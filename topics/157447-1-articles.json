Until this week.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLink for this week\u0027s challenge:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/5xurqq/weekly_challenge_revisited_week_34_a_kerbal/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/5xurqq/weekly_challenge_revisited_week_34_a_kerbal/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the premise is to pilot a rocket to the Mun, land\u00A0and get\u00A0back only from IVA, no map view, no external view. While doing this challenge I\u0027ve learnt a lot, even though I have more than 2000 hours in this game. I had to remove \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E, Precise Maneuver, everything except SVE and its bundled/recommended mods (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, Texture Replacer, Planet Shine)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLessons learned:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) Piloting only from IVA is hard (you don\u0027t say!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) The hardest part is not actually landing on the Mun, that was kinda the easiest thing I\u0027ve done in this mission, the hardest part is getting an encounter with the Mun. I think I\u0027ve tried that 10 times AFTER I had done a test drive with the map view and all the tools at my disposal. Minute changes in the trajectory would have me not get that encounter the other 9 times. And I could only check the outcome by timewarping, not really ideal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nc) If only there was a way to accurately see my altitude, I\u0027d have had no issues with\u00A0this at all. The altimeter shows me for example, 2. But what is that 2? 2000 km? 200? 20? 2 km???\u00A0I didn\u0027t know any way of knowing apart from maybe visual cues (how far the planet is). I almost had an (unwelcomed) encounter with the ground but I brought myself back up pretty quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nd) I had to scrap a few earlier attempts because of my habitual tendendency of pressing \u0022M\u0022 to figure out what\u0027s going on \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the hard mode, I chose the Armstrong Memorial to land on, also to commemorate the recent passing of my mother. It\u0027s one of the easiest landmarks to reach on the Mun because it\u0027s almost on the equator ( \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/List_of_easter_eggs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/List_of_easter_eggs\u003C/a\u003E ), so if you get an equatorial orbit (you can check that from IVA, if your prograde marker is on the navball at the 90 degrees angle, you\u0027re in a counter-clockwise equatorial orbit). I trained myself before attempting this so I can recognize (grosso modo) the terrain features nearby and hover around the area with 100-150m/s horizontal velocity until I recognize it visually before landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the landing was a relative breeze. Going back, right after circularization, I was between the Mun and Kerbin, which is the optimal time for a re-entry burn. I must have missed it by a lot because I had to do a few corrections in Kerbin orbit (that\u0027s the thing, I can\u0027t check the result of the burn until I get there!). Tried to land near\u00A0the space center\u00A0but missed it by some 500 km or so, landed further in the ocean, east from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEnjoy:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuaH-5hWalo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way I\u0027m also inaugurating my channel (I have a few series in video editing, not yet ready to release them).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsed craft:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/bkkamex838rh0hu/Mun%20Precision%20Lander.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bkkamex838rh0hu/Mun Precision Lander.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-07T18:14:57Z\u0022 title=\u002203/07/2017 06:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 7, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by George van Doorn\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eadded .craft file\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
