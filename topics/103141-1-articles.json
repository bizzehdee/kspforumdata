Though I don\u0027t think highly of the SLS Orion system due to the fact it is no more advanced than the Saturn V in the 60s (apart from the electronics), I think starting from scratch yet again would be even worse.\n\nNasa has decided to commit to this course and wiping it and then spending another 20 or more years developing something would make the organisation loose all purpose in the publics eyes.\n\nI also question the ability of Nasa to make anything better... they are so bogged down in red tape that innovation is very difficult for them due to how long it would take them and how much it would cost them."},{"CreatedByName":"Budgie","CreatedById":13840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T14:07:50Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see it as a waste of time, because having a heavy lift rocket is better than not having one.

I\u0027m not the biggest fan of the SLS, but I don\u0027t know all the details about it or its construction/design process so I withold judgement on it.\n\nAs for Orion, well I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a waste of time. Mostly because it should allow for human transportation beyond LEO once fully tested, which I believe no-one in the world is really capable of right now (I could very much be wrong about that one). Even if possibly it isn\u0027t the best way, at least there\u0027s some research going into space travel beyond our own planet, and that\u0027s a good thing in my book."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T15:51:15Z","Content":"The problem isn\u0027t that SLS or Orion exist. The problem is that there are no missions for them. \n\nOrion was originally designed to return to the Moon. When Constellation was canned, its mission profile became exploration with 21-day life support. There aren\u0027t that many places you can go BEO in 21 days except the Moon. To do anything else than a lunar flyby, Orion is going to need either a mission module (a lander or a hab) or an artificial destination (the ARM asteroid or a deep space station). Those would need a development lead time of at least 10 years, and there will be no development funds available until SLS is finished and the ISS program ends. \n\nAfter EM-1 and EM-2, Orion is probably going to be mothballed until its cancelled. Nobody can afford to pay for the infrastructure of a heavy-lift rocket and manned spacecraft that sitting in a hangar waiting for a mission.\n\nFalcon Heavy suffers the same problem as SLS by the way: the lack of payloads. There are no 50-ton payloads in the pipeline. It might find a market for the 20-ton category (competitor to Ariane and Proton) with a comfortable margin for the flyback boosters, but it remains to be seen if that will be competitive."},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T20:20:55Z","Content":"The problem is that this is old stuff.

While it\u0027s true that SLS is a political rocket (no adequately funded payloads or well defined missions), I can\u0027t help but feel that it doesn\u0027t have *that* much political sway compared to the shuttle. Spaceflight is so low down the list of political priorities, and the number of senators and congressmen that are notable spaceflight supporters is dwindling, that if Falcon Heavy ends up being a success, I don\u0027t see what future the SLS has. It still doesn\u0027t address the issue of payloads and missions, of course. \n\nTo be honest, it\u0027s all a waste; unless a government is willing to put up the cash for a proper human spaceflight program, it shouldn\u0027t be attempted at all.
