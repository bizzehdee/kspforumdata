It was my main goal in KSP for almost two years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first I used the mods Trajectories (for more accurate trajectory projections in atmo) and the mod Navhud (for having the prograde marker on the screen) but nowadays I can do it in stock. When I do attempt it these days the failure rate is still very high, but the successes feel very very rewarding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI never bothered with FMRS (it\u0027s that time jump mod, right?) just generous use of quicksaves on my practice runs. And clever and quick switching between the craft. Apoapsis of the booster needs to be above atmo at stage sep in my case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI first saw it done in all stock in the stream of EJ_SA and basically started doing it his way until I knew what to look for. Now I use the reentry burn for a midcourse correction and do the rest with the gridfins/bodylift. Only works if you are coming down almost on point before the burn though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me the landing takes place when the 2nd stage is ghost-riding to orbit, and after the landing I have to switch to it immediately for the circularization.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my main play-through I hardly ever use barge landings anymore. Only use my Falcon9 when a RTLS is feasible. I can land it safe on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E peninsula \u0026gt;90% of the time now. Aiming for the launchpad if I feel adventurous. Haven\u0027t really bothered with the barge in a long time. Sometimes I go for Booster Island, that little island a bit north of the perfect equatorial launch azimuth.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could look up some clips of EJ_SA on twitch to see how he does it. It helped me a great deal. That was back in the days of the first successful SpaceX barge landings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGood luck and make sure to report back!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: just thought of something. You say you can land your boosters softly on the water. What you have to do now is optimize that trajectory until you feel it is perfect, so you can splash down your boosters at roughly the same spot consistently. Use landmarks etc. Keep an eye on all the numbers, always stage sep at the same time and all that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce a booster is swimming in the ideal area use this as a target. Dont recover the boosters. Do it over and over and you will see the spread of your splashed boosters will tighten up over time, then put your barge at exactly the center of your now established splash site and you should be golden. I know it takes a lot of time and effort but it will be very rewarding once you nail it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-02-20T14:11:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/20/2020 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Dafni\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atlessa","CreatedById":187974,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-23T00:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m a little surprised... no one else who has any input on the matter?\u00A0 No mods I overlooked, no checkbox in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E I forgot to check (to ensure strict targetting, maybe), nothing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t believe me and Dafni are the only ones who\u0027ve tried this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-23T00:45:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223745662\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022191791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221582417867\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187974\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Atlessa\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n11 minutes ago, Atlessa said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t believe me and Dafni are the only ones who\u0027ve tried this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMebbe try reading thru the Tundra Explorations thread, to see how peeps do it with that mod? or the couple threads for the modded drone ships...

I\u0027ve managed to land not more than few hundred meters from the lanchpad I was trying to aim for. Try to use as many guides as possible - Trajectories can show your path in flight even, not only in map mode. Try to aim a bit further than where you want to land (assuming you\u0027re not too far away to the sides but that you should figure out as soon as possible after separation) because you\u0027re gonna burn to land anyway, and that\u0027s gonna change your horizontal velocity too.
