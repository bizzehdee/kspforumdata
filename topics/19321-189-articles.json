That\u0027s plane design for you! A plane that is stable at supersonic speeds is going to be \u003Cem\u003Esuper\u003C/em\u003E touchy on the pitch at subsonic speeds. This is true of real aircraft. And the opposite: a plane that is stable at subsonic speeds is going to have pretty much zero pitch control when supersonic and will act like a lawn dart instead. The trick is to find that special middle ground where it\u0027s juuuust stable enough at subsonic speeds that you can fly it up to thinner atmosphere and higher speeds where the plane will be more stable. I still have to trial-and-error this but I\u0027ve gotten much better at my CoM/CoL placements to give me something that has a good chance of working right out of the gate.\u003Cp\u003EWhen I get home after work I\u0027ll take screenshots of the aircraft I posted above, but with the CoM/CoL markers activated so you can see the placement of them.

However, given that you have not once told us what stability derivatives you \u003Cem\u003Eare\u003C/em\u003E have problems with, nor have you specified the flight condition that has them being problematic, no one has been able to help you, and I can\u0027t make changes to the wiki to improve it. Since you asked some to explain \u003Cem\u003Ewhy\u003C/em\u003E the numbers are green / red, I\u0027ll give you an answer: when the derivative is green, that means that it will promote static / dynamic stability in whatever range of motions it controls; red would indicate that it discourages static / dynamic stability. For example, Mw being green would mean that the plane is pitch-stable, while Mq being green would indicate that pitching motions dampen out over time (red would indicate that they grow over time, and combined with a green Mw would indicate that the plane is statically stable, but dynamically unstable. This is rare behavior, but would not be revealed by the simplistic CoL indicator).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll also note that you haven\u0027t described \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E you lost control; the vehicle sideslipping and being destroyed requires a different solution to a vehicle that suddenly pitches up and flies apart. But if you\u0027re losing control as you run out of intake air, then your problem isn\u0027t with FAR; that\u0027s stock behavior messing you up, and you would be served well by keeping track of how much thrust your engines are making while running near the edge of the breathable atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: another point: most supersonic vehicles pump fuel forwards and back to maintain balance as they switch from subsonic to supersonic flight. You will need to do this if you want ideal flight characteristics in both regimes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@Starwaster: \u003C/strong\u003EYou have no means to get the changes you want to happen through FAR\u0027s existing code, and I don\u0027t plan on supporting all-in-one wing/flap parts, as I think they discourage design choices and would either result in many, many calculations on the fly to get things done properly or allow balancing issues to crop up due to FAR.

What Zu being wrong is telling you that going faster means you make less lift, which kind of makes sense near Mach 1; it\u0027s undesirable, but the only fix is to go faster. Xw being wrong is stranger, because that implies you get less drag from increasing your angle of attack, which doesn\u0027t make much sense at first glance. Then the fact that you\u0027re checking at Mach 2 flight at SL (make sure to set your density correctly, it changes the results a lot, you probably want 0.2-0.4 for this test) makes it very clear: you\u0027re at a low AoA already, so a small increase isn\u0027t going to cause much additional drag due to lift, however, it might lead to the vertical tails becoming swept enough that they make less drag, and that ends up being a larger change than the induced drag. In both cases, these don\u0027t matter too much and are just flukes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELb being wrong is the tricky one, and I suspect it has more to do with the low AoA resulting from the messed up density conditions than anything else. Generally the solution for that would be to add some dihedral to your wings, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s what you want to do here, since delta wing craft normally have proper Lb values in standard flight conditions. Now, if you want to be bold, leaving this as it is might be a good idea; I\u0027ll explain why:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a flight motion that planes with highly-swept wings can experience at high AoA called \u0022wing rock,\u0022 where the plane rolls back and forth uncontrollably. This is because highly-swept planforms have really strong Lb values at high AoA (in the correct direction, mind you, but while it does make the plane want to roll itself to the \u0022correct\u0022 orientation, it does so too... vigorously; Lb is strong, but it is too strong compared to Nb and Lp, which would counteract sideslip (the initial cause of the motion) and rolling motions (the problem itself), respectively). So having a highly-swept planform with improper values at this flight condition (Mach 2, SL flight) might give you much better Lb values at a different flight condition (say, Mach 3.75, 35 km) that will make ascent and reentry easier. It\u0027s a balancing act, since planes are pretty much impossible to make perfect in ALL conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-01T23:24:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, good info.

If I try to calculate the flap effect in code from the animation directly, that first requires figuring out what vertices make up the flap to begin with, which isn\u0027t necessarily an easy task. It would be easily broken by anyone that did anything more complicated than plain flaps or split flaps. The alternative is to have it as a thing in the config file, but then that requires the hassle where everyone needs configs to make it work, which is something I\u0027ve been trying very hard to get away from. But then that has the standard problems of someone messing up the input values and all of a sudden weird things are happening, especially since for flaps it can be a little more tricky than just figuring out wing geometry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, the FARWingAerodynamicModel and FARControllablerSurface classes are already so bloated that I don\u0027t want to add more to them if I can avoid it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if this is wrt the KSO, those flaps are in a terrible position.
