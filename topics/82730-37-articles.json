But I\u0027m concerned that I\u0027ve got a problem or possibly a conflict with another mod. I did my best to put together the starlifter as a test based on the blueprint int he image on the OP. 1101.654t of lifter (two carge racks are actually empty as I don\u0027t yet have MKS/OKS). 400k units of Liquid Hydrogen, 8 2.5m Nuclear engines and 1 3.75m nuclear engine. Those engines seem really efficient (900 vaccum isp) but Mechjeb is telling me that I\u0027m only going to get 1055m/s with all that fuel. Less then 6 minutes of burn. Barely enough to fly, one-way, from Kerbin to Mun or Minmus. Is that accurate? Looking at the stats, I\u0027m going to burn 305.5 LH/s at max thrust with the GNR-2500 \u0026amp; 733.2 LH/s with the GNR-3750. Seems like I\u0027d be better off using a standard LFO engine.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyone have any idea if the numbers I\u0027m seeing with the starlifter are correct? If they aren\u0027t then I\u0027ll go through all the mods I have and see if one is throwing things off but I\u0027d really rather not spend the time doing that if the 1055m/s dV is correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akira_R","CreatedById":117470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T16:55:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chrisl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chrisl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnyone have any idea if the numbers I\u0027m seeing with the starlifter are correct?

Try adding fuel lines, or you could hyper edit the thing into orbit and do a burn and see if it is pulling fuel properly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoverDude","CreatedById":105198,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T17:11:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso what folks tend to forget is the ratio of ship mass to fuel tank mass. A 6KT ship with a single spherical tank is just not going to cut it, despite the high DV. Hence why you have some pretty large tanks. So a comparison of fuel mass to your ship\u0027s dry weight is likely in order\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
