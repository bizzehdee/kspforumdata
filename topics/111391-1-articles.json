Thanks to some very helpful forum members, I made it to orbit (and back!) safely. It was a great achievement, and I want to do even more KSP! I wanted to ask, what would be another good step after this? I ask this because I am still very new to the game, and would like some advice. I am doing some contracts, and that is it for now. Of course, I want to do a Munar landing, but I believe I should unlock some more things. Is it worth it to do other orbital missions? What is the next logical step? The funny thing is that I have the far future figured out, (Trips to Mun, Minmus, Duna, etc.) but I do not have the near future figured out! If anyone could give me some advice, it would be very appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T18:50:36Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainApollo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomassino","CreatedById":137899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T16:23:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry unmanned Mun flyby, then Mun orbiter, then lander and then you can do the same with kerballed crafts\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T16:29:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thomassino\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thomassino\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETry unmanned Mun flyby, then Mun orbiter, then lander and then you can do the same with kerballed crafts\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E^ This.

It\u0027s easier in every way: less dV needed (so easier to build the rocket), and the surface gravity is much lower, so it\u0027s much easier to control your lander during the last bit before touchdown. Also, Minmus has lots of perfectly flat, level ground to land on-- that can be a big plus in your early career, when you have limited part selection and your landers tend to be tall and top-heavy. The flat ground makes it easier to land without tipping over.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T17:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my TODO-list of new saves:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mun and minimus flyby\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mun and minimus unmanned landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Mun and minimus manned landing and return\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Probes to EVE and Duna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Manned landing on Duna, Ike and Gilly (NOT eve!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Set up infrastructure such as Mining operations (This is back on the ticket now that KSP has this stock.

I\u0027d aim to build up some money to get the first level of upgrades to the tracking station and mission control - this allows for maneuver node planning and predicting where those maneuvers will take you - whilst a trip to the Mun is not impossible without these upgrades it becomes much easier with them in place and having that functionality makes some of the tutorials make more sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for suggestions, you\u0027ve already got some good ones. Rescue ones are perhaps a bit tricky at first - but they\u0027re essentially docking missions, and docking is a very useful skill that seems impossible at first but, like riding a bike is easy once you\u0027ve done it a couple of times. Would suggest the docking tutorial first before approaching these though (there is a docking tutorial now right? I\u0027m assuming there must be).

Trickier intercept though - but once you\u0027ve put a couple of satellites up you\u0027ll have gotten the hang of altering inclination to achieve the intercept.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T17:59:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jarmund\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jarmund\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...and comm sats (the latter if you play with that antenna mod that I can\u0027t remember the name of)...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re thinking of RemoteTech: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou\u0027re thinking of RemoteTech: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83305\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, that\u0027s correct\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mrklaw","CreatedById":143639,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T18:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t yet have the stayputnik, let alone the probodobodyne probe with SAS, or patched conics, I\u0027d spend some time doing kerbin science to unlock more of those earlier tiers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- build a little science buggy in the spaceplane hangar and go around the space centre collecting science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- build a small plane and fly slightly away from the space centre to get science on and over the shores and deserts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- go into polar orbit with a two man crew (two mk1 pods stacked will be fine) and take a pilot for SAS and a scientist to reset experiments.
