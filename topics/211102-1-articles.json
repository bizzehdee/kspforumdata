The only controls that I can use\u00A0 are; trottle controls,\u00A0 L1/R1\u002B triangle (to open flight options), options button to open up the menu, and camera controls.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFYI; EC is Full, I\u0027m able to EVA but unable to go back inside the ship (using the O button) even though there\u0027s no other kerbal in the ship and there\u0027s place. I\u0027ve also make trim (if any) is reset.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only \u0022fix\u0022 I\u0027ve found is to go back to the tracking station and going back inside the ship, which is not great when you\u0027re about the do a maneuver and/or are about to crash into something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo my question is; Is this a known bug and is there a fix to this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
