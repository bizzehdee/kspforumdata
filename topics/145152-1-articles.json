It was long thought to be lost, until two things happened on July 30th, 2016.

I had a large warp-drive vessel with two inflatable heat shields entering the atmosphere of that planet. However, everything except the capsule and one expanded shield survived the initial entry.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb \u0022bravely\u0022 got out for reasons, but he got stuck in the shield for about a minute before being tossed out by physics. That\u0027s when he started spazzing and spaghettifying so much that he elongated into some glitchy abomination from 1 km to 13 km to 100 km to over ONE THOUSAND KM in only a few dozen seconds. Then the surface of the planet turned into a black hole as Jeb fell in and hit something 5.2 kilometers below sea level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the Spaghetti Glitch is (kinda sorta maybe I guess) back! It is time to figure out more relating to this glitch and see how else it can be replicated, besides Danny\u0027s Transcendence Device and the evil inflatable heat shields.
