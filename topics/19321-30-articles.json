The second thing I\u0027d do is make sure that your vertical stabilizer is perfectly straight; at very high dynamic pressures it can cause noticeable yaw and roll rates. Those should take care of the causes of a constant rolling moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for yaw stability, what it sounds you\u0027re really after is yaw damping; for this purpose what you\u0027re looking to do is maximize S\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E * l\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E, where S\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E is the area of the vertical tail and l\u003Csub\u003Ev\u003C/sub\u003E is the distance from the aerodynamic center of the vertical tail to the CoM of the plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you\u0027re not trying to turn the plane using the rudder. If you are, instead roll the plane and pull back to turn. Use the rudder for nothing more than countering adverse yaw (yawing in the opposite direction you intend to turn due to drag differences caused by deflected ailerons) and damping yaw motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind that as Mach number increases the lift slope near 0 AoA decreases (for very small angles, C\u003Csub\u003El\u003C/sub\u003E = 4 * AoA * (M\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E - 1)\u003Csup\u003E-0.5\u003C/sup\u003E). So planes tend to get a little unstable in yaw as they speed up; you may be interested looking up the wedge tail of the X-15 since it also had yaw stability problems at high Mach numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@grom: \u003C/strong\u003EWell, first you place control surfaces where you would like spoilers or flaps. Then you use the Editor GUI\u0027s control surface tab to set their functions and how much they deflect. Then you set what action groups you want the flaps to respond to; there is one command for increasing deflection and another for decreasing. Then, in flight, you use those action groups to control the flaps while the spoilers respond to brake inputs (which I should change to be an action group itself).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E@SkyHook: \u003C/strong\u003EIt sounds like you\u0027re building aerodynamically unstable rockets or taking a highly aggressive ascent profile that is not actually a gravity turn.

So, long story short, MechJeb is wrong and everything is working as it should.\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t believe that a large SRB pushing a tiny payload should be able to accomplish what it did with FAR installed then you\u0027re still too used to the stock drag model. I\u0027d suggest you try looking at what the dV of that rocket is and figure out how high it would go if you only lost 300 - 500 m/s of dV to drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the response! It\u0027s always awesome seeing mod developers giving so much active support.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter trying a lot of things I kinda came to this conclusion for myself. Even though it feels strange considering the differences with the vanilla drag model, it does add up. My testing craft, the module/SRB one, has about 3000 m/s dV according to Mechjeb, but only reaches around 2.2km/s. And gravity losses don\u0027t fill that 800m/s hole. I always knew FAR changed the drag model in a pretty radical fashion, but the difference is pretty stark. In vanilla I could only reach a maximum altitude of about 40km, against 700km using FAR. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for responding and I\u0027m glad nothing is wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-19T23:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, after a few days messing with things, here\u0027s the SpaceShipOne \u002B White Knight flying.
