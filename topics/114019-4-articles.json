Whatever works for you. For me, the badge is fun but trivial. I mostly look forward to the really cool rocket planes that will likely emerge. Now we may start to see craft that truly are \u0022hypersonic\u0022 (Mach 5.5 \u002B). *cue flight of the valkyries music* Will the fastest craft utilize the fringes of the atmosphere as an aerodynamic grappling hook to achieve tremendous speed during their sub orbital trajectories without slinging themselves into escape from kerbin while seeking the fastest return to KSC? Will they simply shove through the thin air for the sheer purpose of optimizing the shortness of the overall distance traveled, balancing this with speed? Will they use the upper air for a more efficient hybrid design that somehow makes use of the air for additional thrust? Will someone find a way to exit the atmosphere entirely and take advantage of the vacuum of space to mount an incredibly fast course in their journey back to KSC on the equatorial or polar geometric plane? Will they take advantage of the new propulsion liberties to get crazy down below 30 km altitude and pull off a feat there?

It\u0027s useful for helping to maintain steady flight and hold a course. When I started in the first thread, I had a very similar opinion to yours on mods. I have flown completely organically with times into the low 50 min. I even bought a flight stick to try out in the thoughts that analog control might let me compete better (it didn\u0027t. Huge deadzones in the stick made it worse than keyboard input. Or, rather, about as bad in terms of fine control but with the added disadvantage of the amount of time it took to move the stick side-to-side).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried mechjeb first, but found pilot assistant to be a little more precise and way more tune-able (The PID approach they\u0027ve used in its design is pretty handy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I use it is to lock the heading at or shortly after take-off then limit the ascent rate as I approach my top speed/operating altitude.
