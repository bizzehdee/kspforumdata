Once you enter Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E (or you\u0027ve captured yourself into Duna orbit), you can separate the probe and the relay into discrete vehicles and use them as needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a couple of pointers I\u0027ve found helpful:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUse a stock fairing with interstage nodes enabled to be able to more easily package both vehicles into an aeroshell (or connect both together inside the payload fairing via a double-sided decoupler)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s usually best to have your relay in a high altitude orbit, and usually on a steep inclination. Both help give the relay a better path with less planetary occlusion -- especially as your commnet grows\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u0022small\u0022 fixed relay dish (not the folding one) will have enough range to reach from Kerbin to Duna (or Eve) regardless of where those planets are with respect to one another, once you\u0027ve upgraded your tracking station. Larger dishes will be needed for exploring deeper into the solar system.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEach upgrade to your tracking station increases the max range of each communication device\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry building a very compact and inexpensive basic relay that you can bring along with almost any probe mission. You should easily be able to build a dirt cheap and very light relay that can be included in any of your probe missions without a drastic redesign of your launch vehicle\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSince these parts can be heavy, try to set up your encounters so that you can decouple your relay when you\u0027ve just entered the planet\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E, and pack it with just enough fuel to park it into your desired orbit. Then, your non-relay probe can carry much lighter radio gear since it only needs to be able to reach the local relay station\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you\u0027re into mods, check out DMagic Orbital Science, which adds a pair of gigantic folding relay dishes. The larger of these, when deployed in Joolian orbit, can reach back to Kerbin with near-100% signal strength.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"}]}
