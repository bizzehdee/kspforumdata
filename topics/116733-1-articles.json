While there isn\u0027t anything groundbreaking in the design, I was fairly pleased with how it came out.\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/ecDiPtr.png](http://i.imgur.com/ecDiPtr.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://imgur.com/a/VfUUT](http://imgur.com/a/VfUUT)\n\u003E \n\u003E 66 tons, 132 parts without cargo. So far it can take about 10 tons to LKO, and I suspect more, if you can fit it in the bay and pilot well.\n\u003E \n\u003E Enjoy!\n\n- last night I tried one more time with \u0022low\u0022 tech to build my SSTO (100.6 tons; the design uses 8 Whiplash and 4 experimental Aerospikes, with a 909 for final rounding and de-orbit), and Made it! ...except, for the flat-spin on re-entry that caused the 4 inline intercoolers to over-heat and explode, resulting in a parachute landing about 3000km from KSC. I suppose its not really an SSTO if it lands with less parts than it took off with, right? Tweaking of the base model will occur, and a second attempt will be made tonight. I think key is setting the Mk2-Mk1 forward LF as a non-draw reserve for balance.\n\nHowever, Murphy\u0027s Law would have it; after 10, \u0022artful, aesthetic\u0022 designs, the one I threw together that looks like a collapsed Pipe Organ is the one that works... ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nIf a further test is successful, I will see about posting in the K-Prize section- this has certainly caused enough angst \u0026 time expenditure to warrant trying for the badge! - Special thanks to Slashy, whose postings on SSTO philosophy were very helpful."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-24T16:35:03Z","Content":"Nah, its still an SSTO, you made it to orbit in one piece!\n\nIts just not a SSTOAB...
