If a Kerbal in a rover seat gets hurt (falls over, say the rover flips over and causes the Kerbal to \u0022crack his head open\u0022) and then gets back up, the Kerbal becomes bugged and can no longer control/leave the seat.

It happens when the kerbal is ejected from the seat, but clips with the rover. You dont get the \u0022leave seat\u0022 button because youre not on the seat any longer already. I had one design that made the kerbal clip, and the only way i found to unclip it it to shake the rover as hard as i can. I doesnt work weel, thats why i always pay attention to clipping now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blubbermonkeys","CreatedById":61719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T10:33:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen he gets ejected try switching vessels to the kerbal and mash the control buttons to make him stand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T11:28:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had that problem.

I merely drove the rover out from under the Kerbal. My seats were positioned right on the edge of the rover like yours OP, but my seats were on the front/rear instead of the sides. I\u0027m sure you could throw him off of that rover by doing some g-force intensive maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
