That said, ISS will soon (I hope) be re-released, then (maybe) updated with a better, Infernal Robotics-based truss on a latter date. HOME3 had some serious issues, but I\u0027ve already fixed a large amount of them (not all, though, the crew vehicle is still barely usable). I\u0027m not giving any dates yet, though. There\u0027s good stuff coming, and it\u0027s gonna get a new thread.\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I recall there being a community patch for the old HOME parts, but I can\u0027t find it. Could someone send it my way? It might be useful to update those, too, while we\u0027re at it. Just not the DEMVs, since they have wheels that use the old system and are thus impossible to directly port to the new KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell if you are going to get the ISS released you better also hurry up with getting CSS to 100%! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T05:43:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe Dragon has studies so he will be balancing that and ksp would be my guess\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K3-Chris","CreatedById":61664,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T05:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t you just separate the DEMV chassis and wheels into separate parts and apply the squad wheel system to the wheels?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DigitalProeliator","CreatedById":75677,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T06:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes it would be IF you have any skill with 3d modeling.
