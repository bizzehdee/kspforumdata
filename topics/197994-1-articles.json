I thought I could improve on that with more judicious use of gravity assists, and I want to see what everyone else is capable of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rules:\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou must start in low Kerbin orbit (under 90 km). This is where the delta-v counter starts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou are allowed to use cheats or hyperedit to get the craft into orbit but that is the only time that this is allowable.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechjeb/autopilots are allowed. This is more of a maneuver planning challenge than a piloting challenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYour score is the number of meters per second of delta-v used between Kerbin orbit and an Eve encounter. Showing delta-v readings at Kerbin and at the Eve encounter is required. Showing delta-v readings at points in between is recommended.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou don\u0027t have to actually get to Eve - if you have one nonzero maneuver remaining before an encounter then you can add that to your current delta-v expenditure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeaderboard:\u003Cbr\u003E\ncamacju - 841 m/s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"camacju","CreatedById":207172,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-08T23:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/VSBd5Jc\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/VSBd5Jc\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd here\u0027s my submission.
