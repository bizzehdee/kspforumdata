So, I clicked and it appeared that there was a crash window as well as a gameplay window... yet my game is still running fine? Is this a normal occurrence? Anyway, I clicked \u0022OK\u0022 on the crash window and it closed my game like it should. I ran KSP again, and the same thing happened, but I could still fly and build like usual, nothing wrong. I checked the error logs and it seems that when it compiles parts it \u0022crashes\u0022 and the window pops up, but the game still works. Is it bad to keep\u00A0playing the game when this happens? I also noticed that when I quit the game from the main menu, it finally freezes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI run KSP with OpenGL on Windows 10 on a 1080p TV.
