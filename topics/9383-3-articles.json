I guess I\\\u0027m the Kerbal equivalent of the Canadian Space Agency - lots of ambition but limited by my budget...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn idea that I did manage to get working was scanning the \u0027radar/laser\u0027 beam back and forth through a \u00C2\u00B140\u00C2\u00B0 arc about the heading vector, rather than just sampling the distance to the terrain directly below the spacecraft.

I do not possess the knowledge to do that, I could code a scanning raycast but I mean the math involved to correct for angle etc. not a clue.

I didn\\\u0027t make the quad count requirement super high but, well, the game updates the quad count as you get nearer to the terrain so a low setting would make that point potentially when you are just above it. I need to add this to the documentation. I could activate a lowres feature in the cfg but I don\\\u0027t know why anyone would want a map of their orbital altitude lol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SmiteZero\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SmiteZero\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI unfortunately keep getting crashes after about 30 or 40 minutes.

Mapping Kerbin is not realistic at the moment because there is nothing to map when you are orbiting 70 km away from the surface or higher. The game changes the resolution of terrain depending on how close you are to the terrain and eventually makes it a low poly sphere I suspect and possibly drops the collision mesh completely.
