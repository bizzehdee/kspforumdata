I\u0027ve tried all ways but using struts and sepatrons are the way to go. I even tried putting parachutes on the spent stages to increase their drag away from the rest of the rocket and to lower them to the ground. It\u0027s a pity you can\u0027t set up delayed deployment of the chutes after you detach the tanks.
