I\u0027m assuming Ctrl and Left-Shift are used atm. But what about alt/Right-Shift and the 1-0 keys. Doubling the ammount of base customization keys would be extremely helpful. And I would think easy to implement. Or are there some shortcuts in the way atm?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while your at it what about the same for all current non custom shortcuts. Alt\u002BB, Alt\u002BU, Alt\u002BMouse click abort, etc. You could have a second version of each custom one for special operations. This would also take loads of things off of the 1-0 custom keys and give a huge amount of range to ship shortcuts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeys:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrent:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbort: Mouse click Abort\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELights: U\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGears: G\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreaks: B (tap only)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustoms: 1-0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew Keys:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbort2: Alt\u002BMouse click Abort\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELights2: Alt\u002BU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGears2: Alt\u002BG\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBreaks2: Alt\u002BB (Toggle Hard On)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustoms2: Alt\u002B1-0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could also add this to other things like V or C keys for views and add more view options or cycling back and forth depending on current setup.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf any of this isn\u0027t possible now will it be after the 1.1 release. Or is it already planned by chance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess this is more of a suggestion at this point.
