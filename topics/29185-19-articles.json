Water as a propellant is really no more than a curiousity in KSP unless it actually becomes part of the game to the point that you can mine water (or ice) and actually use it as a resource for your ships. Also necessary things for it to become meaningful is that we need to have costs and budgets implemented. Then, when you\u0027re low on funds, your deep space mission is struggling and then it starts to get meaningful. But one thing that has to happen (game standpoint) is that we need to be able to reconfigure engines outside of the VAB. The NERVA has the advantage that you can realistically pump a wide variety of things in there that you couldn\u0027t do with a chemically fueled rocket.

I was reading up on it again and they\u0027re assuming a reactor of only 800K. I\u0027m not sure why unless there\u0027s a performance hit for heating it up too much, which you alluded to above. Which runs counter to everything else I\u0027ve read on the subject, which says you want to heat it up (your nuclear propellants) to the point that it disassociates into its lowest molecular weight gasses. (so, not even steam at that point).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RuBisCO","CreatedById":59540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T16:48:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI been able to set up nuclear engines to operate on different fuels in VAB, but once set they can\u0027t switch in flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIRL yes a nuclear thermal rocket engine can be designed to operate on a variety of fuels, but probably could not switch post manufacturing. For example H2O and H2 have very different properties such that being able to switch in flight would present all sorts of problems for pumping, the fuel element coatings, etc, etc. CH4 and CO2 present problems of carbon soot build up and then there is the problem of free oxygen and highly corrosive environment that fuels like CO2 and H2O could present, H2 present problems of metal brittleness and reducing environment. Fuel rods would need to be coated with or made of reduced compounds (metals) for H2, NH3 and CH4 but would need to be made of or ceramic oxides for CO2 and H2O. A pebble/dust bed centrifuged reactors could get over some of these problems by removing structural strength of fuel elements as a concern: as the fuel is then held in place by centrifugation rather then mechanical strength making opening up a larger variety of fuel element types and coatings that don\u0027t need to be strong and could operate with a wide variety of fuels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also like to go back to the point of hydrogen richness of LO2/LH2 engines. The modern Centaur RL10 engine operates on 20.3 kg LO2 and 3.5 kg LH2 per second (according to wiki). That comes to a stoichiometric ratio of 2.72 mol of H2 per mol of O2, ideally the ratio would be 2 for 100% combustion, so the left over H2 makes the combustions H2 rich, in total assuming 100% combustion only 4% of the exhaust by mass is the rich H2, with a outlet temp estimated at 3000 K that 4% has an ISP of 946, the rest has an ISP of 439: total 459. That is pretty close to RL10 measured vacuum ISP of 464. In short the realistic amount of ISP improvement from running hydrogen rich verse pure water output is ~20 s. So a rule of thumb we could go by is that a nuclear rocket operating at the same exhaust temp as LO2/LH2 (~3000 K) rocket should be 20 ISP seconds less then the LO2/LH2 rocket. We would need to bring up the temp by 300 K to make up the difference. 3500-3800 K is probably be best we could expect from even a drum reactor without going with a liquid core drum reactor: that would come to max theoretical ISP of 487 and 1050 for Water and LH2. A liquid core (drum) reactor is claimed to be able to get 1350-1500 ISP with hydrogen which would be a outlet temp of ~7500 K which I don\u0027t believe because even tungsten boils at 5800 K. A Gas Core though operating at 25,000 K with an ISP by my rough calculation (assuming nearly complete dissociation into protons and oxygen) of ~3900 for LH2 and ~1660 for H2O.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would like to see these options beyond just a NERVA facsimile in KSP\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(centrifugal) particle core reactor with ans ISP of 1050 using LH2 and a thrust to weight ratio twice that of the ingame NERVA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(centrifugal) liquid core reactor with an ISP of 1450 using LH2 and a thrust to weight ratio similar to the ingame NERVA\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGas Core reactor with an ISP of 3800 using LH2 and a thrust to weight ratio of say 1/4 that of NERVA and rapid use of nuclear fuel as well as some kind of means to prevent us on or near Kerbin because of all the nuclear waste it would spit out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess all of these could be on a tech tree from NERVA solid core reactor and up. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course my favourite nuclear engine is nuclear salt-water rocket a continuous nuclear explosion engine that make Orion look stupid!
