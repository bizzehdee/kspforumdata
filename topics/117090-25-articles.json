And I would much rather spend that week worth of time doing the proper customizable upper stage stuff.\n\nSo... I\u0027m just going to go ahead and say \u0027No\u0027 at this point. Would be a near-complete waste of time considering the future plans for the mod.\n\nFor future reference, I will not change geometry on finished models. As even a minor geometry change requires redoing most of the texturing (at least it requires re-exploding the model, redoing the AO bake, re-combining the model, re-exporting it to Unity, recompiling in Unity for KSP, AND still updating any changed texture stuff; hours worth of work at least). A good deal of the \u0027optimization\u0027 done to models during the last phases of design renders them... mostly unalterable without having to redo a great deal of the initial geometry work. For example, just to change a hose a tiny bit for a \u0027finished\u0027 model, I need to redo the entire bezier path for it from scratch, re-layout control points, re-convert it to a mesh, re-UV the mesh, re-atlas those UVs into the main model (If they fit properly, and it doesn\u0027t require re-doing the entire UV layout and texture), re-bake the AO for the entire model, AND still redo the texture for the changed geometry (or whole texture in some cases, if the overall UV layout changed).\n\nBasically it takes longer to -change- an existing finished model than it would to create an entirely new model. As soon as you start seeing preview images with actual color/texure (beyond the raw AO bake), it is already too late for geometry changes. Generally the AO bake stage is the last point at which geometry changes can be made without major impact to the rest of the work-flow/time-to-completion.\n\nEdit:\n\nRough geometry for J-2 engine. This is prior to doing any of the fittings and/or merging the hoses into the turbos/manifolds in one fashion or another. Still likely another day worth of geometry work before I can start unwrapping. Looking not too bad though. Let me know if you spot anything that looks \u0027off\u0027, as now is about the last opportunity to change anything major.\n\n![9tEzGVw.png](http://i.imgur.com/9tEzGVw.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T22:47:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T13:13:37Z","Content":"how is the J-2 going? also, are you planning on adding engine mounts for them in this release?"},{"CreatedByName":"01010101lzy","CreatedById":118333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T13:32:30Z","Content":"Will there be a somewhat RSS or RO compatible release eventually?(something like 8.4m or 10m tanks and massive engines or so)"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T13:39:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Will there be a somewhat RSS or RO compatible release eventually?(something like 8.4m or 10m tanks and massive engines or so)\n\nMost is included in the latest RO release, you can get WIP versions in the RO repository that adds RO support to the F-1 and F-1B though\n\nand in the RO release there is 5.5, 6.6, 8.4 and 10m tanks plus the ones available in the original pack"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T16:08:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E how is the J-2 going? also, are you planning on adding engine mounts for them in this release?\n\nGood.

Common bulkhead is most commonly seen with the Centaur series of upper stages (and the ACES concept), while the split tank is what is used for the Delta-IV upper stages (and ICPS/HUS/EUS/etc).\n\nIt seems like it should be fairly easy to apply a SSTUCustomFuelTank type module to handle doing mesh-switching w/volume-based resource switching. Might be an even more customized module to handle the upper stages though, as they will have some vastly different requirements compared to the fuel tanks. My biggest quandry at this point is actually deciding if I should try and include both styles in a single part, or have two parts-per-stack-size (one part for common-bulkhead, another for split tanks). In theory, I could put it -all- into a single part (all stack sizes, both varieties), though the GUI/interface might become a bit confusing and cluttered. So, will likely be going with one part per stack size (or two parts per-stack-size, for the different varieties). I also intend for the upper stages to include some form of RCS and/or ullage engines, and may have options for solar panels.\n\nThe current idea is that you will be able to select your upper stage part, add it to your vessel, and then customize it to the shape/stats that you want. This will likely be accomplished by using mesh/model switching similar to the fuel tanks, switching in longer or shorter tank models and adjusting attach-node/attached part locations. Additional controls would be available to add/remove/enable/disable the solar panel and rcs options. Will likely come texture-switch enabled, with similar texture sets to the fuel tanks.\n\nEdit:\n\nUpdated J-2 Geoemtry -- still have 6 more pipes to join/make fittings for, the gimbal to finish up, and the gimbal actuators(pistons)/mounting brackets.\n\n![i5xx2E8.png](http://i.imgur.com/i5xx2E8.png)\n\nFurther Edit:\n\nNear-final geometry -- all that is left is adding some mounting brackets to things (electronics controls, turbos). Piping and fittings are done, gimbal and pistons are done. Should move on to unwrapping/layout tomorrow, and textures perhaps tomorrow/Saturday/Sunday.\n\n![iHTAJzA.png](http://i.imgur.com/iHTAJzA.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-12T22:27:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/12/2015 10:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T22:39:50Z","Content":"So... have been reviewing some of the recent changes to other mods that I use heavily, namely MKS and Near-Future.

Below are couple of my thoughts after a quick brainstorming, feel free to ignore if you don\u0027t like them:\n\nMulti-Axis-tracking - I would love to implement that for planetary purposes, if there was possibility to implement some kind of limitation (so for example rotate Y axis \u002B50 to -50 degrees, X axis \u002B20 to -30 degrees) it would be cool. Also you might consider having multitracking module version with configurable output resources and configurable body tracking - for example solar tracking focusing mirrors for thermal energy / heat generation (isru purposes) or Kerbal tacking large dishes ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nAnother thing considering tracking, however might be difficult to implement - would be the ability to specify multiple objects within a part that track stuff, for example multiple solar panels within one part.\n\nMultidocking module - I would love to use some optimized docking port code for my needs, but we already had discussion about it and I understand it\u0027s complex matter (KSP hehe) so I won\u0027t bother you more ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nRCS ports - yah it could be cool idea to have them embedded in larger station parts. Personally I think that 4 multidirectional ports placed on a circle around part\u0027s CoM should be enough for docking them themselves. Maybe integrated probe core in every large module could also help (so a part alone could be detached and positioned - docked using rcs ports). Also from fuel perspective you might consider either including a monoprop tanks for every part that has embedded rcs thrusters (so no need for more parts with monoprop), or having rcs thrusters use LFO so no need to worry about monoprop at all. I guess the first option would be more consistent with stock ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFrom the looks perspective when we have finished station with multiple docking ports on it, it might look a little bit overloaded, so maybe it would be good idea to make them more embedded in the parts geometry (i.e. similar to shuttle nose).\n\nAnd the last little thing; you might consider including KIS storage in your resources switch (I think Angel-125 - the dev of Pathfinder and Buffalo - has this already implemented in his mod), so for example one config would be 1000 l for KIS, another config = 500 l for KIS and 500 monoprop, 3rd config = just 1000 monoprop etc.\n\n-------------------------\n\nJust letting you know;\n\nFor my mod I\u0027m testing small \u0027boxy\u0027 reactor for vehicles with throttled down output compared to mass (so less radiation area needed) however with integrated radiators on the walls. I plan to make my future reactors much less capable than current ones for NF / MKS (for planetary needs: heavier, safer, fully automatic, require no maintenance, longer periods of operation however no refuelling ability). I\u0027ll probably follow RAPID-L derived design, however even more minimized and with less output so around 100 kW for 2t mass.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T09:38:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 09:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by riocrokite**"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T14:38:20Z","Content":"expanding the idea of using KIS: Landers could have a module for KIS storage and bring a Lunar Rover with them"},{"CreatedByName":"davidy12","CreatedById":143411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T15:13:09Z","Content":"Are there going to be engine mounts for the J-2?

Also from fuel perspective you might consider either including a monoprop tanks for every part that has embedded rcs thrusters (so no need for more parts with monoprop), or having rcs thrusters use LFO so no need to worry about monoprop at all. I guess the first option would be more consistent with stock ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\u003E \n\u003E From the looks perspective when we have finished station with multiple docking ports on it, it might look a little bit overloaded, so maybe it would be good idea to make them more embedded in the parts geometry (i.e. similar to shuttle nose).\n\u003E \n\u003E And the last little thing; you might consider including KIS storage in your resources switch (I think Angel-125 - the dev of Pathfinder and Buffalo - has this already implemented in his mod), so for example one config would be 1000 l for KIS, another config = 500 l for KIS and 500 monoprop, 3rd config = just 1000 monoprop etc.\n\u003E \n\u003E -------------------------\n\u003E \n\u003E Just letting you know;\n\u003E \n\u003E For my mod I\u0027m testing small \u0027boxy\u0027 reactor for vehicles with throttled down output compared to mass (so less radiation area needed) however with integrated radiators on the walls. I plan to make my future reactors much less capable than current ones for NF / MKS (for planetary needs: heavier, safer, fully automatic, require no maintenance, longer periods of operation however no refuelling ability). I\u0027ll probably follow RAPID-L derived design, however even more minimized and with less output so around 100 kW for 2t mass.\n\nMulti-Axis Tracking -- hmm.. some interesting ideas. Will give them some thought when I\u0027m working through the station parts. Really though, the solar-panel module is designed specifically for solar panels, so much of that stuff is already out of consideration. Would be simple enough to write plugins for those other functions if I ever found a need for them.\n\nMulti-tracking within a part -- already implemented; see the SC-B-SM (has four solar panels in it), and the LC-DSP (deployable solar panel module in the fuel sections; has four panels in it as well). The lander-core pods also have multi-panel-aware modules; and actually use multiple raycasts/transforms to determine output from their \u0027curved\u0027 panel sections.\n\nMulti-docking module -- I already have the stock-derived multi-docking-port module written and working (as far as I know), I just haven\u0027t had time to make the actual parts for it yet. So, if you need a multi-docking-port part/module, let me know and I can go through the instructions / make sure it actually is working.\n\nKIS -- As \u0027KIS storage\u0027 is not a resource, it won\u0027t really work in that manner. Would require a ton of effort just to add support for -just that mod- (lots of special casing/extra stuff that would be useless/wasted when KIS was not installed). Even less important as there are already dedicated KIS containers in multiple sizes, from many other mods. When stock includes KIS functionality / it is an always present capability, at that point I will consider adding a resource-switch option for it.\n\nEdit:\n\n\u0027Final\u0027 geometry for J-2 engine. It is by a good margin the most detailed geometry that I have done to date. Actually had to spend a bit of time the past few days to cut out some polys to keep it in the \u0027sane\u0027 range.\n\nWill be moving on to UV unwrap/layout/AO bake today, and texturing perhaps tomorrow and Sunday mornings.\n\n![Pjn7liy.png](http://i.imgur.com/Pjn7liy.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-13T17:43:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2015 05:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage**"},{"CreatedByName":"riocrokite","CreatedById":129319,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T17:50:49Z","Content":"hey Shadow, thx for replying,\n\nas always awesome modelling with J-2:)\n\nIf you had time to provide me with the code of multidocking module I could create a part and test it myself ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T18:13:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E hey Shadow, thx for replying,\n\u003E as always awesome modelling with J-2:)\n\u003E \n\u003E If you had time to provide me with the code of multidocking module I could create a part and test it myself ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nThe module is quite simple; its an extension of the stock module with an additional field to name the port with a unique name. It is already included in the SSTUTools.dll plugin that is distributed with SSTU.\n\nBasically, take the stock docking port module config, change the \u0027name\u0027 field to SSTUMultiDockingPort, and add the \u0027portName\u0027 field with whatever you want that port to be called. Requires one module per-docking port. So, if your part has 5 ports, it will need 5 modules. Each module needs a unique docking transform, and adding a unique \u0027control\u0027 transform is also possible (so the \u0027control from here\u0027 option works properly).\n\nThe -very- short source for the module can be found at:\n\n[https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/blob/master/Source/Module/SSTUMultiDockingPort.cs](https://github.com/shadowmage45/SSTULabs/blob/master/Source/Module/SSTUMultiDockingPort.cs)"}]}
