And I would much rather spend that week worth of time doing the proper customizable upper stage stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo... I\u0027m just going to go ahead and say \u0027No\u0027 at this point. Would be a near-complete waste of time considering the future plans for the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future reference, I will not change geometry on finished models. As even a minor geometry change requires redoing most of the texturing (at least it requires re-exploding the model, redoing the AO bake, re-combining the model, re-exporting it to Unity, recompiling in Unity for KSP, AND still updating any changed texture stuff; hours worth of work at least). A good deal of the \u0027optimization\u0027 done to models during the last phases of design renders them... mostly unalterable without having to redo a great deal of the initial geometry work. For example, just to change a hose a tiny bit for a \u0027finished\u0027 model, I need to redo the entire bezier path for it from scratch, re-layout control points, re-convert it to a mesh, re-UV the mesh, re-atlas those UVs into the main model (If they fit properly, and it doesn\u0027t require re-doing the entire UV layout and texture), re-bake the AO for the entire model, AND still redo the texture for the changed geometry (or whole texture in some cases, if the overall UV layout changed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically it takes longer to -change- an existing finished model than it would to create an entirely new model. As soon as you start seeing preview images with actual color/texure (beyond the raw AO bake), it is already too late for geometry changes. Generally the AO bake stage is the last point at which geometry changes can be made without major impact to the rest of the work-flow/time-to-completion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERough geometry for J-2 engine. This is prior to doing any of the fittings and/or merging the hoses into the turbos/manifolds in one fashion or another. Still likely another day worth of geometry work before I can start unwrapping. Looking not too bad though. Let me know if you spot anything that looks \u0027off\u0027, as now is about the last opportunity to change anything major.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9tEzGVw.png\u0022 alt=\u00229tEzGVw.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T22:47:50Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 10:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Shadowmage\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T13:13:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehow is the J-2 going? also, are you planning on adding engine mounts for them in this release?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"01010101lzy","CreatedById":118333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T13:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill there be a somewhat RSS or RO compatible release eventually?(something like 8.4m or 10m tanks and massive engines or so)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoseEduardo","CreatedById":127759,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T13:39:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002201010101lzy\u0022 data-cite=\u002201010101lzy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWill there be a somewhat RSS or RO compatible release eventually?(something like 8.4m or 10m tanks and massive engines or so)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost is included in the latest RO release, you can get WIP versions in the RO repository that adds RO support to the F-1 and F-1B though\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand in the RO release there is 5.5, 6.6, 8.4 and 10m tanks plus the ones available in the original pack\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shadowmage","CreatedById":138730,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T16:08:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoseEduardo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JoseEduardo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehow is the J-2 going? also, are you planning on adding engine mounts for them in this release?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood.

Common bulkhead is most commonly seen with the Centaur series of upper stages (and the ACES concept), while the split tank is what is used for the Delta-IV upper stages (and ICPS/HUS/EUS/etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like it should be fairly easy to apply a SSTUCustomFuelTank type module to handle doing mesh-switching w/volume-based resource switching. Might be an even more customized module to handle the upper stages though, as they will have some vastly different requirements compared to the fuel tanks. My biggest quandry at this point is actually deciding if I should try and include both styles in a single part, or have two parts-per-stack-size (one part for common-bulkhead, another for split tanks). In theory, I could put it -all- into a single part (all stack sizes, both varieties), though the GUI/interface might become a bit confusing and cluttered. So, will likely be going with one part per stack size (or two parts per-stack-size, for the different varieties). I also intend for the upper stages to include some form of RCS and/or ullage engines, and may have options for solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current idea is that you will be able to select your upper stage part, add it to your vessel, and then customize it to the shape/stats that you want. This will likely be accomplished by using mesh/model switching similar to the fuel tanks, switching in longer or shorter tank models and adjusting attach-node/attached part locations. Additional controls would be available to add/remove/enable/disable the solar panel and rcs options. Will likely come texture-switch enabled, with similar texture sets to the fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdated J-2 Geoemtry -- still have 6 more pipes to join/make fittings for, the gimbal to finish up, and the gimbal actuators(pistons)/mounting brackets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/i5xx2E8.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i5xx2E8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther Edit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENear-final geometry -- all that is left is adding some mounting brackets to things (electronics controls, turbos).
