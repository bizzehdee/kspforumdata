So first try pressing Right Caps Lock to make your keyboard input smaller, then use Q or E to bank to left or right, then use the S key to pull the nose up and into the turn. When you\u0027re flying the direction you wish to go, use the other Roll key to level out again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T03:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have SAS turned on? If so, it resists turning. That makes the plane more stable, but less manueverable. You can either turn it off again, or temporarily deactivate it with the F key just long enough to make your sharp turn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"emfolkerts","CreatedById":15046,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T03:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks ill give it a go and let you know how it goes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"emfolkerts","CreatedById":15046,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-08T04:14:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edid what you said and it worked thanks i even figured out how to land\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
