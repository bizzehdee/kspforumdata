There appears to be a lot of reading between the lines in Kerbal. Such as, I can do an experiment and it will yield that it was done in outer space, or the high atmosphere. But to understand where that dividing line is- is something I\u0027d have to find out for myself on the side. Often by reading articles online. So I got to thinking, wouldn\u0027t it be interesting to see short articles that might appear whenever you upgrade your science tree- or whenever you achieve something (by doing an experiment for example). The articles could then inform the players of interesting facts discovered by the Kerbal scientists and maybe even lead the player to investigating the particular biome or location further based on the science discovered. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFood for thought :]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Keymaster89","CreatedById":100480,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T08:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt will sure add some \u0022color\u0022 to the game ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JimmyAgent007","CreatedById":74761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-29T16:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esomething like this has been suggested before, and i agree, some spinning newspapers or what not would totally add \u0022colour\u0022 to the game. but it would be quite low priority for now until the polish stage before 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
