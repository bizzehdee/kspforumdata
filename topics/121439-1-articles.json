So I thought about making my own version, and I\u0027ve made up a quick drawing;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9iw0AAY.png\u0022 alt=\u00229iw0AAY.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those thinking how ridiculous the head piece is, its loosely based on the head molds for the LEGO Simpsons theme, where the heads are molded in the shape of the character\u0027s head, rather than just a default LEGO head piece with a special print or hair piece.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe face mold bit in the upper right corner is kinda also about this, regarding if the mouths/expressions should be printed or molded. Personally, I think a printed version would be okay, but if anyone thinks otherwise I won\u0027t fight against your opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure about making two versions of the RCS Pack; one packed away (RCS off) and one with the controls out (RCS on), it may not be a good idea, since the plastic bar that represents the arm for the controls might be too thin and easy to break off, but again its an idea, we\u0027ll just have to see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the random event anyone thinks so; I am not making this in real life. This is just an idea, and I can\u0027t confirm it will become a reality. I could, of course, try posting the final version(s) onto LEGO Ideas, a site where people submit LEGO set ideas which could, if supported enough, become a reality, but since they won\u0027t accept custom or new molds, it\u0027d take a miracle for them to produce it officially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Leg and Face mold sections are things I couldn\u0027t decide on, and have hence left for people to choose if they wish to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you wish to not decide, Constructive Criticism as well as Positive/Negative comments or suggestions are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will try my best to do more in future, such as design the prints for torsos, RCS Packs, etc as well as maybe make Female Kerbal designs, but for now, I await feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Fred Cop--\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T18:32:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would be great!
