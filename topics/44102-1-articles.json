The automatic fairings in KSP need to be a lot stronger and more rigid - especially since putting a ton of struts, both straight and angled, across the gap doesn\u0027t do much for stiffness. The struts work better when there\u0027s a size difference between stages so they can angle outwards. Going straight across an engine between equal size stages all the struts seem to do is make the parts hold together a little better while still allowing things to flap back and forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStruts seem to be quite elastic, but somewhat variable in that property. I\u0027ve had them break in cases where there ought not to be any reason for it and I have a rocket that might be manually flyable but MechJeb just slams the throttle up and down while the rocket does an impression of a slinky on fire - without one strut breaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is there besides the too flexible struts for holding two stages *rigidly* together, which will also pop off like struts when staging?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just made a rocket yesterday using procedural fairings, which help to some extent but the top end doesn\u0027t seem to actually be \u0022bolted\u0022 to the stage above.

(It really should have been revision 5 or 6 but AARP\u0027s chief engineer decreed that it was going to be 3 no matter how many redesigns it took to come up with one that wouldn\u0027t break.) I first tried 8 struts across, didn\u0027t work. The small tanks stage off the towers as they empty but I had to leave the 2nd from bottom riding along as dead weight so it wouldn\u0027t come apart going through the gravity turn. Since that worked I took off the struts straight between the big tanks since they weren\u0027t adding anything but weight. BLB-3 is the first appearance of the AARP stock lander, which I\u0027ve been trying to put a rocket under that can get it to Mun without using any of the lander\u0027s fuel until after it de-orbits the Mun. *Then* I\u0027m hoping it\u0027ll have enough fuel left to leave Mun SOI and fall back to Kerbin and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s two big failures in there, RD-BLB and RD-BLB-FAIL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERD-BLB was supposed to be a \u0022Reduced Diameter\u0022 rocket - reduced by using a slim core flanked by boosters. Well it doesn\u0027t work too well. It likes to lose fuel pipes during staging. It would often pop some just sitting on the pad so I put in some extras for backup. When it manages to get through the lower half without incident, the upper half doesn\u0027t have enough TWR so it slowly loses altitude. I gave up on it but saved it then wasted a bunch of time trying to build a lower half that could get the upper high enough it could keep going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERD-BLB-DR sort of succeeds at it but gave up all pretense of being reduced anything. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E Gave up on the slim core design completely. I have a nuclear engine in the middle and nowhere to put angled struts to brace above it so I just put several straight across and it wobbles around. Fortunately RCS keeps it under control. It also has 16 large SRBs to get it off the pad before the big engines kick in, otherwise it\u0027ll break in half.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERD-BLB-FAIL is FAIL. MechJeb seems to fly it different every time. I just did and the throttle bouncing up and down wasn\u0027t as violent as the last time I tried (after which it became FAIL). It\u0027s probably workable manually flown but is also saddled with the slim core upper half that doesn\u0027t work. I kept it because during it\u0027s first test in its current form it made me laugh at how MechJeb was whanging the throttle up and down - I was waiting for it to fall apart but it didn\u0027t - at least not before I aborted the flight and started the DR design. The 70K variant just sets the AARP lander on top of the DR lower half - the sole object is to kick it up to a 70K orbit for eventual use for crew exchange of stations in LKO. Should work as long as there\u0027s fuel up there to top off the lander tanks if it has to climb higher than 70K.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBLB originally stood for Big Light Booster as I figured it might be possible to stack up a few Rockomax 64 tanks and engines.
