These memory limits (like the memory limits of most all programs) is a software limitation, not an actual hardware one. Mostly stems from limitations of legacy 32-bit code. With even the best coding, 32-bits can only allocate 3, maybe 4GB of RAM for any single process. Not exactly KSP\u0027s fault since they build on Unity (which is where the limit comes from). Once software developers can finally start transitioning to code that fully utilizes 64-bit OS, it will be an awesome day for everyone (except people using dinosaur 32-bit OS systems).
