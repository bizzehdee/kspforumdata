I have noticed that the rocket is significantly more controllable with a nose cone vs a parachute at the top (in fact, I have a lot of trouble keeping it upright without a nose cone). Does the parachute ALWAYS have to be on top? Isn\u0027t there a way to mount the parachute inside the fuselage that I can decouple during free fall?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-07-18T02:16:49Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2013 02:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Oddible\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T02:11:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a radial one in stock parts I think.

Just wanted to follow up and clarify that the controllability issue I was experiencing didn\u0027t really have anything to do with the parachute, it is just that the nose cone is significantly lighter than my Mk-16 parachute so when I swapped them my craft got top heavy and now wobbles a lot without the 1st stage to balance it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T02:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, excepted for being lighter, the nose cones are just dead weight and don\u0027t affect air flow at all. You could also use small cubic octagonal struts to mount the small parachutes radially using part clipping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial parachutes are your best bet, 3\u002B is probably the most stable way of doing it.
