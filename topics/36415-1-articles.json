Well almost, actually you need to keep adding the (\u0022distance covered of kerbin\u0027s solar orbit during the time the Mun catches up to new solar position in the sky\u0022/\u0022total length of kerbin\u0027s solar orbit\u0022)*\u0022duration of munar\u0022 orbit part for infinity as it should be an infinite geometric series. Luckily though since we know the Mun eventually does eclipse the Sun and kerbin doesn\u0027t really travel too fast around its orbit the ratio we need to keep adding should be smaller than 1 which means that an the sum of infinite ratios we would need to count to know when the eclipse happens is indeed a fixed number rather than infinity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall, without doing the math (too lazy to count the exact numbers), I would say that it happens on average at least once per two Mun orbits around Kerbin. So not a month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:actually wait, if the Mun is traveling around Kerbin in the same direction as Kerbin is around the sun it should actually be (duration of munar orbit)-(sum of infinite series of \u0022catch up\u0022 ratios). Circles make everything complicated. But that means it actually happens at least once every orbit and sometimes twice! Mind=blown.
