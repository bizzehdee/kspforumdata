(I would hope the loss of efficiency wouldn\u0027t be more than 10%. I\u0027m not quite sure how to adjust the simple calculations to account for when you leave from orbit instead of from straight shot, you won\u0027t escape exactly prograde. Maybe someone smarter knows.)\n\nAnyway that all seems doable. Though admittedly that\u0027s a cheap thing for me to say since I\u0027ve not tried to do it. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T18:39:49Z","Content":"Its not really that hard, guys... all you need is...

There is a second option of escaping Kerbin on a sub-orbital Kerbol trajectory.\n\nMissions to put an object on a Kerbol escape trajectory are satisfied by putting the required object into a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory (as opposed to a nice periodic elliptical or circular orbit). I\u0027m thinking especially of those crazy missions to eject a class E asteroid from Kerbol. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) They do not depend on a finite SOI. You do not escape the SOI of course, but that is not the definition of escape KSP uses.\n\nDoing a suborbital is an interesting strategy. That would require that at the point you leave Kerbin you have an orbital velocity of 1803 m/s around Kerbol (so your eliptical orbit is below Kerbol\u0027s surface). This means I guess escaping at about 7481 m/s retrograde. Using the same strategy as I outlined above that means 8122 m/s at 100km, so if done from orbit it would require ~6000 m/s delta v?\n\nStill doable, but harder?"},{"CreatedByName":"Terwin","CreatedById":139655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T16:29:25Z","Content":"I wonder how much of that 5000 escape d/v or 6000 deoribt d/v you could save if you start in a low-Minmus orbit when Minmus is in the correct orbital position...\n\n(I like launching my interplanetary missions from Minmus because that makes it easy to have practically full fuel\u002Bore tanks without adding additional stages.

(I forget myself. Is it 200 m/s? 300 m/s?) Anyway, you\u0027d get for \u0022free\u0022 back the usual 930 m/s, minus whatever that is. Maybe 600 m/s, 700 m/s?\n\nAnd then you\u0027re really, really lucky and good, the Mun lines up just right so you can use its 542.5 m/s orbital velocity to extract another ~1100 m/s, for a total gain of ~1700 m/s. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nRight.
