I think the \u0022once\u0022 parameter on KSPAddon is meant for this purpose. I suggest adding some logging to your constructor, OnStart and OnAwake to make sure you\u0027re not getting lots of them..."},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T16:38:48Z","Content":"Yep, I\u0027m aware of that but it\u0027s good you mentioned that.
