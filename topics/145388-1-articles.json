Imagine being able to build realistic\u00A0hovercrafts, ekranoplans, etc.. This would also make landings a bit easier, since you get an extra blob of air pressure under your aircraft as you near the ground.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EExhaust Compression\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, take a regular engine part, build an aerodynamic shell around it, and ta-da! Makeshift extra-large ramjet. The engine itself gets you going, and then as the shell takes in\u00A0larger and larger volumes of\u00A0air for the engine\u00A0to heat up and compress, the more thrust you get. This would be a great way for players to create their own rocket-ramjet hybrid engines or more unique supersonic aircraft. This would also allow more realistic hovercrafts since the player could build a functioning skirt that compresses engine thrust while also having the Ground Effect to work with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-04T22:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGround effect would be nice, but I don\u0027t foresee it being implemented and would at best be a ground-based, atmospheric only niche. Kerbin and particularly Lathe\u0027s oceans are ideal for ekranoplans, as they\u0027re almost perfectly smooth. However, KSP hydrofoils are easily competetive with RL ekranoplans anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI suspect that modelling dynamic air pressure in KSP would be very difficult and resource-intensive.
