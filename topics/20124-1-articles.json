Smaller craft help, but Kerbol help me if I launch a 3-man capsule with the larger fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I had this issue, I used mechjeb mainly to learn how to land, and then later for the orbital information, for zero-personnel launches, and for operations that I\u0027ve already mastered (landing and launches are so easy for me now, it\u0027s almost become boring). And when I want to do something very particular (like land a large craft or base on a planet), I may indulge myself with mechjeb after a couple of failed non-mechjeb attempts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still believe mechjeb is a great learning tool for newbie kerbonauts. It\u0027s not perfect in anything it does, but it\u0027ll give you the information you need to perfect your own skills when first learning to play the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides ... mechjeb is such an awesome name, you almost HAVE to use it in every mission \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wish the stock game had a lot of the info from MechJeb though (true altitude, inclination, etc).
