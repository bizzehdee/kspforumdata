That\u0027s fun. These controls allow smoother, more precise input to all three axes, which is very good for airplanes... but not really necessary for most spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem: My flight sim hardware tends to give small, undesired control inputs to spacecraft. This results in a tumbling satellite and wasted monopropellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current solution: I increased the deadzones for all three axes so when the joystick and rudder pedals are at rest, they don\u0027t register any control inputs. Satellites are now well-behaved; this solution seems okay at first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Cem\u003Enew\u003C/em\u003E problem: Now the deadzones are too big for the desired fine control for airplanes! I want to roll left or right just a fraction of a degree, but the ailerons don\u0027t move until the stick is so far over that the resulting roll is more like five degrees. I find myself using keyboard to fine tune the plane\u0027s attitude... which completely defeats the purpose of using a joystick!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027m wondering if there\u0027s a way to toggle controller inputs on and off completely with a hotkey or joystick button. That way I could set the deadzones for very fine control, and simply hit a button any time I want to use the hardware. Hit the button again to turn the hardware input off and use keyboard control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes this mod exist already? If not, is it possible? I know next to nothing about coding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
