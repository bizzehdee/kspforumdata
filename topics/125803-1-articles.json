Then when it ray traces and finds the part it can look at an only attach to the part and number for that part. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would imagine this could be done by adding a number to every identical part as you add it to a ship. Then it can identify the part model and number to make sure it\u0026#39;s still attached or to make it attach to only that same part. This or something similar would save a huge hassle with these types of parts. Especially so they don\u0026#39;t fly off and attach to whatever other part they find afterwords if you move the ship around or merge it with another. Maybe it could ray trace through parts, I assume it does already, and then find the first layer of the ship part it can use and attach. Or if there is a cheap way to add a grid location on a part you could have the parts identified via a grid and put it at that exact same spot on the other part. Although I would be worried about to much resources being used to do this. Especially when it comes to CTD\u0026#39;s and other lag issues with alot of part or alot of stacking of parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIs it likely this sort of thing can or is already going to be added with or after 1.1?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is of course also assuming this has anything to do with why parts attach to different parts in some circumstances.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-18T08:53:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2015 08:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
