However there was no consideration on some of the problems on practicality. For example, a first stage with 62 orange tanks and 62 mainsail engines. Another example is that the Eve lander stage is 400 tones, even if I didn\u0027t make it all vertical you still won\u0027t be able to land it safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J3aP3CF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022J3aP3CF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/k7KuLxM.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022k7KuLxM.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/QpjLuXy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022QpjLuXy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some improvements over that crazy simple translation.
