Even if there is no functional difference between creating your own Sandbox by clicking a few buttons in the difficulty settings and having a \u201Cmode\u201D listed next to Adventure mode that just clicks those buttons for you people will perceive them very differently, and will probably feel slighted by the former. There\u2019s a strong sandbox culture that\u0027s grown up in KSP and its worth giving it its due. I would think it wise however to execute Sandbox as individual difficulty toggles that you could customize and turn on and off even after you\u2019d gotten started.
