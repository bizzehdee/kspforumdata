Unfortunately if I make the attachment nodes any larger they envelope the other attachment nodes making it hard to snap to the right ones. I have an idea for that which I\u0027m pursuing that will allow small nodes in the editor that get scaled up when you load the ship into flight mode.

A few little comments though: the texture on the drop tank looks more like a gel or the surface of a liquid than a metal foil; the trusses seem to have a flat, almost painted look rather than a polished metal one; the drop tanks looks to be suspened invisibly when attatched to the truss and there is no clear means of attatchment; also the 3.75m drop tank hold almost 32000 liquid fuel when a normal tank of the same size holds around 6000; finally could you explain the purpose of the truss radiator in-game?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOOooooooh ho..... I think I just realized what the gel comment is about. The 10 meter tank looks a little translucent.
