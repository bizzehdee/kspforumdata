With opening hatches\n\n2.1 With opening hatches and no ramp (So it will be possible to open them in the bottom and extend a ramp like shown on this picture.\n\n![oJ39W.jpg](http://i.snag.gy/oJ39W.jpg)\n\nI will post a link to this topic in the respective parts owners\u0027 topics as well, but for now the most important parts for me are the 3.75 to mk3 hollow adapter (with ramps to align) and the 3.75 part with opening hatches.\n\nParts list for better alignment and their respective owners/topics in the forum :\n\nMk3 cargo bay is stock.\n\nMk4 Parts : [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101699)\n\nCockpit, 3.75 hollow fuselage and mk3 ramp: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79542) - SXT\n\nThe SXT seem to have no problems license wise to modify and build upon their models, as long as they are credited for the basic product.

Something like a small ramp inside the hollow mk3 to 3.75 detail.\n\nDespite the picture, no opening hatch. Just used the old picture. Also the transition mk3 to 3.75 plus hatches will not look nice.\n\n![X8W7W.jpg](http://snag.gy/X8W7W.jpg)\n\nThank you in advance !"},{"CreatedByName":"drtedastro","CreatedById":70911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T23:27:48Z","Content":"Great mod...\n\nI am trying to find that cockpit, the 747 cargo looking one.\n\nHave I overlooked where it is ???\n\nI downloaded the above links, but don\u0027t seem to find it...\n\nI must be missing something, possibly my mind.\n\nany info will be appreciated...
