They should be written in the contract.\n\nIf it is \u0022Landed at Kerbin\u0022, make sure your craft is on the ground. If you put the craft on launch clamps too high above the ground, the game will not consider you landed on Kerbin (you can use launch clamps, but the craft must be very close to the ground)."},{"CreatedByName":"Helmseye","CreatedById":140608,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T20:19:14Z","Content":"thank you\n\nit says test TR-18a Stack Decoupler: perform the test, activate the part through the staging sequence when all test conditions are met\n\nlocation: Kerbin\n\nLand at Kerbin\n\nso i have managed location and to land and I use the decoupler but this seems to not be enough"},{"CreatedByName":"Helmseye","CreatedById":140608,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T21:03:58Z","Content":"thanks for input discovered i do not need to fly just test on ground"},{"CreatedByName":"impyre","CreatedById":116031,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T05:34:23Z","Content":"Yeah, you have to meet \\*all situational requirements at the same time\\*, which in this case means you have to be sitting on the ground when you stage the decoupler (as you found out). As a word of caution, pay careful attention to contracts requirements before accepting them. Some are absurdly difficult with compensation that may not even cover costs. Some of the more difficult ones I\u0027ve tried take the form of (test X thing while flying between A and B altitudes and between C and D speeds... where A and B are close together and relatively low, and C and D are somewhat close together and relatively fast.) Others include landing heavy payloads on heavy planets for test purposes... sometimes loads you\u0027d never land there by choice. Flying very fast at low altitudes with a large unwieldy test vehicle is difficult, dangerous, and potentially expensive lol."},{"CreatedByName":"Helmseye","CreatedById":140608,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T18:05:01Z","Content":"thank you thats very helpful advice"}]}
