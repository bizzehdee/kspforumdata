As a word of caution, pay careful attention to contracts requirements before accepting them. Some are absurdly difficult with compensation that may not even cover costs. Some of the more difficult ones I\u0027ve tried take the form of (test X thing while flying between A and B altitudes and between C and D speeds... where A and B are close together and relatively low, and C and D are somewhat close together and relatively fast.) Others include landing heavy payloads on heavy planets for test purposes... sometimes loads you\u0027d never land there by choice. Flying very fast at low altitudes with a large unwieldy test vehicle is difficult, dangerous, and potentially expensive lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helmseye","CreatedById":140608,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-08T18:05:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethank you thats very helpful advice\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
