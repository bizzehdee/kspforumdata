It works wonders and can tell you if you aren\u0027t lined up. The problem is likely weight \u002B gravity. If the rover is laden with kethane, the wheel suspension will make it dip and it will be a hair too low, or maybe your lander is light (\u002B less gravity) so it is sitting higher. The magnetic attraction is fairly weak. In space, it can do a lot because no air, no friction, no gravity. On the ground, it\u0027s about useless.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Glockshna","CreatedById":32859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T05:55:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I have the docking cam but I thought the magnetization of the ports would be enough.
