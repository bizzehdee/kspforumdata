Three movies in the \u0022not even a franchise yet\u0022 franchise?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to make it clear, pre-production means that the movie has received a go-ahead and is practically confirmed and the budget already is or is about to be allocated. It\u0027s not just some wishful thinking,\u00A0planning and hoping by the producers. Yeah, sure, the profits from the first movie can easily\u00A0finance these three, even with the production cost similar to the first one, but the business model of basically committing to this amount of work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThree??? Set to be released in ~one year intervals?

There was a movie that shown the possibilities of the technology. So everyone watched it, even people who have never been to cinema ever since.
