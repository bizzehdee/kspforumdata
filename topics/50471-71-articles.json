I didn\u0027t add moons\u0027 LANs etc because I couldn\u0027t find them on wikipedia; asmi suggested pulling them from Orbiter (which will have the J2000 values) but I forgot to do it until now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI left the stock values for those, so it is accurate I think. BTW, I had to take the mass of Kerbin and Mun from Wikipedia because those weren\u0027t in the cfg either, and couldn\u0027t find them on github (didn\u0027t search thoroughly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vericon1","CreatedById":103690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T05:28:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Ferram Has Gone Crazy Mk l.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-21T05:51:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbeS: yeah, you can either get acceleration-from-gravity-at-sea-level from mass, or get mass from g; the latter is what\u0027s done for Mun and Kerbin, since that number is more important (in gameplay terms) than mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eferram4: ....jaw....floor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you\u0027re well past ROMBUS-level huge and into \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/surfaceorbit.php#aldebaran\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EConvair Aldebaran-level\u003C/a\u003E size.
