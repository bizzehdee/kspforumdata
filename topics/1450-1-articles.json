Liquid tanks and engines, solids, decouplers... There are a lot of mods made by the community though and many screenshots feature some of those parts. The challenge in this game is to find out what works best for yourself, so I don\u0027t want to spoil too much. You can find a lot of videos on Youtube if you need inspirations.
