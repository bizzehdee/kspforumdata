I only know they\u0027ve been shopping around for international participation for a while now. NASA is sadly banned by US law from cooperating with the Chinese space agency (something NASA openly criticises), but ESA has informally signalled interest, Roscosmos has a long history of cooperation with China, ISRO has long had a tentative interest in human spaceflight but not really the budget to do it all by themselves... Some of these organizations don\u0027t have spacecraft of their own to run cargo or crewed missions with. Which means they\u0027ll be buying those services from someone else. Maybe they\u0027ll buy from China, but who knows, maybe some commercial company will make a cheaper offer? I\u0027m not discounting the possibility. It\u0027ll be more than half a decade before China\u0027s new station becomes an actual thing, and a lot can happen in that timespan. Especially given how blazingly fast things are moving in the space sector right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
