When that completes, I\u0027m immediately able to do it again for the same amount of science. If I go back to space center, and go into my science archives, it\u0027s listed there as an experiment I\u0027ve done - but it says 0 science data (and as far as I can tell, my science hasn\u0027t changed)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you NEED to do the recovery of a vessel before transmitted data is \u0027received\u0027 back at KSC?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: After testing things out a bit, I\u0027ve noticed that it is received back at KSC if I right click the antenna and press \u0022Transmit data\u0022 - but not if I do it straight from the popup where I can choose to send or keep. Is this intended behaviour?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: This was due to a bug in the Science Alert mod!
