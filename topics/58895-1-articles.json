I just got the game about a week ago and I love it! I got some stuff in orbit and on the moon, but I\u0027m still working on my docking skills. I thought that I would share my newbie\u0027s perspective in the hope that it may help the developers decide what may smoothe someone\u0027s introduction to the game: I know how after a while we all adjust to the existing problems and forget they even exist.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, some things that really got a \u0022wow\u0022 out of me:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe cool variety of pieces available to build stuff with.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe cockpit view, even with a window!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMy first exploding rocket - even failure is fun, with those big explosions and stuff flying everywhere!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScience! I haven\u0027t tried it yet, but it looks like a lot of fun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOrbital navigation is so easy and fun with those controls! This is amazingly well done.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStages! It\u0027s so fun to press stage and hear a big kaboom as stuff drops and engines ignite.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe training missions! I didn\u0027t expect them, and they\u0027re very useful.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAction groups! I love being able to assign custom actions to keys, even if I mostly only use it to toggle solar panels.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe way quick\u0026amp;autosave is designed to encourage us to plow forward even when something goes a little wrong. This is subtle but I think it realls adds to the game.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a lot of \u0022wow\u0022, I know! What can I say, it\u0027s a great game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know I bought an unfinished game, so it\u0027s expected there will be some rough spots. Here\u0027s the list of the ones that I would be happiest to see fixed first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn the hangar, it\u0027s nice to be able to click then drag the pieces, but I also expect to be able to drag them directly.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIn the hangar, when I click on a new piece I would expect that to replace the one I was holding, not just drop it. I change my mind about pieces more often than I want a \u0022clean\u0022 mouse cursor.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI could never find the keyboard shortcut to switch tabs (the tabs with the pieces on them), or move between pages inside the tabs. I do these operations a lot so I really expect a shortcut for them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe Kerbals are switched around when I touch the rocket; I wish they stayed in place. Ideally I\u0027d like to be able to use the tweak mechanism to specify the occupancy of each crewable part.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe stages are sometimes scrambled when I work on the rocket. I wish they didn\u0027t.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThere are some things I can\u0027t save as a subassembly. I wish I could.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI wish the hover text told me the keyboard shortcuts, so I had learned about \u0022X\u0022 earlier.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPgUp/PgDn move up and down the rocket; I wish they still did when it\u0027s on the launchpad.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI clicked on the \u0022RCS\u0022 indicator a bunch of times. It\u0027d be nice if that turned it on.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhen looking at the map, it seems to always rotate around the planet I\u0027m orbiting. Is there a way to change this to get a better view of where I want to go?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally there are a few things that would be super cool, but that I understand may be long shots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ETelescopes! So we can examine Kerbal from orbit, or the stars.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAsteroids to send probes to, or even capture and bring to the moon for examination.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPassenger capsules! I want to take tourists to space.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHabitation modules for space stations or bases on faraway places.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOculus Rift support would be super-awesome. I\u0027d love to make a base on Duna and then be able to walk inside and outside it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAlso, some sort of first-person view for when I\u0027m inside, complete with the ability to move from one room to another (if they\u0027re connected). \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for reading so far! Yes, I know, that\u0027s quite the wall of text. In summary, the game is awesome and I\u0027m having a lot of fun. Thank you so much to Squad for making it, and for the many people in the forums for documenting things to smoothe out my learning curve! I hope to see you all in the forums, and we can exchange crazy ideas about where KSP might go!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T01:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the community! It took me a while to figure out how you drag parts in the editors too.

It\u0027s pretty annoying, but as long as you launch from clicking the launchpad/runway or remember to use the crew tab just prior to launch it\u0027s not that bad. The reset button by the staging list can help with the jumbling up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe things you couldn\u0027t save as a subassembly probably couldn\u0027t be attached to anything even if they were saved, that\u0027s the most common reason it won\u0027t let you save a subassembly. If you\u0027re designing a subassembly, keep in mind that the first part you place, the root part, is the part that it attaches by.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can move the camera a little by dragging the middle mouse button, double click to reset. The map can be changed to different targets (your ship, planets, manoeuvre nodes) by using tab and shift-tab. Be sure to hide the navball before using shift-tab as that will also throttle you up. Backspace returns to focus on your craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are mods for telescopes and as far as I know, asteroids are planned for some later update.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, welcome to the community!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nohelmet","CreatedById":99742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-05T12:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you Supernovy!
