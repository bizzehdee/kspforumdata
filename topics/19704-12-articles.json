Yes, he said the SSTV signal is the only step at the moment, a step still leads somewhere. I also said that the SSTV was the only clue, and that a clue still leads \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Esomehwere\u003C/span\u003E but there are no more clues as of yet. My speculation was in no way a \u0022revolutionary new unheard of tin foil hat theory\u0022 it was a response to a question that was posted to me. IMHO it is a quite logical assumption that I have made. I did not say it was in the game yet, I was thinking about what it may be in the future. My reasoning behind this is simple, they are not going to make it easy to continue from this point. We have already had to decode a SSTV picture to know to go to the south pole, where there is a pyramid(which is depicted in the picture). People would naturally land at the south pole without this picture. By having the requirement of 4 kerbins there it would take 2 deliberate trips to that point to unlock the next link, so someone just landing there would not skip the first step. An entity detector is much simpler to implement the orbital mechanics(I don\u0027t know C\u002B\u002B but I do know java and I could have it done in less then 10 minutes, orbital mechanics would take me years), so it is by no means a far stretch of the mind to consider this being implemented in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread is about easter eggs, not just the one easter egg currently being discussed. Please be civil, if the SSTV easter egg picture and its possible future meaning interests people and that is what they wish to discuss, then that is what they are going to discuss.
