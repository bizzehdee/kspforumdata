Repeat strafing. The fleet could split up into multiple divisions or wings and laser anything in range at a light second out. This is an optimal strategy too since the defenders cannot really afford to chase down an enemy fleet with virtually unlimited fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. What this means is the enemy can do drive-by laser zapping all day long and at a range where the defenders are unlikely to hurt them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the scenario where both offender and attacker have both have virtually unlimited fuel then what that does to effect the battle depends on whether or not missiles also have unlimited fuel. If they do then space battleships become extinct like dinosaurs since missile swarms would outrun and overwhelm them as well as be cheaper. If only ships have unlimited fuel then what happens is fleets can chase each other indefinitely across the solar system, and spaceships also become massive RKVs that make moon bases nearly undefendable from attack as well as make leaving on a planet less safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-21T00:48:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suggest you take a look at the Honor Harrington

Original design had the missile launched out of torpedo tube style launchers along the side, torpedo as you would reload.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nLater ships went for an bomb bay setup there you filled the core of the ship with missiles you simply released at the rear, launch pods then rotated towards enemy and the missiles flew away letting you release thousands of missiles at once. I assume they still had the tubes as you only drop the load for an major battle or you was massively outnumbered, a bit like ripple fire all you anti ship missiles on an warship today.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe shields only partially protected the ships. limiting the angle of attack, think top an bottom, solution would be to rotate 90 degree before the missiles arrived\u00A0 so your front face was shielded.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nProblem was that most missiles payload was bomb pulsed x-ray lasers who fired then flying past you.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDefense was anti missile missiles and close in weapon systems probably lasers.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nit uses pure scifi drives capable of 100\u0027s of g both on ships and missiles. Another obvious issue is that at the start missiles burned until engine was out of fuel.
