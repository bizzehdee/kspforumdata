I didn\u0027t want to get all the way to Eve and discover I couldn\u0027t climb down the ladder, or worse, not clomb back up it. The next step, is to build the 7-Kerbal crewed reusable spaceship called the KSS Discovery. My plan is to launch the lander and the Discovery towards Eve seperately, aerobrake, dock in orbit (if necessary for the lander to refuel) and then have the Discovery go and explore Gilly. Later, the Discovery would pick up the return vehicle in LEO before returning home. I may very well launch an additional refueller to Eve as well just as a safety measure. I also plan to do a similar style mission (possibly with the Discovery itself or a sister ship) out to Jool and it\u0027s moons, including Tylo.

The engines are CLAYMOREs (a custom 2.5m version of the RAPIER, basically each equivalent to 4 rapiers), and it includes a lot of B9 parts, but amazingly enough it still flies and can get up to about 1500m/s at 30km before running out of intake air. It\u0027s designed to carry any 2.5m payload up to about 50 tons, although I\u0027m pretty sure it can handle 3.75m parts if need be. On this inaugural flight, it was delivering one of my \u003Cstrong\u003EIguana 1c\u003C/strong\u003E-class rovers into orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ijAOCf2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ijAOCf2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Iguana is a 30-ton mobile Kethane miner/refinery, intended to refuel vessels landed on moderate-gravity bodies (the first one\u0027s going to Mun). Since it\u0027s manned, it\u0027ll also let me do all those Plant Flag missions. It\u0027s got its own onboard engines (ions, and VTOL rockets), so getting it to orbit was more than enough, and once it\u0027s at Mun it\u0027ll refill its own tanks. I used to carry these to orbit on top of a fully recoverable SSTO rocket stack, but this way\u0027s even cheaper; it cost me just under 15k in fuel costs to lift a 30-ton rover valued at 151k.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best part is that as a fully functional plane, it\u0027s capable of precision landing back at KSC:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wSluQkl.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wSluQkl.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I actually landed it that close.

The crew of the newly expanded station got to work, pumping every ounce of monopropellant into it that they could find (enough to fill it thankfully), stripping the batteries and solar panels off the Albion crew shuttle and sticking them on inside the 6S compartment, and rooting around the KAS boxen for whatever else might be useful. I hadn\u0027t shipped up any RTGs, unfortunately, but I did have some cubic octagonals, which I stuck on the bottom as impromptu landing gear (just in case) and two pipe ends, which would be used to bridge the supply craft\u0027s inline batteries to the surviving lander can, (since by the time it landed, local sunset would have happened and the included solar panels were going to be initially useless). And a month\u0027s worth of snacks, just in case.

(there was a whole bunch of spare LFO on the station, but the Albion didn\u0027t have big enough tanks for a mun visit.) At periapsis, which was precisely timed, he then burned another 105dV worth of the injection burn on LFO also (timed to put himself on a high arc to rendezvous perfectly with the station again as soon as possible, since all the extra batteries and solar panels on his craft had been moved to the Care Package), and the supply craft finished the burn on its own, with 1800dV of monopropellant with which to attempt an emergency supply drop, by remote control.

I gave him a squirt of the throttle when the ship was pointed off-axis to deflect it a bit, then another when he was pointed roughly target-retrograde to at least stop him nearby, and sent Burlong on EVA with another monopropellant tank, bearing the last of the thruster fuel on the station, which he installed on the Albion to allow it to finally dock, despite the incessant spray of errors RemoteTech was giving me because of the dead battery:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XVdQgmH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022XVdQgmH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027ve got two Kerbals stranded on the Mun, six Kerbals on a station with one crew shuttle that doesn\u0027t have any power and another that doesn\u0027t even have a service module (I accidentally staged it off who-knows-when a while ago and it just floated away).

On the to-do-list is an SSTO space-plane, small enough to fit inside lander no. 3 and probably a jetboat to explore Laythes oceans.
