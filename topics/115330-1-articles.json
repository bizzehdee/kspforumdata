I\u0027m trying to stay as \u0022vanilla\u0022 as possible until I get more familiar with things, though I did d/l Asteroid Day, MechJeb, and ScanSat.

So far, I\u0027ve done a lot of exploring around KSC on foot and by rover, put Kerbals in orbit, and have put un-Kerballed probes into Mun and Minmus orbits, as well as experienced some really spectacular failures! It\u0027s all good. There\u0027s something whimsically goofy about the Kerbals which seems to lower the risk-anxiety bar...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Etched","CreatedById":147733,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T00:34:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed.
