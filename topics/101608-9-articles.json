Without it you can get 100 tons to LEO with the Ares boosters, 115 tons with the dark knights and 140 tons with the F9 quads.   \n\nThe F9 boosters have fairly similar performance to the F1B boosters, maybe a few tons less to LEO . The F1B boosters are bigger and have more thrust, but they have worse fuel fraction and lower ISP. From the testing I\u0027ve done the F1-Bs manage a couple more more tons to LEO.  \n\n\\* Masses and other performance characteristics will change as I come by new info/better sources.
