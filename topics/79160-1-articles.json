If one demands the simulation to be as realist as possibe *cough n-body physics cough* then I think that one should really avoid time acceleration. It really forces you to plan ahead, make sure you don\u0027t miss launch windows, etc. I\u0027m not one of those people by the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would be nice if Kerbal Alarm Clock had a feature that syncs the KSP clock with the real world clock and from then on never lets you advance past it. So you could come back from vacation and have KSP catch up with 1 week.
