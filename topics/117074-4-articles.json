I am failing to get some ports to dock in order to build the base. The large ports in particular aren\u0027t working. Any tips/tricks? I\u0027m trying to assemble on the mun.\n\u003E Edit: on the hab modules I can\u0027t get the rover to dock at all right now. It just wobbles around and doesn\u0027t attach.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit2: The rover issue was a bad state on it\u0027s docking port. Still can\u0027t get some sr ports to connect though. They don\u0027t even appear to have states in the file like normal ports do?\n\nHey there! Sorry I wasn\u0027t able to answer sooner. I recommend you read through this thread, CrashTestDanny just recently went through pretty much the same pains to put this together, and you might have run into similar problems. Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s not as hard as it looks!\n\nBut, some of those issues you report seems like docking bugs. I feel you there, mate, because those are a pain to deal with. I encourage you to go to [this thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78863-FIX-Dock-Undocking-Bug-in-0-23-5), where I learned how to handle them. It\u0027s tedious, but it teaches you a lot about fiddling with savefiles.\n\nHowever, I think at least the thing with the rover is because you haven\u0027t yet grasped it\u0027s full potential: there\u0027s no way I could have perfectly aligned all docks for all the surface gravities in the kerbol system, so I didn\u0027t: instead I just got close, and made an awesome rover that can *fly*. I have docked it *upside down* to upturned modules, even! If it is stuck wobbling under a port, just activate the RCS system and work it, and if that is not enough, well, hit the monoprop rockets: you should be able to lift a whole module that way in Mun! Also, briefly turning langin gear on/off can take care of some alignment issues when you dock modules together.\n\nOther than that, fiddle with it. It is very difficult to give you guys a full rundown of all the stuff you can do with this, but trust me: one you start coming into problems, a bit of head-scratching and experimenting (after appropriately F5-ing before!) will often get you out of the jam.\n\nRune. I hope you show us soon a successfully assembled base! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"CloudlessEchoes","CreatedById":142599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T22:55:58Z","Content":"I \u0022seem\u0022 to be getting perfect alignment many times, but it just doesn\u0027t connect!

Most likely, the rover\u0027s suspension is giving a bit too much and you are low. Double check that you are aligned with the camera facing straight down, and then let it rest aas close as possible, then drop the landing gear, that jould take carebofbthe vertical sag. You can also lock the suspensions and such...\n\nRune. Good luck!

I didnt see any sense in just sending fuel or changing anything. Just launch one more as is. Sadly, I havent done anything with that save since 1.05 came out. No doubt, either way, I will use this again. I hope this still flies when we get the 1.1 build. It lends itself very well to just changing the payload for other uses and expansion.

One of those fits snugly in the bay of a [Trident](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/119492-trident-ssto-vstol-dropship/) (some tricky docking is involved, but with skill and the alignment indicator I have become quite good at that), so I just use one of those as a tanker, dock it to the base with the Klaw they have on the back, and refill it prior to each takeoff loaded with ore. Turns out the Trident is almost ideally sized to take the full ~30mT of fuel to a 100km circular munar orbit, then come back down empty, with some margin. I do have to further refine it on orbit, but that allows me to think what kind of fuel mix I want on the spot, without having to waste a lot of oxidizer space. Plus, pretty much all my bases have a Trident already assigned to them, even if they were built with CRADLEs, to bring down any special modules I might need (I.E: KIS and Life Support are the usual ones).\n\n![867ODSM.png](http://i.imgur.com/867ODSM.png)\n\nIt also gives  you a ton of great opportunities to grab awesome screenies, BTW... Pay no mind that those are from an older model that doesn\u0027t actually have the Klaw on the tail, Arch Station is often saddled with prototypes that end up slightly different than the production models... you should have no trouble land-docking yours just driving them backwards with RCS.\n\n![jrGzP0l.png](http://i.imgur.com/jrGzP0l.png)\n\nAnd from the orbiting fuel depot the fuel would be further distributed if need be. But to actually refuel stuff in LKO, close to home, I usually just use a SSTO flight carrying ore, much more convenient and almost as cheap as mining it, since you recover the bird and the ore is so cheap. Still, I\u0027m moving a couple of humongous E-classes to build a KSO depot, so I can understand doing things just for the sake of doing them... ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nRune.
