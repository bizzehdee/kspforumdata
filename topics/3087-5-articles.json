Rumor has it that the Waste holds key information to stopping the zombies. The other thing you hear of is small, but still sounds important: Project Exodus. Those two words are all you hear from the two officials who talked about it.

A couple of officials walk past, and one mentions \u0027the plan\u0027, but the other immediately stops him from talking anymore. They then walk into a guarded door. One of the guards notice you and kick you out. You notice another official walking towards the mysterious tower, but he\\\u0027s got a squad of guards with him, so you can\\\u0027t tail him.

They talk about trivial matters: family, the quality of the drinks at the tavern, the odd reduction in the size of the hordes. Then one of them starts talking about the mission the the Waste. Apparently, the objective is two-fold: the public objective is to find out more about the zombie hierarchy, but the elite soldiers are in charge of collecting some materials in the Waste. Other than that, they know little more than where to sign up for the mission. Apparently anybody willing to fight zombies is welcome for the mission. With this information in mind, you go to the tavern to find some loose tongues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETavern:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou almost reach a door, when a hand grabs you and pulls you into an alley.

They-\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt that point, a dart hit his neck and he fell over, dead. You look up and see a shadow on the roofs. You duck behind a dumpster, and hope whoever killed him doesn\\\u0027t notice you. You wait for what seems like hours before you peek out and notice that there is no-one around. You head into the tavern to hide and rest.
