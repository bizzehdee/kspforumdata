If you want it to be simple, just load up enough Supplies containers for your mission and it\u0027s simple; there\u0027s a tool available in the VAB to tell you how long stuff will last. If you want it to be complex there are other parts there to do more complex things. Adding it to an existing career probably will kill your Kerbals though.
