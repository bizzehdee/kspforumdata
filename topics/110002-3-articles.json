You can see how 2000^3 is a whole lot less than 7400^3 (reentry from low orbit for Kerbin and Earth, respectively). That\u0027s a factor of about 50.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is, if you just change things so that Kerbin reentry == Earth reentry in terms of heat, well, what happens to an interplanetary aerocapture? That\u0027s already 5\u002B km/sec entry velocity, maybe even 7 or more. Now suddenly interplanetary capture is really, really deadly if it started out at Earth-reentry-level deadly and has been increased fifty times! Plus you just made flying a spaceplane at Mach 5 (1500m/s, 42% of reentry flux) 50 times hotter. Let alone spaceplane reentry, which everyone\u0027s been complaining about at the same time as saying heat in general is too low. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn alternate approach is to play with the exponent. But that actually makes that problem worse in some ways--spaceplanes won\u0027t be affected as much (say, increase the exponent such that 1500m/s has double the heat it did, 2000 has triple, 3000 has even more...), but interplanetary aerocaptures might become many, many times what they used to be, requiring utterly magic heat shielding that make regular reentries trivial.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T01:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022regex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022regex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...a heating multiplier per planet, which is kind of inconsistent.
