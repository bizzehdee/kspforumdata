Jool is entirely different because you\u0027re entering at high speeds (usually much greater that 3km/s) from interplanetary transfer and have to scrub a lot of delta-V to aerocapture, which means your parts are subject to a lot more heating most especially because you\u0027re in a thinner atmosphere for much, much longer than reentry on Kerbin.

Because Kerbin is so stupid tiny your orbital velocity is so low, even with its artificially increased gravity.

The UI updates are primarily from Unity 4.6, not Unity 5, and KSP is already using Unity 4.6. I would love to know more about the 4.6 UI, but most of the info I\u0027ve been able to find relates to the Unity editor, not creating a UI entirely through code, which is what we have to do.\n\nThe problem is that the pre-4.6 UI is total garbage and is horribly inefficient. It really isn\u0027t meant for anything more than settings menus or things like that which aren\u0027t actually displayed all of the time. There are/were a bunch of workarounds, like EZGUI that KSP uses, but the change to Unity 4.6 means that those aren\u0027t really necessary.\n\nA lot of the more complex UI addons would probably benefit from moving to the 4.6 system, but the legacy UI still works fine.\n\nEdit: Also.....

You can see how 2000^3 is a whole lot less than 7400^3 (reentry from low orbit for Kerbin and Earth, respectively). That\u0027s a factor of about 50.\n\nThing is, if you just change things so that Kerbin reentry == Earth reentry in terms of heat, well, what happens to an interplanetary aerocapture? That\u0027s already 5\u002B km/sec entry velocity, maybe even 7 or more. Now suddenly interplanetary capture is really, really deadly if it started out at Earth-reentry-level deadly and has been increased fifty times! Plus you just made flying a spaceplane at Mach 5 (1500m/s, 42% of reentry flux) 50 times hotter. Let alone spaceplane reentry, which everyone\u0027s been complaining about at the same time as saying heat in general is too low. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nAn alternate approach is to play with the exponent. But that actually makes that problem worse in some ways--spaceplanes won\u0027t be affected as much (say, increase the exponent such that 1500m/s has double the heat it did, 2000 has triple, 3000 has even more...), but interplanetary aerocaptures might become many, many times what they used to be, requiring utterly magic heat shielding that make regular reentries trivial."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T01:59:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ...a heating multiplier per planet, which is kind of inconsistent.
