This is pretty unsafe out of Europe (massive generalisation but on this scale is OK). Also there are incredibly strict laws about what temperature\u002Bvolume the water coming from nuclear power plants must be. This came up at a meeting a few weeks ago when discussing the local impact of a nuclear power station being built a few miles away from me."}]}
