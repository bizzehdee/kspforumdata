Copy those and paste them in a txt file or keep them somewhere. You can completely delete that craft now. Then just go in your game, put your new craft (without launcher, just what you want in space) on the launchpad, quicksave, then go back in the quicksave file. From there, change the flight status from \u0022LANDED\u0022 to \u0022ORBITING\u0022, change the landed line to False, empty the landedAt line and replace all the orbital parameters with those of the old craft that you saved somewhere.

And using the quicksave is just a safemode: If you screw something up, your persistance isn\u0027t done for. It also allows for quicker fixing, if you forgot a parameter or pasted one wrong, you can just open the quicksave again, edit the file and then quickload again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T02:24:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFollowed the advice, though I ended up going at part of it almost backwards - copying the parts block from the probe sitting on the pad over the existing probe, then deleting the scrap from the end of the quicksave - and it seems to have worked.
