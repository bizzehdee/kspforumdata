After having accomplished a few, I came to realise something rather counter-intuitive concerning aerodynamics and reentry:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the same reentering capsule, an reentry from LKO will be slowed down enough to deploy chutes and land safely; while for some obscure reason, reentry from a suborbital flight (~75km apoapsis), even though going slower initially, will lose less speed and end up too fast too low, leading to unavoidable crash, even when using chutes as soon as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t conducted methodical tests with different flight profiles to determine the exact circumstances of this event, but I have had a few suborbital flights that ended up crashing, even in the sea, at alt 0, due to being too fast too low.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought a some time about it, and have come up with two possibilities explaining this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- (the most plausible to me) Vertical velocity issues:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft does not slow down much as it is slower when coming back from suborbital flight, but the reentry being steeper, the vertical velocity ends up being higher than for an orbital reentry. This would explain this issue, and the fact that going \u0022faster\u0022 (with higher horizontal velocity) in a suborbital flight prevents it. The thing is, when getting down to under 10km after reentry, whether you come back from LKO or suborbital flight, your ship has basically the same trajectory, almost vertical, so there would be no reason why speeds are different between the two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- KSP aerodynamics being inaccurate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe title speaks for itself: for some reason, aerodynamics is inaccurate and creates this issue inevitably. I know that KSP stock aerodynamics is not an exact model of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, but even when considering approximations, the drag induced by the reentry should make the two profiles end up the same way. What could also cause this, is the fact that drag in 1.0.4 was reduced, and for some aerodynamic reason, this creates the issue discussed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made this thread to see if anyone else has encountered this, or would like to discuss it, or even come up with a solution to it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I may add screenshots if anyone asks for some.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T17:29:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably because the descent profile is too steep for the mass/cross-section.

Sure, going into orbit around Earth takes massive amounts of speed more than it does on Kerbin, but a suborbital launch goes to roughly the same heights and has roughly the same speed coming back down. But Earth\u0027s atmosphere extends much higher, so the craft falling back down is slowed down sooner, especially if you give it a little bit of horizontal velocity as well (like Mercury-Redstone did). But, while that helps, the main reason is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) moar chutes! Capsules returning to Earth have the option of using drogue chutes, which can be opened higher up and at higher speeds than regular parachutes. Even though they don\u0027t offer enough drag to allow a safe landing, they still offer more than enough drag to lower the terminal velocity by a huge amount and slow the craft down to safe main chute levels long before approaching the surface. In KSP, we have drogue chutes too... late in the tech tree, for 2.5m craft sizes. Except, nobody does suborbital flights with 2.5m craft during late career mode. We do them with 1.25m craft during the very first flights! And there are no drogue chutes available to fill that niche.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth issues can be addressed by installing mods, but for the stock game, the situation is indeed less than ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou have to travel in a parabolic arc, you can\u0027t just go straight up and down.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course you can.
