However, I only recently bought KSP after it got its Career Mode (and I was able to squeeze another non-sale game into my budget... I digress... - Its a great price! I\u0027m just poor. Anyway,) because I like the objective based gameplay. Sandbox with all the parts is just too overwhelming and directionless for me. (I mean, I like Sandbox mode occasionally, its handy and should be kept in the game.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I found while I LOVE the idea of balancing science and money, what I was really hoping to get out of the Career Mode was ruined by the money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could do science mode, get science and unlock the tech tree slowly, but once again I\u0027d be without a rudder. I like having the game choose mission objectives for me, otherwise I\u0027m trying to land on Duna on day one. It\u0027s just how I am. (And sure, I\u0027m betting you can land on Duna on day one but as a new players I spend a lot of time just crashing on the launch pad and not doing stuff that helps me get the better equipment to et to Duna... and Sure, I know better equipment and all.. I need a rudder! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027d like a mode that\u0027s between Career and Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003ESUGGESTION STARTS HERE:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause I couldn\u0027t think of a better name for it, I\u0027m calling it Experiment Mode.

It\u0027d be neat if it also came with an extended tech tree that allows you to get some less valuable things further up after you\u0027ve unlocked all the important parts. They could be variants of things you have, slight improvements, passive upgrades, more structural components, or even just trophy tech that you can have for decorating craft but which has no real benefit beyond that. That way I can zip far enough into the tech tree to have building options and still have a significant amount of game left ahead of me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat bugs me most about KSP is by the time it becomes fun, it\u0027s almost finished.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
