So the game loads most of the way, but crashes before reaching the main menu?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook inside the KSP folder for the file called KSP.txt, that\u2019s a fairly basic log file that might say what caused the crash- it would probably be near the end of the file, you\u2019re looking for errors or exceptions. If you find something, or the sight of the log file makes you want to scream, upload it to a file sharing website and post a link to it here so someone can take a look at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are more detailed log files for the game, but without knowing your game version I can\u2019t say for sure where they\u2019d be.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that your PC is running out of memory; try loading the game with task manager open and see how much RAM it\u2019s using when it loads.
