The second I remove the save KSP returns to normal... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was hoping if someone out there knew a solution to my problem and would help me re-add this to my game (I am using .90 KSP- Windows x32, the save is quite old and people have tried to upgrade it slowly for me but it didn\u0027t work... however if someone else would try it again now with .90 that would be nice). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx7MSvRH-8qdcVdnTjBQZmFZN0U/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx7MSvRH-8qdcVdnTjBQZmFZN0U/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso- my second question is-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI note that the Whack-A-Kerbal objects have physics, however they do not stay in game. Switch scenes or switch crafts and they will vanish. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if I were to grab one with a claw and use it as a base of some sort- what would happen if I were to leave it and return? Would the structure of the base be compromised? Or would it remain since it is part of a craft?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMoonRover","CreatedById":136199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T22:50:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf there is no compatible \u0022persistence.sfs\u0022 file in any one (or more) save(s), you cannot load any saves. When you put the file in to the game, was it called \u0022persistence.sfs\u0022? Because the linked file is called \u0022Keypersistence.sfs\u0022 and would cause this error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVersion 0.24 should be compatible. There\u0027s nothing obviously wrong at the start and end of the file, but I haven\u0027t looked that closely. I don\u0027t have time to try loading it in-game though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting question about Whack-A-Kerbal. I\u0027ve never actually tried that, but I suspect the claw would not attach to one of those objects. If not, I would imagine it will be saved as a part of the ship. I think any other occurrence would be extremely unlikely, unless it is one crashes the game and/or corrupts the save, but I\u0027m just taking educated guesses here. EDIT: It\u0027s worth a try though. I suggest using a sandbox save you don\u0027t care about, just to be on the safe side.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T01:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was called persistence file originally- I renamed it so I could distinguish it from other persistances in my Gdrive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible that someone could try this for me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
