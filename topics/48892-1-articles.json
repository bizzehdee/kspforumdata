Then they are a viable boost for those who wish to use them (as the current %40 transmission boost to double that would be worth the extra launch). It would also mean you get to balance science launches, and funding (1 launch at 40% science, or two at 90% or one massive return craft at %100).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sean Mirrsen","CreatedById":3873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T12:42:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbes really need instruments to gather data, and power to work. Without so much as using its reaction wheels, a typical probe will not last long enough on internal batteries to make it anywhere, plus the reaction wheels it does have are pitiful. Probes are thus nearly useless without RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to recap, in order to do science - i.e. start the game - with probes, you need a probe core, some kind of instrument, either RCS or separate reaction wheels, and ideally some extra power because probe cores have pitiful reserves and actually need them to stay active. The power draw of the simplest transmission antenna, for the simplest report, is greater than what the probe can store, so you would be even more limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting the game with manned capsules makes more sense both from the game progression standpoint, and from the in-universe standpoint, that being the Kerbals\u0027 amazing incompetence in the face of their sheer engineering prowess. They have rocket engines and spacesuits, but need effort to put together space-worthy thermometers and battery packs or realize that landing legs are a thing that spaceships intending to \u003Cem\u003Eland\u003C/em\u003E should probably actually have.
