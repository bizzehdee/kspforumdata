The problem is that it seems like they can only be loaded using the UnityEngine.Resources class, and our plugin directories don\u0027t seem to be traversed by that loader. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could read the files in as a byte stream using KSP.IO, but unity\u0027s font class doesn\u0027t have a constructor that will read those bytes. I could look into subclassing their font class and building a custom ttf loader, but needless to say that could be quite intensive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can somehow get the unity Resources class to look inside the gamedata directory, it would be problem solved.
