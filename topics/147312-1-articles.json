Mods like\u00A0Outer Planets Mod, Xen\u0027s Planet Collection, Kerbol Origins, and New Horizons, to name just a few of my personal favourites. Even just the few that I\u0027ve specified contain so many new places to explore. Once you\u0027ve gone everywhere in the stock system, or even just gotten used to going interplanetary, planet packs provide so many new and exciting destinations.\u00A0Outer Planets adds wonderfully-designed\u00A0analogues to Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto-Charon. Xen\u0027s Planet Collection adds interesting new features to Duna, Eve and Eeloo as well as two unique new planets which pose their own challenges (Mios has an equatorial ocean and Richell rotates backwards). Kerbol Origins adds several planets that are based on unimplemented ideas for the stock system, all of which are well-designed and great destinations to explore. New Horizons rearranges the Kerbol system entirely, changing locations of all the stock worlds and adding numerous new ones; with Kerbin in orbit around the gas giant Sonnah you have to figure out entirely new vehicle designs to traverse the system. And this certainly isn\u0027t all of the planet mods out there, there\u0027s a lot more including several which add entirely new star systems (one of which that I know of\u00A0has a couple of tidally locked planets which definitely look intriguing).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-09-08T23:55:45Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2016 11:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by eloquentJane\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegolius13","CreatedById":165625,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-09T00:23:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t finished exploring yet.

I decided, after I\u0027d visited every world in a hodgepodge way over a long career, to systematically hit every single world with a dedicated \u0022Apollo-style\u0022 mission. It was great fun, and I designed every mission from scratch to account for (or take advantage of) each world\u0027s unique quirks. This kept me busy for months. Another time (Just recently in fact) I started a new career with the Anomaly Surveyor contract pack and visited every Easter Egg in the game - several of which I\u0027d never seen before. That was another great experience.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMod Cocktails. Think up something you\u0027d like to try, and find the mods to try it. Be it planet packs, life support, programming probes with kOS, or whatever you can dream of. Maybe try Kerbal Construction Time paired with Extraplanetary Launchpads, so it\u0027s actually quicker to build off-world than at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.

Every few months (though these days it seems a bit longer) a new version comes out, and that new version usually has SOMETHING new to learn.

Next update, we\u0027ll be getting restrictions on probes that should prove interesting.
