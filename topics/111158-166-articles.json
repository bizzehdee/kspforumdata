There are only a few of us, and we\u0027re part-time unpaid volunteers, and we can\u0027t even vaguely read everything that ever gets posted to the forums-- there are \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethousands\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E of you guys, and there\u0027s simply no way we could keep up.\n\nSo as a general rule,  we\u0027re reactive rather than proactive.  We read and use the forums just as any normal forum user would (because we\u0027re KSP players too, after all), and if we just \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ehappen\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E to notice something off-kilter-- just in passing, as it were-- then sure,  we\u0027ll step in to tidy up. But that wouldn\u0027t address the 90%\u002B of the forum content that we never see because we never happen to read it. I mean, \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E don\u0027t read every single word that gets written in the forums,  do you? ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nBeyond that,  then, we\u0027re dependent on you guys to be our eyes and ears, i.e. when folks file reports. When something gets reported,  \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E we take a good close look at it.\n\nAnd that brings me to the \u0022yes\u0022 part of your answer:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 8 hours ago, Kerbalstar said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Whenever a mod post doesn\u0027t contain the license \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eand someone reports it\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, do you download it to check if the .zip has the licence? And than again after they say they\u0027ve updated it?\n\u003E \n\n^ There, I\u0027ve taken the liberty of tweaking your quote. If someone \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ereports\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E a problem,  then yeah, we take a look. We need the report because it\u0027s the only way we find out about a potential issue in the first place.\n\nBut once that happens, then yes, we look at it, and we generally take a look inside the .zip, too, and when the person claims to have fixed it, we look again to make sure that they really fixed it. We need to do that for the simple reason that experience has shown that most folks don\u0027t get it right on the first try-- at least, most folks who have already gotten reported for missing licenses.\n\nIt\u0027s understandable.  Licensing is possibly the least fun aspect of modding.  It\u0027s tedious, arcane, nitpicky, and not something that most folks want to think about. And it\u0027s not something where you can just \u0022wing it\u0022. You have to actually learn it and understand it and jump through all the appropriate hoops.\n\nMost modders successfully do the right thing most of the time. (Thank goodness!
