The Vistas and other odds and ends don\u0027t really draw that much power comparatively, so not that much waste heat is generated under those conditions. I don\u0027t use deadly reentry, but you could do a powered descent with all the dv available. The nozzles are for lifting off in heavy gravity and atmosphere. The vistas are the primary engines when in space due to their due to their insane isp and decent thrust. I was using KW rocketry at the time, it has some radial reaction wheels, though one could make due with the stock ones.
