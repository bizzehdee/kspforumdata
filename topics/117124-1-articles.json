Whenever I send a plane, or a rover, or anything with wheels/landing gear on it, the wheels seem to sink into the runway. It doesn\u0027t do this with the regular ground, or any other part of KSC. Heck, it doesn\u0027t even do it with the slanted sides of the runway, just the tarmac part. It does this regardless of any mods installed, I just have it on the modded support forum, since I currently have them installed. So, if anyone has this issue, or can solve it, please reply as soon as you can. Thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceCannon46","CreatedById":116170,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T13:29:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, I\u0027ve figured out that it only does this with the cars/trucks/rover from KSOS mod.

With the reworked attachement nodes of 1.0 I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s still a correct direction to attach them. You should probably ask in the KSOS thread.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
