It\u0027s buggy enough when it\u0027s stock and adding even just parts seems to make it more unstable. Despite it being ostensibly unlimited in terms of memory usage, it still seems to be restricted. It might work for you, it might not - the point is that Win x64 is unpredictable so trying to pinpoint bugs is too difficult due to it CTDing with some people and working fine with others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing\u0027s stopping you from using this in 64bit - they\u0027re just parts, they\u0027ll always work. What makes them not work is the inherent instability with the x64 build, which is why the devs recommend 32bit - so they can narrow down and pinpoint bugs/fixes. If a bug is present on x86, it\u0027ll be present on x64 and can be fixed, but if a bug is present on x64, it may not be reproducible in x86 which makes pinpointing it difficult (see above for reasons why).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-10T22:44:13Z\u0022 title=\u002209/10/2014 10:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 10, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ObsessedWithKSP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sesni","CreatedById":50625,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T23:18:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on 64 bit and running a heck of a lot of mods, i.e kw rocketry sp\u002B bda texture reducer, near future (which only electrical will work for some reason) and a few others.
