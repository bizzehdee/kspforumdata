I need to know what the difference in sizes are between say, the three docking clamp diameters. You might suggest that I can just scale to fit after making my part, but in this case I am looking to model a part that goes from one size at one end to another at the other end, like the MK1-2 command pod, so the relative sizes have to be correct before I can do the final scale to fit the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried searching on the forum, but my search-fu is weak.
