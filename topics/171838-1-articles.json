However this was tinged with guilt over sneaking them out of Voyler\u2019s quarters, but his need for socks was greater; he had a ship to fly after all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat Gatler Kerman had seen was that the mining ship Jeb commanded had just passed through its closest point to Tylo, precisely on schedule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003EAnother box that Jeb could mentally place a tick in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe F12 engines that all the LOST ships were equipped with had done a fine job in whisking Jeb and Voyler to the Jool system in a fraction of the time with normal ones.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt wasn\u2019t known exactly how these new engines provided the thrust that they did.

To them science wasn\u2019t about following rules, it was about breaking rules and hell raising. In particular breaking speed limits near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E in the sports cars that the huge bonuses the F-12\u2019s \u201Cdevelopment\u201D had brought them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end the official explanation was that the Kraken must have \u201Cfiddled with the stats\u201D, but whatever the reason, they were taking the LOST team to Laythe in weeks rather than years.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter swinging by Tylo, the turquoise orb that was Laythe steadily grew in the view from mining ship\u2019s command pod.

Although it was a highly formulaic detective procedural, the series of strange accidents that befell its leading actor, as well as the sets being burnt down 3 times, and a string of truly appalling scripts, led some to believe that the show was cursed by the Kraken.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOthers theorised that the show was being conspired against by \u201Cthose in the know\u201D who they believed were trying to kill it off before it revealed a dark secret about the history of kerbalkind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill others, identifying as the Brotherhood of Kalkan, held that the pattern of incidents that befell the show, when appropriately transformed using a form of mathematics no-one understood (or they possibly made up) predicted the date of the apocalypse.

Sindley glanced at her nervously, having noticed that they were already down to 300m, although thankfully that big shield was slowing their descent considerably, so buying them some time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYou need to be real careful with those switches\u201D Jeb warned \u201Cthe 2\u003Csup\u003End\u003C/sup\u003E switch cuts the chutes and the 4\u003Csup\u003Eth\u003C/sup\u003E is snack storage detachment\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGelsey instantly understood the gravity of the situation, button 2 was a deadly impact with the surface, button 4 would be days without snacks until a later ship from Kerbin arrived.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBoth were fates not worth contemplating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scientist thought for a moment and asked what she thought might be a pertinent question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CHow many switches am I looking at on that row here?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJeb thought for a moment, trying to remember more clearly the layout of the cupola console.

The vessel was swinging and rolling wildly as it now rested loosely at one end on the detached heat shield. They were now pointing roughly in the right direction; they could see the ground now at least, if a bit too much of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CJeb... urghhh... we\u2019re looking at a lot of ground here... eroooh...

Go science!.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe took hold of the sticks on the remote control unit and started to roll the vehicle side to side in an effort to dislodge the shield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside it, the two scientists could contain their stomachs no longer and hurled. Fortunately the console was mostly covered in plastic and largely below them at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter several of these rolling motions, far too many for its unfortunate occupants, the heat shield broke free, causing the rear end of the vehicle to fall suddenly, coming level with the front. The jolt brought forth another fountain of partly digested snacks from the poor scientists, but at least they finally were looking at the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFree of the heat shield, the troubles of their landing were surely over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EEmpty\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227BoRZTZ.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7BoRZTZ.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a partiality to Kerby Krisps, the delicious snack of choice for many kerbals, Gelsey had been steadily eating her way through the stock of them on the science vessel since departure from Kerbin, in fact a couple of them were now sprayed across the plastic covered console.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese snacks were all stowed in the rear end of the science vehicle that hung below the (theoretically at least) well balanced array of parachutes. Unfortunately for the two scientists, Gelsey\u2019s taste in chocolate treats meant that the front and slightly heavier end of the vehicle was slowly drifting to point towards the surface once more. Not so great an angle to jeopardise the vehicle and its crew, but enough to give them a less than perfect landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe front wheels hit Laythian dirt for the first time, scraping along for a moment before lurching back up, followed by the rear\u0027s hitting the ground, their suspension groaning under the sudden shift of weight. A pattern of lurching between front and rear wheels contact followed, lasting about 10 seconds, emptying what little was left in Gelsey and Sindley\u2019s stomachs, before finally coming to rest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately the brakes were on, stopping them from rolling down the slight incline that they had landed on. They had that at least.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a moment to catch their breaths and compose their stomachs, the two shook hands weakly.

Replacing the physical discomfort he had been enduring, with the emotional discomfort of being around Bill and Coslin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor a moment his sombre mood was replaced by something approaching happiness, as he looked out of a window, to the horizon of the planet below.

On her console a reading of the direction and estimated range of the colony was displayed which at first seemed fine, but as the vehicle descended, it was clear that her hopes of a pinpoint landing were going to be dashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain it was the issue of the missing mass (that mass having been left behind in Kerbin orbit) that was causing the Lifter to decelerate more rapidly than planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer only chance to correct for this was to deploy the parachutes late... very late, something that Val was prepared to take the risk of to pull of a touchdown bang on target. However this would significantly increased the chances of the vehicle (and its pilot) being smeared across the surface of the planet. But no risk no gain, right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first the late deployment seemed a viable plan, with the projected descent trajectory settling within a few hundred metres of the colony. However touching down there would be a short lived victory, as it would require a landing without the use of parachutes or the engine. So this \u201Clanding\u201D would be more of a terminal, high velocity impact with the surface, killing all onboard and anyone close by.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRealising that she\u2019d run out of alternative options except \u201Cdie in the attempt and wipe out the colony\u201D, Val let out a sigh and lazily plonked a finger on the Deploy Parachutes button.

But as the Lifter descended, the colony disappeared from view, beyond the horizon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally the parachutes opened and her vehicle gently drifted towards the surface before making a perfect landing, something the other pilots had all had major problems with.

It wasn\u2019t that she was nervous of the descent, but she really didn\u2019t want to take a tumble and have that 17.6km trip with a sore head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHer boot hit the reassuring solidity of a ladder rung, then she grabbed the base of the hatch frame with her free hand and leaned back, before taking a step down the ladder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHalfway down the side of the vehicle Val paused in her descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, I\u2019m at the panel and ready for release procedure\u201D Val informed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe reached for a small panel cut into the side of the hull, before using the small \u201Cpress\u2019n\u2019turn\u201D release catch that was so common on Kerbal craft.

She then pressed a pair of buttons simultaneously, triggering a small green light to illuminate, then a third button marked \u201CRover Release\u201D.

These were now combusting at a more leisurely rate than planned. It was less like an explosion and more like a small rocket motor, one which was attempting to push the rover away from the Lifter That rover being held in place by its brakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe plume of gas and sparks from that small rocket was dangerously close to the landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVal\u2019s impulsiveness in her release of the rovers had got her into a bit of a pickle, but her quick thinking was going to get her out of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe remembered that there was a brake release lever on each of the rover\u2019s four wheels, to allow moving it without having to enter the vehicle. She raced around the rover, disabling the brakes on three of the wheels, and then ducked underneath it to get at the fourth on the far side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe reached up to give the release lever a yank, then dropped to the ground as flat as she could in her bulky suit. The rover moved away from the landing leg pushed by the motor that threatened to melt it. Val stared up at the underside of the rover, as it slid past overhead. Her eye\u2019s caught sight of a marking on one of the various panels on it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were a few words, but the word \u201CSafety\u201D caught her eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep she though... next time think \u201Csafety\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a few seconds the rear end of the rover passed over the top of Val, leaving her a clear view of the sky.

It was the vast bulk of Jool hanging in the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWell hello there Jool\u201D she said to herself and gave a wink... \u201COh krak!\u201D she exclaimed, suddenly remembering that there was still another rover to deal with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022UCJvWHa.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/UCJvWHa.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina took off as fast as here boots would carry her to the other side of the Lifter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn arriving there she found that the explosive bolts on the other rover were doing the same fiery display that threatened to damage one of the landing legs. Again she raced around, disabling rover brakes, but for the last one, rather than disable it from underneath; she pulled herself to her feet, pulled the lever and grabbed hold of the suspension mounting in front of her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rover headed away under the power of the slowly exploding bolt and Val went with it, hanging on to the back of it, as she had the overcrowded buses, where she grew up. There weren\u2019t many people were she was from, but when there\u2019s only one bus a day, it gets pretty busy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a few seconds the bolt burnt out and the rover started to slow. Val reached down and yanked on the lever to re-enable the brake, and the vehicle lurched violently round to the side, throwing Val off in the process, before coming to a halt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust like that old bus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227SS9M31.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022575\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/7SS9M31.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSometime later Valentina stood near the Lifter, admiring the pair of rovers that she\u2019d corralled after their unplanned excursion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut there was work left to do before she could head off for the Colony site. First, Gatler had informed her that the science team wanted her to take a surface sample. She reached for the small touchscreen on her right arm with her left glove and tapped the text on it \u201CTake Surface Sample\u201D. This opened a small hole in the bottom of her boot into which the suit drew a small amount of the soil beneath it. That little sampler was a fantastic invention and avoided a lot of unnecessary bending.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter that she had to return to the Lifter to remove the final part of the equipment that had been attached to its exterior for the journey to laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis equipment was the aero mast that was attached to the nosecone of the Lifter. This had allowed the vehicle to be controlled while sheltering behind its heat shield during the descent to the surface. Val was now sat at the controls in the cockpit, with her hand hovering over the Release Aero Package button, but before pressing it, wanted a little chat with the Gatler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201C\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E can you confirm that aero package release procedure\u201D she requested.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter a shot pause Gatler\u2019s voice came over the speakers \u201Cerrr... press button marked Release Aero Package\u201D before continuing \u201Ceverything alright up there Val\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nValentina stabbed at the button and a satisfying jolt, followed by a bright glare emitted from above her.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CEverything\u2019s fine here \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022wFnGoNg.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022640\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/wFnGoNg.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe aero package flew up and over to the side of the lifter, carried safely away from it by a small solid rocket motor.

She had briefly tested one of the rovers on Kerbin and it seemed like a decent, if slow to accelerate ride. But now, zipping across the dunes of Laythe, with Jool visible out of the left side of the cockpit, it felt like it was where it truly belonged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was engineered to be capable of 35m/s, but had an advised max driving speed of 25.

On the one hand this meant that she hadn\u2019t had to go through some annoying \u201Cwelcome to Laythe\u201D speech from Jeb, but on the other she was really looking forward to speaking to someone other than Gatler.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E a young software engineer, barely old enough to remember the first landing on Duna, worked through the night on a fix to the comms problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engineer coded, drank coffee, tested, drank coffee, tested some more... and drank more coffee.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real stuff of course, this was not a decaf situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy 8:00am the lone engineer, drenched in sweat, partly from the pressure he was under to make the fix, but also the copious amounts of caffeine in his system, shakily hit the \u201Csubmit\u201D button, followed by \u201Cdeploy\u201D.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoments later Gatler grabbed his microphone with a flourish that came from a kerbal who for the first time in weeks did not have a hangover; the pad crew\u2019s special brew having run dry 20 hours ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201COk there Val, we\u2019ve got that update we\u2019ve be promising ya.
