I made a lander using a 2-kerbal lander can, with a fuel tank under it, on top center I put a docking port and around that 8 small trusses and 8 of those small grey cylindrical fuel tanks on those, and then radial engines on the sides of the lander can - and the engines aren\u0027t getting any fuel. I was able to get fuel from top tanks by running a fuel line from each to the lander can, but for some reason I couldn\u0027t put a fuel line from bottom tank to lander can so I tried placing a truss on each and then a fuel line to those but that doesn\u0027t work...
