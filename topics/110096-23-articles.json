Then I took the four poses I liked best, cropped and removed backgrounds from three of them, pasted those three in position next to the fourth, and that was that. Also note the Kerbfleet stuff on the Recovery screen are NOT a mod (thought maybe somebody will make it someday!), the ranks and promotion messages are all done by hand in Ppt.\n\nIf that sounds tough, you should hear what I was GOING to do for that last scene. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E The End.

Hope you like it.\n\nThe Flight of the Hummlebee (to the tune of \u0027A Modern Major General\u0027).\n\nWell, Wernher Kerman said to Kerbfleet \u0022Gentlekerbs, we have a ship,\u0022\n\n\u0022A destination (Duna), and a crew so we should take a trip.\u0022\n\n\u0022Since mining and refining is designed into the Hummlebee,\u0022\n\n\u0022They\u0027ll bring back all of Duna\u0027s science and unlock the whole tech tree.\u0022\n\nSaid Gene \u0022We\u0027ll need this scanner, for the mission codenamed \u0022Red Rock One,\u0022\n\n\u0022So Jeb and Lisa bring back science from the surface of the ... Mun.\u0022\n\nJeb jumped Gene\u0027s countdown. Gene was mad, but Munhopper was now in flight.\n\nSighed Gene \u0022Well, just bring back the science. Better hurry, window\u0027s tight.\u0022\n\nNow, Jeb was calm and cocky, Lisa awed and also terrified,\n\nWhile venting snacks inside her helmet she did not enjoy the ride.\n\nWith bingo fuel Munhopper landed, then rolled down a crater slope.\n\nSo Jeb used RCS to brake or his good ship would have no hope.\n\nThe Flight Director calmly laid out all the steps that they had planned.\n\nHow Jeb was shocked when first he heard that Val was told to take command.\n\n\u0022Jeb is the very model of a modern Majer in the air,\u0022\n\n\u0022But deep in space we need precision, Val will take the Kaptin\u0027s Chair.\u0022\n\nMunhopper lifted off and flew, reentered, splashed down safe and sound.\n\nWith crew and science, all recovered. Back at KSC they found...\n\nA brand new Mk2 Hummlebee was in the hangar waiting there,\n\nAtop the orange Knight. Moments later ship and crew were in the air.\n\nThe Orange Knight carried Hummlebee to 40 k, detached, was lost,\n\nWhile Mort was back at KSC lamenting all the funds it cost.\n\nNow, Val and Bill on Minmus surface, were stuck in old debris they found.\n\nTheir plan was stymied, Bill was clever, they flew to Minmus Outbound.\n\nVal plotted transfers while Bill sang, Jeb burned to make the rendezvous.\n\nWith crew united, hit the window, burned for Duna right on cue.\n\nWhile in deep space they hibed and all the work and talk and song did cease.\n\nThe interlude was introduced and Kuzzter wrote more masterpiece.\n\nThey woke to plan the capture burn, Bill showed he\u0027s just as smart as Bob.\n\nWith Jeb\u0027s BadSness, Val\u0027s assistance, pilot teamwork did the job.\n\nThe Hummlebee touched ground and bounced, the VTOL engines saved the rep,\n\nOur crew had landed, KSC cheered, now to take their first small step.\n\nWell, Val and Jeb flew, Lisa scienced, Bill refined some ethanol,\n\nWhile kerbals bonded with the readers, Kuzzter broke through the fourth wall.\n\nThey mined, refined, and gathered science, through each biome they did traverse.\n\nWhen suddenly a great disturbance swept through the whole Kerbalverse.\n\nNow Jeb was eager and said \u0022Burn!\u0022 despite Bill\u0027s voicing his concern,\n\nPort wing lift then just disappeared, but they were saved by Jeb\u0027s left turn.\n\nWith Val unhappy Jeb\u0027s ascent plan, which was just \u0022B T Z Whooo!\u0022,\n\nGave their orbit inclination, still she found Ike rendezvous.\n\nOn Ike they landed, mined, and fuelled. Then they did a biome hop.\n\nAs Lisa crewed her instruments they gathered science every stop.\n\nWith mainstrut spliced, while crewmates sang, Bill\u0027s thoughts to the maneuver turned,\n\nWith Val\u0027s misgivings set aside, the Hummlebee for Kerbin burned.\n\nThe final interlude was shown, we saw the orangesuits as cadets,\n\nWith no right answer, simulations may lead to command regrets.\n\nWith Lisa\u0027s growth and confidence, a kerbal musical transition,\n\nFinally Bill\u0027s k-mails back to base laid bare his dark suspicion.\n\nTheir homecoming came with surprise, a sudden change of destination.\n\n\u0022Set your peri at 400, burn for Micarooni Station.\u0022\n\nThe Hummlebee was short on fuel, could not match the trajectory,\n\nSo Enzin Kenlie to the rescue, Kranefly met the Hummlebee.\n\nKranefly burned and disconnected, Val and Jeb switched Kaptin\u0027s shift,\n\nThe ship hit atmo and reentered, still the port wing had no lift.\n\nWith Bill\u0027s deep knowledge of the \u0027verse the ship was fixed and flying true,\n\nJeb handed over flight control so Val could show what she could do.\n\nVal took the stick and flew the ship right down the glidepath, no abort.\n\nShe hit the mark with great precision, \u0027tween Overshoot and Whoopstooshort.\n\nThey touched the ground all safe and sound, and Gene and Wernher led a cheer,\n\nThe crew reflected, thanked the ship, and Jebediah shed a tear.\n\nThe ship was taken, science won and this is where the story ends,\n\nNow our brave crew are not just kerbals, they have all become our friends.\n\nHappy landings!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-06T00:32:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/06/2015 12:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T23:15:40Z","Content":"Thank you, that\u0027s lovely! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Cydonian Monk","CreatedById":69224,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T00:58:29Z","Content":"Very nicely done, and a good ending.
