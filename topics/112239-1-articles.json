You could place them in random places around Kerbin.\n\nBut what would also be useful if there were command centres on every planet. You could build and launch rockets from planet to planet.\n\nOnce discovered, you could refurbish command centres (if they were abandoned) or if they are currently in use you could buy them and the work force. I feel this would add another aspect of adventure mode, to discover all the command centres. Of course, if you were to implement this it would need a lot of polishing. I hope you like this idea though.\n\nI have a few other ideas about this, of course you can choose to implement any you want.\n\n1. You would have to hire Kerbals to work in a refurbished command centre.\n\n2. Abandoned command centres cost different amounts to repair, depending on how damaged they are and what level the building are at.\n\n3. Abandoned command centres would slowly decay after you found them, but didn\u0027t refurbish them. It would slowly cost more to refurbish them.\n\n4. A business and automation side to things. You can buy working command centres and have them doing missions for you (would need a lot of balancing). You could also view the individual worth and overall worth of your command centres.\n\n5. Some command centres would already be known on the map, and they would also be completing missions that you have been offered, but haven\u0027t accepted.\n\n6. Other command centres\u0027 rockets would also be around. You could interact with them, and even sabotage their missions.\n\n7. Just like you can sabotage their missions, other command centres should be able to interfere with your missions. (This should only be in hard and possibly medium difficulty.)\n\n8. There should be a way to build your own command centres. Find a spot that isn\u0027t near any others, then mark it as a spot to build it. Then you would have to get ships full of the resources over there.\n\n9. The cost of parts should be more on other planets, to be a bit more realistic. The further away from Kerbin, the more expensive.\n\nThank you for reading this, and I hope you liked this idea. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T11:46:54Z","Content":"Some more places to launch rockets/planes from Kerbin: YES\n\nKSCs on other planets: NO.\n\nThe rest of the ideas are a bit too much IMO."},{"CreatedByName":"DSKY","CreatedById":115470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T16:31:40Z","Content":"Overall very interesting. It would be nice to see more civilization on Kerbin in general (I created a separate suggestion for that). Other command centers could be a way to implement multiplayer. You could further expand that into other industries, which would tie into the tech tree. For example, you need a semiconductor plant to unlock Mechjeb, or a nuclear industry to unlock RTGs. Off-Kerbin command centers and manufacturing would have their own capabilities, but only according to what you provide and build on each body."},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:53:32Z","Content":"Multiple command centers is the most interesting and realistic option. \n\nI think it shouldn\u0027t be much more complicated than how the current building upgrade system works. I don\u0027t even think there should be time where you need to search for them. \n\nThis may lead into Multiplayer ideas also, with different players handling different launch facilities accross Kerbin. But Im all just dreaming at this point when it comes to Multiplayer haha.\n\nHell the Island Airport is a great start its already sitting there lol."}]}
