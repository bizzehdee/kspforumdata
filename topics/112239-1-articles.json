You could place them in random places around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what would also be useful if there were command centres on every planet. You could build and launch rockets from planet to planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce discovered, you could refurbish command centres (if they were abandoned) or if they are currently in use you could buy them and the work force. I feel this would add another aspect of adventure mode, to discover all the command centres. Of course, if you were to implement this it would need a lot of polishing. I hope you like this idea though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a few other ideas about this, of course you can choose to implement any you want.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. You would have to hire Kerbals to work in a refurbished command centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Abandoned command centres cost different amounts to repair, depending on how damaged they are and what level the building are at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Abandoned command centres would slowly decay after you found them, but didn\u0027t refurbish them. It would slowly cost more to refurbish them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. A business and automation side to things. You can buy working command centres and have them doing missions for you (would need a lot of balancing). You could also view the individual worth and overall worth of your command centres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Some command centres would already be known on the map, and they would also be completing missions that you have been offered, but haven\u0027t accepted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Other command centres\u0027 rockets would also be around. You could interact with them, and even sabotage their missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Just like you can sabotage their missions, other command centres should be able to interfere with your missions. (This should only be in hard and possibly medium difficulty.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. There should be a way to build your own command centres. Find a spot that isn\u0027t near any others, then mark it as a spot to build it. Then you would have to get ships full of the resources over there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. The cost of parts should be more on other planets, to be a bit more realistic. The further away from Kerbin, the more expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you for reading this, and I hope you liked this idea. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T11:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome more places to launch rockets/planes from Kerbin: YES\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSCs on other planets: NO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the ideas are a bit too much IMO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DSKY","CreatedById":115470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T16:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOverall very interesting. It would be nice to see more civilization on Kerbin in general (I created a separate suggestion for that). Other command centers could be a way to implement multiplayer. You could further expand that into other industries, which would tie into the tech tree. For example, you need a semiconductor plant to unlock Mechjeb, or a nuclear industry to unlock RTGs. Off-Kerbin command centers and manufacturing would have their own capabilities, but only according to what you provide and build on each body.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMultiple command centers is the most interesting and realistic option. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it shouldn\u0027t be much more complicated than how the current building upgrade system works. I don\u0027t even think there should be time where you need to search for them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may lead into Multiplayer ideas also, with different players handling different launch facilities accross Kerbin. But Im all just dreaming at this point when it comes to Multiplayer haha.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell the Island Airport is a great start its already sitting there lol.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
