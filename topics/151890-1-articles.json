You have to use the fuel you brought with you on the initial launch and once that is spent it is mission over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever you are allowed a second launch to bring the science home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was rather pleased with my haul, but I am sure it can be beaten.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-11T21:37:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the Jool 5 challenges is to bring back all the science you can.
