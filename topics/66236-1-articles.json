I will create each module as a vertex with two half edges attached, sticking out at 120 degrees from each other. Clearly, I don\u0027t want to mount the vertex end on to the lifter, as it would be hideously unbalanced. But if I rotate the module so the legs are pointing into the air, I can\u0027t use symmetry to build the lifter, because the axis of symmetry follows the main axis of the original root part, which is now horizontal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t attach the station module sideways to a lifter as a sub-assembly, because I cant attach the sub-assembly to a radial hard point\u0027s \u0027inner\u0027 side. For the same reason, I can\u0027t build the lifter first and add a horizontal payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to get the rotated payload to sit happily on top of a lifter which can be built with symmetry, or is the only option to build everything completely by eye, with no automatic symmetry involved.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, this is probably the most frustrating thing I\u0027ve tried to do in KSP yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T16:18:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what you need to do, build your lander with symmetry, using a girder as the root part.
