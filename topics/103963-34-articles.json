Scared me too for a second.\n\u003E Honestly, the work you guys (blackrack, rbray, Proot, shaw, and all the others involved in those efforts) do for making KSP insanely beautiful cannot be appreciated enough. It\u0027s also very nice to see how you all cooperate across your various mods to provide a consistent experience for all of us. I\u0027m patiently waiting for things to be released for us to test and enjoy, and I sincerely hope that you all don\u0027t get too put off by all the hype and impatient people (and bluntly, people who don\u0027t know what \u0022wip\u0022 means and how free software communities work). I\u0027d rather the moderators rule with iron fists in your dev threads, or close the threads down until there is a release, than any of you getting frustrated and burning out because of unwarranted pressure put on you by some people.\n\u003E \n\u003E Please take your time and keep enjoying what you do, and rest assured that there are many people like myself that are insanely grateful for everything you give to us, whenever it may come.
