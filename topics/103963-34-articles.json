Or maybe merge it with another mod.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOriginally the mod was just for atmospheric scattering effects but I\u0027m already working on including some of the other stuff in Proland because it\u0027s relatively easy since I have most of the framework set up. Ocean shaders are halfway done (check around page 38-40 for a sneak peek) but they had issues with moving around and I haven\u0027t worked on them since then because they took too much time. I don\u0027t think I will be able to do forestry though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I don\u0027t plan on merging the mod with any other mods, but I\u0027m trying to make it compatible with EVE and then anyone can include it into a visual pack if they want to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T07:13:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 07:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by blackrack\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T08:39:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you mean forestry with physics?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that if you use random number generator with same seed each time their (maybe per save?) position would not change so that no potential physics clipping on reload would occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis may have a great potential in replacing or supplementing stock terrain scatters\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tkw","CreatedById":142638,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T13:55:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sashan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sashan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it possible to disable the effect in Map view?
