Most grapes are of such a size as to get within the ballpark of being a half wavelength at 2.4 GHz, even. The connecting skin quickly heats up from the large currents, and then it either ignites or ceases to conduct and then arcs over. Either way you get a little bit of plasma to seed the process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T09:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, basically it is possible to build rocket engine out of microwave and a bunch of grapes? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E Of course the only way to power up such engine would be with potato batteries \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T10:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scotius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scotius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo, basically it is possible to build rocket engine out of microwave and a bunch of grapes?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have to get creative to find something you can\u0027t build a rocket engine out of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-09T10:37:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn reality you can fuel a rocket with anything.
