Preferably with a button on the docking port. The strengthening could possibly be explained by docking clamps that grip into each other and thus lock the docking port together after the magnetic connection is made. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis would a allow you to dock your ships and then toggle the lock on and off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes something like this exist?
