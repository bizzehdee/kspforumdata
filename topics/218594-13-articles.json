Whatever bugs or questionable design choices it may have (and I think you\u0027re severely overstating how serious they are, I\u0027ve never had nearly as many issues as you keep claiming to experience, except maybe when trying to figure out new mods) the fact is it still adds up to a wonderful, deeply enjoyable game. I\u0027d pay $50 for KSP1 again today, and it\u0027d be worth every penny.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t interpret this as \u0022dumping\u0022 on KSP 1, but rather, pointing out that KSP 1...\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ewas what it was.\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0A brief look at what the mod community did and how popular certain mods were should have been enough to identify that the game had shortcomings or design that had more potential, and the mod teams stepped up. I look at it like Skyrim... unmodded Skyrim is a world of infinite possibilities, right up until you figure out what you\u0027re doing in the game, and then you run into the \u0027borders\u0027 of the game design pretty quickly. Modding fixed it up tremendously, but there\u0027s always a certain argument to be made that Bethesda really shouldn\u0027t have shipped or developed certain things in a certain way in the first place. I think one of the most embarrassing Skyrim features was the stupid \u0027puzzle\u0027 spinners. They weren\u0027t puzzles, they were idiotic. Bethesda should have either cut them from the game or actually put in real puzzles, but instead they left a half-assed feature in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1 was cobbled together by like three different dev teams across what at this point may as well be multiple different engines, went through several massive changes in scope, and a decade of active development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point of a franchise sequel in a non-story-based game is to really build on where the first entry stopped. Not just... rebuild the exact same game again, even down to recycling the model parts even for parts that were pretty terrible in the first place (Mk. 2 Lander Can, LV-909, etc.). A sequel is exactly the time and place to take where the boundaries of the first game lay and build them further out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike imagine it had been years since something like Satisfactory came out, and then they were like \u0027Satisfactory 2!\u0027 and it\u0027s literally just the first game on the same land mass but with new graphics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T04:03:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 04:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Frostiken\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chilkoot","CreatedById":175911,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T04:16:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224243035\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212076\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677373455\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022182413\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Bej Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Bej Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds more like a minor misdirection than \u0022poorly conceived and inconsistent\u0022.
