This CIWS also detects missiles and objects without an IFF tag and attempts to destroy them as well. In addition to all that goodness, it has a built in safeguard that stops the gun from shooting it\u0027s own vessel, so it\u0027ll only take the shot if it has clear line of sight. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly...
