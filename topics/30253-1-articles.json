While I\u0027ve had some truly bizarre problems placing RCS thrusters on it so that it could safely dock, the ~5000 dV enables it to land in any place on the Mun \u003Cem\u003E(or get to lots of other places and land there, but this time I\u0027m only concerned with the Mun)\u003C/em\u003E and handle multiple landmarks without refueling while being immune to my suboptimal landings and takeoffs, which was the whole point of using a nuclear engine when it constitutes half of the craft\u0027s total mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately looking for the right place to stick a flag into typically involves more searching, which can take a while on foot and wastes fuel when trying to do it while landing. The obvious solution is to put wheels on, but it obviously can\u0027t work if the craft is still oriented vertically, because LV-N. I can put the wheels on sideways, no problem, but then I need to land wheels down. I can\u0027t just land on legs and then fold some of them, because the vessel needs to take off on it\u0027s own later, and do a repeat landing somewhere else, so I can\u0027t drop anything either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I can stick side mounted engines on it, keep them disabled, switch to them when I\u0027m near the ground, kill all velocity to zero and use the time that gives me to reorient and land horizontally. And herein\u0027s the problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf they were the only engines on the ship, I would just set up four of them so that the thrust vector goes through the center of mass and be done with it, SAS would keep it sufficiently stable to land onto the wheels. However, there\u0027s also the LV-N, which is also displayed in thrust vector and messes everything up. I can\u0027t remove it and still see the correct center of mass, because it is half of the ship\u0027s mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I see the thrust vector of only a certain subset of engines? If I can\u0027t see that thrust vector, how do I get the ship balanced to land horizontally?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-30T19:38:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2013 07:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mihara\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CookiezFort","CreatedById":68364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T16:19:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewell waht you can do is place the legs (the ones that can retract) and place also some of the landing gears that can retract on the same side, keep the side engines as they are and activate them only when you need to... so what you would do is land with landing struts, open the landing gear, retract the struts and there you go... if oyou tried that already then i do not know anything else\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mihara","CreatedById":59752,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-30T16:30:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, landing vertically and tipping over is not going to be helpful here, I need to take off.
