Have the appropriate pros and cons of each system, as well. For example, the CCCP pods might have built-in retrorockets for land-based parachute landings. The US-style parts might land too fast for that---tweak the US capsules to land at 8.5-10 m/s and have that survivable on water. So if you go with the current KSP parts based on US stuff, you land on water or die unless you build some other kind of craft. If something like the current version if USILS (RoverDude\u0027s life support mod) were added, then the added habitation volume of the Soviet-style craft might allow longer duration flights, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake tech tree choices matter with meaningful branches, instead of just unlocking everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-04T00:16:52Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2016 12:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fairytalefox","CreatedById":115320,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-04T04:10:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe just need more different pods.
