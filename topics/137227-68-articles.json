The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E. I don\u0027t quite buy the idea of playing without mobile lab altogether, because you know, stations are awesome, and I\u0027m too practical to have stations just for looks. And I was disappointed with station science mod. Soo, I stumbled across Kerbalism, and while it has some minor bugs it was awesome. I didn\u0027t start a new career back then though, and had a lot of advantage, even if some kerbals on the missions rapidly unscheduledly kicked the bucket because of LS requirements kicking in.. Well, as the time went by I had some issues here and there, and this weekend I decided to start a new career after all, taking in account the stuff I learned about Kerbalism, and tweaking some settings here and there to better suit what I\u0027d like gameplay-wise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ended up removing Kerbalism altogether and going with TAC-LS (and some other mods of course), because, as I was switching off features, I realized there\u0027s little left of Kerbalism I actually wanted in a new game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere were my concerns, in no particular order:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\ngame performance suffers somewhat, there\u0027s very slight, but constant stutter\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nit does not always play well with other mods, because these mods are balanced for vanilla, and Kerbalism rebalances some stuff. For example solar panels. So one has to make patches. There are compatibility patches bundled for some mods, but even these are not perfect, for example near future solars ec/weight/cost ratios are kinda inconsistent (they are not scaled as of latest versions, and instead have coded replacement values). It is not really hard to make patches, but overall it\u0027s a work, either for players or modders (or you) and begs the question - why was it even needed to rescale solars in the first place? Why not change ec only consumption values instead, main culprits here being life support, resource converter and ion engines, as far as I see it (and you scale engines\u0027 ec consumption anyway). Even if some consumer is not rescaled, I imagine it would average to a lesser effect compared to poorly scaled ec generation. There was the same issue with LS resources, but that one you did fix.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nmalfunction mechanic, while fun at first, was most detrimental to gameplay. It makes strong point of having an engineer (which is nice) but:\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nit makes unmanned long-range missions WAY too much pain. By the time a probe reaches some planet it is broken heavily, even worse if it\u0027s a lander and it can no longer land\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nit makes skipping time (interplanetary travel / waiting for a good launch window) painful if I have ongoing missions, because stuff just rots, so I ended up having a lot of missions simultaneously, with poor launching schedule and ETA times and so on\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nand these two points resonate with each other heavily.

What bothered me about malfunction mechanic was that stuff breaks mercilessly on interplanetary timescale, but just decreasing malfunction chance would make it too unlikely Kerbin-scale, and having many missions sucks because stuff breaks just as much in background. And logically speaking, why does stuff break so much in the first place, when it\u0027s not even used? So, maybe bring that background malfunction chance down by a lot (malfunctions caused by radiation) and introduce a chance of malfunction when a module is used instead, or something happens (like fiery atmospheric landing). Though I\u0027m not quite sure how to handle modules that are used passively (solars) or continuously (refinery, reactors, lab, etc). But the general idea is to break more when it\u0027s active and less when it\u0027s just a space brick of hardware. That would make malfunctions less tied to the actual time and more to \u0022events\u0022 on the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-21T05:09:10Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2016 05:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by enlait\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ebetter wording.
