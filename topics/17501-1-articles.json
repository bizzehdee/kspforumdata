Here\u0027s the Kerbal equivalent, the Purge Scourge. 5 Hi-Performance Engines will rocket you up into the stratosphere, where you will reach a service ceiling of 16,500-17,000 metres. In an emergency due to low fuel levels, this craft can glide to safety, down to a gentle 47.5 m/s to guarantee a soft landing. I managed to get this craft to 20,025 metres for a height record (not sustained flight) and afterwards when it descended, its speed reached about 706.5 m/s (just over Mach 2).

I tried my best to make a backswept wing to further reduce drag, but at the same time, provide excellent air grip.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueFalcon77","CreatedById":12907,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T07:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, just set a new height record for this plane.
