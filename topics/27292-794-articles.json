I found the missing parts from the BDArmory Addons I got, and I tried to make a WWII replica-ish fighter with KAX. It has an unfortunate tendency to flip, likely due to a combination of the COM, COL, and COT all being near the front, and the fact that the four elevons to a wing were set to pitch, witch I corrected in the SPH but have not had a chance to see how it affects the problem. It takes off fine, but pitching up more than a teeny tiny bit leads to it flipping, and it\u0027s usually to close to the ground for me to get out of it, if I can. Course though, the only time I can remember doing that was in a stock craft from the MK 2 expansion mod, the f-13 raptor, and that was incredibly close, with me pulling out succesfully less than a meter above the ground.
