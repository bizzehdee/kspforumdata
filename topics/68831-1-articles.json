It would probably expose the asteroid to a constant stream of impacts from space debris as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YourEverydayWaffle","CreatedById":83957,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T23:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI bet it\u0027s because it would take a lot quick thrust power that the asteroid pushing engines (I believe they intend to push, not pull it) won\u0027t be easily made with. I think it requires a lot of precision to get things into the right LEO without foreign governments getting angry for taking up space. And imagine if they accidentally de-orbited the thing. Then you\u0027ve got an asteroid made of who-knows-what hurtling toward Earth. The moon requires less quick actions and it presumably has a more expendable surface in the minds of NASA. I don\u0027t know, just my theory.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
