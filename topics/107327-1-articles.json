When the rocket is travelling straight up, fins have very low drag. However, if the rocket begins to tip slightly to one side, the fins\u0027 drag increases, making the rocket briefly more stable. They also exert a force on the base of the rocket (\u0022Lift\u0022) that causes the rocket to remain pointed up. Lift plays a far larger role in keeping your rocket pointed in the right direction than drag does, but both are quite capable of helping.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s another diagram from NASA.

For example, rockets with large fairings have a lot of drag up top, and thus they need larger fins to bring the center of pressure down to the right spot. In addition, the sharper the nose cone (and the less drag) up top, the lower the need for large fins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo properly stabilize the rocket, at least three fins are needed. Most rockets use three or four fins; there\u0027s really no reason to use any more than six.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EOkay, but how can you tell where the CG and the CP are?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s currently a very good way to find your rocket\u0027s CG: click the button at the bottom right of the VAB that says \u0022Center of Mass.\u0022 Finding your rocket\u0027s CP is a bit harder. The indicator that says \u0022Center of Lift\u0022 \u003Cstrong\u003Edoes not give your CP\u003C/strong\u003E. As a matter of fact, it doesn\u0027t give any data at all if you don\u0027t use the wing bits found in the \u0027Aerodynamics\u0027 tab! Thus, I would personally recommend using a part from the aerodynamics tab as your fins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you have placed your fins, you can pull up the \u0027Center of Lift\u0027 tab and the \u0027Center of Mass\u0027 tab. If your \u0027Center of Lift\u0027 is one caliber or more behind your \u0027Center of Mass,\u0027 you should be good. A \u0027caliber\u0027 is the width of your rocket\u0027s fuel tanks: if you have a 1.25m tank, for example, you need to place the fins so that the \u0027center of lift\u0027 is about 1.25m further down the rocket. (You can eyeball this if you want.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your rocket is too stubby to have the center of lift a full caliber behind the center of mass, that\u0027s okay.

Most notably, rockets with fins consistently point prograde (in the direction the rocket is travelling). If your prograde marker is slightly off-vertical and you turn your SAS off, the rocket will begin to very gradually tip in that direction. Because your thrust vector will no longer be vertical, your prograde marker will move further towards the horizon. Your rocket will, theoretically, tip until it is ninety degrees from vertical and then start descending... if you don\u0027t design it properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, this happens quite frequently if a model rocket launches into the wind or without sufficient thrust. It\u0027s called \u0027weathercocking.\u0027 Here\u0027s a picture of this effect, originally taken by JCRocket.com:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.jcrocket.com/images/magnum/magnumk700-2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022magnumk700-2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo combat this, you can do several things. One is to place fins that can swivel on your rocket. These fins will do a better job of keeping the rocket pointed at exactly the angle you want it to. Another thing you can do is add some SAS. Finally, you can throttle up all the way or otherwise increase the amount of thrust your rocket produces relative to its weight: its \u0027thrust-to-weight ratio.\u0027 This will ensure that the rocket does not tip as quickly, because the amount of thrust is basically pushing you further upward before you tip too much more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote, however, that if you can get your rocket tipped very slightly early in the flight so that it is nearly horizontal when you get to the upper atmosphere, you\u0027ve done a great job creating an \u0027orbit-friendly\u0027 flight profile! Because your rocket was pointing prograde the whole way up, your burn to orbit will be quite efficient and it may not even require the SAS unit! In other words, this rocket behavior can be annoying, but it can also help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EDo you need fins on your radially-mounted boosters?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELikely not, at least with shorter boosters.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadially-mounted boosters are usually mounted near the base of the rocket.

For small deviations from the direction of flight:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(a) the lift of the fins is perpendicular to the centerline of the rocket, which favors torque production;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E the drag is nearly parallel to the centerline, which is unfavorable for torque production;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00A9 the drag area of the fins is not much larger than when the rocket is pointing in the direction of flight, so the form drag doesn\u0027t increase much;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(d) for typical airfoils, lift increases faster than induced drag (for small angles of attack)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the only way for drag to be the dominant contribution would be for the drag force to be considerably larger than the lift force that can be produced. However, typical wings have lift-to-drag ratios on the order of 10, so the lift-induced torque would tend to be considerably greater for the reasons stated above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m no aerodynamics expert so please do correct me if I\u0027m wrong; I bring this up to hopefully improve my understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T10:26:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is great!
