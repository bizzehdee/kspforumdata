My name is UpsilonAerospace.\n\nI\u0027ve had loads of experience with model rocketry, so I have a fairly good general idea of How Aerodynamics Work. However, it seems as if many new players of KSP are a bit weirded out by the aerodynamics that were introduced in 1.0 and subsequent patches.\n\nThus, I\u0027ll take this opportunity to give an overview to aerodynamics as a whole. **I\u0027m going to start out rather simple and then get more technical as I go,** so just start reading wherever something catches your eye that you may not have known before, okay?\n\nGood. Let\u0027s get started.\n\nA Brief and Simple Guide to Rocket Aerodynamics!\n\n(I thought I could make this guide shorter. Perhaps I was overly optimistic with my title... oh well.)\n\n~~~\n\n**Let\u0027s first get some simple terminology out of the way:**\n\nThe **center of mass** (or center of gravity) *is a rocket\u0027s horizontal balance point.* There is an equal amount of mass above the C.G. (as it\u0027s abbreviated in model rocketry) as there is below it.\n\nThe **center of pressure** (or C.P., as it\u0027s abbreviated in model rocketry) is a little more difficult to find. All bits of your rocket have a certain amount of drag, and if you took the location and amount of drag of every part and averaged it all out, the average point would be the center of pressure. Fortunately, there\u0027s an easier way to do this in Kerbal Space Program, as we\u0027ll soon see.\n\n~~~\n\n**So, where should the CG and the CP be on your rocket?**\n\nI\u0027ll use the example of a badminton birdie (or shuttlecock). Here\u0027s a friendly picture:\n\n![badminton-birdie.jpg](https://gamesweplayed.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/badminton-birdie.jpg)\n\nNow, as anyone who has played badminton knows, the birdie flies with the bit on the left pointed in the direction it\u0027s traveling. If you tried to throw it while it was pointed backwards, it would correct itself so that it was pointed forwards again. In other words, it\u0027s \u0027stable.\u0027\n\nOf course, it would be nice to have your rocket pointed in the direction it\u0027s travelling. If it wasn\u0027t, it would lead to instability: flipping and possibly crashing. You don\u0027t want that to happen.\n\nSo, where\u0027s the center of gravity and the center of pressure on a badminton birdie?\n\nThe front of a badminton birdie is most definitely heavier than the back: the center of gravity is almost all the way at the front of a birdie. Because the back of a birdie has a lot of drag, its center of pressure is located a bit further back. In other words, the center of gravity is in front of the center of pressure to make the birdie stable. \n\n**A stable rocket must have its center of gravity** ***in front of*** **its center of pressure.** It must have enough drag on the bottom to move its center of pressure behind the center of gravity. Some people think that this is counterintuitive: they think that the rocket should be bottom-heavy, so that the bit with the most weight would be pointed towards the ground. But that\u0027s simply not true.\n\nNASA agrees with me here, so I think I\u0027m doing something right:\n\n![558273main_rocket-direction.jpg](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/558273main_rocket-direction.jpg)\n\n...oh, and by the way, badminton birdies make *great* model rockets, though they\u0027re a bit too draggy to win any competition awards.\n\n![birdie_main.jpg](https://www.apogeerockets.com/images/oddl_products/birdie_main.jpg)\n\n~~~\n\n**How can you get the CG and the CP to be in the right place?**\n\n**There are several important things to note here:**\n\n- **A tube-shaped rocket with a nose cone on top will be unstable.** The CG will be at about the middle of the rocket, but the CP will be near the top: even the pointiest nose cone will still be more draggy than any other part of the rocket.\n- **The faster you go, the worse the problem gets if your rocket is unstable.** Or, to be more precise, the more airflow over the rocket, the worse the problem gets. In the lower atmosphere, rockets have an especially hard time with this.\n- **It\u0027s much easier to move the CP than it is to move the CG.** While you have to completely rearrange your rocket\u0027s layout to change the CG, you only have to add some special bits called \u0022fins\u0022 onto your rocket to change the CP. (More on this later.)\n- **However, the CG moves around quite a bit during flight!** As the tanks drain, the rocket\u0027s center of gravity gets lower and lower, causing it to be less and less stable. This is worrisome, and you should keep it in mind.\n- **Placing very draggy bits at the bottom will actually help!** If you put a big ol\u0027 set of structural panels or wing bits at the base of your rocket, arranged to be as high-drag as possible, they will make your rocket more stable (by lowering the location of the CP). They will also be as draggy as all get-out, so you probably shouldn\u0027t do this if you want your rocket to go to space. There are better ways of doing this, folks!\n\n~~~\n\n**What are fins, and what do they do?**\n\nFins are protrusions outside the rocket\u0027s airframe. Their goal in life is to lower the center of pressure on the rocket. **Therefore, the most ideal fins are rather small and** ***as far towards the bottom of the rocket as possible*****.**\n\nFins keep the rocket stable without much drag in a very clever way. When the rocket is travelling straight up, fins have very low drag. However, if the rocket begins to tip slightly to one side, the fins\u0027 drag increases, making the rocket briefly more stable. They also exert a force on the base of the rocket (\u0022Lift\u0022) that causes the rocket to remain pointed up. Lift plays a far larger role in keeping your rocket pointed in the right direction than drag does, but both are quite capable of helping.\n\nHere\u0027s another diagram from NASA. (This one is an expanded version of the precious one.)\n\n![rktstab.gif](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/VirtualAero/BottleRocket/airplane/Images/rktstab.gif)\n\nSome configurations of rocket need larger fins than others. For example, rockets with large fairings have a lot of drag up top, and thus they need larger fins to bring the center of pressure down to the right spot. In addition, the sharper the nose cone (and the less drag) up top, the lower the need for large fins.\n\nTo properly stabilize the rocket, at least three fins are needed. Most rockets use three or four fins; there\u0027s really no reason to use any more than six.\n\n~~~\n\n**Okay, but how can you tell where the CG and the CP are?**\n\nThere\u0027s currently a very good way to find your rocket\u0027s CG: click the button at the bottom right of the VAB that says \u0022Center of Mass.\u0022 Finding your rocket\u0027s CP is a bit harder. The indicator that says \u0022Center of Lift\u0022 **does not give your CP**. As a matter of fact, it doesn\u0027t give any data at all if you don\u0027t use the wing bits found in the \u0027Aerodynamics\u0027 tab! Thus, I would personally recommend using a part from the aerodynamics tab as your fins. \n\nOnce you have placed your fins, you can pull up the \u0027Center of Lift\u0027 tab and the \u0027Center of Mass\u0027 tab. If your \u0027Center of Lift\u0027 is one caliber or more behind your \u0027Center of Mass,\u0027 you should be good. A \u0027caliber\u0027 is the width of your rocket\u0027s fuel tanks: if you have a 1.25m tank, for example, you need to place the fins so that the \u0027center of lift\u0027 is about 1.25m further down the rocket. (You can eyeball this if you want.)\n\nIf your rocket is too stubby to have the center of lift a full caliber behind the center of mass, that\u0027s okay. Your rocket still *should* fly safely, though it may not have as good of a margin of stability.\n\n~~~\n\n**How do fins affect your rocket\u0027s flight path?**\n\nFins\u0027 ability to make your rocket more stable lends to some interesting characteristics. Most notably, rockets with fins consistently point prograde (in the direction the rocket is travelling). If your prograde marker is slightly off-vertical and you turn your SAS off, the rocket will begin to very gradually tip in that direction. Because your thrust vector will no longer be vertical, your prograde marker will move further towards the horizon. Your rocket will, theoretically, tip until it is ninety degrees from vertical and then start descending... if you don\u0027t design it properly. \n\nIn real life, this happens quite frequently if a model rocket launches into the wind or without sufficient thrust. It\u0027s called \u0027weathercocking.\u0027 Here\u0027s a picture of this effect, originally taken by JCRocket.com:\n\n![magnumk700-2.jpg](http://www.jcrocket.com/images/magnum/magnumk700-2.jpg)\n\nTo combat this, you can do several things. One is to place fins that can swivel on your rocket. These fins will do a better job of keeping the rocket pointed at exactly the angle you want it to. Another thing you can do is add some SAS. Finally, you can throttle up all the way or otherwise increase the amount of thrust your rocket produces relative to its weight: its \u0027thrust-to-weight ratio.\u0027 This will ensure that the rocket does not tip as quickly, because the amount of thrust is basically pushing you further upward before you tip too much more.\n\nNote, however, that if you can get your rocket tipped very slightly early in the flight so that it is nearly horizontal when you get to the upper atmosphere, you\u0027ve done a great job creating an \u0027orbit-friendly\u0027 flight profile! Because your rocket was pointing prograde the whole way up, your burn to orbit will be quite efficient and it may not even require the SAS unit! In other words, this rocket behavior can be annoying, but it can also help.\n\n~~~\n\n**Do you need fins on your radially-mounted boosters?**\n\n**Likely not, at least with shorter boosters.** \n\nRadially-mounted boosters are usually mounted near the base of the rocket. This actually moves both the center of gravity and the center of lift towards the base. If your rocket is stable without boosters, it *should* be okay with boosters. You *probably* don\u0027t need larger-than-normal fins on the main stage or separate fins on the boosters. However, if your rocket wasn\u0027t that stable to begin with, you might want to consider adding fins onto the boosters and/or the main core to ensure stability.\n\n~~~\n\n**Do you need fins on each stage of your rocket?**\n\n**It depends.**\n\nIf your rocket has multiple stages that fire within the thick of the atmosphere, each one should have its own set of fins. The fins on the lowest stage should almost certainly be the largest and most prominent, with every subsequent stages\u0027 fins getting smaller and smaller. Don\u0027t forget that you\u0027re raising the center of pressure significantly with each set of fins.\n\nIf you\u0027re firing your upper stages at 30km or higher, especially with some SAS on them, you don\u0027t need fins. Your rocket will fly fine without them.\n\n~~~\n\n**Is there any reason to put fins at the top of the rocket?**\n\n**Not really.** The only good reason you would do something like this is either if you had an upper stage or if you wanted to build a scale model of a real rocket.\n\n~~~\n\n**Are there other ways to make my rocket fly properly?**\n\n**Sure!**\n\n**Option 1: Engine Gimbal**\n\n**Pros:** Probably applies to most rockets you build, meaning you don\u0027t have to add extra parts. Somewhat effective, especially at lower velocities.\n\n**Cons:** Less effective (to completely ineffective) at higher velocities. Requires an engine with gimbal capability. The larger the gimbal, the greater the percentage of fuel wasted while burning in a direction other than straight up. Gimbal may overcorrect, resulting in wobbly rockets.\n\n**I should note that many people have kept their rockets quite stable with a combination of engine gimbal and SAS (seen below).** If you\u0027re a more advanced player, you shouldn\u0027t have much of a problem with a finless rocket.\n\nHowever, doing this requires you to manually point your rocket within five or ten degrees of prograde throughout the ascent. If you\u0027re using this, you should always keep your SAS on as well: turning it off will quite likely cause your rocket to flip over.\n\n**Finally, fins are all-but-required if you have a solid rocket booster (SRB) or an engine without a gimbal for your first stage.** Engines without gimbal are unable to correct your rocket\u0027s position when it deviates even a tiny amount from prograde, thus making your rocket far more likely to lose stability. You can check your engine\u0027s gimbal range by right-clicking on the engine\u0027s icon on the left side of the VAB.\n\n**Option 2: SAS**\n\n**Pros:** Allows for complete control at all levels of atmosphere, whether the engines are burning or not. Rather nice and simple.\n\n**Cons:** Rather heavy, reducing amount of payload that can be carried into orbit. Can be twitchy.\n\n**Option 3: RCS**\n\n**Pros:** Allows for acceleration in different directions, both in the atmosphere and in space.\n\n**Cons:** Way too heavy. Depletable. Mostly pointless. Why did I even add this option?!\n\n**Option 4: Spin Stabilization**\n\n**Pros:** Rather simple. An interesting real-life concept. Can make unstable rockets stable without adding much mass.\n\n**Cons:** Impossible to orient oneself. Impossible to do a gravity turn. May waste fuel by spinning. Causes Kerbal nausea. (No one likes Kerbal nausea.)\n\n...yep, I\u0027ll go with fins, personally.\n\n~~~\n\n**Is there anything else to say?**\n\n**Probably. Let me know if you have any unanswered questions, or if you find inaccuracies within this guide!** I\u0027ll try to address your concerns as well as I can.\n\nI would like to note that this thread is basically an extension of the \u0022[Why does my FLIPping rocket Always Flip Over!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117876)\u0022 thread.

There are no fins on the Falcon or Atlas rocket families. Another strategy to recommend making stable rockets, is to setup the staging of a rocket such that the center of mass always move upwards.\n\u003E \n\u003E Very long, minimally staged rockets with payloads lighter than the engine (approximate of course), have the center of mass move towards the bottom of the rocket.

And this is the same for each subsequent stage.\n\u003E \n\u003E A rocket design considers two things now. Boosters to get off the ground, and balancing each stage of a rocket through the ascent.\n\nSee, the problem with this is, no matter how high the center of gravity is, *the center of pressure is always higher than the center of gravity.* This is because the nose is generally the main source of a rocket\u0027s drag, so it raises the CP almost all the way to the top. Sure, having the CG rise is nice, and it is possible with a reasonably large upper stage. But it still results in an unstable rocket.\n\nThe best stability test you can do is to take your rocket up to about 5km, turn off the SAS, and then press W,A,S, or D for a second. If the rocket corrects back to near-vertical, it\u0027s stable. If it continues tipping, it\u0027s either \u0027neutrally stable\u0027 or \u0027unstable.\u0027 I\u0027ll bet you my own $0.02USD that you can\u0027t create a rocket that passes this stability test without placing something at the base of your rocket that adds drag (or turning on the SAS or otherwise cheating).\n\nOh, and I\u0027ll also comment that if the Falcon or Atlas\u0027s guidance system failed, they would be unstable.

If you know exactly what you\u0027re doing, it\u0027s possible to angle the rocket slightly after launch and then just take your hands off the controls as the rocket gradually tips towards horizontal and gains altitude. I have yet to achieve the perfect burn, but I\u0027ve regularly ended up at about ten degrees from horizontal at 35km, travelling at 1500 or 1600 m/s, with my nose right at the prograde marker the whole way up. No control input, no SAS, just plain ol\u0027 aerodynamics. The weight cost for this very nice ascent was only about 0.06 tons.\n\nI would strongly recommend giving this sort of thing a try and seeing whether you can do it too!

If there\u0027s another option, regardless of whether it\u0027s fins or reducing gimbal, I\u0027d like to at least try it out and see if it can do it better than I can manually. Plus, building a rocket that can very nearly fly itself into space simply by thrusting and letting physics do its thing sounds really dang cool."},{"CreatedByName":"Meithan","CreatedById":76123,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T02:14:41Z","Content":"Great write up, very clear and complete. I\u0027ve sent some rep your way.\n\nAs an aside for people willing to discuss the finer points of this, I\u0027d like to add that while it\u0027s true that both the lift and drag of the fins contribute to the restoring torque in a stable rocket, I\u0027m under the impression that it\u0027s the *lift* of the fins that generates the dominant contribution. \n\nI can think of several reasons for why this could be so. For small deviations from the direction of flight:\n\n(a) the lift of the fins is perpendicular to the centerline of the rocket, which favors torque production;\n\n(![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) the drag is nearly parallel to the centerline, which is unfavorable for torque production;\n\n\u00A9 the drag area of the fins is not much larger than when the rocket is pointing in the direction of flight, so the form drag doesn\u0027t increase much;\n\n(d) for typical airfoils, lift increases faster than induced drag (for small angles of attack)\n\nSo the only way for drag to be the dominant contribution would be for the drag force to be considerably larger than the lift force that can be produced. However, typical wings have lift-to-drag ratios on the order of 10, so the lift-induced torque would tend to be considerably greater for the reasons stated above.\n\nI\u0027m no aerodynamics expert so please do correct me if I\u0027m wrong; I bring this up to hopefully improve my understanding."},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T10:26:53Z","Content":"This is great!
