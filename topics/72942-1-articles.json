It happened right after I started tracking more asteroids in the NASA Missions. I figure it\u0027s because the game needs to track more objects and I just hit it\u0027s upper limit with that. So I opened up the persistent files on my HD and I\u0027m looking for the sections that tell KSP which potato shaped objects have been tracked and which are still unidentified.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took out the NASA missions to check if that would help and it did but most of my ships use sections from it and I really like the redirect missions I just don\u0027t need to track 40 asteroids at the same time. 1 or 2 would be fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny one know how to make those changes? I found where the asteroids are kept in the file themselves I just don\u0027t know which values to change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that makes sense.
