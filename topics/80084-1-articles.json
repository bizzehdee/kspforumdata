By the time I crack 25,000m, the RAPIERs are turned off and don\u0027t come back on until it\u0027s time to start burning oxidiser.

You just don\u0027t need a lot of thrust for high altitude level flight; two turbojets are enough to get my 100 ton spaceplane to Mach 4.5 at that altitude. The poster should also be shutting down engines as the air thins; the eight turbos may be handy for getting off the ground, but they just aren\u0027t that useful at altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding more intakes is usually a waste of time; keeping more engines running isn\u0027t going to make you significantly faster, because once you approach Mach 5, the turbojet thrust (which reduces greatly at these speeds, no matter how much air you feed them) begins to be outweighed by the intake drag.
