Lets use KSP game design choices that we are all familiar with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the best KSP related answer has to touch on the programming choices for the in game gyros. I want KSP to realistic. However I don\u0027t want it to be a pain in backside either. As such the gyro\u0027s work as they are expected to. There are just as technically accurate as they need to be to put little green men into space. There is of course mods to adjust things. The point I am making is a game developer has to pick a design choice. The best choice is normally the one that feels right to most\u00A0players. Even it it is not completely realistic in the real world. It is just a fun simulation after all. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImmersion in computer games and interactive theater is related in that most payers do have\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u00A0suspension of disbelief\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0They\u00A0will accept that some things should not be realistic for the purposes of game play.

This is not a farming simulator and nobody cares. On the other hand in early versions quite a few people mentioned that a lack aerodynamics was bad. They where expecting aircraft and rockets to fly a certain way because that was central to the games theme.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that made sense.

There are a number of ways they approach this, and a myriad of kinds of stories, but fundamentally, they are media for conveying stories. Games, on the other hand, are a horse of another color. Games seek to convey an experience of some kind.

Sometimes the art style of a game can be enough of a draw just on its own, and a game that on paper sounds really good can be awfully let down by poor choices in the art department.

No. But I do want to immerse myself in a well-described and detailed environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn games, as I suspect is the same in a lot of forms of art, ugly can be beautiful.
