We need to be able to see values to start with on all 3 axis and then have the ability to manually change them with actual values. This would solve a lot of building problems and help people both learn the game and make more interesting things. Almost everything in the game needs this done to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BigFatStupidHead","CreatedById":44217,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-04T18:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t setting the rotation gizmo to absolute work for you?

But it still needs numbers to be able to see exactly where it is. With small adjustments it\u0027s almost impossible without visual references to even out wings in odd circumstances. In my case I have to over align to get a visual reference. Which means I can\u0027t figure out if two separate wings are really angles the same way in two different spots.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-05T20:35:23Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2019 08:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
