Earlier you said you were dealing with a \u0027show stopping bug\u0027 to do with resource management and Kethane (or lack there-of in game). Does this by any chance mean you\u0027re attempting to link with another resource system? Say, KSPI? I\u0027d love it if there was a way for EL to integrate with KSPI directly, even if it required a MM plugin .CFG. Truth be told I\u0027m starting to get rather tired of Kethane\u0027s system, though there are problems with KSPI\u0027s as well right now (no mapping as yet other than an indicator of \u0027hot spots\u0027 and a plot to say what the level is under your craft at that moment.)
