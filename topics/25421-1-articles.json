Like a simple phasing orbit. It will fight to get that last .2 m/s to make a154k orbit, when in reality, being at 153.8k is fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you leave rcs on, it will eat the fuel like it is at a buffet during maneuvers. It feels like loosening up its accuracy tolerances would help.

Me, I get a proper thrill out of seeing my complex and comprehensive designs function the way I intended and be able to handle a wide range of contingency situations. I like that I can engineer in a reasonable margin of error, and that I actually get the chance to make use of said margin.
