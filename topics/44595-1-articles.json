I had the two parts pushed together and aligned as best I could. However, when I attempted to weld them I got the message, failure: the parts are too far apart. Since they are pressing against one another as hard as they can I don\u0027t know what to make of this. The parts are the aisle module from the large structural parts pack and the large 2.5m battery from KSPX. I wonder if there is something about the collision meshes of these two parts that makes them not want to behave? Any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MjROqFH.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022MjROqFH.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T13:13:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis question would be better asked in the mod\u0027s thread, not here.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wbcundiff","CreatedById":59031,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-01T13:36:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was not aware this was a stock only thread.
