Also, use whatever fuel you have left to decelerate before hitting the re-entry interface...lower speeds = less friction, and less mass = less intertia, which means drag should slow you down quicker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Redwizard000","CreatedById":107736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:39:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was having the exact same problem.
