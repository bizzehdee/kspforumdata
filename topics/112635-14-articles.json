Because an adaptor would be good right about now actually with what I\u0027m doing.\n\u003E How do I make the yacht (or maybe cargo) command pods be able to be placed as the first part? I\u0027m just trying to get around the tweakscale bug where root parts resize back to normal. I\u0027ll just figure something out I guess.\n\nThe adapter should be in the 0.1.4 release under structural and is named, clipper deck adapter. It\u0027s icon looks like a solid white square. The easy way to find Maritime Pack parts now is to click the black arrow in the upper left corner of the SPH screen and at the bottom of the left hand column of filter icons, you\u0027ll see one for the Maritime Pack. Hover over it with the mouse and you\u0027ll see a hint pop up. Click on the structural and it should be the top right icon.\n\nAs far as the root part for tweaking. That is a bug I\u0027ve probably encountered at some point but didn\u0027t realize it was a bug. In order to place a bridge as a root part you\u0027ll need to edit the .cfg file for each bridge. You\u0027ll need to make this change:\n\nChange this line: attachRules = 1,1,0,1,1\n\nto this: attachRules = 1,0,1,1,0\n\nFor whatever reason, squad doesn\u0027t allow command modules to surface attach to things. In order to be a root part, things have to connect via a node. Because a ships bridge should be able to fit anywhere on the hull, I made all of the bridges surface attach, which means, they can\u0027t be the root part. The paddlewheeler wheelhouse for example... if you wanted to put it on top of the Texas parts, you have no choice but to surface attach. There are no nodes on top of either Texas part.\n\nOnce you make that change, the bridge parts will ONLY be able to connect via a node though.\n\nLet me know how that works out with tweakscale.\n\nBTW, doesn\u0027t changing the root part in the SPH get around this bug or does tweakscale always assume it\u0027s the first part placed?\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E =\\\n\u003E Had to do major rennovations on my ship as you changed most of the hull pieces I was using....\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about spinny thing on my mast... My ship already has a radar scanner on it\u0027s mast, and it is spinning!!! =P (LLL).

I switched to LLL when B9 became so massive I didn\u0027t have the ram for it. Even did a ground circumnavigation of Eve using his hull parts as the base of my rover.\n\nMy radar will be like his, but much more maritime. While his sorta represents a radar, it looked too blocky to me. That and mine has my coolish name stenciled on it... ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-28T16:46:53Z","Content":"As far as tweakscale goes, I tried using it on Laythe and it was having issues with buoyancy (if Laythes water is saturated with salts shouldn\u0027t it be denser than Kerbins seawater?
