Once I got back up to a 5km circular orbit, I found that there was no way to get home save my (incredibly inept) manual piloting skills. Unfortunately, the trans section under orbital operation does not have a way to get me back home that I can see. Am I missing something? I managed to make a blind guess and get myself into an elliptical orbit that intercepted Kerbin, unfortunately I intercepted it at about 700 m/s, and my chutes failed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is the best way (using mechjeb) to get from munar orbit to a stable orbit over Kerbin?

Mechjeb does it at a high altitude , when the spacecraft is moving much slower, and thus the fuel cost to change inclination is lower (generally halfway to two-thirds of the way there, in my expeirience, I presume it\u0027s actually doing the math for minimal fuel costs.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After all, you don\u0027t have to match Minmus\u0027 orbital inclination to reach Minmus, you only have to go through Minmus\u0027 orbital plane at the place and time when Minmus is nearby.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to return from the Mun just using Mechjeb, get into orbit, then use its Orbital Operations panel to raise your apoapsis to a point higher than the radius of the Mun\u0027s SOI (2200km or so.) That will get you out of the Mun\u0027s SOI, and allow you to then land on Kerbin. It\u0027s not the most efficient way to return from the Mun, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA very efficient way involves burning directly from the Mun\u0027s surface (or very low Munar Orbit) into an orbital path that is hyperbolic, and puts you at or near the center of the trailing edge of the SOI moving fast enough to cancel most of the Mun\u0027s 545 m/s of velocity. If you\u0027re in orbit of Kerbin at 11400km altitude, and moving slower than 176 m/s in any direction, your orbit will intersect Kerbin, as shown in this video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2YDQvwawbg?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"togfox","CreatedById":17083,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T09:58:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the mun, flight straight up till you reach 700m/s then cut engines.
