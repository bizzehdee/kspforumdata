Before then I used to be great at rockets, after FAR it became great at planes. Now my problem is rockets seems way harder than planes now and most of the time my rockets just fall apart because of \u0022Aerodynamic failures\u0022 because it spins out. I also use mechjeb wich the default ascent path is for stock aero only, I know that so I fly manually. But isnt\u0027t there a ascent path for mechjeb that will just fly my rocket without FAR issues?
