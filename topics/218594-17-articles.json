I think that gameplay is more important than those two right now. While we\u0027re talking about the fundamental elements of the game, I think KSP2 just as bad as KSP1. You name \u0022non-impulsive maneuvers\u0022 and \u0022persistent thrust,\u0022 as improvements over KSP1, but you neglect the fact that the code base is every bit as dysfunctional, unintuitive, buggy, and unoptimized as KSP1 ever was. You could have all the delta v calculators, transfer wimdow planners,\u00A0 innovative new systems you want but that won\u0027t make the game any better if you don\u0027t have features. If you have veteran KSP1 players struggling, then how will the newbies fare? Also you and I have very different definitions of functional, as is somewhat inevitable, but it\u0027s interesting that you claim that KSP1 is overpriced but KSP2 is not. It\u0027ll be worth $50 when it reaches 1.0, and that version will be worth $60. You accuse me of having a sentimental attitude towards KSP1, while you completely ignore your own bias in the opposite direction.
