Each ship design is affected differently by the same air so there\u0027s no way to predict the outcome. Trial-and-error in each individual case (via F5/F9) is the only way to find out. But in general, all altiudes used 1.0.4 are SIGNIFICANTLY higher than they were before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, aeroBRAKING and aeroCAPTURING are different things. The former is when you already have a closed orbit (such as when returning to Kerbin from Mun), the latter is when you don\u0027t (first arriving at another planet after an interplanetary trip). The former USUALLY involves much less speed (unless your Ap is way out near the SOI boundary) so is relatively survivable although the ridiculously steep (essentially vertical) atmosphere density cutoffs everywhere but Kerbin mean still can\u0027t go very low so it takes many tedious orbits to do you much good. The latter always involves about the highest possible speeds and, in 1.0.4 with 100% reentry heat, is quite problematic to do at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you insist on using 100% reentry heat, then you have basically 2 options for interplanetary aerocaptures (at least at Eve and Jool--Duna\u0027s not much of a problem and Kerbin is somewhere in between):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Build some ridiculous heat shield on your ship and accept that no ship can aerocapture more than once, so no more reusable tugs cycling between the planets and Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Don\u0027t touch significant atmospheres at interplanetary speed. This necessarily involves bringing a lot more fuel and enough TWR to use it in the time available, regardless of whether you capture (and lower your Ap significantly) via thrust alone or manage to gravity brake off a large moon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve doesn\u0027t have a large moon so there, you\u0027re pretty much stuck with lots more fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, you can just turn reentry heat down to a reasonably level. The system is clearly quite broken at present. Only Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere gradually fades to nothing over a long distance. All the others, although they do technically fade away, drop off so quickly they they\u0027re effectively oceans rather than gaseous envelopes. That\u0027s just wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut right now, no matter what you do, you\u0027ll never like how the system works everywhere in the game. Making Kerbin a challenge totally eliminates the ability to aerocapture at other planets without designing the ship around some monster heat shield. OTOH, making aerocapture survivable at Jool and Eve (say with a 20% heat setting) makes reentry everywhere else such a doddle you probably won\u0027t even need heat shields there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, that\u0027s what you get with a broken system.

Because of a broken game system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s broken IMHO isn\u0027t so much how heat or even aero stuff works in KSP (although both could obviously use tweaks), it\u0027s how the atmospheres of other planets are structured more like liquids than gases, due to their lack of thin, upper layers. This is not a realistic situation and it rather undercuts the realism of having a reentry system at all. And if the situation is unrealistic, then designing ships and mission profiles to deal with it is also unrealistic. Sure, it can be done if you\u0027re willing to go that way, but I think that\u0027s just making a bad situation worse, so I prefer to just dial down the heat and hope Squad addresses this in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T16:03:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you send flotillas without binding them together into a single transport, you are complaining about a problem you\u0027ve created yourself.

Again, if this kind of costs is an issue to you, your gameplay style bears some serious problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, 1.0.3 broke the atmospheres of other planets leaving them with a sharp cut-off instead of the thin layer. It requires more planning and more cautious gameplay. What you used to achieve by descent to altitudes where density would be optimal, now you achieve by timing your presence in atmosphere precisely. With periapsis 2km below the upper border you\u0027re maybe 30 seconds in the atmosphere and it\u0027s too short to be damaged. It makes the game less realistic, but not unplayable - just more challenging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, the only time I ever burned up in the atmosphere was when I pushed the throttle to the max in my SSTO plane while in a level flight 2km above Kerbin on my way to KSC (70km away).
