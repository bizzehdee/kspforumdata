I recently got into the technical challenge of designing MK2 SSTO\u0027s. I had great success with one of my early designs. I tweaked it to my best ability to be as efficient and useful as I can make it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then I\u0027ve tried making different designs but they don\u0027t seem to come close to what my first SSTO accomplished. A logical person would just use the one that works, but I prefer to experiment since I\u0027m still very much learning. I\u0027m toying with less weight, engines, intakes, drag, and fuel but it seems like everything I try falls short. (Very short.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can just about guarantee there\u0027s another thread with the info I\u0027m looking for, but I am very lazy/at work supposed to be doing stuff, so instead I\u0027m using my short amount of free time to simply ask for help. (And let\u0027s face it; everybody in this community loves to jump on a new thread and give that oh-so-satisfying answer before anybody else can, and I think there will be different answers coming from people that have different building styles too, which I\u0027m looking forward to!)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want some recipes for my SSTO cookbook.

Of course those were in the pre-1.0 days so I couldn\u0027t tell you if those figures are still good or not. Really, control surfaces are all about how far away they are from the Center of Mass and how big they are (i.e. how much leverage you can get from them). Pitch is the one that has generally given me trouble - ideally your elevators are not in-line with the main wing. If they are (say, with a tail-less delta design), that\u0027s the time to also consider a set of canards - ugly or not. And don\u0027t overlook the utility of SAS units - A) at some point your plane becomes a rocket and you still have to be able to turn the thing, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E anything that can take stress of your control surfaces is generally a good thing.

Avoid the bush plane gear for spaceplanes; they work okay for low-speed surveyor planes close to KSC though, and they can be used to good effect for low-tech jet-powered \u0022rovers\u0022. Rear gear should be set for full braking torque and steering disengaged if possible; front gear should be steering engaged, brakes disabled. The heavier the plane, the larger the gear you\u0027re going to want. Don\u0027t be afraid to add more rear gear. If you have a problem with tail strikes, consider a set of \u0022kickers\u0022 right at the tail; it\u0027s kinda cheatsy, but if it saves your plane, well......\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T17:02:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVal:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou really know your stuff.

If I\u0027m sticking them in Cargo Bays, I try my best to leave the sides of the bay clear - the front and back ends of the bay make great mount points for fore-and-aft (i.e. prograde-and-retrograde) firing RCS ports, something a lot of good plane designs lack. They only work if their thrust doesn\u0027t hit other part of the plane, of course. Speaking of RCS - if you ever need RCS control for a plane (say, you\u0027re building a passenger or fuel ferry and need to be able to dock the thing), stick to the linear ports (the kind that only fire in one direction); use blocks sparingly, if at all. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RCS Build Aid mod is worth its coder\u0027s weight in gold bricks - even if you don\u0027t use it to help you build a balanced craft that doesn\u0027t exhibit unwanted torque from RCS thrusters, it\u0027s useful for seeing how far/in what direction your CoM shifts as you fly (see my first post for the importance of that particular phenomenon).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T19:11:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA general set of values to start from might be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Rapier per 20 tonnes of spaceplane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 Shock Cone per Rapier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 lift per 20 tonnes of spaceplane (many excellent builders use much less)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 tonnes of excess fuel/cargo/passenger compartments\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 command pod\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elanding gear\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe rest of the weight is fuel for your ship - I like to start with the tanks full of liquid and half-full of ox and tweak from there\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eadd control surfaces, airbrakes, batteries, solar panels, and reaction wheels to taste\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: Oh yeah, Drag is King!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-22T19:55:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2015 07:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eforgot intakes!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nothalogh","CreatedById":139345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-22T21:00:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JHadden123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JHadden123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyour plane is like a fat figure skater; graceful and large.
