I\u0027m a big fan of sending unmanned probes, but now that each science module can only be used once, I\u0027d have to attach 10 materials bays and 10 goo canisters to hit all the biomes I pass through. This makes my probe the size of a house, and defeats the purpose of sending unmanned missions in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there something I\u0027m missing about the new system? Or or there modded parts out there that make the materials bay and goo cans tiny, so I can strap a bunch on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know how to use the new science lab, but that only applies to return missions.

You can send up like 6 probes with a single launch. The other option is to have space stations with a science module and then to dock the probes there to reset the modules. What i did is to place a basic manned space station where ever i want science. Then you can send a ship out to the stations to take the science back to Kerbin. It is a lengthy process but that was the propose of the last update to give you more play time i guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the new system, it forces you to think, and forces you not to be lazy and take the easy way out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(hope it makes sense)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Panzerbeard","CreatedById":66380,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-19T10:12:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ziogatto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ziogatto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think you should give up on sending probes with those kinda experiments and isntead send probes with very light experiment modules like the temperature etc...\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s actually how I did it in .22, you will have to send a manned mission there for the EVA reports and surface samples anyway, so theres no point in weighing down your probes with the heavy science equipment.
