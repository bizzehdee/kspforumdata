I\u0027d got to the point in career mode where I\u0027d unlocked docking ports and was excited about the prospect of starting to use the more fuel efficient, elegant and realistic feeling \u0027lander \u002B command module \u002B service module\u0027 (a.k.a. Apollo-like) approach for missions to the Mun and beyond but realised that without a way to transfer the science gathered on the surface from the lander to the command module for return to Kerbin I\u0027d be missing out on some of the science return if I did. Currently if you want maximum science all your landers, or at least their pods, need to be capable of return, re-entry and soft landing on Kerbin which pushes you into using ship and mission designs that just look and feel wrong, at least to me, e.g. Mun landers with parachutes, flimsy lander pods being used for re-entry, etc, etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the reasons that I like KSP so much is that it manages to combine being fun and accessible with enough realism to be engaging and satisfying. Generally speaking the approaches that work well in real life work well in KSP (and vice versa) because much the same underlying principles are at work, and for me that contributes significantly to the immersivity of the game. Here though is an example of the game mechanics (or rather the absence of a particular mechanism) pushing the player away from works best in real life and that does irk me a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis all relates to the more general issue of the side effects of the perfectly logical science bonus you get for returning samples and specimens to Kerbin instead of just transmitting results. With an incentive to bring lander pods, goo containers and science bays back to the surface of Kerbin it pushes players into hitting the atmosphere with increasingly bulky, lumpy and implausible looking return vehicles instead of the traditional and far more believable command pod \u002B parachute(s). Aesthetics and realism issues aside (which I accept don\u0027t matter to everyone, and should take second priority to gameplay considerations) if this becomes standard practice it\u0027s going to be even more difficult for Squad to introduce either re-entry heating or more realistic aerodynamics without massive upheavals to game balance, and I think both are still official Planned Features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lexar","CreatedById":88540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-18T08:52:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYES!
