A cat could fit in a one man pod so Kerbal Steve, a close relative to Scuba Steve, wouldn\u0027t go crazy from boredom while he\u0027s aimlessly drifting and waiting to do the orbital burn around Duna in another year. It could lead to some pretty cruel \u0022experiments\u0022 where you expose Bubbles the monkey to the vacuum of space to see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother \u0022fun\u0022 idea I had would be random animals and random animal attacks on Kerbal.

Maybe one day there\u0027ll be a races and gender type framework to work off of to make animals and whatnot.

It could be added to career or science modes similar to hunting in Rea Dead Redemption, only you get science by studying animals instead of killing them for fur and food...or running if you .... off a bear, wolf, or tiger and losing reputation if they catch you or you disturb them. That\u0027ll cause them to flee or change their normal behavior leading to not gathering enough science to fulfill the contract. Or the contract could be to poke a badger with a stick just to see what happens. Do you build a rover that pokes stuff with sticks or just say screw it and airlift Joe down to the tundra?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could have whales on the Mun for crying out loud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Aren\u0027t many times I get to reference Futurama, KSP, and SG1 in the same sentence)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T04:11:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERocket simulator turned Safari simulator?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
