As it turns out, Steam likes to meddle with KSP\u0027s files and while this is usually fine with stock KSP, if you add mods into the equation then there\u0027s a good chance something will get corrupted causing a huge list of exceptions in the logs, errors on the screen and a KSP that either doesn\u0027t load at all, crashes immediately or runs but is clearly broken. It used to be much worse when the game was getting updates as each update brought with it a significant risk of corrupting the mods (not to mention major updates breaking mods entirely) but that\u0027s less of a problem now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe solution to this problem is very simple: \u003Cu\u003Ejust make a copy of KSP and put the mods in that instead\u003C/u\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Right click KSP in Steam library \u0026gt; browse local files.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Copy KSP/saves/\u0026lt;your save name\u0026gt; and paste that on the desktop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 If you used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to install your mods (and you should!), click File \u0026gt; export modpack and save that to your desktop too.
