It\u0027ll get to a point where it isn\u0027t increasing the shaking anymore, but its like swinging 45 degrees from one side to the other at that point. Anyone know why this is happening, and how to fix it?\n\nI am not using FAR, nor DRE (Both seems very buggy atm)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T15:08:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 03:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sokar408**"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T23:48:37Z","Content":"They did something to the control parameters for SAS in 1.0, not sure exactly what.\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that the problems seem to pop up if you have \u0022too much\u0022 SAS torque authority.\n\nFor example, my standard craft for rescuing a kerbal from LKO is a Mk1 command pod with a hex probe core perched on top (so I can launch it unmanned). For reentry, it ditches tank \u002B engine, so it\u0027s basically just the pod, probe core, and chute coming down.\n\nThe command pod has 5 units of torque, which appears to be way too much for 1.0 SAS, I get weird effects. But if I disable the command pod\u0027s torque and just use the probe core\u0027s (which is only 0.5) then it\u0027s fine.\n\nI really wish they\u0027d make reaction wheel torque tweakable, like they did for engine gimbal in 1.0.
