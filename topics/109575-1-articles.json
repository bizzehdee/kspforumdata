For reentry, it ditches tank \u002B engine, so it\u0027s basically just the pod, probe core, and chute coming down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe command pod has 5 units of torque, which appears to be way too much for 1.0 SAS, I get weird effects. But if I disable the command pod\u0027s torque and just use the probe core\u0027s (which is only 0.5) then it\u0027s fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really wish they\u0027d make reaction wheel torque tweakable, like they did for engine gimbal in 1.0.
