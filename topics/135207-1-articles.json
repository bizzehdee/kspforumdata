There is no storyline, and I cannot do obvious side-missions because cash is not paid out until after I finish a mission\u00A0(at which point I don\u0027t need the money anymore).\u00A0As I compared my missions to those of NASA, I suddenly got an idea that I think could drastically improve the fun of career mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, KSP contracts are given in accordance with where the player is holding exploration-wise and part-wise. They\u00A0have a modest advance payment (mostly cash, sometimes reputation) and a substantial reward (mostly cash, some rep, and sometimes a little or a lot of science) upon completion. There is also a penalty which approximately retracts the advance, while giving negative reputation. Part-testing makes the part available as long as the contract is active. Unintended achievements give rewards too. The most important milestones do not have a deadline.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, real-life NASA missions usually go like this: NASA is paid a very large amount to achieve far\u00A0unprecedented exploration, and for which the technology (parts)\u00A0does not exist. There is no reward for completion other than reputation. And the penalty for non-completion of a project\u00A0(i.e. congress cancels it) is just retraction of the funds set aside for it. A new part has to be developed before it can be used. Unintended achievements (like \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_spots_on_Ceres\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eanomalies\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0or\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emission extensions\u003C/a\u003E)\u00A0are in the news (i.e. reputation and possibly science), but do not result in substantial\u00A0payouts (only maintenance expenses covered). The most important milestones \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehave a very short deadline\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI therefore propose a mod that results in the user being given long term goals early on, e.g. \u003Cem\u003EEVA in low Kerbin orbit\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EPlant a flag on the Mun\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EOrbit Jool\u003C/em\u003E,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003ETest\u00A0RoveMax Model S2 on the surface of Duna\u003C/em\u003E, \u003Cem\u003EPlace a satelite in\u00A0synchronous\u00A0orbit above the Duna face\u003C/em\u003E, etc. The player then has to use the given money to reach the goal by proper resource management: He or she will need to decide on spending money on development\u00A0(i.e. unlocking parts), upgrading KSC, or on side-missions (that he/she will have to decide on)\u00A0to gather enough science to unlock the tech tree for the desired part(s). All this in order to complete the accepted mission before the deadline.\u00A0There will be no steady cash flow from completing trivial missions, only from accepting additional long term goals \u2013 which all bring new deadlines. Failure has a severe reputation penalty, and most importantly the retraction of the full advance amount. So if the player has already spent the money, it may cause bankruptcy. Non-contract achievements (world-firsts etc.) only pay science and/or reputation, but no cash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts? Comments?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
