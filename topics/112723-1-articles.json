The modeling bit I\u0027ve got down fairly well. The unwrapping bit is what I\u0027m having trouble with. \n\nFor my first part, I\u0027m making a Multipurpose Logistics Module (MPLM). Seems like a simple enough shape to not be too difficult. \n\nFirst attempt: \n\n![V9XN6Pt.png](http://i.imgur.com/V9XN6Pt.png)\n\n![QhfQs5h.png](http://i.imgur.com/QhfQs5h.png)\n\nDidn\u0027t like it at all. I\u0027m not great at texturing at all, so I\u0027d like the UV map to do a lot of the work for me.\n\nSecond attempt: \n\n![W2y7S6Xl.png](http://i.imgur.com/W2y7S6Xl.png)\n\n![IpblaYxl.png](http://i.imgur.com/IpblaYxl.png)\n\nAs you can see from the image below, I\u0027d like the inside faces in blue, to be one color, and the outside faces in green to be another color. \n\n![LLbtthQl.png](http://i.imgur.com/LLbtthQl.png)\n\n![JdNiyq7l.png](http://i.imgur.com/JdNiyq7l.png)\n\nThe idea is to have tiny little pieces I can stack on top of each other to make the UV footprint really tiny. For now though, I want to unwrap the entire thing so it looks like a big fishing net almost. \n\n![RCXLTPvl.png](http://i.imgur.com/RCXLTPvl.png)\n\nAaaaand, Ignore the circle segments, those I\u0027ve already been able to map effectively. I\u0027ve been able to reduce the large circles to small segments I can stack up. The problem is that tangled mess in the bottom left. I can\u0027t get it to unwrap properly. \n\n![DZhwQT9l.png](http://i.imgur.com/DZhwQT9l.png)\n\n![P0OFniNl.png](http://i.imgur.com/P0OFniNl.png)\n\nAnyone have any ideas on how to unwrap this thing? It\u0027s been driving me crazy for days.\n\nIf anyone wants to play around with it, here is the Wings3D file. [https://www.dropbox.com/s/6wybq80ppxpnctl/Leonardo%20MPLM.wings?dl=1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6wybq80ppxpnctl/Leonardo%20MPLM.wings?dl=1)\n\nIf someone wants to unwrap this thing, and then show me how they did it, that\u0027d also be super helpful.\n\nCheers. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T02:56:57Z","Content":"I don\u0027t use Wings3D myself, but in Blender, there is the feature to mark certain edges as seams, which tells the software to split the corresponding groups of faces up into more sensible UV islands.\n\nSee if Wings3D has a similar feature."},{"CreatedByName":"landeTLS","CreatedById":97925,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T09:00:13Z","Content":"myself i would probaby use normals to make those indents on the side but assuming you wanna keep them you have an issue in the uv seams setup where the \u0022frame\u0022 around them is connecting at the start and the end, you can see this in the uvmap(lower left).make a single seam down the vertical line and it should unwrap more evenly. see [http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=94010](http://www.polycount.com/forum/showthread.php?t=94010) you can still keep the frame uv island seperate from the indents if you want them to overlap etc.\n\nalso its hard to see in the pics but did you camfer all those tiny corners of the indents?, if so then that is completly unnecessary. \n\nanother potential issue is that the intersection of the frames are not made of quads, not that all quads are required for lowpoly but you could get mesh/texture artifacts if the ngons in those areas gets triangulated unfavorably inside unity. Most 3d modeling software auto unwrappers also appears to favor intersections made of quads. The straight sections in between can use ngons. But if they curve then youll get shading artifacts.\n\nhope this helps\n\ni was going to open your model in 3dsmax and take a look at it but max does not support the wings3d format.\n\nUpdate: improved my explanation a little bit.

I plan to add two CBM halves, and possibly a PMA. The exercise here is to make the MPLM/PMM take up as little room as possible.

By reusing small bits of the texture like that, you can use the space very efficiently. If you have multiple parts that can benefit from the same texture, you can squeeze a lot in there. I did this with Fuel Tanks Plus and SpaceY. For instance, in FTP, I have only one 1024x1024 texture image per tank *diameter* (one for all of the 1.25m tanks, one for all of the 2.5m, etc)."},{"CreatedByName":"curtquarquesso","CreatedById":42872,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T04:12:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yep, that\u0027s the sort of thing I do.

In your newest pic it looks much better. \n\nRegarding \u0022shininess\u0022, in unity you set a material with a specular shader like ksp/specular (?

The alpha channel will determine the how reflective it is at any given spot on the texture. \n\nIt will have a \u0022shininess\u0022 slider, which really only just controls the width of the reflective sheen. A \u0022higher\u0022 sheen (to the right with the slider) will make a narrow reflection (like highly glossy paint), and a \u0022lower\u0022 value here will make the reflections wide, like something with a more \u0022satin\u0022 finish to it. The \u0022Specular Color\u0022 will let you choose how bright the reflection is. It defaults to a medium grey, but you can make it much more reflective by shifting this toward white. Most of my parts are between the default 50% grey, and maybe a 75% grey. I usually only push it really close to white if it\u0027s supposed to be metallic."},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T18:29:24Z","Content":"Wow!
