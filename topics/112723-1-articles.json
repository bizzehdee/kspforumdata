I cheated this on my parts by adding the hatch collider where I would normally attach a docking port. Though I can still manage to eva from the part, as they just clip through everything until they are outside (it violently ejects them in space, and mildly when landed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise you would need to make that crew transfer plugin a dependency for your part if you dont want to add the hatch collider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022curtquarquesso\u0022 data-cite=\u0022curtquarquesso\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt what point is it normal to start a dev thread for a part mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epeople start whenever, be it with only concept sketches/models, or with functioning parts usable in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmallFatFetus","CreatedById":137860,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T15:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGo for a dev thread, that subforum is much more active and more people will see/download this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
