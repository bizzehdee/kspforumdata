The cage should be large enough to fit several Kerbals and be open on one end, and have a door into a capsule INSIDE the cage somewhere. You could even build the cage around a capsule. Put ladders on the insides of the cage walls, and make it (test on the ground) so you can get back to the capsule entrance from any of the ladders. It\u0027d help to get RCS too but it\u0027s not 100% necessary. This is the hardest part because you have to research all of these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the launch pad, make sure the capsule Jeb will be going in is empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunc and maneuver your ship so Jeb goes into your box/cage.
