Fuel tankers and transfer stages are essentially the same: fuel tanks, nuclear engines, and a docking port. Because kethane containers weight less than fuel tanks and the conversion process creates mass from nothing, it\u0027s better to store kethane as kethane and convert it only when needed. Given that the kethane miner also needs engines, fuel tanks, and kethane tanks, and you already have those in the tanker/transfer stage, it\u0027s better to add landing struts to that ship, instead of using a separate lander with a lot of duplicate parts.\u003Cp\u003EBy making my kethane infrastructure simpler, I also made it more efficient and faster to use, until I had combined everything into a single class of ships. That\u0027s what I call successful engineering.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m more concerned about the big refinery that doesn\u0027t run out of supplies myself. Everything runs out of supplies sooner or later, and usually it happens sooner rather than later. Also, making things to require less maintenance usually makes them bigger, heavier, more expensive, and less efficient, which are all rather bad attributes when space travel is concerned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea was that the small refinery unit is something you might include in a lander to produce the fuel for the return trip, saving you a lot of mass. If the refinery stops working after producing enough fuel, with a reasonable margin of error, nobody cares. The big refinery is supposed to big enough that you\u0027ll actually want to build infrastructure for faraway colonies, instead of carrying small converters with almost every ship just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhh, I\u0027ve had Kethane installed for the past few months, but didn\u0027t realize some of those points (like that it creates mass from nothing, for instance- which honestly sounds like the biggest problem to me. Fix that so that mass is conserved, and the fuel tanks are just as heavy for their storage-capacity, and players will actually have motivation to create separate refineries, either as immobile orbital stations or on the surface, that don\u0027t move with the rest of their mission...) as I haven\u0027t actually used it at all yet except for a brief stint with a Munar scanning satellite...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-31T03:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a tiny mass excess though, 3% at most (for making fuel with the large converter).
