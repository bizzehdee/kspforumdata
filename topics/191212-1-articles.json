It has to take more than one second in real time to process one second\u0027s worth of in-game time. This makes your simulation appear to run in slow motion. Every experienced player gets this a few times in every game, especially for a yellow clock. Occasional yellow clocks are normal and shouldn\u0027t be a concern unless it\u0027s running in the red frequently and causing the game to be unplayable for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnless you are using certain mods the CPU is the main bottleneck - especially when using high part counts, during moments of extreme physical stress on the craft (like explosions, atmospheric shock, or decoupling several parts at once), and when using physics time warp. Accelerating physics time warp in atmosphere will almost always cause the clock to turn yellow or red.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe graphics card of your computer isn\u0027t really being used to simulate the physical interactions of parts in your ship, and the game has been balanced so that you\u0027ll usually have graphics options that don\u0027t slow down a computer too much.
