I believe you can add multiple sub shaders with different tags, and add multiple tags to a subshader, but don\u0027t quote me on that :)[/QUOTE]  \n\nTesting this now.  \n\n[quote name=\u0027selfish\\_meme\u0027]Some more shots for you, I have not had any of the artifacts the others reported, using 0.0191 with artifacts.zip on OpenGL Nvidia Linux, but I have seen this before with scatterer and SVE cruising through the cloud base back to the KSC, I have a video of moving through the cloud base, they look like texture edges to me that are not faded out completely. i also tried Loaddelay like you said but it still seems a lot slower than previously.  \n\n[URL]http://i.imgur.com/VyMmGsP.png[/URL]  \n\nOther direction no artifacts visible  \n\n[URL]http://i.imgur.com/y4ATuC6.png[/URL]  \n\nYes the edges definitely move with the clouds[/QUOTE]  \n\n[quote name=\u0027Manwith Noname\u0027]In terms of playing the game, I\u0027ll revert to 0.0191 with the files in Fix3.zip. When combined with EVE this works wonders for me. I\u0027m mostly a sandbox dabbler so this has just been some interesting testing for me and hopefully useful to yourself and rBray. Happy to test anything out.  \n\nEdit:  \n\nYeah, the last zip file with the replacement .dll and shaders.  \n\nAnother edit: This one...  \n\n[url]https://mega.nz/#!CAZ2xJTT!RFzP6vX8o55ktRZz6-L4D32fnIRbZ\\_fU2eLaXO931fk[/url][/QUOTE]  \n\nTry this:  \n\n[url]https://mega.nz/#!ad5QXQKS!fbAn2AMTNT8eUFffR7xJmrHO-4E39EoGCCdFEJhRw74[/url]"},{"CreatedByName":"Manwith Noname","CreatedById":117203,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-19T00:57:22Z","Content":"[quote name=\u0027blackrack\u0027]Try this:  \n\n[URL]https://mega.nz/#!ad5QXQKS!fbAn2AMTNT8eUFffR7xJmrHO-4E39EoGCCdFEJhRw74[/URL][/QUOTE]  \n\nParticles are good but....  \n\n[URL]http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=557917762[/URL]  \n\nI\u0027ll throw EVE back in and report if the blue rectangles appear.
