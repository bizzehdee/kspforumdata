That\u0027s usually just enough to get me into orbit with some wiggle room in case I botch my ascent profile - which probably happens more often than it should. Based on these numbers, your plane has got 1,581.59 m/s of delta-V, about 220 short. So yes, that\u0027ll get you sub-orbital; you need just a little more to make the final transition to orbit. Your options - either add another four tonnes worth of LF\u002BO (the equivalent of an FL-T800) or use a different rocket with a vacuum Isp of no less than 335. Myself, I\u0027d shoot for the higher Isp rocket; it\u0027s generally easier to swap out an engine for one that\u0027s more efficient. And by easier I mean that it usually causes less of a change to your overall drag profile. Of course, your options would be quite limited if you\u0027re picking between stock rockets...Terriers, Poodles, Nervs, Rhinos and Aerospikes are the only stock rockets with a vacuum Isp that high, and the ones that are the same size as the one you\u0027ve got aren\u0027t renowned for their overall levels of thrust (the Aerospike, maybe - but it still only gives 175 kN of thrust and it doesn\u0027t gimbal, two big downgripes). I don\u0027t know if B9 would have another option available or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T01:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDucted area ruling for engines is pretty awesome.
