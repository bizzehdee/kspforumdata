Are you trying to use wings as radiators? Attach the engines to larger parts instead. Either Mk2 or MK3 tanks or MK1 jet fuels radially mounted on MK3 tanks. I went to the Mun and landed there with nukes with such a setup, but I had a heatshield beneath the MK3 which was, I guess, absorbing the heat. And if you\u0027re using so many nukes, get the MRS mod and use its quad nuke engine mounted on short MK3 fuel tanks. You\u0027ll save in part count and you\u0027ll be spreading the heat over a larger tank.\n\nThe nukes aren\u0027t broken. Same as the aero system, people need to relearn how to use them."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T00:24:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022Rockets flip over, no stability, etc. in 1.0.2\u0022\n\u003E \u0022Way over 4000 dV to orbit in 1.0.2\u0022\n\nYou are looking for a logical reason.
