Just consider the Mk1 Pod has a built-in heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the memory leak, that, I agree, is pretty bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENah, nothing needs a heat shield. Test it. It\u0027s broken. I\u0027m not advocating for 1.0 aero... but, 1.0.2 is too tweaked in the .90 direction. We need a happy medium in between 1.0 and 1.0.2\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T07:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ShadowZone\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ShadowZone\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022Rockets flip over, no stability, etc. in 1.0.2\u0022\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Way over 4000 dV to orbit in 1.0.2\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I present the Ozymandias II, my long range interplanetary exploration vehicle. It weighs 242 tons and sits on top of the second stage of this launcher vehicle. It took me about 3900 dV to get it into a 70/70 orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding flight profile: Just stay \u0022above\u0022 the prograde vector, keep your TWR at around 1.5 (you would need KER for that, otherwise just throttle down after every significant turn) until you stage and then crank it up full throttle for orbit. I had to correct a little, yes, but it was okay. Not any harder than in 0.90 or in 1.0 - just a little different.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I did NOT like however was that my LV-N cluster blew up after about 3 minutes at full throttle.
