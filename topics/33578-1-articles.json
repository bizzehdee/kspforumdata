If you go the stock route, you\u0027ll need a probe core for the command module and RCS and/or a high-efficiency/low-thrust engine like an LV-909 or Poodle to rendezvous, eight radial chutes and a hitchhiker. You don\u0027t need a lot for an orbital rescue boat. I\u0027ve never worked with the Crew Manifest Mod; from what I understand, though, it\u0027ll empty your pods out without all that mucking about with fun stuff such as \u0022rescue missions\u0022 and \u0022more opportunities for unplanned vehicular disassemblies\u0022 and such.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
