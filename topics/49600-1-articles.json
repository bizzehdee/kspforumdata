I am however able to create a single part sub-assembly, but for some reason cannot save multiple part subs. And then, I saved my single part SNAFU in the spaceplane hangar, then went to the VAB to attach it for kicks, yet it was not available, as if I had no sub-assembly parts.

It is hard to line up, BUT, I Have done it, so it seems, and the entire craft gets deleted as if it were a part being dragged into the pane. Lost for good, there is no recycle bin to retrieve it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried again with just on part, a capsule, it worked. SO I added a second part to the capsule, and drug it in and get an error, something like \u0022this part is not available to be saved as a sub-assembly\u0022 or something like that. So, I stopped there in hopes someone had a tutorial for .22, NADA. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"glibbo","CreatedById":73642,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-20T10:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, for what it\u0027s worth I had a dabble and encountered a similar thing, what I found was to make each assembly so that it would accept another one, I had a mid section which I had to remove the engine so it would load in and then I added the engine before assembly, hope this helps?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
