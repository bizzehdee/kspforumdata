I landed and so did the debris. I saw it land (I\u0027m not crazy:sticktongue:) and so I recovered my main capsule. I went straight to the Tracking Station only to find that the debris wasn\u0027t there in the middle of KSC where it landed.

I thought they had turned it off, but perhaps not. It might be that stuff around KSC needs a probe core to keep from being auto-cleaned. The other thing to check is your settings, and make sure that the Persistent Debris is set to something other than 0 (though I\u0027m guessing you know that one). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think putting a new craft on the launchpad/runway initiates something like a clean-up duty, but I never tested the radius.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
