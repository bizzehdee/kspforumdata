I landed and so did the debris. I saw it land (I\u0027m not crazy:sticktongue:) and so I recovered my main capsule. I went straight to the Tracking Station only to find that the debris wasn\u0027t there in the middle of KSC where it landed. I know it\u0027s a small saving you make, but it makes a big difference in the long run.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T14:56:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 02:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by One-Way Films**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T07:23:47Z","Content":"Debris used to auto-recover around KSC. I thought they had turned it off, but perhaps not. It might be that stuff around KSC needs a probe core to keep from being auto-cleaned. The other thing to check is your settings, and make sure that the Persistent Debris is set to something other than 0 (though I\u0027m guessing you know that one). ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:49:14Z","Content":"I think putting a new craft on the launchpad/runway initiates something like a clean-up duty, but I never tested the radius."}]}
