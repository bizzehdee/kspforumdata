It was quite entertaining, however they stopped the series because multiplayer technology of the time was not very stable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jsfxo-nfAHM?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I haven\u0027t exactly checked, but now that it is seven years later, I\u0027m guessing the multiplayer mods have improved somewhat. I\u0027m looking to make something similar to that series, having 3-5 KSP YouTubers hang out and complete KSP challenges, with each episode being under an hour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are a small YouTuber and want to participate, please let me know! The goal is to make this a weekly thing, maybe with a varying cast depending on who can make it that week if there is enough interest. I\u0027m not going to put hard upper or lower bounds on what a \u0022small\u0022 YouTuber is, but basically as long as you have a decent mic, KSP experience, and a YouTube channel, you are probably good to participate (for comparison I\u0027m at about 300 subs).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know when this will start, but there will be a test session first to make sure everything is feasible. The only other big things I can think of are sorting out who will do the hosting, how to do the hosting, and which of the two existing multiplayer mods we should use (DMP vs LMP). I might not be able to host depending on the restrictions of my college\u0027s internet. If you have any insight as to the pros and cons of each mod, please let me know as it has been a while since I have tried them out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultimate Steve","CreatedById":161505,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-17T01:08:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m going to bump this just in case someone relevant hasn\u0027t seen it, but if this garners no attention I\u0027ll drop the idea for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Twitchi","CreatedById":73343,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-17T14:09:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I wasn\u0027t going into university this year I would be totally up for it.. but as this\u00A0 is the start of the academic year I cannot commit\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
