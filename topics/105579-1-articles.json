This is irritating me, as I have a set of ailerons on a big jetliner that i want to double up as both control surfaces AND flaps (So don\u0027t spam about disabling pitch/yaw/roll). I need the flaps for stability and fine control, but also the control surface for hard maneuvering (As for pulling up if the plane is diving towards the ground, or to turn away from a building, etc.) I hope this is a bug, and if not I would like it to either be changed, or to have an option to disable control when flaps mode is on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: An option to disable control surface could be added, so you can use action-groups (in this case the same as for flaps mode) to disable the steering of an aileron.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT 2: Apparently it is not clear enough: DO NOT SUGGEST DISABLING PITCH/YAW/ROLL.
