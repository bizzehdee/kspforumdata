This is irritating me, as I have a set of ailerons on a big jetliner that i want to double up as both control surfaces AND flaps (So don\u0027t spam about disabling pitch/yaw/roll). I need the flaps for stability and fine control, but also the control surface for hard maneuvering (As for pulling up if the plane is diving towards the ground, or to turn away from a building, etc.) I hope this is a bug, and if not I would like it to either be changed, or to have an option to disable control when flaps mode is on.\n\nEDIT: An option to disable control surface could be added, so you can use action-groups (in this case the same as for flaps mode) to disable the steering of an aileron.\n\nEDIT 2: Apparently it is not clear enough: DO NOT SUGGEST DISABLING PITCH/YAW/ROLL. Thank you.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T07:22:25Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 07:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Master\\_Evar**"},{"CreatedByName":"nholzric","CreatedById":7793,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:53:44Z","Content":"Looks like you\u0027re trying to build to a more detailed design than I\u0027m usually worried about, but do you have the option of including more than one control surface - that way some control surfaces could be used only as flaps (disable pitch/yaw/roll) and the others as control?"},{"CreatedByName":"Armchair Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":76165,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:59:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Looks like you\u0027re trying to build to a more detailed design than I\u0027m usually worried about, but do you have the option of including more than one control surface - that way some control surfaces could be used only as flaps (disable pitch/yaw/roll) and the others as control?\n\nIf I\u0027m reading his post right, he does have multiple sets of control surfaces, and wants to have one set be flaps while the other is steering on one mode, but then be able to use both sets for steering when hard maneuvering is required."},{"CreatedByName":"Master_Evar","CreatedById":98074,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T20:00:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E If I\u0027m reading his post right, he does have multiple sets of control surfaces, and wants to have one set be flaps while the other is steering on one mode, but then be able to use both sets for steering when hard maneuvering is required.\n\nThat is right.
