[uPDATED FOR 1.0.2]**\n\nThis is an updated compilation of the tips from the \u0022What are the most important things about KSP to pass on?\u0022 thread. Where possible, I have tried to remove any obsolete tips or update them for 1.0.2, as indicated by the [1.0.2] tag.\n\nThe list is broken into categories. \u0027Tips\u0027 are practical information; \u0027advice\u0027 is, well, advice. They are NOT sorted within the categories themselves. Links to important things are included, and [MOD] when the tip refers to a mod. Standard abbreviations (LKO for low Kerbin orbit, AN for ascending node, etc.) are used. Some tips are for advanced players, but most are for all. Feel free to print out a copy of this list for your reference, alongside delta-v maps and such. Thanks to the original posters of these tips and advice for their contributions.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\n**Rocket Construction Tips:**\n\n- MechJeb or KER for calculations [MOD]\n- Reduce payload weight. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CEvery gram counts\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2.\n- Modularize/ construct modularly\n- *Shift-Click* selects the entire craft\n- *Shift-AQWSDE* changes the part by 5-degree increments\n- *Alt-Click* duplicates the part selected\n- Build your rockets radially (i.e. outwards) rather than upwards. [1.0.2]: Drag and aerodynamic stability are now very important, so this tip may no longer apply.\n- SRBs for high launch thrust/TWR\n- MOAR BOOSTERS. MOAR STRUTS. MOAR PARACHUTES. All are cheap.\n- Struts break after decoupling\n- Cubic Octagonal Struts open up a whole new realm of creative rocket designs\n- You only need one strut at the top of a booster, and one at the bottom, usually.\n- The big orange tank tends to overheat easily. Place a lone strut to absorb heat.\n- Strut \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153inwards\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 from a booster (place the first end of the strut on the booster, then the main rocket). This way, you can easily duplicate the booster with Alt-Click without having to reattach multiple struts.\n- Use [this work-around](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43621-How-to-have-engine-clusters-in-upper-stages) to enable clustered engines in upper stages\n- 400v batteries and an OX-STAT solar panel so you never run out of juice. [1.0.2]: Physicsless parts have changed. Batteries and OX-STATs are still drag-less, but mass IS added to the parent vehicle.\n- Navigation lights [MOD\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC[B9 Aerospace](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92630-0-25-B9-Aerospace-Release-5-2-6-%28updated-22-10-14%29)]\n- Lights, in general. [1.0.2]: Physicless parts have changed. Mass IS added to parent vehicle.\n- Place reaction wheels are close to Center-of-Mass as possible; RCS equidistant and as far from CoM as possible\n- Reaction wheels aren\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t strictly necessary, but can save a lot of time rotating your rocket to the right orientation\n- Use RCS when your craft has to dock with something, use reaction wheels when they don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t.\n- Use asparagus staging for launch if you\u0027re trying to minimize mass, but SRBs if you\u0027re trying to minimize cost or complexity\n- Radial decouplers are expensive. If you need multiple SRBs, stick one on the other, then connect it to the rocket with one decoupler, vs. having each SRB with its own decoupler.\n- Stick to one size of docking ports for your fleet as much as possible\n- Stick a Small Docking Port on every craft, so you can always perform an emergency refuel if necessary. Small Docking Ports weigh very little.\n- Large Docking Ports are directional. Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t place one upside-down.\n- Use the same action groups as much as possible across your fleet (e.g. pressing \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C*3*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 always toggles the solar panels)\n- Ladders save the headaches of finicky EVAs\n- More RCS ports, the better. They are massless, so having more doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t hurt.\n- Sepratrons can help if used and angled correctly. Don\u0027t point them directly at the stack, or else they may blow up the main stack\u0027s engines and tanks. Angle them 45 deg. or so away from the main stack.\n- Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t inadvertently place things on capsule hatches (make sure you don\u0027t inadvertently place one by symmetry, too).\n- Calculate the amount of parachutes you need with [this Parachute calculator](http://ksp.freeiz.com/). [1.0.2]: Due to the new aerodynamics, the parachute calculator will only be approximate. Your vessel\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s drag profile may vary.\n- Double-check the following before launch: electricity, hatches, docking port alignment, staging order, fuel lines, crew, action groups, struts\n- Fins may be useful at launch to about 20km, but are useless in the upper atmosphere and space\n- You can launch \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153empty\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and refuel at a refueling station in space. This is often simpler and wiser than adding thrust to haul heavy fuel at launch.\n- Name your ships and save them.\n- Save good copies of rockets, landers, rovers, stages, etc. as subassemblies and use prior subassemblies as much as possible rather than designing from scratch every time.\n- If you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t like excessive \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153revert flights\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, make some way to abort your mission and save your Kerbals.\n- Monopropellant may be all you need for very small crafts in orbit.\n- Stick an Octo probe core on every craft. They weigh almost nothing and you get SAS.\n- Nuclear engine doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need oxygen, so empty those oxygen tanks in the VAB.\n- Sometimes reducing fuel in the rocket in the VAB can IMPROVE payload capacity.\n- Ion engines have too little thrust to be useful for anything other than very lightweight probes\n- Build your payload into the last stage of the rocket, not as an inert payload. In other words, have your final lander/probe/whatever be the final stage, not just a payload to be hauled up to orbit.\n- Stayputnik doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have reaction wheels built-in, so you won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have attitude control without either gimballing or a separate reaction wheel.\n\n**Plane/Spaceplane Construction Tips:**\n\n- Center of Lift (CoL) ALWAYS behind Center of Mass (CoM)\n- Rear landing gear too far back will prevent plane take-off\n- Front landing gear too far back will cause plane flippage on take-off\n- Place control surfaces as far away from CoM as possible\n- Lift is more important than thrust\n- At high altitudes, throttle down jet engines to prevent flameout while still picking up speed\n- Assign intakes to action groups and close them to prevent excess drag, or open them for more intake air\n- Spam intakes if you want\n- Small Gear Bay is physicsless, whether deployed or retracted. [1.0.2]: physicsless parts have changed. Mass is now added to the parent vehicle.\n- Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t forget Center of Thrust! If it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s too far above, below, or to the side of the CoM, your spaceplane will be very hard to control during the rocket portion of its flight to orbit.\n- Translate your view in the Spaceplane Hangar w/the middle mouse button\n- Flip the plane upside-down to make placing landing gear easier.\n- Interleave engines and intakes to prevent asymmetrical flameout, per [Kasuha\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s technique](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64362-Fuel-Flow-Rules). [1.0.2]: This is no longer an issue.\n- MechJeb can handle intake management and throttling for you [MOD]\n\n**Rover/Landing Tips:**\n\n- Rovers/landers should be wide and low to prevent flipping\n- Place landing legs on topside of rovers to re-right flipped rovers\n- Remap your SAS keys from your motor keys to prevent accidental flipping, or drive your rover in Docking Mode\n- Rover CoM should be at wheel axle, not attachment point\n- Disable steering on rear wheels for better high-speed handling\n- Use roll and turn controls to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153lean in\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 to a turn\n- When going up steep slopes, put more traction of front wheels w/SAS or thrusters\n- Use downwards thrusters to soften falls\n- Disable front brakes so you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t flip when braking suddenly\n- Use trusses as bumpers to guard during crashes\n- Structural girders make for great lander legs\n- Use a mod or switch to IVA for radar altimeter readout for landing [MOD]\n- Use drogue chutes for heavy landers (the red Mk parachute)\n- You can make a very durable box with stuff inside using structural panels (good for cheap probes). [1.0.2]: This workaround has been superseded by the new gear bays.\n- Landing directly on wheels can be risky because they have low impact tolerances. Better to land on landing legs, then retract them to settle onto your wheels. [1.0.2]: Some of the new landing assemblies are more durable than their predecessors\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2.\n- On bodies with low gravity, a nuclear-powered lander may be more efficient and easier than a manned rover.\n- If landing on a hill with a tripod leg configuration, position a leg downhill and lock its suspension.\n- Park a probe/rover with batteries and solar panels near KSC to serve as a target for landings near KSC\n\n**EVA Tips:**\n\n- Pressing \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153*[*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153 and \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153*]*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 keys changes between nearby ships/Kerbals\n- Kerbals can survive falls from great heights, but not explosions. Fall head-first by clicking and dragging the Kerbal during EVA; their helmets are very, very strong.\n- Pressing \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153*Shift*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 makes your Kerbal run during EVA\n- You can collect science even when science parts accidentally break off during a rough landing, either through EVA or the Tracking Station\n- You can land and return to orbit with just the EVA Jetpack on Gilly, Bop, Pol, and Minmus\n- If you run out of fuel, you can use your Kerbal on EVA to push the craft (slowly) from behind. And since Jetpack propellant is infinitely replenished by re-entering the command pod, you can theoretically have infinite delta-V.\n- All of the crew modules refuel your Kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s EVA jetpack, EXCEPT the External Command Seat.\n- Switch to different view modes by pressing \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C*V*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 during orbit or EVA. Really helps during EVAs.\n- Kerbals can open solar panels, repair legs, and repack chutes while on EVA by right-clicking. Useful if you forgot to extend your panels before time-accelerating. [1.0.2]: EVA capabilities now depend on the Kerbal\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s role. Engineers can repair parts, scientists can restore science modules and take readings.\n- Press \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153*L*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 on EVA to turn on Kerbal helmet lights\n- Kerbals can survive some take-offs by holding onto the ladder outside the craft. Be very, very careful. This may come in handy if you want to hold extra copies of data, but you\u0027ve already got one set in the command module.\n- The gravity of Duna is the limit of the Jetpack\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s capabilities. You will NOT be able to fly around on Eve or Tylo, so make sure you have ladders for your Kerbals to reenter the command pods.\n\n**Flight/Docking Tips:**\n\n- Pressing *Alt-\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2* and *Alt-\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201C,\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2* forces physics acceleration when in an atmosphere or under acceleration!\n- Burn an equal amount of time before and after a maneuver node\n- To use a maneuver node, burn towards the blue \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153X\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2\n- Use maneuver nodes and play with them\n- Navball switches to \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Target\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 mode when you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re within 50km of the target\n- If you align your vessels at perpendicular angles, you can dock using only the Navball and engines\n- *Alt-Right Click* to transfer fuel between two tanks, even without fuel lines. [1.0.2]: You need to upgrade R\u0026D facilities to enable fuel transfer.\n- Place a maneuver node near the surface to estimate your suicide-burn times\n- Use multiple gravity-assist flybys by [placing your crafts into resonant orbits](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/102289-Resonant-Orbits-Worksheet-and-Orbital-Calculator) with the larger body\n- Launch heading east (90 degrees on Navball) for cheapest orbital insertion\n- It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cheaper to perform an inclination change at launch rather than when you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re already in orbit\n- Stick a probe in equatorial LKO to help you plan launches. See [metaphor\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s technique](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/74375-Lowest-Delta-v-to-Moho/page2)(which is used for real-life missions) for reducing interplanetary delta-v.\n- Cheapest way to [perform an inclination change greater than 45 degrees](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69659-Apoapsis-plane-change-manoeuvre-%CE%94v?p=971064\u0026viewfull=1#post971064), by Alexmun: extend your AN/DN, perform your inclination change, reduce your AN/DN and recircularize\n- Maximize Oberth Effect by performing burns at your highest orbital speed (aka at your periapsis)\n- Press *F5* and *F9* to undo screw-ups. *Alt-F5* is \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Quicksave As\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2, but don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t accidentally hit Alt-F4!\n- Drop your heaviest stages first\n- You only need one or two engines to gimbal. The rest can be disabled by right-clicking.\n- Switch to the Tracking Station or to a stationary, landed craft to time-accelerate when in a low orbit, then switch back to your active craft\n- Launch an efficient \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153tug\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 and use it for laborious assembly tasks in LKO\n- You can \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153freeze\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 the AP or PE readouts in Map view by clicking on them\n- Use aerobraking/aerocapture whenever you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re around a body with an atmosphere to save delta-V. [1.0.2]: Due to the new aerodynamics and heating, this is much more difficult.\n- Parachutes tear off in timewarp. [1.0.2]: This has been corrected and is no longer an issue.\n- To visualize successive orbits, [place maneuver nodes one-behind-the-other](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37995-How-to-plan-encounters-more-than-one-orbit-in-advance)(useful for planning encounters/gravity assists)\n- You can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t switch vessels while you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in an atmosphere\n- You can only store one copy of each biome\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s science data in a command module. Use labs to store multiple copies of data (useful for maximizing the science returns)\n- Use RCS, or limit your engine thrust by right-clicking, for precise orbital maneuvers.\n- Be careful on long interplanetary injection burns that you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t accidentally reenter the atmosphere\n- Divide your long burn into several short burns (\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153periapsis kicks\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2).\n- Land on the \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153day\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 side of the body, especially if you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have lights.\n- \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Closest Approach\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 pointers only show when your inclination respective to the target is near zero, or your AN/DN directly intersects the orbit somewhere\n- \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Freeze\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 or turn off batteries by right-clicking when you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have solar panels in early stages of Career mode, or need some guaranteed reserve electricity.\n- When staging, rolling your craft will help \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153spin-away\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 the boosters\n- MechJeb has a pretty good aerobraking calculator under its \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153Landing Prediction\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 window [MOD]. [1.0.2]: New aerodynamics means MechJeb\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s predictions are approximate.\n- Make sure your periapsis is above the highest terrain for a planet. Some moons like Gilly and Bop have mountains sticking up to 22,000m above the ground.\n- Be consistent with your orbits. For most cases, this means your crafts should be in an equatorial, zero-inclination, prograde (counterclockwise) orbit. Nothing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s more annoying than rendezvousing with a craft, only to realize it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s going the exact opposite direction\n- In Map view, hovering over the top edge of the screen will display the types of objects, just like in the Tracking Station. You can turn on and off debris and asteroids, for example.\n- Have an escape system bound to ABORT, or the Backspace key.\n- In docking mode, double-tapping the Spacebar activates \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Chold\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 mode.\n- Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry too much about a perfect [gravity-turn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn)/pitch program launch profile, but better to be too steep than too shallow-- too steep, and you waste a bit of fuel; too shallow, and you might be held up by atmospheric drag so much that you don\u0027t make orbit.\n- Be careful with time warps near SOI changes. Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t timewarp at 10,000x before Kerbin reentry, for example.\n\n**Gameplay Tips/Advice:**\n\n- Spaceplanes are the key to lifting things to orbit for cheap b/c they\u0027re reusable and get oxygen from the air, but they\u0027re harder to design\n- Having high part counts on your rockets will cause your computer to lag\n- The color of the time in the upper-left box indicates physics lag/time. If the color is green, your computer is handling the physics calculations fine.

No one likes to be stuck at only 10x acceleration.\n- Print out and consult [a Delta-V map](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/41652-A-more-accurate-delta-v-map) CONSTANTLY when designing your missions.\n- Print out a [keyboard mapping diagram like this one](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/25074-KSP-Keyboard-Map-Old-School-Gaming-%282-0-15-Nov%29). There are TONS of key combos you probably didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t know!\n- Contracts often have long completion deadlines but provide money up-front. So if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re really short on cash, accept a bunch of contracts and worry about fulfilling them later.\n- Upgrade to unlimited contracts as early as possible, accept them all, then use the up-front cash to do the fast and easy contracts\n- Bundle contracts together and complete multiple contracts in a single flight\n- Station a couple Kerbals throughout the system and use them to complete easy EVA/plant flag/transmit science contracts repeatedly.\n- Experiment and test things out on bodies with similar gravities/atmospheres (on Minmus for Gilly missions, Mun for Dres missions, Kerbin for Laythe missions, etc.)\n- Always have a way to recover Kerbals to Kerbin alive. [1.0.2]: Recovery of Kerbals is now especially important because hiring new Kerbals and leveling them up is expensive.\n- Don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry about [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome). The chances of debris hits are incredibly rare. But excess parts in orbit may slightly slow your computer performance.\n- Keep space clean by deorbiting stages, colliding it, deleting from Tracking Station, etc. to speed up computer performance and be aesthetically pleasing\n- There\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s lots of easy science near the Launchpad\n- Minmus is a lot easier than the Mun. May be a little harder to reach because of the distance and inclination, but it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s far, far easier to land and return from Minmus, and there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s easier and more profitable science.\n- Make lifters that can lift a certain payload to LKO (10t, 25t, 50t, 75t, etc.), save them as subassemblies, and use them rather than custom-building each rocket. This saves time at minimal extra cost.\n- Contracts that stipulate a station \u0022Supporting \u0027X\u0027 Kerbals\u0022 don\u0027t require you to fill those seats in the station. You can satisfy a contract for a 5-Kerbal station with a station that has the capacity for 5 Kerbals, but only two onboard, for example.\n- Space stations are cool but not that useful except for refueling or storage\n- Money is pretty easy to come by, so don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t worry too much about eking out a few thousand dollars in savings.\n- Strategies: trade prestige for cash, prestige for science, and take Hard Negotiations = money and science flow in\n- Upgrade buildings when you have to, not when you can.\n- In the early stages of Career, before you orbit Kerbin, complete suborbital tourist contracts for easy reputation/science/cash boosts\n- Science labs don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t automatically start with Kerbals in them. You have to add them manually before launch.\n- [1.0.2]: Science labs have new features, such as science research. For a breakdown of how science labs now work, read this guide.\n- After the first 3 tiers of the Tech tree, the bottom levels of the Tree yields more useful immediate results. Things like parachutes, batteries, and solar panels are more useful than large engines or structural parts.\n- For RemoteTech, attach antennas, batteries, and simple solar panels to any stages or debris and turn them into simple comm sats rather than pure debris!

It\u0027s better to maximize this effect by doing burns at fast speeds as much as possible. EVERYONE GETS THIS WRONG. Or at least not wrong, but very, very sloppy. Oberth effect is related to speed, not orbital height. Obviously, there\u0027s a relationship between speed and height, but for the sake of the newbie, please be consistent. For example, if I\u0027m in an almost-perfectly-circular orbit, the difference in orbital speed at PE and AP is almost negligible, so Oberth effect doesn\u0027t really matter. I can start my burn anywhere along my orbit. If you\u0027re in a more eccentric orbit, the speeds will vary more, so Oberth will vary more. PLEASE BE CONSISTENT.\n- Duna and Minmus may make good refueling stops, especially with Kethane/Karbonite [1.0.2]: Mining/refining is now included in the stock game. But it is always more efficient (but more difficult) to launch in one go with all the fuel you need.\n\n**General Advice:**\n\n- Understand why things happen rather than follow rules rigidly\n- Plan missions in advance. Planning is key.\n- Set both small, short-term and hard, long-term goals\n- Build things that work in KSP, not things that work in the real world. KSP physics aren\u0027t a perfect mirror of reality\n- When in doubt, simplify and aim for smaller, less complicated rockets\n- Play the game at your own pace\n- Watch [Scott Manley](https://www.youtube.com/user/szyzyg) videos for inspiration, NOT practical advice necessarily.

RT 2 has a flight control computer that can orient and kill rotation, no SAS needed (although you will need some type of control, like a reaction wheel, added to your probe). My early comms sats all use Stayputnik cores, and many of my later ones do too for various reasons (weight being one of them).\n\nIf you don\u0027t use RT, then I agree, they aren\u0027t very useful because of the lack of SAS. I suppose if you had a really well balanced rocket, you could use them for science gathering by giving them ballistic trajectories, using the Mun to capture them, or whatnot. But since RT 2 is one of my must-have mods, I don\u0027t see the reason.\n\nSo, in keeping with the Tips compendium, if you want to get use out of your first available probe core, take a look at RT 2, as it\u0027s flight control computer makes up for the lack of onboard SAS without being too cheat-y, as it also requires you to have communications with your core. \n\nPS - KoS would probably work just fine with a Stayputnik as well."}]}
