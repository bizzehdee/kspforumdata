I wanted to reposition some solar panels with my 2* engineer on a soon-to-be space station, but I cannot move, rotate or attach anything - in fact, I can\u0027t even place anything in the inventories except for parachutes and EVA packs. Is this intended? Is there a way to reposition some smaller parts on a ship (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ports, solar panels, docking ports etc.) like in stock, or is it not possible in RP1?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running an older version of RP1 where it still pays money for contracts with the usual additions (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E, Kerbalism etc.) on a 1.12.5 KSP version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
