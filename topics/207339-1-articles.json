At the moment I\u0027m building a mining device in the orbit of kerbit. To make the connections strong I\u0027ve started replacing the single docking ports with a quadruple system. After detaching, modifying and reattaching I realized: Damnit. It\u0027s rotation angle is wrong. So I wanted to undock the 4-docking-part-connection, fix the rotation and re-dock it again. But after undocking the first three ports, I can\u0027t undock the fourth one.
