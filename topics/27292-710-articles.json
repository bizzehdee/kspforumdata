It should actually arrive shortly before my Grand Tour ship gets to Duna. After leaving Ike, I was also able to schedule a Minmus orbital capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOddly enough, neither of these ships counts as having a Minmus fly-by in-spite of having landed and refueled there, and the mission ship also seems to be missing an Ike fly-by. In any case, I\u0027ll make sure they classify as having a Minmus fly-by before returning to Kerbol with their science loads to make sure I get my two Tour missions fulfilled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also launched an attempted Jool scansat probe, but I am not sure if it will be able to do more than have a reasonably stable orbit in the Jool system without a refuel by the Grand Tour ship(once it gets there). Kept loosing my Jool rendezvous while thrusting so I probably wasted a lot of fuel. If I can get some gravity assists I may be able to have enough fuel to start some scans, but not at all sure about that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Similar to the eve probe launch, I had about 600m/s left in the ascent stage after getting to orbit, but a lot of that extra speed probably ended up getting wasted)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am speculating about using the asteroid miner to deorbit those two over-successful launch stages after the asteroid gets transferred to a lander.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Adamczuk","CreatedById":146006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T19:13:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDecided to build an exploration fighter and one particular part caught my eye; the Tricoupler!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/p6GNj0Q.png\u0022 alt=\u0022p6GNj0Q.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus The Peninsula was born!
