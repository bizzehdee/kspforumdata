We have a KerbNet window where now and than a ? pops up... but what is the mechanic behind it? X% chance of/per what? once a day? once per orbit? everytime i open up the KerbNet window? If i have 3 sats scanning the planet...do they each get a roll? And if yes, do they share the data or do i need to check each one induvidualy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe whole stuff is pretty much a mistery to me, wich is sad cause it sounds like a lot of fun if we/i just knew the rules by wich to play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-27T08:04:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think anomaly hunting is one of the most fun things you can do in KSP. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have 5000 hours in this game and KerbNet a mystery to me too.
