So I\u0027ve used a Google Spreadsheet for it. As time passed it has been grown and I think there might be some players out there, who like to use it, too.\n\nEssentially the MKS/OKS calculator has two features:\n\n1. Calculate\n\n**efficiency**\n\nof the different modules\n\n2. Calculating a quasi-steady-state for\n\n**consumption, production and balance values**\n\n. Either regarding\n\n**load values**\n\nby user or using linear optimization algorithms for determining bottlenecks, resource volume, input requirements etc. The possibilities are various and depend on what you\u0027re aiming for.\n\nYou can view it here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17kPF5Tp6kBk-DqCk-VTUXZfjzI8BVzadnhNpz1K78p4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17kPF5Tp6kBk-DqCk-VTUXZfjzI8BVzadnhNpz1K78p4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nMake a private copy and feel free to do with it what ever you want. \n\n**Short introduction (more will follow):**\n\nThe first sheet \u0022Colony Overview\u0022 has yellow cells, which can be filled by a user to \u0022build\u0022 the colony. Blue and grey cells have formulas, so be careful. They\u0027re showing different variables, related to the users input.\n\nThe second sheet \u0022Real Consumption/Production\u0022 has green cells, which can either be filled by a user or by a linear solver. I\u0027d suggest to install OpenSolver Add-on, because it can be used intuitively without complex understanding of optimization algorithms.\n\nThe third sheet \u0022ResourceConverter RAW\u0022 contains values pulled from the configs of the different USI Kolonization parts.\n\n*Because I know you like pictures...*\n![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n*here they are:*\n\n\u003E //imgur.com/a/QZMuh\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

I will try to implement these and I\u0027ve some plans what should be added to the spreadsheet in the future (EPL,Karbonite,USILS,...). I\u0027m open to suggestions.\n\nTHX to Roverdude, who is awesome, for creating the USI mods and allowing me to adapt his source code for the spreadsheet. \n\nMKS is licenced under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) license.\n\nI\u0027m not sure regarding license for the spreadsheet, might be google license ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) ...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T06:49:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 06:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funk**"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T08:13:06Z","Content":"Please: sheet \u0022Colony Overview\u0022, column \u0022P\u0022, every calculated cell:\n\n=IF(B25=1,4-COUNTIF(J26:M26,\u0022none\u0022),0)\n\nWouldn\u0027t be correct: \u0022IF(B25\u003C\u003E0...\u0022?
