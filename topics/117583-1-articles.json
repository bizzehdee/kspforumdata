It has rockets or it can use its own wheels. Under wheel power it can reach 23 m/s.\n\nOur first race car, The Kan Am Racing Kar.\n\nAction Groups:\n\n1: Toggles spoiler. Generates lift at rear(use at high speeds)\n\n2: Toggles front wing. Glues front of car to the ground(use at startup)\n\n3: Toggles side wings. Increases grip in turns.\n\nWe have an untuned and tuned car. The action groups only apply to the tuned car.\\\n\n[https://www./folder/kpsceia7e7gei/KSP_Racers](https://www./folder/kpsceia7e7gei/KSP_Racers)\n\nSorry, no pictures:(\n\nThe stock kar is untuned, the racing kar is tuned.\n\nHave fun!\n\nTop speed of 60 m/s before wheels burst."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T03:11:52Z","Content":"y no pics?"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T03:15:50Z","Content":"i have no pictures because imgur decided to stop working for the hour.
