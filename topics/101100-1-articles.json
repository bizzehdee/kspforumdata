For Kerbin, you need to reach about 2300 m/s at 70 km or higher.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPlbDEI63B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPlbDEI63B4) (Newton\u0027s Cannon)"},{"CreatedByName":"QuantumInc","CreatedById":137889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T06:59:53Z","Content":"The generally accepted method is 1. Go straight up until 10,000m, move slower than 200m/s here\n\n2. Turn to the ocean, the east, aim for a 45 degrees above the horizon\n\n3. Check the map, cut engines when your AP reaches your desired orbit, which must be at least 70km\n\n4. Right before you reach your AP tilt down to the horizon, and burn horizontally until the PE rises to where you want it, stop if you see AP and PE moving around a lot, wait until you reach the new AP and start again. When the PE is above 70km you\u0027re officially in orbit.\n\nI\u0027d hate to say it, but there are a few mods that are ridiculously useful. Mechjeb, Engineer Redux, VOID, launch window planner, these all give you a lot of essential information, such as your delta-V.\n\nDelta-V refers to how much you can change your velocity before running out of fuel. Another important term is ISP, specific impulse, which is essentially fuel efficiency. \n\nLiquid fuel has better fuel efficiency than solid fuel, but solid fuel booster are cheap. So only use solid fuel for the first stage.\n\nAll of the engines have better fuel efficiency in space than in the atmosphere.\n\nMost of the liquid engines have a similar ISP, though the short engines typically have slightly better fuel efficiency in space at the cost of thrust power.\n\nIon engines and Nuclear engines are high tech, but have wonderful ISP in space. They are favored for moving around after you\u0027ve reach orbit.\n\nToroidal Aerospikes have significantly better ISP that other engines, but are only available at the end of the tech tree.\n\nJet engines only work in the atmosphere and need air intakes on the front of the craft, but they have a much, much greater ISP. Generally a space plane is more fuel efficient, but many people have trouble getting one to work."},{"CreatedByName":"WOOTtheWall","CreatedById":139201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T03:45:36Z","Content":"Welcome!I am here to help in anyway I can.(I\u0027ve had kerbal for around two years and have around a thousand hours on steam in it...which is increaseing at a alarming rate)(And got on the forums last mounth)So if you have any questions or need help message me and I\u0027ll help in anyway I can\n\nSafe voyages,-WOOTtheWall"}]}
