My problem is one end of my base seems to be jumping nearly 20m up when I dock a module to it. Part count is relatively low currently being under 300 parts in the area so far (Under 300 parts in the 2.x Km distance that objects are rendered). This has happened on a prior station on a different part of the mun as well. Near as I can tell on the older base it was related somehow to some landing legs that seemed to \u0022spawn in\u0022 just a hair below the surface when you changed to the base from the tracking station or you used the warp feature. I had to stop construction on that base as well because of the growing jumping problem. On the original base the problem seemed to start small then get worse as things were added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E On the new station though I have not seen any of the landing legs behave the way the first base did so I\u0027m really not sure why it is jumping the way it does. The first modules dock with zero problems. You can see the station \u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/579003970156869538/A265B4A682BFD4497654489734ED8715D3873F72/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.
