Open the new game\u0027s persistent.sfs and look for two SCENARIO blocks, one named \u0022VesselRecovery\u0022 and one named \u0022ScenarioDestructibles\u0022; they should be found right after the one named \u0022ProgressTracking\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Your current game (i.e., the one you are fixing) should \u003Cem\u003Elack\u003C/em\u003E these two blocks.
