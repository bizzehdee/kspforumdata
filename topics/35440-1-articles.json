Essentially I feel it just gets a little too heavy and serious. There\u0027s a lot of character interaction to establish their relationships and such, and some tense action scenes as well, but as a whole I feel like the the chapter is a little bit TOO intricate, and doesn\u0027t really achieve the tone and ideas I had set out to convey in a rational span of time. It actually feels a lot like Mass Effect, which has a TON of dialogue and character building, but it starts feeling like a crazy amount of unnecessary detail after a time.
