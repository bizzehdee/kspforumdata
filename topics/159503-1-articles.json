They were looking at the full sized blueprints of a probe on one of the walls. The science and engine sections were broken out into other blueprints elsewhere on the wall. On a table in one corner was a paper model of the probe and launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWe\u2019ll leave aside the launcher for the moment,\u201D Aldald said as he pushed up his glasses. \u201CIt is sufficient to get Scimon, and its up fueled variant, to an eighty by eighty orbit. Upon achieving orbit, Scimon will separate from the launcher. From orbit Scimon will perform a burn to enter a M\u00FCnar flyby with a periapsis of twenty kilometers with a Kerbin free-return trajectory. Projected Kerbin periapsis will be forty kilometers. Upon entry to the atmosphere it will burn the remaining fuel and aero brake until airspeed is reduced to 250 mps. The parachutes will deploy bringing it to rest on the surface.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGus looked at the model in the corner. \u201CWhat\u2019s the projected reliability?\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAldald pushed up his glasses. \u201CFor the launcher we are projecting 4 nines. For Scimon it is only two nines.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGus and Bob frowned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CMost of the failure modes and uncertainty are a result of a lack of information about how propulsion and control will behave in M\u00FCnar orbit,\u201D Aldald continues. \u201DRe-entry to Kerbin also presents large amounts of uncertainty, despite our performance so far with the tourist contracts.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhere\u2019s the uncertainty in the control systems,\u201D Linus said. \u201CI thought the commands were all relayed from here to Scimon.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CThey are,\u201C Aldald said. \u201CThe problem is the relay itself. There is concern that the conditions either on launch or in transit will affect the forward or back channels.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CWhat about a second set of radio equipment,\u201D Bob asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinus shook his head. \u201CToo much mass.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CCorrect,\u201D Aldald said. \u201CIn the event of failure of one of the channels, Scimon will attempt to use the remaining channel for both directions. If both channels fail after the exit burn, Scimon will still have a return trajectory to Kerbin. This will be sufficient to reduce speed enough for landing after two passes. The parachutes will automatically deploy once it is at a safe speed and appropriate altitude.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CNo readings will be taken in the event of total radio failure,\u201D Bob asked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CIn that situation Scimon is set to automatically take four equally spaced samples,\u201D Aldald said. \u201CIt will start at periapsis up to 2000 km on the outbound portion of the flyby.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CAnd all of that is less that a second set of radios?\u201D Linus said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u201CYes. Those automation systems mass approximately 50 percent less.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
