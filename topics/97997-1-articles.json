Nearby is this pile of random debris from the booster that brought it there:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/02dHow0.png\u0022 alt=\u002202dHow0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\u0027s much too big to drag back to base, but I figure the colonists brought some tools with them... With the base being pretty far from here, I thought it might be useful if I could repurpose some of this junk into a little hut or something for the pilot to shelter in overnight etc. What\u0027s the best way to go about this? The simplest way would appear to be to find and replace the fuel tank with a hitchhiker cabin in the save file (as they\u0027re about the same size.) Is it as simple as that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T19:05:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you might be able to get away with that. You\u0027ll want to make sure you\u0027re editing the correct fuel tank, which you can likely do by searching for the name of the debris. Once you find the VESSEL {} structure, you\u0027ll need to find the part that corresponds to the fuel tank.
