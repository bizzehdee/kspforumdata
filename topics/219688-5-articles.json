A solid rocket booster, which is made from several mated sections (which are not intended to move relative to one another) should \u0027not\u0027 deform unless in the most extreme circumstances. Now, a connection point where something is mounted (not mated) to something else \u0027should\u0027 be one of those variable locations. The issue is, Kerbal has always done an \u003Cstrong\u003Eextremely\u003C/strong\u003E poor job of simulating these things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I fully believe is needed, is a \u0027weld joint\u0027 tool. Where the attachment node/joint is for all intents and purposes removed and two parts become a single homogenous part, fir physics calculations and such forth. I don\u0027t really see a viable alternative to that. There does however need to be several \u0027hard rules\u0027 embedded within that, an example being one cannot weld a 1.25 metre tank to a 2.5 metre tank, as the contact point of the two tanks is the barrel section\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E the dome. So for that example you\u0027d be forced, by design to use an adaptor of some form, which is what you\u0027d want to do. It\u0027s what real rocket manufacturers do. The whole purpose of that is to psuedo-simulate the idea of having an actual physical connection, whether that\u0027s a weld, or bolts between two parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere I think deformation is required is mounting solid rocket boosters for example, there should be a structure (strutting) that removes the torque created with having a booster attached to a single point like that. What I don\u0027t want to see is an \u0027auto-strut\u0027 setup again as it doesn\u0027t address the root cause, and we remove that second example (the solids mounted to the decoupler) from the equation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly believe we in the community need to accept that a solution is going to fundamentally alter \u0027something\u0027 about how the game plays and embrace it as something of a progression to Kerbal Space Program being a bit more realistic, from a physics standpoint.

I even see really experienced folks like Matt Lowne using them really inefficiently which is why they end up with so many. Its probably because so many players rely on autostrut and so they kind of stop thinking about structure. In fact I see a lot of players who look like they\u2019re trying to mimic autostrut: just putting connections absolutely everywhere, which creates the same performance issues that autostrut has. \u00A0With a bit of education I think players could make their vessels even sturdier than Autostrut and with much less overhead. Ive never used Autostrut in KSP1 even for great big modded motherships. You just need to think about where these forces are coming from and counteract them in all 3 directions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022f5tTTX0.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022119.75\u0022 height=\u0022750\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/f5tTTX0.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u2019t a \u2018get gud\u2019 argument though. KSP2 feels spongier than KSP1 did even without autostrut, and I think everyone feels like single diameter stacks should not wobble around the way they do. So maybe treating those as rigid could be an option. If a player goes from 3.75m down to 1.25m that would still flex, but if you could solve that with a shroud. And I do still think radial attachments should still flex, though perhaps not as much as they do now.
