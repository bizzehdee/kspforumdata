I cannot click or interact with any of its features and also cannot exit it once it is pulled up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy questions are\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: Has this been an issue anyone has been able to work around? If so, please share I am good at following instructions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: Are there any other mods that will allow me to place a launchpad on another part of Kerbin? I need at the very least to do that because the reusable rockets that I like to build cant reach any other potential landing sites. I need to therefor place a launch site on the opposite side of the continent to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E so that my rockets can launch there and land at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E where the ground is flat enough.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease help, and thank you for your feedback\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
