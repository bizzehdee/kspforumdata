The vessel is put \u0022on rails\u0022 - that means that it cannot move or be moved from its pre-set path and orientation. All motion is frozen, no control inputs are processed, and all control authority systems are disabled. The state the reactions wheels were in at the moment of activating time warp does not matter.
