It\u0027s also the one that varies the most in difficulty and cost depending on the timing of your chosen transfer window, due to Moho\u0027s significant inclination and eccentricity. And in addition to that, it\u0027s the one most sensitive to errors and imprecisions, due to the high speed with which Moho screams around the sun. Getting to Eeloo is a walk in the park compared to getting to Moho, so don\u0027t feel bad about being stumped here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are basically two ways:\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The first is your typical Hohmann transfer. You make a single departure burn in low Kerbin orbit that gets you an encounter, and you make a braking burn once inside Moho\u0027s SoI. It works just the same as any other interplanetary transfer, and is the fastest and most direct option. The problem with it is that because Moho is in such a tight, fast orbit, you can\u0027t really eyeball the transfer window like you can for other planets. The ideal time for departure is an intervall of maybe an hour or two at best, and deviating from it at all increases your dV cost significantly. So you probably want a tool to assist you, unless you like being really persistent with trying out maneuver nodes orbit after orbit until you find one that\u0027s acceptable to you. A good tool is a mod called Transfer Window Planner by TriggerAU, which is an ingame port of \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis web calculator\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- The second one is the way macollo describes in the post linked above. Because the Hohmann transfer window is so finnicky and mistakes cost so much extra dV, that appraoch says \u0022screw transfer windows\u0022 and instead departs when lined up with Moho\u0027s ascending node/apoapsis (they conveniently fall in the same spot). When you do this, you will not get an encounter. The trick is to stay in that orbit and loop around the sun until you do - or, more realistically, until you get a near miss. At that point you perform a course correction to force that encounter. Depending on your choice of transfer window and the magnitude of your course correction, this approach can give you a cost similar to a perfect Hohmann transfer, and definitely much less than a botched one. The downside is that you may potentially be waiting for a long, long time to get an encounter. For most people playing stock KSP, this is an acceptable tradeoff; but if you like to play with life support mods, and your vessel is crewed, this might not be the best option for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-03-25T08:51:40Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2016 08:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plusck","CreatedById":153264,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-25T10:14:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been going to and from Moho quite a lot recently.

isn\u0027t so much in getting there from Kerbin, it\u0027s STOPPING there once you arrive. \u00A0If you\u0027re not extremely careful with the transfer, you will often find that capturing into a Moho orbit takes ungodly amounts of dV, like 4000-6000m/s. \u00A0This has been the ruin of many 1st-time Moho expeditions and is what has given Moho its evil reputation \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u00A0Because the cost of the transfer burn is essentially fixed due to orbital altitudes of Kerbin and Moho, the objective is to reduce the capture\u00A0burn down to something reasonable, say 1000-1500m/s, without simply shifting this cost to the transfer burn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt any planet, the cost of the capture burn is proportional to the angle between the ship\u0027s trajectory and the planet\u0027s orbital path. \u00A0The closer these lines are to being parallel, the lower the relative velocity between the ship and the planet, so the lower the capture burn cost. \u00A0The closer these lines are to being perpendicular, the greater the capture burn cost. \u00A0Therefore, the objective is to approach Moho at as small an angle as possible. \u00A0This is achieved by making the ship\u0027s orbit as similar to Moho\u0027s as possible. \u00A0Because a direct transfer from Kerbin to Moho makes a rather elliptical orbit not at all similar to Moho\u0027s reasonably circular orbit, it\u0027s apparent that you must somehow lower the ship\u0027s solar Ap from the \u00A0altitude of Kerbin\u0027s orbit down closer to Moho\u0027s altitude. \u00A0The various tricks\u00A0experienced players use to get to Moho on the cheap perform this lowering of the solar Ap in different ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is also the matter of Moho\u0027s inclination. \u00A0The further Moho is above or below Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane by the time you get there, the more dV the transfer burn itself costs, either up front on a ballistic transfer or en route with a plane change. \u00A0This can be a significant amount so experienced players avoid it as much as possible by arriving\u00A0at Moho only when it\u0027s at or near its AN or DN with Kerbin. \u00A0This has NOTHING to do with conventional transfer windows based on the phase angle between Moho and Kerbin, which don\u0027t take this into account. \u00A0Therefore, experienced Moho explorers totally ignore transfer windows between Kerbin and Moho and leave only when they need little or no inclination change (more on this in a while).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what do you do? \u00A0Well, as a general rule in KSP (and probably real life as well), you can trade fuel for travel time. \u00A0If you don\u0027t care how long the trip takes, you can usually get there for very little fuel by taking an indirect route. \u00A0Conversely, the shorter the travel time, the more fuel it requires. \u00A0Elapsed mission time in KSP doesn\u0027t matter in stock games. \u00A0If you\u0027re using a life support mod, however, you need to pack enough supplies for the trip or use DeepFreeze. \u00A0Indirect transfers to Moho typically take about 1-2 years of gametime because they usually require you to do 1 or more solar orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, probably the most efficient way to get from Moho to Kerbin is to leave Kerbin when it\u0027s at an AN or DN with Moho\u0027s orbit. \u00A0Pay no attention to where Moho itself is at the time, only where Kerbin is. \u00A0Do a transfer burn from Kerbin so that your trajectory hits Moho\u0027s orbit at the AN or DN with Kerbin that\u0027s on the other side of the sun. \u00A0Thus, once you leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI, your solar Pe is at Moho\u0027s orbital altitude and your solar Ap is at Kerbin\u0027s altitude. \u00A0Once you get to Pe (which is on or near Moho\u0027s AN/DN with Kerbin\u0027s orbital plane), burn retrograde to lower your solar Ap down to somewhere between Eve and Moho so your orbit is fairly circular, minimizing the angle at which you\u0027ll meet Moho. \u00A0Then you wait, tweaking your Ap as needed, until you meet Moho at your ship\u0027s Pe, which might require making several solar orbits. \u00A0This pretty much eliminates all the inclination change you\u0027d otherwise have to do and also minimizes the capture burn, although you effectively need more on the transfer due to lowering your solar Ap with thrust. \u00A0The name for this method is the bi-elliptic transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot quite as efficient but still pretty good is to use a gravity brake at Eve. \u00A0In this scenario, again you totally ignore Moho\u0027s position when you do the transfer burn. \u00A0Instead, you leave Kerbin on a regular transfer window to Eve. \u00A0You tweak your departure burn from Kerbin (and maybe tweak your trajectory en route or once in Eve\u0027s SOI) so that your ship will pass Eve on the sunny side and somewhat above or below its orbital plane. \u00A0Adjust your Eve Pe altitude so that once you leave Eve\u0027s SOI, your solar Pe will be at or near Moho\u0027s orbit. \u00A0Also adjust your Eve Pe\u00A0vertically to get as much inclination change as possible towards matching planes with Moho. \u00A0Once you leave Eve\u0027s SOI, your solar Pe will be at Moho\u0027s altitude and your solar Ap will be at Eve\u0027s altitude, and you\u0027ll have done some (but never all) of the plane change. \u00A0From here, it\u0027s a matter of burning to match planes with Moho and then tweaking your solar Ap and/or Pe as needed to intercept Moho. \u00A0Because you\u0027re matching planes with Moho, you can intercept it at any point around its orbit instead of having to hit it at an AN or DN with Kerbin. \u00A0This means \u00A0you can usually hit Moho within 1 solar orbit instead of maybe having to wait several solar orbits, so travel time this way is usually rather shorter than with a bi-elliptic transfer. \u00A0And the actual transfer burn is minimized because you only burn to go to Eve and its gravity does the work of lowering your solar Ap. \u00A0However, you make up for that in usually having to do a fairly significant plane change burn to match planes with Moho, and this usually makes this method require somewhat more fuel than a bi-elliptic transfer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith both methods, the capture burn can be further reduced by gravity braking off Moho itself. \u00A0The 1st time you meet Moho, pass it on the sunny side to further lower your solar Ap so that now your orbit is very similar to Moho\u0027s. \u00A0Then do another solar orbit and finish capturing the next time around. \u00A0However, this will add even more travel time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo there you are, 2 indirect methods for getting to Moho that cost significantly less in total (including the capture burn)\u00A0than trying to do a conventional direct Hohmann or ballistic transfer based on phase angles. \u00A0Both take considerably longer than direct transfers however. \u00A0The opportunities to do bi-elliptic transfers happen regularly twice per year as Kerbin passes the AN and DN with Moho\u0027s orbit. \u00A0The opportunities for Eve
