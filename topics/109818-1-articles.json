The experiment is re-runnable up to 3 times before the film (for the pictures) is fully depleted. Then you can right-click on a capsule and store one film roll in the pod. You then jettison the pod (attached to some seperatrons) for recovery. The capsule can withstand a 150m/s impact (I am not sure about the heat resistance - may need to change).\n\nYou cannot transmit the film back, as it is film and must be recovered - like the Corona satellite missions. The pod is uncontrollable/uncommandable.\n\nThe link to the original site isn\u0027t available due to the fact that the main server for the site is down and may not be recovered. The site had mods that dated to earlier than 0.20 - yeah, the site is relatively old.\n\nI just checked - the site isn\u0027t a mod site anymore. Here is the site[REDACTED].\n\nOh, and MeCripp - the mod isn\u0027t like HullCam VDS at all - you need to recover the film, not transmit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T23:13:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 11:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai**\n  \nRemoved reference to pirate mod website"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T23:14:55Z","Content":"Astrofox, just so you know, the defunct website you\u0027ve mentioned was shut down for illegally scraping add-ons from the original official Kerbal Spaceport website.
