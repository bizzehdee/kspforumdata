The experiment is re-runnable up to 3 times before the film (for the pictures) is fully depleted. Then you can right-click on a capsule and store one film roll in the pod. You then jettison the pod (attached to some seperatrons) for recovery. The capsule can withstand a 150m/s impact (I am not sure about the heat resistance - may need to change).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot transmit the film back, as it is film and must be recovered - like the Corona satellite missions.
