You were to be the Shadow Bearer of the Dark Lord, to carry his shadow from the M\u00FCn\u00A0to Kerbin to begin the Good Work. I searched for years to find just the right weak, fearful mind... Those other two were just supposed to be insurance. Edmund hid his little problem well, \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E didn\u0027t even know about it, but at least he proved useful.

But instead he \u003Cem\u003Eresisted\u003C/em\u003E, and was driven mad by the effort! It must have been excruciating. That\u0027s inhumane even by my rather lax standards.

I have worked, and schemed, for years, here in the shadows. I sent Chadvey to the M\u00FCn, I sent \u003Cem\u003Eyou\u003C/em\u003E to the M\u00FCn. And you derailed all my careful planning with nothing more than luck, and a fool. But you can\u0027t stop me. I am the grandmaster! You merely hastened the inevitable! It would have taken many years to disseminate the Master\u0027s Shadow enough on Kerbin to bring a ship here, instead you forced me accelerate my plans, and now the end is at hand.

It is a trained monkey doing tricks at my command! I own a 67% share! All prudently distributed across a dozen people who never existed. But I needn\u0027t have bothered with such minutia. It turns out when you simply tempt already rich executives with ridiculous sums of money, they\u0027re only too happy to lie, cheat, and steal. They\u0027re really quite good at it.

There\u0027s not much in the rack for pain, so I had the machine keep you out for a while.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain Edgas tried to blink away the fuzziness. He was floating, strapped loosely to the bed. His right arm was heavily bandaged, but still looked... less.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I wouldn\u0027t think too much on that if I were you,\u0022 Burdous said gently, \u0022this thing can do some amazing stuff, but it\u0027s programmed for emergencies, not reconstruction. We still have a long trip home.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh... you\u0027re hurt too,\u0022 Edgas said, noticing a bandage poking out from beneath Burdous\u0027s shirt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Bah, I\u0027m all right,\u0022 he said, \u0022didn\u0027t need that kidney anyway, it was always kind of a slacker.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMemories slowly began to trickle back, \u0022but... I saw him... how did you...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Had a self-healing mechanical counterpressure skin on under my suit, top secret Ussari prototype. I thought things might go bad, but...\u0022 he trailed off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I\u0027m... not sure what to say...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous chortled, staring at the wall, shaking his head, \u0022my own brother. Seems so obvious now, of course. I guess these things always do. He was never the same, after the temple in the desert. Became obsessed with finding the Kraken, or whatever he was calling it that week. I just saw a chance to get my engine built, I was as blind as anyone. And then Chadvey found that seal, or whatever, and--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EChadvey\u003C/em\u003E. \u0022Wait, Chadvey,\u0022 Edgas struggled to make a coherent thought, \u0022we have to go back. We can\u0027t just leave him there...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lander\u0027s out of fuel. I used up every last drop and then some getting \u003Cem\u003Eyou \u003C/em\u003Eback. I\u0027m not much of a pilot. I suppose I could rig it to run on hydrogen, but--\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022No...\u0022 Edgas said softly, thinking. \u003Cem\u003E...Ah\u0027ve so little concept of home anymore...\u003C/em\u003E He looked out the window at Jool. It seemed sad now, lonely. \u0022No, I... I think Chadvey would be happy to be where he is.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous smiled at him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022That\u0027s something you don\u0027t do much,\u0022 Edgas said.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What? Huh, I mean...\u0022 Fumbled Burdous, looking abashed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So... you don\u0027t hate me anymore?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous rolled his huge, rather bloodshot eyes, \u0022I\u0027ve seen you stand toe to toe with an eldritch abomination from outside reality, and\u003Cem\u003E punch it in the face\u003C/em\u003E. If it\u0027s all the same, I\u0027d prefer to stay on your good side. Only logical.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas just smiled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Jerdous was always fond of that Gerinish scripture quote of his, but he always left out the next stanza. I never understood why, until now.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas raised an eye... bulge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Again the voice said, \u0027come and see,\u0027 and I saw, and behold: from among the people, a Challenger stepped forth! Though he was weak of arm, his spear was like fire; and though he was frail of heart, his shield was like gold; and upon it were inscribed the words, QVIS VT LVX. Betrayer did speak lies unto him, to tempt him, but he was not swayed. I saw him stand alone before the Beast, and speak his name unto it, and with a mighty blow he struck it down. And for this, he was called Champion. And for this... he was called Hero.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas felt distinctly redder. His mind was going all fuzzy again. \u0022But... there\u0027s something I still don\u0027t understand.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Why a spoon?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Huh?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You said you\u0027d stab me with a spoon.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Er, yes, well, it\u0027s dull. It\u0027d hurt more.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Ah...\u0022 Reflected Edgas, \u0022you\u0027re pretty demented, you know.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA wicked grin cracked Burdous\u0027s face, \u0022only a demented mind could conceive an engine like\u003Cem\u003E this!\u003C/em\u003E\u0022 He shot his arms out wide... and promptly winced and grabbed at his bandaged side. \u0022Ow! Owowowowowowwwwww!\u0022 He tumbled weightlessly, grimacing. \u0022Can... can we go home now?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas opened his mouth to speak, and paused. He was very tired, and it was getting hard to think. Finally he said, \u0022no, not yet. There\u0027s some place we have to go first.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Where?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe grinned broadly, \u0022to the M\u00FCn, Burdous.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-08T02:57:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2018 02:57  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T06:42:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);\u0022\u003EChapter 44: Homecoming\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas watched from his bed in the medical bay as Jool slowly, ever so slowly, faded in the distance. The ship was quiet now, after the transfer burn. The lights were dimmed, Burdous had turned in and was (presumably) sleeping in his bunk. It had always impressed Edgas just how \u003Cem\u003Equiet\u003C/em\u003E this ship could be. Six months home. It seemed like such a long time, but even now they were moving incredibly fast. The phase angles were all wrong, the transfer orbit horridly inefficient, but even six months from Jool to Kerbin was incredible. \u003Cem\u003EStopping\u003C/em\u003E once they reached Kerbin would be another challenge, of course, but Edgas thought they could handle it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSix months. Chadvey had been right, a little vacation seemed spot on right about now. Edgas could use the rest. He looked down at the tangle of tubes and wires still attached to various unpleasant places. The machine\u00A0indicated he was healing remarkably well, but the two Kerbals had agreed it was best if he spent a few more days in the medical bay. He glanced at what he assumed was the twisted wreck of his right arm, under all those bandages. Healing remarkably well, except for that. That was... not. Edgas knew there would be some adjustments in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdjustments. That went for everyone, of course. Even if they didn\u0027t know it. Edgas sighed. No one would ever really know what had happened up here. They couldn\u0027t. Edgas hated the notion, but none the less agreed with it. If there was one thing he had learned, it was that reality was a fragile shell over the truth. Break that shell, show people what was really underneath... and bad things happened. It was trite, but most people couldn\u0027t handle the truth. That didn\u0027t make them bad people, it just made them...\u003Cem\u003Ehuman\u003C/em\u003E. Maybe one day they could, but not today. And not in six months. There were things beyond that shell that would try people\u0027s souls. Here, there be monsters. But there were also heroes. And that was the most important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHeroes. Yes, there were heroes. Chadvey. Dr. Kerman. Edmund. Burdous. Anastasia. Billy. People who were willing to stare into the darkness, to peek beneath that shell, to go seeking the monsters, face them, fight through the fear, and doubt, and uncertainty, and need for space-diapers... and punch them square in the face. Edgas didn\u0027t think he was a hero, but, he supposed, real heroes never did. There would be more darkness ahead, he knew that, and he would face it. But the darkness would do well to be afraid. Be very afraid.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDarkness. Jerdous had said, darkness was faster than light. And he wasn\u0027t wrong. The darkness would always be there first, waiting, abiding, scheming. Darkness \u003Cem\u003Ewas\u003C/em\u003E faster. But the light was \u003Cem\u003Estronger\u003C/em\u003E. No matter how deep and choking the darkness became, it could never extinguish the light. No matter how fast it moved, the darkness could never stop the light. And when the darkness was at its worst, when heroes failed and hope died, that is when the tiniest and most insignificant light blazed the brightest of all. In the end, darkness \u003Cem\u003Efeared\u003C/em\u003E the light... because it had nowhere to hide. Edgas still didn\u0027t understand it all. But he believed. He had \u003Cem\u003Eseen\u003C/em\u003E. He thought people like Chadvey... and Billy, who believed, but had not seen, were fortunate indeed. Edgas had a lot to think about, he was glad for the long trip home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHome. No happy homecoming awaited them. There would, of course, be hell to pay. There would be inquests, and commissions, and hearings. Fingers would be pointed, blame would be thrown, excuses would be proffered. Answers would be demanded, careers would be destroyed. There would be wailing, and gnashing of teeth. Oh yes, there would indeed be hell to pay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas would see to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-02-08T03:06:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2018 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T07:13:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(53,60,65);\u0022\u003EChapter 45: Shadows and M\u00FCndust (Reprise)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ESix months later...\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022What do you think it is, Ed?\u0022 Asked Burdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I don\u0027t know, Burdous.

They were standing at the base of a massive cubic structure that loomed over them. Whatever was on top, he couldn\u0027t make out. What was it made of? Stone? Metal? He couldn\u0027t tell. It seemed solid, eternal, lifeless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027d had to \u0022borrow\u0022 a lander to get down to the surface. It hadn\u0027t been very difficult. The Ussari crew wasn\u0027t inclined to argue. It seems, that when you had at your disposal what amounted to a half-kilometer-long nuclear-powered death ray, no one really felt like arguing with you. There would be some explaining to do, of course, but... they could get in line. The crew had happily petered off back to Kerbin in their odd little orbiter. Convincing MechIvan to change the landing coordinates, now \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E had been hard.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ussaris, the Administration, and the Company wouldn\u0027t be too happy about \u003Cem\u003Eanother\u003C/em\u003E stolen spacecraft, but they would shortly have other concerns. The encrypted thumb drive Burdous had finally decoded turned out to be the lynchpin. Records, names, account numbers, all leading back to Jerdous\u0027s shadow identities. And the missing data that tied them back to Jerdous himself. It was a sloppy mistake to leave it with all the others. Jerdous hadn\u0027t been in the habit of making sloppy mistakes. Getting that thumb drive where Edgas could find it, well, someone must have pulled some strings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe powers that be might not be in the mood to listen. Edgas would \u003Cem\u003Emake \u003C/em\u003Ethem listen. It was always said that Edmund Kerman had a lot of friends. Well, Chadvey had a lot of friends too. Edgas had a certain suspicion that Chadvey had left word with the right ones about exactly what they should do if an agitated, wide-eyed Kerbal showed up with a stolen space ship and crazy stories about space-beasts and grand conspiracies. The right people would listen. Edgas was sure of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if not, there was always the half-kilometer-long nuclear-powered death ray.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now, one task remained. The M\u00FCnbase was exactly as it had been when Edgas and the others left it nearly four years ago. Even their footprints were still there. And Isfjell 1, still fighting its endless, desperate battle against the darkness. It was short a solar panel now, probably from a micrometeoroid, but its floodlights still kept their solemn vigil. Edgas and Burdous didn\u0027t enter the base its self, there was no need. That was a labor for another time. They had come for the rover, and it still worked. Edgas had had no doubt. When Billy fixed something, why, it stayed fixed, by gum!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now they stood, in the same place Billy-Bobrim and Edmund had stood so long ago, before a massive structure on another world. Edgas was very tired. Even the low M\u00FCnar gravity was taking its toll on him after so long in space. The empty right arm of his suit ballooned out from his side, and bounced comically as he moved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022So... what now?\u0022 Asked Burdous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Come on,\u0022 Edgas said. Using his suit jets was difficult with only one hand, even after Burdous had modified the controls, but he managed to fly up to the top of the strange, cubic structure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Hey...\u0022 said Burdous, \u0022does that look an awful lot like a flag to you?\u0022 He was pointing to... something on top of the structure. There was an odd, dome-shaped object as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas just smiled, \u0022let\u0027s be done with it.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous nodded. He took out the flagpole he had brought, and unfolded it. Then he opened a container of Mystery Goo, gave the tip of the pole a good coating, and gripped it tight with both hands. With a final nod from Edgas, he jammed it with all his strength down into the anomaly. There was a tremor, Edgas felt... something... in his mind, but it was weak and feeble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Quickly now,\u0022 Edgas said. Burdous turned the knob on the flagpole. There was a \u003Cem\u003Ewhump\u003C/em\u003E, the flag popped out, and a puff of dust from the base. For a moment, just one fleeting moment, Edgas felt a scream, but then it was gone. It was angry, and hateful... and defeated. Then the two saw in amazement the flagpole slowly turn brilliant white from the base up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurdous poked at it hesitantly, \u0022it\u0027s... it\u0027s the same material as the seals! And look...\u0022 He pointed. Where the flagpole met the structure was a disc of pure white, inscribed with angular writing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022I... I can read it...\u0022 Burdous whispered, \u0022and there\u0027s a second line...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Well?\u0022 Just moving was difficult enough for Edgas, he couldn\u0027t bend over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Not dead which eternal lie, not ended but at an end.\u0022 Burdous was about to say more, when he pointed in amazement, \u0022your feet!

Over crevasses, across flat shelves, along towering cliffs, and past ephemeral drifts, until it reached a lonely collection of modules glazed in ice.

He rubbed absently at his right hand, at the little spot beneath the crescent-shaped scar in his palm where the bones had never been broken. His hand always ached when the wind blew like this, which was most of the time, but he didn\u0027t mind. It turns out, six months in zero-G did wonders for healing... that, and an infusion of Mystery Goo. It had taken a long time to regain strength in that arm, though. His door was closed, as it always was this time of the duty day.

At the top, since Edgas was quite fond of it, was one small medal. It said, \u040B\u0404\u042F\u0424 \u0424\u0492\u00A0\u0426SS\u0414\u042F\u0407 \u00A0\u0426\u0418\u0407\u0424\u0418, in their odd, not-quite-right script. Edgas had been more than a little surprised at that one, after everything. He\u0027d been surprised that Billy\u0027s sister, Billy\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eadopted\u003C/em\u003E sister, had been some sort of Ussari royalty.

He set his tablet down and looked to a small shelf opposite the window. On it were photographs of his friends, those still here and those who had moved on... and under a glass dome, was a small, gray, sparkly rock. It had taken a long time to track it down, packed away in a safety deposit box in a bank in Gednalna. He\u0027d had to pull some strings. Now he looked at it... and waited...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutside on the frigid ice sheet, the sun moved out from behind an obstruction, a sunbeam shone through the window and fell on the sparkly rock... and the small room lit up like a galaxy. A billion points of light danced, swirled, played across the walls, each one seeming to shine like a thousand suns, brilliant and beautiful. They swayed, and cavorted, and swirled, each one like a memory of light against which no darkness could stand, no darkness could hide. Edgas thought about his friends, how it was never truly dark here, up on the top of the world, and that had nothing to do with the latitude. Once you had seen that light, you could never be in darkness again. Against that light, darkness seemed a feeble and pitiable thing. The light was stronger. No matter how dark the darkness became, the light was stronger. And it could never be extinguished, not so long as one person was willing to stare into the darkness... and find the light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdgas believed, and understood. He watched the specks of light dance around the room, and he, Edgas Kerman, threw his head back and laughed for the joy of it. He laughed loud and heartily, like a person who was, perhaps, just a bit mad. But he \u003Cem\u003Eknew\u003C/em\u003E, now. It was so \u003Cem\u003Eobvious\u003C/em\u003E. He understood... and believed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOut on the ice, the sun moved back behind something, and the specks faded away. Edgas knew they weren\u0027t gone, they would always be there. And they would return just a few minutes later tomorrow. He looked over at the portraits of his friends.

He rubbed absently at his right hand, at the little spot beneath the crescent-shaped scar in his palm where the bones had never been broken. His hand always ached when the wind blew like this, which was most of the time, but he didn\u0027t mind. It turns out, six months in zero-G did wonders for healing... that, and an infusion of Mystery Goo. It had taken a long time to regain strength in that arm, though.

At the top, since Edgas was quite fond of it, was one small medal. It said, HERO OF USSARI UNION, in their odd, not-quite-right script. Edgas had been more than a little surprised at that one, after everything.

He looked at the clock, it was time. He set his tablet down and looked to a small shelf opposite the window. On it were photographs of his friends, those still here and those who had moved on... and under a glass dome, was a small, gray, sparkly rock. It had taken a long time to track it down, packed away in a safety deposit box in a bank in Gednalna. He\u0027d had to pull some strings.

A billion points of light danced, swirled, played across the walls, each one seeming to shine like a thousand suns, brilliant and beautiful. They swayed, and cavorted, and swirled, each one like a memory of light against which no darkness could stand, no darkness could hide. Edgas thought about his friends, how it was never truly dark here, up on the top of the world, and that had nothing to do with the latitude. Once you had seen that light, you could never be in darkness again. Against that light, darkness seemed a feeble and pitiable thing. The light was stronger. No matter how dark the darkness became, the light was stronger. And it could never be extinguished, not so long as one person was willing to stare into the darkness... and find the light. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdgas believed, and understood.
