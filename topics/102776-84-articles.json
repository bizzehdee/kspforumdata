Or, you may find this mod useful-- a single big 1000G antenna, specifically for the purposes of supporting large solar systems.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/153125-122-jx2antenna-v11-giant-1000g-antenna-for-big-solar-systems/\u0026do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Avalinx","CreatedById":174582,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-10T19:55:07Z","Content":"HOLY WATER it\u0027s back, i was waiting soo long for this update, thx for the awesome mod.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-06-11T14:36:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2017 02:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Frybert**"},{"CreatedByName":"Pxtseryu","CreatedById":200653,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-15T22:12:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/10/2017 at 3:55 PM, Avalinx said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E HOLY WATER it\u0027s back, i was waiting soo long for this update, thx for the awesome mod.\n\u003E \n\nWHY THE **gorilla** ARE YOU CENSORING LIKE THAT"},{"CreatedByName":"SAS123","CreatedById":15467,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-21T08:36:12Z","Content":"I see one of my favourite and one of the most talented planet makers is back...  \n\n\\*Handshakes KillAshley\\* Welcome Back o7 \u003C(Salute; Courtesy from Elite Dangerous)."},{"CreatedByName":"FeliusKerNes","CreatedById":115894,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T21:48:44Z","Content":"I like most of this except the changes of Kerbin and its moons, finding it annoying to have it as a moonless moon of Sonnah.

It would probably be easier to just use a different pack if you\u0027re after just a \u0022more planets\u0022 kind of thing (such as OPM or something), unless you really want these specific worlds, as this pack is designed to be a different system to create a new way to play."},{"CreatedByName":"SAS123","CreatedById":15467,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-07-04T05:30:06Z","Content":"[@KillAshley](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/128696-killashley/) If you need some ideas on things to work on, I have played New Horizons long enough that there are a few things that I\u0027ve noticed and thought of.\n\n1) I\u0027ve noticed a few of the Science Definitions are out of date especially for the mod DMagic.
