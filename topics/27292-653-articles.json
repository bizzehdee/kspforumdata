I realized that I had unlocked the Barometer since the last time I\u0027d updated the design of the vehicle, and its addition gave me just enough science points to get KIS connector ports unlocked. And also big orange tanks. Same node, see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I designed and launched a fuel module for the New Horizons space station orbiting Kerbin, and got it rendezvoused and docked up. I was then able to refuel the Raven 7 spaceplane also docked to the station at the time and then pull most of the remaining fuel out of the booster core still attached to the station, which was then jettisoned and sent plummeting back down to Kerbin. I hadn\u0027t put chutes on the thing and when I went to switch between the station and the Raven (which I\u0027d undocked by then) the game put me in control of the damn booster, which at that point was in atmo - the game wouldn\u0027t let me switch back. So I got to ride the thing all the way down like Slim Pickens. Some of the parts actually survived the crash at 130 m/s and I did get a recovery...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, after refueling the Raven, I looked at the station\u0027s compliment of visitors to see where their itineraries would take them. I had four of them whose destinations included Mun, so I went and ahead and loaded them into the Raven and had Jeb set a course. They\u0027ll head to Mun Port 7; there\u0027s a Mun Buggy 7 lander already docked to Mun Port, so the ones that are headed to the surface should be able to just head straight down once they\u0027re docked up. I\u0027m debating as to whether or not I should have Jeb wait to take them back towards Kerbin or if I should have him head on; I\u0027m leaning towards waiting, as I don\u0027t have a lot of other tourists heading towards Mun at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd with the connector port finally unlocked, I designed a rescue craft for Valentina and her batch of tourists currently stranded on Minmus. I didn\u0027t have any available pilots left, so Bill\u0027s in a Mk2 Lander Can with an OKTO core piloting the thing, with (hopefully) the necessary parts to get the tourists into the rescue ship stowed in KIS containers. The plan is to attach a winch to the rescue lander once it arrives on Minmus, connect a docking port and antenna to Val\u0027s crashed craft (to fulfill a contract to put an orbital outpost on Minmus, knock on wood), then attach a connector port to the crashed ship and plug in the winch cable. If the plan works, the game will consider the two craft docked - and will allow a transfer between modules to take place. I\u0027ve heard KIS folks talk about using pipes to \u0022liquefy their Kerbals\u0022 and move them around places...this I think would be akin to \u0022beaming\u0022 them.

I\u0027ve always wanted to write missions reports, but real life seems to always get in the way. That and lack of consistent will. Sigh. Well, I decided to finally give it a proper go, and I thought what better handrail than a forum challenge to guide me!

No schedule, no overarching format beyond the initial challenge; just letting the missions guide the writing and seeing where it goes!

No need for a midcourse correction, just straight into Minmus\u0027s SoI and to a fairly low orbit, and with plenty of fuel to spare.
