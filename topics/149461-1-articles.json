I\u0027ve been using mountains and hills to elevate my relay stations to allow a much longer communication link between stations. My question is, is it worth elevating a sea level relay station to increase range? Is the communication link drawn from the center of mass of the vehicle? So If I built a sea comms tower, balanced with a mass at the bottom, it would move the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E so low that the height would be irrelevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-07T22:09:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, one thing to bear in mind.\u00A0 By default, comm links can actually go \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethrough\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the planet (at least, a certain amount)-- for an atmospheric planet like Kerbin, the default setting is 0.75, i.e. it pretends like Kerbin\u0027s radius is only 75% of what it is, i.e. 450 km instead of 600 km.\u00A0 So unless you\u0027ve tinkered with that setting, it basically doesn\u0027t matter whether you\u0027re on a mountaintop or at sea level, since the elevation difference is trivial compared with your 150 km elevation above the \u0022radio horizon\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if you\u0027ve grabbed the slider and dragged it up to 1.0 so that the planet acts like a solid, radio-opaque sphere from sea level downwards, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethen\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E elevation makes a difference, in terms of how far one ground station can see another ground station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said:\u00A0 In that case, I don\u0027t know what position the game uses for determining \u0022position\u0022 for that calculation (e.g. does it use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E, or the antenna\u0027s position, or what).\u00A0 So, the answer is \u0022doesn\u0027t matter\u0022 if you haven\u0027t tinkered with the setting, and \u0022I don\u0027t know\u0022 if you have.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
