The text needs to be able to wrap around properly so that those who require larger text will be able to zoom in and still be able read the article.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPreviously, I had thought the problem was that the text overflow property was set so that it would horizontally scroll when the text was too wide, however there isn\u0027t even a horizontal scroll option this time. I\u0027m not entirely certain what the problem is, but taking a gander at some of the CSS shows a lot of \u0022white-space:nowrap\u0022 and \u0022text-overflow:hidden\u0022 properties, either of which could be contributing to this issue, though I haven\u0027t been able to track down exactly which one is being applied to the article container. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using Firefox 42.0 on Windows Vista, 1280x1024 resolution, btw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Just tried it in Chrome and IE, and it happens with both of them, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-10T01:10:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2015 01:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sidereus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"scifi6546","CreatedById":130550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T00:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have that bug to, thanks for noticing that, I am \u003Cem\u003Esure \u003C/em\u003Ethe developers will love to fix that bug.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-10T01:11:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScroll to the bottom of the page.
