The resulting orbit, which will have an apoapsis somewhat lower than half the height of the SOI, is what I try and capture into. I believe this gives me the maximum margin for error both ways. I can then make subsequent cautious aerobraking passes to lower my apoapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have the delta-V spare you could instead make a powered capture into an initial just-captured orbit, then make as many aerobraking passes as you like.
