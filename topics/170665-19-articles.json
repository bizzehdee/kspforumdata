He\u0027s referenced in a key event in the plot - I\u0027m certainly\u00A0not going to dispute that. Anakin\u0027s fall to the Dark side is pretty much the main plot point in the original trilogy and the prequels. But we already know about Anakin\u0027s fall after Episode IV and then we learn the truth about it in Episode V and have it confirmed in Episode VI. The fine details of \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E he fell (and Plagueis\u0027s rather indirect role in it)\u00A0aren\u0027t so important I don\u0027t think. Although it is interesting, at least to me! I\u0027ve always been a sucker for an origin story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve watched the video and yes - I agree that the \u0027Mary Sue\u0027 label is neither here nor there, as I mentioned earlier. And yes, the video has a point about Luke\u0027s abilities vs Rey\u0027s. I think the video makes rather too much of the supposed differences between Anakin (not a Mary Sue) and Rey (a Mary Sue) though and I disagree with it there. Anakin is rather more obviously flagged up as a Special Character is all. The point it makes about Anakin needing help with certain things (like politics) is true enough for example but so far Rey has only been put into a rather limited set of circumstances, usually involving fighting or running. Now (again as I mentioned earlier) I\u0027m quite happy to change my opinion based on what we see in the next film (it may turn out that Rey really is better at everything than everyone else although I really hope not) but for the moment I\u0027m sticking with my opinion that she\u0027s not a Mary Sue. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also disagree that there\u0027s no reason presented for some of her skills, particularly her ability with a lightsaber, although this might just be my take on the films. When we first meet Rey in Episode VII, we see her armed with a staff and able to fight with it quite effectively. Now, fighting with a lightsaber isn\u0027t going to be an awful lot like fighting with a staff but at least there\u0027s a reason given for her agility, physical condition and ability to handle melee weapons. I\u0027m wondering if Rey\u0027s fighting abilities are analogous to Anakin\u0027s piloting abilities - they\u0027re both the way in which the Force initially manifests itself in them and to some extent they\u0027re dictated by circumstances - Anakin uses racing as a way out of the worst of his slavery, whereas Rey is a lone female on a fairly hostile world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow this is where I wander off into the weeds a bit but hopefully some of this is backed up by established canon. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0We know that aggression and anger are portrayed as making\u00A0a Force user powerful but are also seen as the path to the Dark Side. We\u0027re told as much by Yoda in Episode V and that\u0027s consistent with Luke\u0027s fighting abilities in Episode VI. When he rescues Han, he\u0027s on the offensive, going for the fight - despite Yoda\u0027s admonition that a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense. Similarly it\u0027s only when Vader threatens to turn Leia in their final battle that Luke loses his cool - and becomes angry enough to defeat Vader. His real victory is of course realising what he\u0027s doing and consciously deciding to stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow - whenever we see Rey fighting in Episodes VII and VIII she\u0027s almost invariably - and very visibly - angry. She\u0027s taken the easy path - the Darker path - to power and it makes her strong despite her lack of (or near lack of) formal training. After all - how much training does it take to get angry with someone. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m thinking that fighting using the Force is comparatively easy. Trust your feelings, let go and the Force will flow within you. Ultimately that does have to be tempered with some control and this (I hope) is something that we\u0027ll see Rey learning. However, fighting like a \u003Cem\u003EJedi\u003C/em\u003E is not at all easy. First of all you must suppress those oh-so-useful feelings of anger and aggression in a fight (and not feeling aggressive in a fight strikes me as being pretty hard \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0)\u00A0along with the power they lend you. Then you must also find your own power in calm logic and conscious control rather than giving in to emotion.\u00A0That\u0027s tricky for any skill - if you\u0027ve acquired a skill to the point where you have muscle memory for it, then thinking too hard about what you\u0027re doing can actually be detrimental. So a fighting Jedi is simultaneously juggling two or three conflicting requirements whilst under a great deal of pressure. \u003Cem\u003EThat \u003C/em\u003EI can well imagine takes a lot of training to do well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not what Rey is doing though. She\u0027s taking the easy path, which is why she appears to be so impressive with so little training.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MiffedStarfish","CreatedById":175356,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-05T19:59:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223260486\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168580\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515181937\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166940\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Earthlinger\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, Earthlinger said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello all\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have yet to watch the movie\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.ca/url?sa=i\u0026amp;rct=j\u0026amp;q=\u0026amp;esrc=s\u0026amp;source=images\u0026amp;cd=\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC9cLNy8HYAhWCFywKHdlTBjMQjRwIBw\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflip.com%2Fmemegenerator%2FI-Too-Like-To-Live-Dangerously\u0026amp;psig=AOvVaw1ZJJ-aFGddlz_nQ9bK121a\u0026amp;ust=1515268026738797\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Image result for live dangerously meme\u0022 height=\u0022320\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgflip.com/s/meme/I-Too-Like-To-Live-Dangerously.jpg\u0022 style=\u0022margin-top:46px;\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut actually, I just wanted to ask if the movie is good, because most people seem to either love it or hate it.

I think the video makes rather too much of the supposed differences between Anakin (not a Mary Sue) and Rey (a Mary Sue) though and I disagree with it there. Anakin is rather more obviously flagged up as a Special Character is all. The point it makes about Anakin needing help with certain things (like politics) is true enough for example but so far Rey has only been put into a rather limited set of circumstances, usually involving fighting or running. Now (again as I mentioned earlier) I\u0027m quite happy to change my opinion based on what we see in the next film (it may turn out that Rey really is better at everything than everyone else although I really hope not) but for the moment I\u0027m sticking with my opinion that she\u0027s not a Mary Sue. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also disagree that there\u0027s no reason presented for some of her skills, particularly her ability with a lightsaber, although this might just be my take on the films. When we first meet Rey in Episode VII, we see her armed with a staff and able to fight with it quite effectively. Now, fighting with a lightsaber isn\u0027t going to be an awful lot like fighting with a staff but at least there\u0027s a reason given for her agility, physical condition and ability to handle melee weapons. I\u0027m wondering if Rey\u0027s fighting abilities are analogous to Anakin\u0027s piloting abilities - they\u0027re both the way in which the Force initially manifests itself in them and to some extent they\u0027re dictated by circumstances - Anakin uses racing as a way out of the worst of his slavery, whereas Rey is a lone female on a fairly hostile world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow this is where I wander off into the weeds a bit but hopefully some of this is backed up by established canon. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0We know that aggression and anger are portrayed as making\u00A0a Force user powerful but are also seen as the path to the Dark Side. We\u0027re told as much by Yoda in Episode V and that\u0027s consistent with Luke\u0027s fighting abilities in Episode VI. When he rescues Han, he\u0027s on the offensive, going for the fight - despite Yoda\u0027s admonition that a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense. Similarly it\u0027s only when Vader threatens to turn Leia in their final battle that Luke loses his cool - and becomes angry enough to defeat Vader. His real victory is of course realising what he\u0027s doing and consciously deciding to stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow - whenever we see Rey fighting in Episodes VII and VIII she\u0027s almost invariably - and very visibly - angry. She\u0027s taken the easy path - the Darker path - to power and it makes her strong despite her lack of (or near lack of) formal training. After all - how much training does it take to get angry with someone. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m thinking that fighting using the Force is comparatively easy. Trust your feelings, let go and the Force will flow within you. Ultimately that does have to be tempered with some control and this (I hope) is something that we\u0027ll see Rey learning. However, fighting like a \u003Cem\u003EJedi\u003C/em\u003E is not at all easy. First of all you must suppress those oh-so-useful feelings of anger and aggression in a fight (and not feeling aggressive in a fight strikes me as being pretty hard \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0)\u00A0along with the power they lend you. Then you must also find your own power in calm logic and conscious control rather than giving in to emotion.\u00A0That\u0027s tricky for any skill - if you\u0027ve acquired a skill to the point where you have muscle memory for it, then thinking too hard about what you\u0027re doing can actually be detrimental. So a fighting Jedi is simultaneously juggling two or three conflicting requirements whilst under a great deal of pressure. \u003Cem\u003EThat \u003C/em\u003EI can well imagine takes a lot of training to do well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not what Rey is doing though.

When she wasn\u0027t reminded of the force we tapped into her former self and began to remember. Especially when Kylo said the word force. It would trigger her mind to use all her trained power. THIS WOULD DESTROY THE ENITRE ARUGUEMNT OF A MARY SUE! It would make complete sense. She has a higher than normal force ability but inst over powered but instead was trained and \u0022forgot\u0022 She was still not proficient but used her former knowledge to her ability. In Ep 8 this would be revealed on Ach To. Luke would still be a grumpy person and say the Jedi would end but instead would help her develop her abilities like Mace Windu. Using the Dark and the Light But for the benifit of others. She would be pretty much in terms of light and dark Mace Windu. This way Luke sets up the 3rd Jedi Order in the canon The Users of the light and the dark for Lightside ideals such as mercy, compassion, \u00A0etc. This way Luke isn\u0027t wasted. Rey has a legitimate reason for her power. Also further adding some obstacles in her path like the inability to remember her former training and self and the Luke Temple and such would be nice to make her more relatable to the Audiance. Lastly a scene would be her about to be killed By Kylo Because she was arrogant when he strikes she falls of the edge of a railing. Into a escape pod. Kylo Jumps down as the door closes. The lightsaber penitrates the pod and goes down her arm into her bone verticly so her arm is stil, attached but useless. The pod fires as this happens. This requires a Cybernetic Arm. This way it shows she isn\u0027t perfect and needs to study more and also shows some physical trama for her Hero Status. This would make Rey into SUCH A BETTER CHARACTER in my Opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurther to represent her Balance of Light and Dark.

First of all you must suppress those oh-so-useful feelings of anger and aggression in a fight (and not feeling aggressive in a fight strikes me as being pretty hard \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0)\u00A0along with the power they lend you. Then you must also find your own power in calm logic and conscious control rather than giving in to emotion.\u00A0That\u0027s tricky for any skill - if you\u0027ve acquired a skill to the point where you have muscle memory for it, then thinking too hard about what you\u0027re doing can actually be detrimental.

She isn\u0027t fighting with discipline or focus - not consciously at any rate. Instead she just gives in to her feelings and lets go. The Force does the rest after that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you do have a point about being taught to use the Force - but established canon on that is \u003Cem\u003Eextremely\u003C/em\u003E woolly anyway. I mean, Obi-Wan\u0027s method of teaching Luke to use it was to cover his eyes (because they can deceive) and tell him to reach out with his feelings. Besides, the Force is just a label - I\u0027m not sure you need to know what its called in order to use it. And from Episode VIII we know that Rey has always had something powerful inside her and has been frightened of it. Luke\u0027s lesson helps her see that the force inside her is the same thing as the Force that she perceives all around her. At that point I can only imagine (again, this is just my interpretation) that using it becomes a lot easier, once she\u0027s no longer afraid of it and can fully trust it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso a genuine question - do we ever see Rey \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E a mind trick? We see her resisting Ren\u0027s interrogation and in a twisted sort of way I can imagine that being a very short sharp lesson in Force mind tricks but that really is just my interpretation! For that matter - do we ever see Luke being trained in mind tricks? It\u0027s possible that he\u0027s taught them off-screen somewhere but its not obvious. He\u0027s definitely acquired the ability by the start of Episode VI though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCanonically, I\u0027m thinking\u00A0that quite a lot of Jedi abilities are self-taught. A classic example is in the Return of the Jedi book - in the final battle, Luke starts off by being able to deflect the Emperor\u0027s lightning before being overwhelmed by it. The book outright states that he\u0027s never heard of such a perversion of the Force - but he realises that if something is Force generated then it can be Force repelled. So repel it he does, at least to begin with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally - levitation. That is the one Jedi skill that I can imagine relies more on raw powah than anything else. You\u0027ll note that we didn\u0027t see Rey lifting eggs or anything that requires delicate handling and control. Although admittedly\u00A0my argument would be more convincing if she\u0027d just thrown the rocks away at the end of the film rather than stacking them up neatly! And umm, summoning a lightsaber requires control. OK, forget this argument!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut comparing her to Luke? Luke\u00A0failing to lift the X-wing was his lesson that he still wasn\u0027t fully trusting the Force. To him it seemed like an impossible feat - and therefore it was. Whereas Rey was able to lift the rocks because she\u0027d fully accepted the Force at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYours is a fair point though - I can just rationalise it away in a way that I\u0027m comfortable with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit. Good point also about the advanced physics. However, I\u0027m not sure if even the greatest Jedi masters truly \u003Cem\u003Eunderstand\u003C/em\u003E the Force. They can use it in exquisitely subtle ways but whether they understand \u003Cem\u003Ehow\u003C/em\u003E it does what it does is an open question I think. \u00A0To use an analogy from my own writing, it\u0027s a bit like you or me simply moving an arm. You can explain it in great detail in terms of the molecular basis of muscle action and nerve impulse transmission but that\u0027s different to\u00A0understanding how I, the conscious entity, decides to move an arm and then makes that happen.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-05T20:49:06Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2018 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cheif Operations Director","CreatedById":183218,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-05T20:51:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/61025-ksk/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002261025\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/61025-ksk/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@KSK\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe uses a mind trick against A storm trooper in Ep VII.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes They might be self taught but not that early into Jedihood.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe is the only Jedi\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003EEVER\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0To not need a master or a freind to do the journey together with.
