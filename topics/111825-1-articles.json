I understand that my current turbojets just have power up to 17km; is that because of the RAM intakes giving up at that height? Could I thus go higher with turbojets once I have Shock Cones? Asking hypothetically the other way around; would Rapiers, which supposedly have power still at 20km, also work with just RAM intakes instead of Shock Cones?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T19:01:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falkenherz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"n0xiety","CreatedById":143324,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:42:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust so you know rapier works better at high altitude and speeds passing 1000m/s. I have planes that can go over 30k and stay there with 1400m/s. I use the ram with an engine cooler generally. I don\u0027t know why but engine cooler works great at high altitude or i feel like it does. I really feel like the engine cooler takes the heat from the intake its connected to and radiate it much faster. The main difference between ram and shockcone i see is that the ram is lighter and more temperature resistant. But don\u0027t let this fool you because it really doesn\u0027t matter that it has more temperature ressistance since it is lighter and has less heat conduction to the part it is connected to, thus the ram intake generally is the first thing to overheat and explode.

Shock cone is better than ram in terms of drag. The difference is quite alot actually. For reducing the tail drag you can place a shock cone over rapier and then clip the shockcone inside the engine untill you can\u0027t see the white part at the side of the shock cone. Don\u0027t clip more than that. This will allow the thrust to pass from openings of the shockcone and reduce the tail drag \u002B it will give you some more air for high altitudes. Try it i know it sounds strange but it actually works something like rapierspike.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T14:37:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what do you think of structural intakes ? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFurther more, I\u0027m not sure the open/close do anything anymore.

I feel like it takes away the heat from the shockcone and directs it onto other parts which in turn allows more time while you are gaining speed under 20k. Oh just noticed that the clipped shock cone i mentioned before does improve stability too. Had a very unstable plane and now it seems to be quite stable with the clipped shockcone over rapier. Further testing needed for sure. But the clipped shockcone shows its benefits after you pass 500m/s. Before that it slows you down a bit because of the extra weight but after you pass that point the gain is about %10.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T15:28:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Warzouz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Warzouz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd what do you think of structural intakes ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnderstand that only 2 things matter about intakes: intake area and drag. The amount of IntakeAir resource is pretty meaningless. Jet engines consume 2 resources: LF and IntakeAir. The game thus handles IntakeAir just like any other fuel, meaning you need a \u0022fuel tank\u0022 of IntakeAir. That\u0027s what the IntakeAir capacity of an intake is, the size of this \u0022fuel tank\u0022. So basically, all intakes are \u0022fuel tanks\u0022 that grow their own \u0022fuel\u0022. The bigger the intake area, the faster the intake \u0022grows\u0022 IntakeAir in any given set of circumstances (altitude, speed, etc.). As long as the intake \u0022grows\u0022 IntakeAir faster than the engine consumes it, the engine will keep running, and the size of the \u0022fuel tank\u0022 doesn\u0027t matter. Once the air gets so thin that production is less than consumption, the engine will flame out very quickly because the total \u0022tankage\u0022 of IntakeAir from many intakes isn\u0027t big enough to keep it going more than a few seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen there\u0027s drag, which you can\u0027t see without looking at part config files. Drag limits both speed and acceleration. Too much drag and you can\u0027t go supersonic at all, and in any case more drag means more time needed to reach any given speed, which means more fuel consumed, which means maybe not reaching orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs things stand now in 1.0.2, the ram intake has a slightly higher intake area than the shock cone, but the shock cone has a bit less drag and can stand higher temperatures. Assuming you fly a good ascent path, the temperature should never be an issue with either, so it comes down to intake area vs. drag. This means that a ram intake can fly slightly higher than a shock cone but the shock cone has an easier time getting there. In practice, however, I haven\u0027t noticed any significant difference between them. The same ship, differing only in the type of intake, flies essentially the same. Thus, for actual intake use, it\u0027s really just a question of aesthetics. That said, as others have mentioned, the shock cone can be used as a tail cone for drag reduction. But as for actual use as an intake, it\u0027s really a matter of taste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as to the structural intakes, with 1.0.2 air, both structural intakes and the old \u0022hood scoop\u0022 radial intakes are bad for supersonic planes. They add far more drag than their miniscule extra amount of intake area is worth. I only use them on subsonic planes as their only intakes. If you need a bit more intake area for your SSTO, it\u0027s way better to use the \u0022precooler\u0022 than structural intakes. More intake area for less drag, plus a bit of extra fuel. And note, the \u0022precooler\u0022 does NOT have anything to do with cooling. It\u0027s just another type of 1.25m inline fuel tank with an intake on it. It\u0027s just got straight sides so is more friendly to radial attachment, and less drag than the other types of fuel-tanks-with-intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-05T07:51:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, my SSTO uses 2 ram intakes and 16 structural intakes for 2 rapiers and 1 turbojet.
