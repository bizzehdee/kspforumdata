Yay! Here we go! Unfortunately, about a quarter of the way through the trip, the encounter suddenly... goes away. Nothing important, right? It\u0027s probably just the timewarp-inaccuracy thing. It\u0027ll correct itself, right... ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, as Duna got closer and closer, nothing happened.

How close was your encounter? Sometimes small movements in on your vessel can \u003Cem\u003Every\u003C/em\u003E slightly change your orbit, which in turn, screws up your approach.
