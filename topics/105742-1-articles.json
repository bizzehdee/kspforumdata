I\u0027m very happy with what Squad was \\*trying\\* to do for 1.0, they just desperately needed more time to test and tweak it. Hopefully putting it in the hands of tens of thousands of players has accelerated this testing process.\n\nSo I\u0027m super excited and anticipate that 1.0.1 or 1.0.2 will be a most awesome version. I\u0027m hoping they can get together the most glaring fixes and push 1.0.1 out within a week (or, even better, this week), with any remaining bugs getting stomped with 1.0.2 if necessary.

A single turbo ramjet is more powerful than most rocket engines, and will very easily and extremely quickly turn your ship into molten slag blazing through the atmosphere at Mach 3. Perhaps a bit of thrust nerf?\n\nParts impacting water induces much, much, MUCH more lag than it used to, **especially** when they explode or get damaged.\n\nParts exploding low-atmosphere due to overheating also induce incredulous amounts of lag.\n\nWhen you switch from Map to Vessel view, you can see your orbit line and a ghosted image of your orbit, fading nearly instantly. Dunno why this happens, but it\u0027s ugly.\n\nSorry for being one of many, but career mode is still a bit of a grind in Hard mode (Though much, much better!), but only because of the building price. Perhaps \u0022hard\u0022 mode could simply mean increased penalties if you fail, harder missions, and increased rewards? Instead of increased penalties and decreased rewards, and the standard missions?\n\nEarly on in career mode, strategies are nearly useless, and that is when you need them the most. Though I like the nerfed rewards (First thing I tried to do was get \u0022Outsourced R\u0026D\u0022 (The one that does Funds-\u003EScience), and found that it was nerfed to hell, much approval on my part), you basically cannot get any rewards now."},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T00:12:46Z","Content":"I\u0027m hyped for fixes for bugs that should have been caught by the Experimentals team."},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T01:03:31Z","Content":"Discussion threads are boring.
