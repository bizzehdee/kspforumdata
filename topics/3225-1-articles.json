It is setup so that you can pop the chute before the final capsule decoupler and optionally use it to assist an otherwise powered landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first shot at this ended in a futile attempt at a powered water landing.

It is about the biggest ship my setup with current settings will handle and stutters quite a bit for the first minute or two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck and have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Would prefer to rank by mass or price but those don\\\u0027t show up in the mission reports (yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"icefire","CreatedById":5242,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-26T10:30:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy would a lunar lander have a parachute and winglets.

The parachute would be there regardless for parachute landing on the return trip. If someone gets too frustrated with trying to land fully powered, the staging order is such that, for this challenge, the parachute can be popped to make it a bit easier - still by no means a sure thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Munar landings, the winglets would be replaced by RCS units to allow for lateral thrust. In fact, I\\\u0027d not argue a bit if someone wanted to replace the winglets with RCS units for this challenge. I gaurantee it\\\u0027ll be far more challenging. Regardless, landing on the Mun is going to be much different than landing on Kerbin due to lack of atmosphere and much lower gravity, so simulation is not what this challenge is about, rather it\\\u0027s a mock run with a similar sized payload and a powered (or power assisted) landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT/ADDITION:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter doing some tests today, the following landing craft is offered as an alternative for those offended by the first design as well as for those looking for a harder challenge. This lander has two stages, the uppermost will not be used in the challenge it is just payload, in an actual Munar landing it would be the return vehicle. The bottom stage has RCS units instead of the original version\\\u0027s winglets. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce again, all vanilla except for Captain Slug\\\u0027s Landing Legs.
