You need at least 6 working in tandem to start doing interesting things. 10 if you want really interesting things. So far, I\u0027ve only seen optical and spin-resonance systems manage that. There\u0027s also that D-Wave QC, but it\u0027s Adiabatic, which is very limited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is encouraging, though. If they can make a gate, odds are, someone will figure out how to make multi-spin system that actually does something useful soon enough.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
