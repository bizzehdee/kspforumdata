You guys can call me Zed. I\u0027m a 22-year-old artist and aspiring graphic novelist with Asperger\u0027s Syndrome, and I must say that Kerbal Space Program is incredible - Finally, an aeronautics simulator that flexes your creative muscles and has a witty sense of humor! Praises and applause aside, what really interests me the most on this forum is designing concepts for future builds, mods and patches for the game. I have a Kerb-load of ideas for KSP and I will happily share them with my fellow Kerbonauts!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rich","CreatedById":17874,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T20:33:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E, hopefully we will see some of your designs appearing in the Spacecraft Exchange sometime soon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Engineering,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERich\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-01T21:29:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello from a fellow Aspie!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
