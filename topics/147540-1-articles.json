A simple text box that lets me manually enter the design amount saves me quite a bit of trouble having to faff about with the horrible, horrible sliders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor lights, why do we have to deal with RGB values in decimal? Just let us enter a value from 0-FF or 0-255 so we can get the lights in any standard hex color code. Why can\u0027t we adjust colors on lights placed with Symmetry enabled asymmetrically? Sure, it\u0027s a cosmetic item, but dammit, I want my disco pimp plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like how engines can have their gimbals adjusted for control authority in all three axes independently. Why can\u0027t control surfaces have the same configurability? The elevons at my wingtips have crazy roll input at full deflection that I want to scale back, but maybe I want them at full authority for pitch commands. And for that matter, why can\u0027t they be enabled/disabled via Action Group?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSpeaking of Action Groups, making them editable in-flight would do wonders in the quality-of-life department. There are quite a few smaller craft I\u0027ve carried into orbit as payloads of a larger vessel, and those craft don\u0027t have Action Groups because giving them groups would interfere with those of the carrier craft. Same story goes for on-orbit construction projects, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheEpicSquared","CreatedById":158667,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-13T19:23:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll of these suggestions are brilliant and I cannot think of why they should not be in the game already. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OrbitalBuzzsaw","CreatedById":158329,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-13T19:45:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.
