I\u0027m a fairly experienced KSP player who\u0027s got a moon base, a fully scanned Kerbin and Mun, no mining rig thingies yet (Karbonite is kinda tricky to understand), uhhhhmmm, and an untouched Minmus. I should really go there. I mostly play sandbox, but career is nice. Oh, I have some satellites and a Mass Relay. (Danny has taught me well :3).\n\nYeeeeaaaah stuff. Not sure what I should say here. Don\u0027t add.. eehhhhh... things. What DON\u0027T you add to rockets in KSP? Nothing. That\u0027s the answer.\n\nI better stop rambling now.\n\nCheers!\n\nI\u0027m also from Murica.

This needs inspection. And written down coordinates.\n\nUpon further inspection, after quickloading, the game was super slow cuz my rig disappeared, and when I crashed into the rig, the game crashes.
