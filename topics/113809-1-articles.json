Anyway this is what I saw. It looks like *every* craft I had, with a heat shield and a decoupler on that heat shield, became uncontrollable in a very peculiar way. If I attempted to \u0022fly\u0022 that craft, then:\n\n1. some parts of the craft would appear in strange places,\n2. no aspect of the craft would appear controllable, I could right-click on parts and observe their status but the usual buttons would not appear,\n3. no crew would appear to the bottom right,\n4. if at real time (no warp), time would stand still both in terms of MET, and the crafts position would not change one jot,\n5. if I used warp forward the camera would focus on the \u0022root\u0022 part (whatever that might be) while the remainder of the craft appeared to \u0022fly\u0022 behind it (as if the \u0022root\u0022 part was still in orbit, but the remainder of the craft had undergone a total dead stop),\n6. it was totally irresponsive to all commands,\n7. Kerbin appeared to be a flat white circle if close, and turn into concentric white circles with transparent regions if further away (see pictures).\n\nAll crafts without heat shields attached to decouplers were unaffected, and appear (so far) to be working normally. (The heat shield/decoupler thing could be a red-herring for all I know, it\u0027s just the only common factor between all these craft that I saw, that was not shared by other craft that continued to work fine.)\n\nUnfortunately, the ones with heat shields attached to were *also* my crewed craft. So this was incredibly annoying, because I thought for a second I\u0027d have no choice but to declare my dozens of in flight kerbals dead. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) See some pics (linked, not IMGed to keep the post short):\n\n[Image 1](http://s48.photobucket.com/user/SZKP2021/media/KSP%20103/2015-06-22_00001_zpsvafuf78i.jpg.html): Here is one where the center of my craft got \u0022shoved\u0022 to the side (note the gap in the middle, and the fuel tank that \\*had\\* been there hanging off the side to the right):\n\n[Image 2](http://s48.photobucket.com/user/SZKP2021/media/KSP%20103/2015-06-22_00002_zpsmfeggkvc.jpg.html): Here is one where my craft was kind of just generally screwed up, and uncontrollable. This one was especially heartbreaking because it had a *lot* of science on it, with the reusable landers having visited all biomes on Minmus, and all but four biomes on the Mun. The weird white circle is where Kerbin should be.\n\n[Image 3](http://s48.photobucket.com/user/SZKP2021/media/KSP%20103/2015-06-22_00003_zps4nuqspx1.jpg.html): Here is a space station in LKO. Note that Kerbin shows up as a flat white circle.\n\nCombined, all of my \u0022ruined\u0022 craft had 45 kerbals on them, and a total of 9039.5 recovered science from the Mun and Minmus. So it\u0027s a good thing I know how to edit the save files. (I\u0027ve had to edit save files to work around bugs before, but this was by far the most extreme. I built an empty craft on the pad with lots of hitchhiker seats, \u0022moved\u0022 the kerbals and science into it from wherever they had been, then recovered the craft.) Otherwise I probably would have had to stop playing KSP for a good few months, because that would have been so heartbreaking.\n\nAs it is, it was mostly immersion breaking to have to \u0022edit\u0022 people into a situation where I could possibly rescue them. Shocking at first -- when I thought I\u0027d lost everyone and 9000\u002B science, the product of probably man-days of effort, I felt actually like I\u0027d been punched in the stomach -- but I feel better now that I\u0027ve made a successful recovery through hax. And now I\u0027m filled with a bit of glee that I have 9500 total science to spend. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI run Windows 8.1, 32-bit KSP, and my mods are EngineerRedux, Kerbal Alarm Clock, and Contracts Window. I haven\u0027t seen any reports of this, and I think people would be slightly more vocal if they had seen I saw, so am I actually unique?"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T05:53:02Z","Content":"[http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3asi15/uncontrollable_craft_kraken_fix/](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/3asi15/uncontrollable_craft_kraken_fix/)\n\nIf your craft had a heat shield, apply that fix to it."},{"CreatedByName":"PKing Zombie Spy","CreatedById":144850,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T06:27:19Z","Content":"Thank you.
