Getting the ratios right can be difficult since in both cases liquid fuel is required- pack too much oxidiser and you\u2019re carrying around dead weight, pack too little and you could run out. All this assumes you\u2019re in an atmosphere with oxygen in it, which Eve and Duna don\u2019t have; propellers are useful here, but their top speed is limited.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne reason for using NERVs on spaceplanes is that they simplify the fuel arrangements significantly by removing the oxidiser requirement. You\u2019ll still need some \u201Cproper\u201D rockets to boost out of the atmosphere due to the NERV\u2019s low thrust, but if you\u2019re already using Rapiers then that\u2019s taken care off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe real question is, what is this spaceplane for? Carrying all that plane-related gubbins about with you will eat into your delta-V margins and unless you\u2019re going somewhere with an atmosphere they\u2019re just dead weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-28T12:03:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224083217\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206627\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221643345098\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201493\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022miklkit\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, miklkit said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAck!\u00A0 I was not notified that there were replies.\u00A0 Apologies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n@18watt -\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1)\u00A0 All my spaceplanes are staged like that, and there is a reason.\u00A0 The Rapiers and NERVs must be separated or the burn times given will be waaay off.\u00A0 I place the NERVs in the 1st stage to get accurate burn time readings in space, and the Rapiers are in the 2nd stage because they have to go somewhere.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2)\u00A0 The Rapiers are toggled on and off with action group 1, mode is toggled in AG 2, and the NERVs are toggled on and off with AG 3.\u00A0 The Rapiers are set to air breathing by default.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should not have posted that 2nd screenie as it shows the m/s of the air breathing Rapiers.\u00A0 Perhaps this one illustrates my issue better.\u00A0 It is the same spaceplane heading out under NERV power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MYrmV7j.jpg\u0022 title=\u0022Enlarge image\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MYrmV7j.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022502\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MYrmV7j.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I am trying to find out is the actual m/s of these spaceplanes to see if they have the range to do a round trip to Eve and Duna.\u00A0 They should be able to get there, but I don\u0027t know if they can make it back.\u00A0 The m/s readings vary from around 1400m/s to almost 6000 m/s with full tanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe readings seem very correct. you are using nervs, so you hare making full use of your liquid fuel and high isp. the staging is set to use the rapiers after the nervs are exhausted;
