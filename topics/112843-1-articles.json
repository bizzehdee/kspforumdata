I think all instances were while I was just leaving kerbin\u0027s orbit but not sure. Cannot reproduce at will as I\u0027ve found no correlation with anything. Happens just when I drop out of time warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, this happened twice on 2 different rovers with 2 different kinds of wheels - sometimes the wheels start generating torque. Might have happened more since it would only be noticeable when on really low gravity bodies. My instances were on ike and dres. Both times I was driving somewhere and the battery ran out and then the rovers started tumbling (in the wheels direction). After a while, they tumbled into a position where the bug wheel didn\u0027t have enough torque to keep moving so I could timewarp, recover some battery and turn on SAS which killed the tumble but as soon as I turned off SAS it started again. As I later found out, breaking the faulty wheel stops the tumbling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, this one is very consistent - The ore extractors work way better then they are supposed to, most of the time. I had a drilling ship go kerbin-\u0026gt;mun-\u0026gt;gilly-\u0026gt;ike, on mun the drill worked as expected but on gilly and ike, I got a full tank the instant I started drilling. If I dump the ore, it instantly mines it back again. If I disengage the drill and reengage then it works as normal. Later, I had another ship go kerbin-\u0026gt;mun-\u0026gt;gilly-\u0026gt;moho and the same happened on gilly and moho and even later, I took some more missions to transport ore from gilly or ike to eve or duna orbit and again same. So.. this could be something to do with those orbital bodies or the drill (since I have not tried to have a second drilling in kerbins sphere of influence). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFourth, not sure if this is a bug or by technological shortcomings - not all parts behind a heat shield are protected from the heat. Happens with radial mounted objects only and seems totally random, had to spend a lot of time moving parts around in my rovers by trial/error to find a place for them behind the landing shield so they wouldn\u0027t blow up during atmospheric descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027t\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
