I\u0027m talking real hardware... I have been interested in something for retro gaming, and got the idea to find some old laptops to mess around with. I picked them up on eBay for a decent price. The first one I\u0027ve already received, taken apart, formatted, installed DOS 6.22 and Windows 3.1 and some games etc. The second is still in the mail and is slightly newer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first is a Digital DECpc 425SE. It\u0027s got a blazing fast 25mhz 486SX, 8mb of RAM, and the original (as far as I can tell) WD 170mb hard drive. I\u0027ve had to transfer everything to it via floppy disk so I don\u0027t have any big games on it, and the screen refresh is a little disappointing being passive matrix. It also has no onboard sound except the PC speaker. When I received this computer it had Windows 95 which was pretty sluggish, and is partly why I downgraded it. The computer is from 1994 and was used at the Digital corporation, it has a \u0022Property of\u0022 sticker on the bottom with an employee name and badge number, and Windows 95 said \u0022Digital Internal Use Only\u0022 before the login. Not to worry, this company is long gone along with 99% of information and parts for this computer so I\u0027m crossing my fingers that nothing goes wrong. Because of the screen I\u0027ve been avoiding the first person shooters but it seems to run fine. I grew up with computers from this era so it\u0027s pretty nostalgic and entertaining to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA friend jokingly asked me if this computer would run KSP and I had a mental image of hitting the floor it button, going to sleep, waking up and hitting space, waiting two days and putting a roll of coins on the D key to start my gravity turn...

It has the 133mhz Pentium 1 and 40mb of RAM (8mb onboard) and I believe it came with Windows 95 preinstalled, but it has no hard drive at the moment. I\u0027d like to set that one up with a dual compact flash to IDE adapter to dual boot Windows 95 and Dos6.22/Win3.1.
