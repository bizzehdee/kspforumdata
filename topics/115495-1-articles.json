I would say a large percentage of the time I EVA him to pick up surface samples I will get back to my rocket and start my ascension back to space only to realize that I flail all over with no stability, even though SAS is on and lights up. I have power, I choose to control the ship from the probe core, and get no results. I have tried disabling/re-enabling SAS, changing control to something else and then back to the probecore, as well as saving and loading. The only guaranteed fix I have found for this is to go back to the Space Center and then back to the ship (which is not ideal if my ship is falling).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else experienced something similar? I am not sure if it is mod related, I have a list in my signature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
