Since Moho is pretty highly inclined to the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, there\u0027s a high delta-v requirement to change inclination. You can get rid of some of this delta-v by including it in the interplanetary transfer burn from Kerbin orbit. So instead of burning 2000 m/s forward to leave Kerbin and then 2000 m/s up or down to change inclination, you can burn 2800 m/s at a 45 degree angle and achieve the same final orbit. Of course this depends how close to the ascending/descending node you are when you leave Kerbin orbit, but you can always get some better efficiency unless the nodes are at exactly 90 degrees from you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you can do is a gravity assist from Eve. This is what I always do for my Moho missions since it cuts down the amount of delta-v significantly. So you only need to burn about 1100 m/s from Kerbin for an Eve transfer, and then adjust your trajectory when you\u0027re close to Eve to get the Eve exit direction you want. Eve has enough energy so that with a gravity assist you can either change your inclination to Moho\u0027s inclination, or get your sun periapsis down to Moho\u0027s orbit, which both save a lot of delta-v at no propellant cost. Of course if you want to encounter Moho in the same orbit, you have to time your Kerbin launch right so Moho is in the right place, but otherwise if you don\u0027t worry about where Moho is in its orbit, you can get a Moho encounter in one or two more sun orbits at most after leaving Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you launch from an airless planet, there\u0027s no atmosphere drag, but there\u0027s still gravity drag. So unless your thrust to weight ratio is very high, you have to burn some of your delta-v vertically. So the total delta-v needed to orbit is a little higher based on what engine you have, probably around 1100-1200 m/s instead of 1043 m/s for Moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, the calculations are spot on. If you are actually making a Moho mission, you always want at least 10% more delta-v than required in case of errors and course correction burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T02:21:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Etomf, this is great, thank you.
