If I grab a part that can be extended (such as landing struts and antenna),\u00A0 it appears to be already extended, but I can extend it into itself. It is like the is a frozen image of the extended part, and I can interact with a duplicate that is stuck within it. I have the restock mods downloaded,\u00A0 and I was thinking\u00A0 that it is a visual bug that comes from multiple\u00A0 texture mods? I am not sure.\u00A0 I have many graphical mods, such as scatterer and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E, but I do not think those mods are the issue.\u00A0 Could someone please help me with this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kspAddict_","CreatedById":234282,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-11T02:10:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI FIXED IT YIPPEE HOORAY!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"adsii1970","CreatedById":89014,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-11T02:18:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224406559\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022225403\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221720663839\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022234282\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kspAddict_\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 minutes ago, kspAddict_ said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI FIXED IT YIPPEE HOORAY!!!!!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the best type of KSP victory\u2014figuring something out for yourself.
