Compare to my MER Replica Mission, this one has been built to be bigger, stronger, glitchier, laggier, and with more \u0022Ka-boom!\u0022 for free!!\n\nFor some reason my Procedural Parts glitched out and got the node where it shouldn\u0027t be, and added some wobbles to my ascend, but MechJeb was (mostly) able to correct it. Also, my Centaur second stage has pretty low TWR (if I use a bigger engine, it wouldn\u0027t be able to bear two engines, since there\u0027s a two-engine version of Centaur), thus I added two 70% sized Rockomax Mk-55s to add thrust and controllability since they mostly serve as verniers. But still, low-ish TWR causes longer burn time, and inaccuracy when executing nodes, as you might see.\n\nIt is in series with my MER Replica mission of course, and it shall be followed by Mars (or Duna, in this case) Sample Return Mission and Constellation-Styled Duna mission, both may (or may not) be in NEAR or FAR, possibly DRE, but definitely not gonna be in RSS/6.4x Kerbin or RT2.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/jUf-UpEpSy8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nAnd here\u0027s my MER Replica Mission video, much shorter. \n\nYes, I do realize that it doesn\u0027t look very much alike the real one, because it\u0027s really hard to add lots of detail on a small thing like that, compare to my Curiosity replica with a functional robotic arm.\n\n(Forgive me for the bad intro there)\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/mz9qMLUwcsk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**List of mods:**\n\n**INFRASTRUCTURE:**\n\nKW Rocketry\\*\n\nB9 Aerospace\\*\n\nProcedural Parts\n\nProcedural Fairings\n\nBlackheart\u0027s PF Extension Pack\n\nRealChute\n\nOblivion Aerospace\n\nTweakScale\n\nTweakable Everything\n\nUSI Airbags (MER Only)\n\nKerbal Attachment System\n\nMSI Infernal Robotics\n\n**PLUGINS:**\n\nMechanical Jeb\n\nMap Resource Overlay\n\nFirespitter Plugin\n\nTrajectories\n\nTAC Fuel Balancer\n\nCrossfeed Enabler\n\nTimeControl\n\nToolbar Plugin\n\n**VISUALS:**\n\nHotRockets!\n\nSmokeScreen\n\nDistant Object Visual Enhancements\n\nTexture Replacer\n\nNEBULA Decals\n\nMinAmbience\n\n*\\*: KW Rocketry and B9 has some properties that were edited by me. For example, I edited KW\u0027s Vesta VR-1 to give it higher thrust (160kN) and higher Isp (410s, RL-10 on Centaur has ~450s) so that it acts more like RL-10. And also Maverick-V, I gave it higher thrust (1750kN), or else my Atlas-V just wouldn\u0027t fly or have enough fuel. On B9, I simply give the RCS ports more thrust, since you aren\u0027t really going to do anything with zero-point-something-kilonewton of thrust. And I only have partial install of B9, as everybody knows, it kills a significant amount of RAM, that I only have RCS ports, lights (surface lights and spotlights), invisible struts, and radial monoprop tanks.*\n\nSince some parts has been customized, I may or may not share the .craft files. If I do, I\u0027ll release it with a MM Patch. \n\nOK, I think that\u0027s it.
