If you click the speed meter it will change from \u0022Orbital\u0022 to \u0022Surface\u0022 and should read 0.0m/s."},{"CreatedByName":"hatterson","CreatedById":107383,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T22:39:36Z","Content":"It shows because Minimus (along with all other planets/moons) are actually rotating. When you\u0027re sitting on the surface you\u0027re \u0022orbiting\u0022 minimus at roughly 9.5m/s as that is your speed relative to the center of the planet.\n\nIf you\u0027re trying to land, what you need to do is click on the blue box that has Orbit in it. That will switch the velocity mode to \u0022Surface\u0022 That will give you your speed relative to the surface below you, which will exclude the default 10m/s that Minimus spins at.\n\nYou can see a similar thing on Kerbin when launching a new ship by clicking on the same blue box (it should say surface when launching). It will go from \u0022Surface 0m/s\u0022 to \u0022Orbit 175m/s\u0022 because when you\u0027re on the surface of Kerbin you\u0027re moving at roughly 175m/s\n\nLet me know if you have other questions on how that works."},{"CreatedByName":"Loup","CreatedById":144301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T23:52:55Z","Content":"Oh thank you guyz, after hundreds hours playing it i dont remember ever push this button ^^\n\nThanks again for the quick answers and the assistance.\n\n\u0022Problem\u0022 solved ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"}]}
