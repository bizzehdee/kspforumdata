I have to assume this is my install because it seems either no one else is experiencing this, or worse, it\u0027s working as intended. When using the chase camera, what you would naturally expect it to do is chase your craft, however, when I switch to it, it always just selects some arbitrary point around my craft. The expected behavior here is that it would focus behind the craft, or at least in the direction your craft is moving. You are still free to move it around and it will lock wherever you point it and follow that angle instead, which is fine, but what is the point if I have to center it myself?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASUS G550JK\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore i7-4710HQ @ 2.50GHz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8GB DDR3 @ 800Mhz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EnVidia GeForce GTX 850M w/ 2GB DDR5 @ 1000Mhz\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T17:27:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, switching to chase cam should initially position the camera somewhere behind and probably slightly off axis (\u0022above\u0022 for an aircraft, for example).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Merinsan","CreatedById":57629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T14:23:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m finding the chase cam to not even be oriented correctly, after re-positioning it behind the craft.
