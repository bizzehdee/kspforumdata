Everything goes fine until I try to load any type of save (quicksave or persistant), then the flag simply disappears as if taken down or destroyed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF5-F9-ing while in EVA show that the flag actually sinks about 2m into the ground after each save loading and eventually explodes due to colliding with Moho (guessing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a quick search on the forums and haven\u0027t found a recent thread about this problem.

I did my mission there fine and everything, but then, after returning to Kerbin I noticed the flag was missing and assumed I forgot it, and simply HyperEditted another one to Vall. I now think the two might be the same issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone has had the same problem or is it a known glitch ? Any possible explanation or way to fix it would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo screenshots this time, I didn\u0027t take any and I\u0027m not going back down there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E Hopefully, they won\u0027t be needed for this issue.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
