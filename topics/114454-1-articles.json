Everything goes fine until I try to load any type of save (quicksave or persistant), then the flag simply disappears as if taken down or destroyed.\n\nF5-F9-ing while in EVA show that the flag actually sinks about 2m into the ground after each save loading and eventually explodes due to colliding with Moho (guessing).\n\nI did a quick search on the forums and haven\u0027t found a recent thread about this problem. If anyone knows one, thank you to redirect me there ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nI run KSP 1.0.4 with only KER and KAC installed.\n\nIf it might be of any consequence, the flag was planted on a \u003E10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 slope\n\nAnd I remember having a similar problem at Vall in 1.0.2. I did my mission there fine and everything, but then, after returning to Kerbin I noticed the flag was missing and assumed I forgot it, and simply HyperEditted another one to Vall. I now think the two might be the same issue.\n\nDoes anyone has had the same problem or is it a known glitch ? Any possible explanation or way to fix it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nNo screenshots this time, I didn\u0027t take any and I\u0027m not going back down there ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) Hopefully, they won\u0027t be needed for this issue."}]}
