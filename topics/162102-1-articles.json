However, what about adding other things to it? This requires building a separate craft, getting it into orbit as well, and trying to catch up with the station. That seems difficult, but it\u0027s actually easy. For me, I\u0027ve simply built a \u0027Crew Module/ Escape Pod\u0027 as my thing to dock in space.\u00A0It\u0027s a cupola module, a Monopropellant tank, some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, some Sepatrons (used for the \u0027Escape Pod\u0027 bit. They should be enough to deorbit me and send me back to Kerbin), and of course, a docking port. That\u0027s only \u003Cem\u003Emy\u003C/em\u003E example, but you can build whatever you want to add. Also, don\u0027t forget to add a launch vehicle, the thing that gets it up into space!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/photos/AwU92itepdXP4be58\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EExample Of A Launch Vehicle\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 2: Getting Into Orbit, And Rendezvousing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nSo you\u0027ve built what you want to add to your station. You\u0027ve put it on a rocket that\u0027ll hopefully get it into orbit. You\u0027re ready to launch. Here are a few tips: Firstly, wait until your target in orbit is near the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, as you don\u0027t want to get into orbit and have it halfway around the planet, do you? Secondly, wait until daylight! It is MUCH easier to dock in daylight then in the dark, as you can actually see what you\u0027re docking to!. With those things sorted, time to launch!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOnce your rocket has taken off, simply get it into orbit, roughly at the same altitude as your target. However, DO NOT REMOVE THE MODULE FROM THE ROCKET ONCE ACHIEVING ORBIT! I say this, as you might \u003Cem\u003Eget \u003C/em\u003Einto orbit, but you probably won\u0027t be able to catch up with the station, having you just float around there forever. If you have any remaining fuel, wait until you and the target are on the same side of the planet (either both on the night-side or day-side, but day-side is preferable, as you can see your target easily). Set it as your target. On the \u0027Map\u0027 view, you will now see your target\u0027s orbit in green, instead of grey. There will also be a few nodes along the orbit path. There\u0027s one in particular: \u0027Closest Intersect\u0027. This is where you and your target will be the closest to eachother, so you should set a manoeuvre node around that area, so you can make a burn to get really close. Once you\u0027ve done the burn to intercept your target, then just timewarp around until you are nearing it. Then, once close to the target, stop timewarp. Now comes the actual docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/photos/cgEBJtgTAw9w8NPC9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft Preparing To Dock\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 3: Velocity\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve closed the gap between your target, you will have to make your speed roughly the same as it. Otherwise, you could fly past the target, completely missing it, and having to do it all over again. Let\u0027s say that there are two ships, Ship A, and Ship B. Ship A is the one that you, Ship B, is trying to dock to. If Ship A is travelling at 2250m/s, and you, Ship B, are travelling at 2500m/s, then you are 250m/s faster, and will basically fly past Ship A. What you should do, is turn your craft around, so your engines are facing the way that you are going, and fire them. This is basically slowing down your craft in orbit. A 5m/s speed difference is ok, but you should probably have about 2m/s or even less. Once you are within 100m of your target, or in physical sight, you should prepare for docking. This is where \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, patience, and a steady hand is important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPart 4: Actually Docking\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nYou\u0027ve selected a docking port to attach to. Only now, you can separate your module from the rocket. Turn your ship around again, so that you\u0027re docking port is facing the other docking port. Then, at roughly 20m between you and your target, click the button below \u0027Staging\u0027. This is called \u0027Docking Mode\u0027, and uses \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters for up/down, left/right, and backwards/forwards. The controls are as follows: LeftShift/LeftCtrl for forwards and backwards. A/D for left and right, W/S for up and down, and Q/E to roll left or right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/photos/wA1LyJEknGV849gF9\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELining Up To Dock...\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nPress \u0027Shift\u0027 to fire your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters forward, but don\u0027t hold it down for long, unless you want to go forwards rapidly, and risk colliding with your target. As you approach the docking port, line your port up with the other one. Press \u0027Ctrl\u0027 if needed to fire your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters the other way, to slow down, if need be, but you shouldn\u0027t really have to do this if you have been paying attention. Finally, at around 0.5m, the two docking ports should \u0027feel\u0027 eachother, and magnetically clamp. If they don\u0027t, then try again. Often the problem is that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is activated, so you should turn that off while the ports are connecting. Once they have connected, the camera will zoom out, and you\u0027ve docked! To undock, right click the docking port that you attached to, and select \u0027Undock\u0027.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://goo.gl/photos/4CmV9u1PuUHjPq9y7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E...Docked!\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:justify;\u0022\u003E\nHope this long(ish) guide helped, TCIS.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-08-02T04:54:53Z\u0022 title=\u002208/02/2017 04:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 2, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by The_Cat_In_Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
