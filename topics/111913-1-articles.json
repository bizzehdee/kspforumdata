Load attached save, go to any satellite and sat will start moving about, turning on sas will cancel movement, most of the time. Quitting that save and returning to the new game, capsule will start moving about as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrevious steps attempted: Install that save started having problems with I removed/disabled mods in effort to see if a specific mod was causing the problem, problem always recurred. Attempted fresh install, slowly added mods till matching with previous install; Problem did not recur till save was copied over to fresh install, deletion of saves and settings files caused problem to go away.
