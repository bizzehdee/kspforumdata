This is not phantom force as the control gauges do actually move.\n\nMods Installed: Quite a few, I\u0027ve included the ckan file so that it can be reproduced and two mods that are not via ckan are packaged as well.\n\nReproduction steps: Fresh 1.0.2 stock install, load in mods, start new game, launch rocket into space. turn off SAS. capsule is still. Load attached save, go to any satellite and sat will start moving about, turning on sas will cancel movement, most of the time. Quitting that save and returning to the new game, capsule will start moving about as well.\n\nPrevious steps attempted: Install that save started having problems with I removed/disabled mods in effort to see if a specific mod was causing the problem, problem always recurred. Attempted fresh install, slowly added mods till matching with previous install; Problem did not recur till save was copied over to fresh install, deletion of saves and settings files caused problem to go away. Ensured joystick was not connected, KSP not bound to joystick controls, swapped out keyboard (no phantom inputted text however on other applications), swapped out mouse.\n\nZip file of approximatly 7.5MB that includes Save game, B9 with patches to be usable in 1.0.2, MM config to bring back stock bay alongside Ven\u0027s stock revamp models, and .ckan file to load other mods installed by ckan.\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/ynz52nksoe9v471/waerloga_save.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ynz52nksoe9v471/waerloga_save.zip?dl=0)\n\nFinal issue: FAR flight assistance was on.\n\nSolution: turn off FAR flight assistance, especially when out of atmo.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T00:08:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 12:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by waerloga**"},{"CreatedByName":"FinalHazard","CreatedById":152403,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T21:11:25Z","Content":"Thank you so much!\n\nThis was frustrating me for close to 24 hours and I made this account just to thank you."},{"CreatedByName":"the_machemer","CreatedById":140907,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-17T02:44:05Z","Content":"I started having this problem and despite turning off FAR flight assistance and restarting the game, it still persists. What do i have to do to make this stop? Is it just my current crafts that have it or is it anything i build subsequently too? Can i simply uninstall/reinstall FAR? I guess my real question is: do i have to delete yet another career mode? This is about to be the fourth time due to various reasons and I\u0027m really getting fed up.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-17T02:50:31Z\u0022 title=\u002202/17/2016 02:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 17, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by the\\_machemer**"}]}
