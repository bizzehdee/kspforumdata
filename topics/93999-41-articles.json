This means you\u0027re not pulled down as much and as such you slow down much more easily than in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. This low gravity also influences the height of the atmosphere. Because the gravity is low, the atmospheric gases aren\u0027t pulled down to the moon as much as they would on a larger planet like Kerbin. As such the atmosphere extends farther out.
