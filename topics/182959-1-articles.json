it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity assists are a way to change the orbital relationship between you and a planet by using a moon as an intermediary (or between you and the sun by using a planet).\u00A0 It takes advantage of the fact that there is a difference between \u003Cem\u003Espeed\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Evelocity\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 For our purposes, the main thing to understand is that with velocity, direction is an important component, but for speed, it is not.\u00A0 For a simple illustration of that, consider two cars 100 metres apart on a narrow road.\u00A0 Both are travelling at 100 kilometres per hour.\u00A0 If they travel in the same direction, then the situation is perfectly safe.\u00A0 Imagine now that they are travelling in opposite directions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDirection is important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you enter the sphere of influence of a celestial body, assuming that you do not aerobrake, ignite your rockets or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, or crash into anything, then you will exit the sphere of influence with the exact same speed as you entered it.\u00A0 Your speed will change as you move through the sphere because you are falling under gravity, but as soon as you pass periapsis and begin climbing out, you trade that speed for altitude until you exit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, fly-by orbits are not straight lines; they are special curves called\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehyperbolae\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0(singular\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehyperbola).\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EBecause the fly-by is not a straight line (or the original orbital track; I know those aren\u0027t straight lines either), you don\u0027t pass through the sphere of influence and exit where you would have if the celestial body was not present; your direction changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nImagine for a moment that you\u0027re orbiting Kerbin and your orbit takes you up to the Mun\u0027s altitude.\u00A0 At that apoapsis, the Mun, being in its own orbit, catches up to you and you enter its sphere of influence.\u00A0 From the Mun\u0027s perspective, you are flying more or less towards it; assuming that your apoapsis orbital speed was negligible, then on entering the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence, you are approaching the Mun (or the Mun is approaching you; it makes no difference) at about the Mun\u0027s own orbital speed, which is 542.5 m/s.\u00A0 Let\u0027s also imagine that you just barely miss the Mun and that its gravity is such that your fly-by path warps around so as to exit the sphere at the same point that you entered.\u00A0 That isn\u0027t actually possible for a couple of reasons, and we\u0027re also assuming that this happens quickly enough that we can neglect the Mun\u0027s orbital motion, but it\u0027s good for an illustration.\u00A0 When you entered the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence, you were travelling at 542.5 m/s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ein\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 When you exit, you\u0027re travelling at 542.5 m/s\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eout\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 When you were in Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence and just about to enter the Mun\u0027s, you were travelling at nearly zero m/s in the Mun\u0027s prograde direction.\u00A0 When you just enter Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence after exiting the Mun\u0027s, you\u0027re travelling at 1085 m/s in the Mun\u0027s prograde direction.\u00A0 That kilometre per second is the effect of the gravity assist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn actual use, the Mun cannot provide such a good gravity assist.\u00A0 Its own gravity is too low to warp your trajectory back on itself, and even if it\u00A0could, it has a surface which obviously limits your closest approach.\u00A0 It also orbits fairly close to Kerbin, which reduces the size of its sphere of influence.\u00A0 It is best used as a helper; it can cut the fuel required for an interplanetary ejection, but it can\u0027t get you to your destination on its own.\u00A0 It can also cut the fuel needed for a braking burn (though Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere does that just as well; such braking assists are much more effective at Ike, because Duna\u0027s atmosphere isn\u0027t very thick, and Tylo, because Jool\u0027s atmosphere is too thick) and it can provide an assist to Minmus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as how to use a body for an assist, the key is to understand where your orbit enters and exits.\u00A0 For prograde and retrograde changes, you want to exit in the Mun\u0027s own prograde or retrograde direction as shown by its orbit around Kerbin.\u00A0 The ideal assist has you enter the sphere exactly where you intend to exit, but the Mun can\u0027t provide that trajectory, as I said earlier.\u00A0 In your case, you\u0027ll want to catch up to the Mun as you fall from Minmus, but you\u0027ll need to hit the sphere a bit to the radial out side if you want to exit exactly retrograde.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EA bit\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is not very exact, but you\u0027ll have to test it yourself and see.\u00A0 Use the manoeuvre nodes to plan the burn (also turn up the conic patch limit in the settings if you have not already; I use six for my own games) and see what you can get.\u00A0 It\u0027s actually not difficult to get the encounter; the issue is getting the encounter exactly right so you can extract the most assist from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you understood none of that, don\u0027t worry.\u00A0 Gravity assists are quite the advanced topic.\u00A0 Consider how difficult it is to do interplanetary transfers, when you\u0027re\u00A0trying to go from a moving origin to a moving target on a single burn by getting the direction and\u00A0timing\u00A0exactly right at the beginning.\u00A0 Gravity assists complicate that exponentially by requiring you to do same thing as an interplanetary transfer and\u00A0go to the second planet which is not only moving, but in such a way as to exploit that motion in order to arrive at a third planet which is also moving, and moving differently, without needing to fire the engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat being said, they are not out of reach.\u00A0 Keep at it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you would like a fuller explanation,\u00A0\u003Ca

with zero fuel expenditure (though you\u0027ll need to burn to avoid a second assist from Tylo or whatever you use), but there\u0027s nothing to stop you from taking the fuel and doing things the brute-force way.\u00A0 I will say also that you can use assists for the inner planets:\u00A0 Eve has high gravity, is centrally located, is fairly easy to reach\u00A0from\u00A0Kerbin, has a high orbital velocity, and has a bit of inclination, as well.\u00A0 There\u0027s also nothing to keep you from circling round and, with minor corrections, getting a second assist from a single celestial body, so it is actually the case that if you can get to Eve, then you can get anywhere.\u00A0 The only cost is time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

excellent explanation from @Zhetaan, but add that you\u0027re not going to see a huge effect using the Mun to slow down from Minmus.\u00A0 Per the delta-v map, it takes about 860m/s to burn from Kerbin to the Mun, and about 930m/s\u00A0to go to Minmus.\u00A0 The max speed you can lose is the difference between those numbers (70m/s), which is probably not going to have a big impact on your reentry speed. If you have a craft that overheats on reentry for Minmus, it\u00A0 may be more effective to shed speed by aerobraking -- i.e., setting your periapsis at Kerbin high enough that you take several passes before falling out of orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that said, gravity assists are really helpful certain scenarios (capturing into the Jool system is number one in my book), so it\u0027s a great idea to get the concept down early.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-19T14:48:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/19/2019 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 19, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Aegolius13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
