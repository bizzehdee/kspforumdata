I think it speaks to the part of me that loves to design and tinker (engineer by training).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing that I find an absolute killer though is the way vehicles are internally represented (1 parent tree) is making it very difficult to build intelligent designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe most common example is trying to build a lower stage that is a \u0027star\u0027 of fuel tanks (one in the middle, 4 around the outside held together by radial decouplers). The problem first shows up if you try to connect the outer tanks to the inner at more than one point to give it more structural integrity (without resorting to the kludge of struts everywhere). It gets even worse if you try to put a 2nd stage on and connect 2nd stage outer fuel tanks both vertically (to the stage below) and laterally (to the central column). The way ships are represented in the game it simply refuses to understand that things in the real world can be connected at more than one point, and often must be to be rigid/strong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (A different and possible better explanation is given here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25550-Attaching-objects-in-builder-to-multiple-mount-points\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/25550-Attaching-objects-in-builder-to-multiple-mount-points\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is gloriously frustrating since the vehicle that results is either not robust, not functional, or both!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have enough background in design and programming to know that trees are very nice structures to work with, however they have shortcomings when describing a real world structure.

I know they can be healed with docking ports... imagine a nice tank setup with a tricoupler turned upside 3 way at least 6 monoprop tank on it and another tricouplet on top of it facing down. It is a really nice detailed addition to any base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it is 20 parts if you use 2 struts to \u0022weld\u0022 those two unattached attachment nodes on the upper side to stifften the connection: that is two more part for the phisics counting... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use docking ports you need 12 surplus object. 6 on each end...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5 -10 of it just becouse it is looks good and here you are more than 10-25-100 more parts you don\u0027t really need other than to launch this thing into orbit. (not counting the 6 x 3 MP tanks just because the tanks are not procedural)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this should be a only 5 part object. 2 tricoulers and 3 long mp tanks connected on the logical way (tanks both ends)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a \u0022weld\u0022 function might eleminate this kind of problems (lots of them)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BabaProphet","CreatedById":138329,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T11:20:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t agree more with this suggestion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tree architecture is somewhat unintuitive and requires a lot of experimenting for new players as well as a lot of patience for advanced ones, when trying to work around issues like building wings, stacking things between multicouplers or even attatching large boosters (with tons of struts).
