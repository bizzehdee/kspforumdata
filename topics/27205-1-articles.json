I don\u0027t think that\u0027s possible. All the below 50 ton crafts that I know of are open-air rockets. These 50 ton capsule\u0027d crafts don\u0027t use the EVA jetpack with its 520m/s of delta-V as it\u0027s final orbital stage does it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut suppose there was a 50 ton lander with an one man pod, that clearly shows somewhere in your design you have inefficiency. For one using tricoupler for your final stage and including those 1.25m - 2.5m adaptors seems like a waste of weight to me. Instead of tricoupler use the cubic strut trick as you would with clustered engines. Everything on your rocket, particular that final stage should only be there if it\u0027s absolutely critical. If taking away a part of the rocket doesn\u0027t cause it to fail catastrophically then it doesn\u0027t belong on a Eve return vehicle. Every kg of weight you save at the top translates to dozens of tons by the time its effect filters down to the first stage. So for example if you switch that ASAS for that spaceplane guidance package and your rocket manages to still fly straight you save another 40kg from the top. All the record breaking crafts such as that 18 ton open air two man Eve return rocket are hand flow or with MJ so as to ditch ASAS to squeeze even more delta-V out of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other hint - if you want to carry three guys back and you don\u0027t want to use the ladder trick for an open air rocket then using three one man pod is still lighter than using a 2.5m pod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Splode","CreatedById":57337,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T04:03:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the craft pictured the whole rocket?

You\u0027ve obviously learned how to construct a rocket, get your current mass, get your total delta-V, and so on, so you can do it without us handing you a perfect design. As long as the stage in question isn\u0027t activated until you\u0027re above 15000m or so (where the nuke\u0027s ISP reaches 500), the only reason to use the less efficient engines is if you still need the high thrust, so you should be able to figure out for yourself exactly which stages should be using those engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T08:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00221001sd\u0022 data-cite=\u00221001sd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA little (off-topic maybe) thing to say, is that you can in fact search the forums for short/common words using google.
