(May need to sort that from minmus then new rocket then to mun) So after a while i signed up here. And after playing KSP and making my station over duna dock with a rocket that failed to reach and lost fuel in orbit with duna, Sadly. But the mission is continuing, Yay! So now to my idea, I don\u0027t know if this has been made before. But my idea is to try and create a artificial gravity well/pull not just for ships but as a weapon, You know if a projectile comes after you it can go through the gravity well/cannon/pull and lunge back at the shooter/debris. A very good tactic for saving a ship that\u0027s impending impact with debris, Or can be used as a strategic defense for ships, if made correctly it can be a invisible shield to your ship!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know if i\u0027ll succeed or not, But it\u0027ll be made completely with stock parts. Only with help from mods, Nothing with parts or anything. Mods like FAR so i can know if i\u0027m stalling or not etc, And a clock possibly so i can see the best times to start testing or even land with it and see if it\u0027ll land good without lunging your ship back from the surface of the planet you tried to land on. So yeah if you\u0027d like to help me or have some knowledge in KSP\u0027s projectile system etc like max speeds before it slows down, Max speeds in atmospheres before it impends impact with the ground, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T01:56:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum, Vane, and congratulations on your moon landing. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T02:00:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, and welcome to the forums!
