Assuming the height of the atmosphere is small in comparison to the radius of the planet, the mass of the atmosphere will then scale with the surface area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf Mars is to have an atmosphere as thick as earth\u0027s, it needs a column of gas 2.66 times as heavy as earth\u0027s, spread over 28% of the surface area, so 74.5% the mass of earth\u0027s atmosphere (3.83*10\u003Csup\u003E15\u003C/sup\u003Ekg).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are going to walk on the surface of Mars without a pressure suit, the pressure must be above the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_limit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EArmstrong Limit\u003C/a\u003E, which is about 6.25% the atmospheric pressure of earth, and is the point below which water will begin to boil at human body temperature. That needs an atmosphere with a mass of 4.66% that of earth\u0027s atmosphere (2.4*10\u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003Ekg).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, whatever you want from a Martian atmosphere, you\u0027re going to need a LOT of mass. Where can we get it from?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne place that has been suggested is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_polar_ice_caps\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epolar ice caps\u003C/a\u003E. It is estimated that together they contain 4.1 million km\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of\u00A0frozen CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, which has a density of about 1.5kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. That gives you a mass of 1.5*4,100,000*1000*1000, or 6.15*10\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003Ekg. That\u0027s only about 2.5% of what we need even to get to the Armstrong limit. Looks like we\u0027re going to have to look off-world for that mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let\u0027s assume we want to bring the pressure of Mars up to the Armstrong limit within 200 years. That requires redirecting 2.34*10\u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003Ekg of material. To give that mass an acceleration of 10m/s over that time period would require a constant power input of 3.7MW. 100m/s would require 371MW.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople often talk about moving Venus\u0027 atmosphere to Mars using a mass driver. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SqdzxzF.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EA Venus to Mars transfer costs about 4km/s\u003C/a\u003E. Add maybe 8km/s to Venus orbit, ignoring atmospheric losses, and you get 12km/s, which gives us a power over 200 years of 5.34TW. Venus has an insolation of about 2kW/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, so you\u0027d need about 2.7*10\u003Csup\u003E10\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of 10% efficient solar panels to power your mass drivers (plus massive storage, as you would only be able to fire during transfer windows). That\u0027s 26,700 km\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, or a square 163km. We\u0027re talking cloud cities and beamed power from orbital stations on a monstrous scale here. Not practical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best bet is probably to move frozen material from the outer solar system using the Interplanetary Transport Network. If you don\u0027t mind your mass taking a long time to get to the inner solar system, a 100m/s nudge should be enough to move a Neptune or Uranus trojan from L4 or L5 into a position where it can be redirected into the inner solar system using gravity assists. That just leaves the far-from-trivial problem of delivering 400MW to outer solar system bodies over a period of 200 years, then precisely guiding the mass you throw into the inner solar system so it gets all of the right gravity assists and hits Mars. We\u0027re going to probably need large-scale nuclear fusion before this becomes even remotely a possibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we\u0027ve established that giving Mars an atmosphere, even one just barely thick enough that our eyeballs don\u0027t boil away, is going to be incredibly difficult. Let\u0027s assume that we can give Mars an atmosphere though. How quickly is it going to escape into space?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~mlewis/PlAtm/Jeans.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThis is the best source I have been able to find for Jeans\u0027 Escape\u003C/a\u003E, or the thermal escape of gas into space. It gives most parameters needed to calculate the flux, but not enough information about the exobase, or the altitude at which molecules at escape velocity are likely to be able to leave the atmosphere without hitting another particle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where I quickly start to get out of my depth. My gut feeling says that Mars could hold on to a thick atmosphere for millions of years, but I don\u0027t think we know enough about the exosphere of Mars, in particular a Mars with a hypothetical 0.06 bar atmosphere, to accurately determine all the parameters required to calculate the flux of atmospheric gases to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027ll leave this up here in case anybody is feeling particularly mathematical today!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Findthepin1","CreatedById":139989,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T16:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMars\u0027 solid CO2 storage is much larger than that.

Where can we get it from?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne place that has been suggested is the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_polar_ice_caps\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Epolar ice caps\u003C/a\u003E. It is estimated that together they contain 4.1 million km\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of\u00A0frozen CO\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E, which has a density of about 1.5kg/m\u003Csup\u003E3\u003C/sup\u003E. That gives you a mass of 1.5*4,100,000*1000*1000, or 6.15*10\u003Csup\u003E12\u003C/sup\u003Ekg. That\u0027s only about 2.5% of what we need even to get to the Armstrong limit. Looks like we\u0027re going to have to look off-world for that mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo let\u0027s assume we want to bring the pressure of Mars up to the Armstrong limit within 200 years. That requires redirecting 2.34*10\u003Csup\u003E14\u003C/sup\u003Ekg of material. To give that mass an acceleration of 10m/s over that time period would require a constant power input of 3.7MW. 100m/s would require 371MW.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople often talk about moving Venus\u0027 atmosphere to Mars using a mass driver. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SqdzxzF.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EA Venus to Mars transfer costs about 4km/s\u003C/a\u003E. Add maybe 8km/s to Venus orbit, ignoring atmospheric losses, and you get 12km/s, which gives us a power over 200 years of 5.34TW. Venus has an insolation of about 2kW/m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, so you\u0027d need about 2.7*10\u003Csup\u003E10\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0m\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E\u00A0of 10% efficient solar panels to power your mass drivers (plus massive storage, as you would only be able to fire during transfer windows). That\u0027s 26,700 km\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E, or a square 163km. We\u0027re talking cloud cities and beamed power from orbital stations on a monstrous scale here. Not practical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best bet is probably to move frozen material from the outer solar system using the Interplanetary Transport Network. If you don\u0027t mind your mass taking a long time to get to the inner solar system, a 100m/s nudge should be enough to move a Neptune or Uranus trojan from L4 or L5 into a position where it can be redirected into the inner solar system using gravity assists. That just leaves the far-from-trivial problem of delivering 400MW to outer solar system bodies over a period of 200 years, then precisely guiding the mass you throw into the inner solar system so it gets all of the right gravity assists and hits Mars. We\u0027re going to probably need large-scale nuclear fusion before this becomes even remotely a possibility.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo we\u0027ve established that giving Mars an atmosphere, even one just barely thick enough that our eyeballs don\u0027t boil away, is going to be incredibly difficult. Let\u0027s assume that we can give Mars an atmosphere though.

It gives most parameters needed to calculate the flux, but not enough information about the exobase, or the altitude at which molecules at escape velocity are likely to be able to leave the atmosphere without hitting another particle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where I quickly start to get out of my depth. My gut feeling says that Mars could hold on to a thick atmosphere for millions of years, but I don\u0027t think we know enough about the exosphere of Mars, in particular a Mars with a hypothetical 0.06 bar atmosphere, to accurately determine all the parameters required to calculate the flux of atmospheric gases to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027ll leave this up here in case anybody is feeling particularly mathematical today!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMars can remain habitable w/o a magnetosphere, assuming it is terraformed, for max. 100 million years.
