It\u0027s a very simple idea but would exponentially increase the diversity and functionality of action groups while maintaining simplicity. As of now, action groups and stages are the most effective methods of controlling a craft as simply as possible. The limitations so far i have experienced is that, the stages are linear and sequential (one by one, no reversing no alternatives except continue forward.) Action groups help make up the short coming of stages by allowing the user to freely fire any button they wish. This is extremely useful, though yet again there are some short comings (each button does 1 thing so it sometimes many buttons for a single task, there is no wait X seconds command.) My ideas are relatively simple and ill try and explain to the best of my knowledge\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWAIT X Seconds \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the simplest and most neccesary part of this idea. The wait command is used to make action group bindings pause or wait for a certain amount of time (several selectable seconds). You simply insert the command before an action, then the computer will pause for a few seconds before it executes the command. This is EXTREMELY useful, as it makes a single action group button almost as diverse as the stage button as it fires several commands one after another. For example an escape tower bound to the abort button at the moment either fires everything at once or it requires a second button (generally the stage button) to decouple and deploy the parachutes. With a wait command, it could fire everything with a single button.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEscape tower Abort with Wait command\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EAbort button\u003Cbr\u003EFire Escape Rocket\u003Cbr\u003EWait 3 seconds...\u003Cbr\u003EDecouple\u003Cbr\u003EDeploy Parachute\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile this seems simple enough, we have gone from needing 2-3 buttons (abort and staging) to needing a single button. There are many many instances where a wait command would increase the diversity and simplicity of crafts while also reducing the amount of buttons needed to do these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWAIT FOR COMMAND\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis part is a bit more complicated and much more enriching. The basic idea is to add sub groups into the action group bindings to give sequential staging (Mod \u002B Custom01... repeat pressing for sequential staging of a part) and sub grouped action groups (hold Custom01 \u002B Num 1 or Num 2 etc.. each combo subgroup functions the same as an action group)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding these subgroup combinations exponentially increases the diversity and functionality of the action groups. The player would be able to create either type of subgroup in an action group key bind which essentially waits for either (Mod \u002B Custom0X) to sequentially stage a part or (Hold Custom0X \u002B Numpad X) which works essentially the same as action groups but give much much more diversity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow is an example of an engine which would be quite simple to set up yet only uses 1 traditional action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[B]Custom01[/B]\u003Cbr\u003EToggle Engine\u003Cbr\u003E[CODE][B]Mod \u002B Custom01[/B]\u003Cbr\u003ESet Engine Power 33%\u003Cbr\u003E   [B]Mod \u002B Custom01[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E   Set Engine Power 66%\u003Cbr\u003E      [B]Mod \u002B Custom01[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E      Set Engine Power 100%[B]\u003Cbr\u003E         Mod \u002B Custom01[/B]\u003Cbr\u003E         Set Engine Power 0%\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[B]Hold Custom01 \u002B Numpad 1[/B]\u003Cbr\u003EToggle Gimble\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[B]Hold Custom01 \u002B Numpad 2[/B]\u003Cbr\u003EToggle Mode\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[B]Hold Custom01 \u002B Numpad 0[/B]\u003Cbr\u003EShutdown Engine\u003Cbr\u003EWait 5\u003Cbr\u003EDecouple\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i were to press Custom01 it would toggle the engine and function exactly the same as the existing action group does right now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to keep pressing Mod \u002B Custom01 it would sequentially fire up the engine from 0% to 33% then 66% then 100%, one more time after that would set the engine to 0% (essentially reseting it) ending the script.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I Hold Custom01 and press Numpad 1 I would toggle the gimble of my engine, this functions the same as existing action groups, but with much more diversity as the player has exponentially more freedom\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf i Hold Custom01 and press Numpad 0 It would function like an action group with a WAIT command. First the engine will shut down, then 5 seconds later the engine will decouple from the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the idea probably needs a way of resetting the sequential staging effect of Mod \u002B Custom01. So instead of just always staging up from point to point without being able to reset the stage position, I think Ctrl \u002B Mod \u002B Custom01 should RESET the WAIT FOR script. This means that (following the example) if you are at 66% thrust pressing CTRL \u002B MOD \u002B Custom01 will reset the script meaning next time you press Mod \u002B Custom01 it will put you on 33% INSTEAD of 100%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOK Thanks for listening to my idea.

So you set it up in the GUI and put \u0027stage breaks\u0027 in which end the action group and rebind the key to the next \u0027stage\u0027 action group (which sits in the GUI though it were still part of the first action group), so you could keep pressing a single button to \u0027stage\u0027 an action group. The timer would be great to have too, it could just be firing different (unbound) action groups thru timers from the original key press (as it seems smart parts does already) The idea seems a bit choppy atm, though you could have staging thru a single keybind group(or automated even). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso you could add a \u0027loop\u0027 break to the GUI, so when the \u0027staging\u0027 reaches the end of its cycle, it rebinds the key to the first part (first action group) of the script.
