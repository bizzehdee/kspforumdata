I went to the website and saw that 0.90.0 BETA was out! I was excited, so I ran the patcher, then when it was done (it took forever) I ran the game. After about 5 minutes of loading the game, the progress bar was about one third of the way through, and it crashed. I tried a few more times, and it kept crashing. I tried restarting my computer, and even deleted the entire KSP folder and re-downloading it three times, but it keeps happening.\n\nEvery single time, it is on the exact same part of loading, which is Squad/Spaces/landerCabinInternals/model002.\n\nI have searched for this problem, and nobody else has it. People have had similar problems, but I\u0027ve tried everything suggested on their topics and nothing works. Please help.\n\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n![64376.png](http://upurs.us/image/64376.png)\n\nBTW I am running Windows 7 Home Premium with 4GB ram. I don\u0027t know about the CPU and graphics cards, but I think those should be fine because the game worked perfectly before the update.\n\nI\u0027ve even tried deleting model002 and replacing it with model001 and renaming it, but the same thing happens."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T04:50:30Z","Content":"Off hand, I don\u0027t know of something I can point at immediately. You can try skimming through this thread for some of the usual suspects like virus scanners. Another thing to check for, if the game took five minutes and only loaded that far. Ensure you don\u0027t have any unused network adapter, especially virtual ones (like Hamachi). There is a bug in Unity which can cause exceeding long load times. [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92228-Known-Issues-Self-Help](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92228-Known-Issues-Self-Help)\n\nIf that\u0027s not helpful, then please check out this thread. It will outline some of the info that will potentially help us narrow down the problem. Specifically we will need your log files to see if there is anything unusual in there. Possibly also upload a dxdiag dump.

It may take a bit of trial and error to narrow it down.\n\nWelcome to the forums. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"nin10dorox","CreatedById":139926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T20:43:44Z","Content":"Thanks. I read the first topic and it turns out that I have a 32 bit duel core processor. I just made it only use one of the CPUs and it still didn\u0027t work. It did make it farther, though. This time it made it to mk1PodCockpit/model003.\n\nSomething strange happened, though. Rather than the game notifying me that it crashed, it just shut down without warning. It still left a log, though. I\u0027ll find a way to post the logs.\n\nCould it be because both of my CPU cores are duel core?"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T02:27:54Z","Content":"Possibly, but it sounds unlikely. Generally through windows, identifying a single core to run on means it\u0027ll only run on that one core. Your post is slightly confusing to me. Do you have a dual processor, dual core machine? If it\u0027s just a usual Intel or AMD dual core, then specifying one core will keep it attached to just that one core. (Although I will also say that the need for single core affinity seems to have mostly gone away.)\n\nIt\u0027s kind of hard to guess what the problem might be without the logs. If you have the ability to, please upload them. You can use a place like dropbox, mediafire, google docs, or even paste it into pastebin.\n\nUsually when something interferes with KSP loading, it is things like antivirus, or because people it is being run from somewhere like \u0022Program Files\u0022 or the Desktop. Some of those usual problems are outlines within the general post I directed you to earlier. \n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T19:52:01Z","Content":"We need the game logs to really know what\u0027s happening here, please find the KSP.log or output\\_log.txt in the KSP folder and upload it somewhere for us ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"oriramikad","CreatedById":133379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T02:38:30Z","Content":"\u003E Often when the game hangs up on loading a file like that, it\u0027s not the file itself but something else.\n\nIt loads successively, so my money is on model003.mbm being the problem."},{"CreatedByName":"nin10dorox","CreatedById":139926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T23:49:53Z","Content":"I was finally able to get to my computer and post the logs.\n\nOutput log: [http://pastebin.com/pBSqY9i1](http://pastebin.com/pBSqY9i1)\n\nError: [http://pastebin.com/V7hFWy0i](http://pastebin.com/V7hFWy0i)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-28T05:29:13Z","Content":"It looks like you are running out of memory.

My old computer is about 7 or 8 years old, running Vista with a dual core Intel and 4GB...and it\u0027s capable of running KSP with the graphics turned down. Your logs seem to indicate that KSP is only able to get to about 2.6ish GB. You might have a lot of things running in the background.\n\nYou can try closing stuff in your task tray, and also starting up the process monitor and killing some unused or unknown processes. (If you kill the wrong ones, you might have to restart. But usually windows won\u0027t let you kill the wrong stuff.)\n\nIf you are comfortable with fiddling with the computer, you can try turning off some of the auto-start processes using MSCONFIG. Go to the run box and type \u0022msconfig\u0022 (without the quotes of course). There\u0027s a \u0022Services\u0022 and \u0022Startup\u0022 tab. In there, you can look for old or unwanted programs that automatically load themselves to \u0022help you out.\u0022 You can uncheck items in here and restart your computer. This prevents them from loading upon startup, thereby booting the computer faster and gobbling up less memory. Generally speaking, leave all the Microsoft ones alone. Also, avoid anything for your graphics or sound drivers. You can keep turning things on and off, then restarting to get your computer to run a little smoother.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"nin10dorox","CreatedById":139926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T23:38:41Z","Content":"I just checked.

That stupid thing has caused more problems than a virus itself would)"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T03:59:01Z","Content":"Well, aside from what I suggested above, you can also find some descent programs that can help clear out old programs. Although you need to be very careful because many of them are mostly adware or malware. Really, my first recommendation is to read up on using MSCONFIG and try that. It doesn\u0027t require installing anything and is a microsoft built in utility. It helped me immensely in controlling the bloat on my old computer, without having to wipe it out. Also go through the Control Panel-\u003EPrograms and uninstall old stuff. Sometimes that also helps remove bloat or stuff that is sitting around in the background. And make sure you have plenty of hard drive space. If your hard drive is full, it can cause problems for Window\u0027s swap file (not having enough space).\n\nI don\u0027t know much about Kaspersky myself since I don\u0027t use it. It may be that you can disable some of it\u0027s protections while still maintaining firewall and virus support. But please make sure you know what you\u0027re turning off or take precautions to protect your computer if you disable while playing KSP.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T23:02:29Z","Content":"If you\u0027re still checking the forums...\n\nAs another thing to try, install KSP to a different location. Such as C:\\Games\\KSP, instead of in your user directories. Also, avoid places like the desktop, documents (which is where yours is installed), or \u0022program files\u0022. Sometimes Windows has an issue installing to these locations.\n\nMake sure you either install fresh from the .zip, or that you copy \u0026 paste the KSP directory over. *Do not move* the folder. Windows might try to help you out and will keep track of the protected directories.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"}]}
