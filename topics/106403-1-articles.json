Kerbals should be re-orderable at the astronaut complex.\n\n2\u003E I use an absolute throttle control (on a Logitech flight stick), and it works fine except on launch, the throttle is always set to 50% instead of the current position of the throttle; I have to wiggle the throttle to get it to update. If an absolute throttle control is available, it should set the initial throttle from the position of the control.\n\n3\u003E The error margin on placing satellites in orbit is way too generous. As soon as I get anywhere near the right orbit, the last one accepted at maybe 5 degrees off. the guide disappears as the task completes and I\u0027m left unable to fine tune the orbit further, if I so choose. On hard difficulty, it should require a lot more accuracy, maybe a 0.001% error margin! A setting for this is requested.\n\n4\u003E This last one is more a personal opinion, but on hard difficulty the science income may be a little too reduced (at 60% science income.) Generally it makes science more of a grind, rather than hard. Of course this can be adjusted when starting a career, I just thought I\u0027d mention.\n\n5\u003E With a level 1 tracking station, there is no way to switch control targets via the map. So it is an annoyance that you have to go ship\u003Espace center-\u003Etracking-\u003Eship, due to load times.\n\n5a\u003E You can\u0027t go directly to the Tracking station from flight/map, you can\u0027t hide objects on the map like you can at the tracking center, and you can\u0027t set a body you\u0027re near as a navigation Target. This all could be streamlined.\n\n6\u003E \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to add that my small annoyance is that nowhere in the description of the science lab does it say that it requires 5 electricity/second to process data.\n\nPlease try and fix for the above, thanks.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-07T10:06:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/07/2015 10:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Acru**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sonny_Jim","CreatedById":103060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T23:12:08Z","Content":"WRT 1:\n\nI find this annoying as well, as it ends up with Jeb being a \u0027glory hunter\u0027 and always being the first to jump into an empty pod.

You has to buy all the candidates (even if you don\u0027t need them by specialization), to get more - and among the new candidates there is no kerbounaut with the required specialization. Annoying. (At least 75% of them women - kicking the illusion of this game\u0027s reality)!\n\nThe new aerodynamic model - there is no fuel balancing, and as the fuel drained from the top tanks, the center of mass moves backwards making the rocket more instable - especially with long few staged rockets, installed a payload with high drag.\n\nOre? Gas station everywhere? Why not needs at least two raw materials for fuel production, for making it some hardness?\n\nUnbalanced properties of parts there are too much propellant in the smaller tanks, the Mk3 has the best dry/wet mass ratio... It is getting worse and worse by each new version. The mass of the drilling machine is only 0.25, and a fairing of a minimalistic probe is over 1.0 (!). And of course the Atomic Motor (new diet) and the Aerospike (lower ATM SpI then some conventional rocket !) are rendered to the useless category...\n\nAnd I don\u0027t wana waste time for repeating the long list of missing features, annoying things of the career, but when the developers implement something, it should be done well."},{"CreatedByName":"MondayZi","CreatedById":143051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:21:24Z","Content":"Is it just a glitch with my save or someone else has found it to?
