If you want to check out what we accomplished last time, [check this out!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100924-S-S-T-Y-C-Challenge)\n\nThis challenge will be for almost anything and everything single stage. Lets see what we can accomplish without making a mess of orbit.\n\nI may modify or add rules depending on how this challenge pans out.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for rules or formatting, feel free to send me a message.\n\n**Rules and Restrictions**\n\n- No single stage to orbit, low Kerbin orbit lifters, liquid jets that \u0022just fly\u0022 (or hover), Kerbin circumnavigators, or ion gliders.\n- Your craft may not use any additional stages in the staging controls, action groups are fine though.\n- No re-fueling with other crafts. Feel free to create a single stage craft that can harvest and convert resources though, I would like to see it.\n- Your craft may separate, but all pieces must be recovered together. No using SSTO lifters or ditching stuff in orbit.\n- It\u0027s ok to lose pieces of your craft while attempting to show it off (i.e. crashing), but it should not lose pieces by design.\n- Information, autopilot, and visual mods are allowed. No other mods please.\n- All stock parts, physics, and solar system. No file tweaking or modding please.\n- No over powered game exploits like kraken drives, or infinigliding. Part clipping is allowed.\n- No debug menu shenanigans. Please be honest, nobody likes cheaters.\n- Must provide pics of your accomplishments, my bandwidth usage limit doesn\u0027t like videos. **Embedded albums rock! If you don\u0027t know how to,** [**you can learn here.**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/misc.php?do=bbcode)\n- If you like this challenge please rate it, and give me rep!\n\n**Scoring**\n\nPlease include at least 3 pieces of information for scoring, feel free to add additional information that you feel is relevant to your design. If I start to see some competition I will create categories, but for now here is what people have accomplished with a single stage.\n\nHere is my entry to get things going\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

The mining parts and scanners etc are all stock, as is the rest of the ship.\n\nBut it is a FAR design. Someone could probably make something comparable in stock aero, but it won\u0027t be me. Like a lot of the FAR-crew, I find stock aero intolerably unpleasant to play with (it\u0027s a lot better than the old aero, but it\u0027s still not a patch on the real thing).\n\nIf anybody wants to try and fly it in stock, feel free; it would probably even work if flown right (i.e. ride the edge of overheating until you\u0027ve maxed the jets for both speed and altitude, raise the apoapsis on the oxidiser and circularise with the nuke).
