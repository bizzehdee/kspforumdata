For starters, what may seem like a memory leak in KSP may in fact be an issue with Unity and Mac. It takes considerable testing and time to boil it down to what actually is causing the memory leaks, and that time is most likely time the development team simply does not have. It could be a very present fact that only a handful of Q\u0026amp;A and experimental testers have a Mac to test KSP on, and there may be nobody on the KSP dev team that actually has a Mac at all. This makes testing and refinement extremely tough, and in a small indie team like the developers of KSP, the money needed to purchase a Mac JUST to start spending HOURS upon HOURS trying to find something that they may not even be able to fix at all, would not be worth it in such a small team. Perhaps you would like to join the Q\u0026amp;A or experimental testers, seeing as you have so much criticism to add? Or do you not have enough time to join the Q\u0026amp;A team? Well maybe the Q\u0026amp;A, experimentals and dev team don\u0027t have enough time or resources to begin finding a fix for the Mac platform, when it is apparent that OSX only makes up for \u003Ca href=\u0022http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Earound 3% of the steam community\u003C/a\u003E. And that\u0027s statistics off of one of the BIGGEST gaming platforms to date. With ownership statistics as low as that, why would the developers spend a huge amount of time working on a fix for such a low turnaround group of the community (low turnaround in terms of possible revenue)? Yes, Linux makes up for a smaller percentage of ownership, but considering that builds for both Windows and Linux are not too much separate, as Windows at its very base could be called a type of Unix system, which is why Linux and Windows are both stable in the terms of memory leaks. Another point of consideration - no memory leaks occur on two of the three platforms KSP is built for. No code is changed in the time it is built for each separate platform - it is just cross-compiled. Which begs the question, why is Mac the odd one out? A change of code to fix something on Mac, may in fact cause instabilities in the other platforms due to the cross-compiling, but seeing as the memory leak is only present on one platform it could in fact be boiled down to Unity not playing well with Mac.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T11:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill feels its flying like beta.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KasperVld","CreatedById":40700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T12:08:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xerogravity\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xerogravity\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDid any of the QA team actually use a Mac for testing?

Hope Ted doesn\u0027t tase me for saying that.) And I\u0027ve never got them during 0.25 and 0.90 either. I\u0027m not saying they don\u0027t exist, I\u0027ve just never seen them.

Perhaps my testing process isn\u0027t conducive to having this leak occur, perhaps it\u0027s triggered by a specific sequence of scene transitions that I\u0027ve just never performed.

I don\u0027t know the relative KSP OSX player base size, but based on the 3% steam community size mentioned earlier, the QA team has a far better OSX representation. There will always be these sorts of things. Even within the the fairly narrow product range of Apple, there is a vast amount of different computer software and hardware combinations. It\u0027s impossible to cover all possible combinations. And don\u0027t suggest making the dev builds available for everyone to test. It used to be like that, when the community was much much smaller, and it just didn\u0027t work. The shockingly bad and useless bug \u0027reports\u0027 were so overwhelming Squad created the experimentals team. Even with warnings and disclaimers everywhere, it just wouldn\u0027t work. Trust me, things work a heck of a lot better the way they are currently. Not saying certain things can\u0027t improve; there\u0027s always room for improvement.

I see no real justification for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, having said that I feel the following also needs to be said: Much of the invective and frustration directed at the 1.0.x releases is, well, a bit justified. See...here\u0027s the thing. 1.0 is supposed to be the finished product; the \u0022fulfillment of the original design document\u0027s vision\u0022 as Squad kept saying. Why then, are core aspects of the game being fiddled with? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a game or software hits 1.0, only minor revisions are supposed to come out OR there\u0027s a long time between significant updates that do more than fix bugs. With the aero and ore sotrage tank revisions in the past week, the game is essentially a different experience in 1.0.2 than it was in 1.0--this makes these updates a major revision, not a minor one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the time between these two versions is less than a week (let\u0027s not mention there were just hours between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2). It doesn\u0027t matter if I like or dislike these changes (I agree with the changes, by the way, before you all lump me in the category of people who just need to shut up and L2P). My frustration is that I invested dozens of hours in a game that was working under a rule set that was a lot like Poker, and now, just days later, the game is more like Texas Holdem. It\u0027s still a game about drawing cards and having the best hand--KSP is still a game about flying rockets into space--but the impression of the overall experience is entirely different. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENearly all all my designs that worked in 1.0 no longer work. This would be a small niggle...except that the gameplay is supposed to STOP evolving past release and remain more less static until \u0022DLC\u0022 or explicit expansions start being released. Why? Because the beta testers were supposed to have at the game and provided balance feedback well before release. Who are these mysterious beta-testers? We are. The whole community who bought the game in Early Access. See, these are the kinds of game-changing and \u0022frustrating\u0022 experiences we Early Access users understood we had bought into. In Early Access, I don\u0027t have a complaint when I say \u0022Man, I had to redesign my entire fleet of rockets.\u0022 It\u0027s because Early Access games are supposed to change the fundamental experience of the game--and frequently too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead updates were months in between and rigorously tested well before released to the Early Access crowd and the game remained static between updates. Updates were also relatively small in scale. Adding a few parts here and there, and major mechanics like the Science system and Career mode were gradually introduced element by element. These mechanics are the strongest elements of the game by far. Why? Because the whole Early Access community was testing them well before official launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe post-release situation is essentially different. We\u0027ve had more updates in one week than we\u0027ve had in four months. That\u0027s backwards. We should have been spammed with updates as a whole community in the month or so prior to full release. The fact that the game has received two updates in a week that majorly rebalances the game indicates that it is not currently the \u0022fulfilled vision of the design documents.\u0022 And that is irritating--because now the game is supposed to be \u0022done.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole community should have been testing the new aero model and heating system. The whole community should have been testing the resource gathering mechanics and parts and their balance with the fuel tanks. These are components of the game that should have been released during the beta phase.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EQ\u0026amp;A testers and the Experimentals aren\u0027t at fault for that...it\u0027s Squad\u0027s decision making regarding going from .90 to 1.0 in one big update. And while bashing them too is not the correct way to deal with this frustrating situation, criticism of the developer\u0027s decision is very much warranted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what I\u0027m trying to say is: Don\u0027t criticize the Q\u0026amp;A people or the Experimentals testers. Criticize the system for these things that Squad designed. Squad had legions of volunteer testers in the Beta versions. They were the Early Access player pool. Squad deliberately and intentionally decided not to release code to this player pool. Why? Because a release version that was essentially just a bug fix version of a Beta .99 that had the new aero model, new thermal system, and resources couldn\u0027t be hyped so much. And that\u0027s because there wouldn\u0027t be many shiny new gameplay elements to \u0022reveal\u0022 to the community. We would have had them already and balanced them out to perfection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s exactly what a game release version should be--a small iterative step between a nearly complete Beta version and what you are asking a premium price for. The polished finished product. The kind of product that has had its gameplay niggles and overall balance critiqued into to the ground before the big day. That\u0027s not what we have. We have a game that will likely receive patches week after week until it is acceptable. And those of us playing the game will experience rule set changes frequently enough that we might just get frustrated and stop playing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing is wrong with Poker or Texas Holdem. But gosh darn it, there is something wrong when the average person doesn\u0027t know which one they should be playing. And that\u0027s what it feels like since 1.0 hit. It\u0027s not that the changes themselves are bad. It\u0027s that I don\u0027t know how to play the game because the rules might be different next week. This kind of instability is appropriate for Early Access. Unacceptable for a 1.0 version.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T14:48:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 02:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scourge013\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fleb","CreatedById":63851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T15:02:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to say thanks to Squad and all the QA people, I have been having a blast with 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
