The aim is to build space stations around planets and moons, top them up with kethane and so have refuelling stations scattered around the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I just have stations around Kerbin and Mun, and have a mining vehicle which also transports the kethane up to the munstation. An ion-powered transport vessel is waiting at my Kerbin station to move the kethane around. Here\u0027s the Mk I lander/miner (with radial and ion engines) docked to the station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.ajones.co.uk/kethaneminerss.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kethaneminerss.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is currently the weight / efficiency of my Munlander. I\u0027ve made some changes since the screenshot (a single Monopropellant tank, for example - docking has been much easier than I thought!) and am also working out a good way to mount nuclear engines without smashing them on landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs anyone else playing in this style and I\u0027m just wondering what efficient vehicles people have come up with for the munlanders, so that you don\u0027t spend half your mined kethane on renewing your fuel supply?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdam\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T10:31:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELV-N\u0027s may not be the most efficient choice. Their extra weight can drag them down more than their Isp helps them, especially on landing when the engines will be a much bigger chunk of your mass. For alternatives consider the LV-909, Aerospike, or for a huge ship even the KR-2L.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that, the best thing is probably to cut off excess weight. You can refine on the ground or in orbit, it makes little difference if you\u0027re making LFO (but if you\u0027re making monoprop or xenon it\u0027s more efficient to do it on the ground), but either way don\u0027t be hoiking your converter up and down every time. Or your drills for that matter. Of course, this means you\u0027ll need to master on-the-ground fuel transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPersonally I don\u0027t see the point of kethane in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, beyond demonstration missions. It\u0027s quick and easy to launch fuel directly. Now if you\u0027re operating on other planets or moons, then kethane becomes more helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pope_Gregory_IX","CreatedById":82244,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T10:58:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your thoughts. I did think about leaving the miner on the surface of the Mun, but it was the ideas of transfers that put me off. I agree about the lack of need for kethane this close to kerbin, but this is the first stage (and a sort of test run) of something that I hope to extend across the system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a big converter at the Munstation, but I do also have conversion on the lander - perhaps with a lighter, more efficient vehicle I can ditch that - at the moment, I have been converting on the surface of the Mun in order to get me back up to orbit.

My design philosophy behind Kethane is this; \u0022More and bigger converters and drills will make your ship mine Kethane faster, but then again, so does time warp.\u0022 You really only need one medium converter and one drill, but I go with one medium converter and 4 drills because 4 drills will mine Kethane at just about the same rate that a medium converter will convert Kethane into liquid fuel, oxidizer, and mono-propellant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just finished setting up my Kethane mining system for a tour of the Jool system. I am playing with custom biomes, so I plan on doing multiple landings on all the moons of Jool. I have a standard Kethane miner which is fairly simple. I use a 3.75m KW tank as the base of the lander with 6 landing legs. I put 3 small fuel tanks with a nuclear engine radially attached to the main tank. I also put on the medium converter, 4 drills, and a .625m fission reactor from Interstellar to power it. In Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I have a Kethane mining operation set up on Minmus. My lander never leaves Minmus\u0027s SOI, I built a giant and very efficient fuel tanker to ferry fuel from Minmus to LKO. I would suggest considering mining on Minmus. It takes ~640 dV to take of from the Mun, while Minmus only requires ~240. Also, the flatlands of Minmus are much more pleasant to land on. In Jool\u0027s SOI, I mine from Bop, then I have a tanker take the fuel to a fuel Depot between Tylo and Vall\u0027s orbit. My fuel tanker follow my landers to each of the moons for refueling.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-03T13:40:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2014 01:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Rabada\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T13:47:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can try using the Rocomax Poodle.

First off, the mun is not going to be very efficient for this kind of thing because of the relatively high gravity, but it\u0027s still possible to get a net gain of fuel to your station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually have three ships in my system. The first is a station orbiting the mun and acting essentially as an orbital fueling station (and also living room for a few Kerbals just in case). The second is a stationary base which has the kethane mining and converting station and a few other things. Kethane is mined and converted on site. The third is a lander that holds lots of fuel and can go between them. I transfer fuel into it from the base using Kerbal Attachment System.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe separate lander makes it more efficient because then I don\u0027t have to move the conversion equipment which increases the amount of fuel needed to reach the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is one flaw: you have to land super close to the base to get all the pipes set up. This requires precision landing that uses up a significant amount of fuel, which is a problem when kethane is a limited resource. Sometime soon I plan to send up some sort of tanker truck that can go between the base and the lander, which will be easier and more efficient because wheels are electric.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-03T14:35:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/03/2014 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Blind Dead McJones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-03T15:45:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat is heavier?
