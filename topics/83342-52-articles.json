As I recall from US aircraft systems the older ones from the 70\u0027s tend to get cheaper to build each unit over time , but their upkeep costs go up as they age, this is pretty much from more efficient modern manufacture, more efficient modern components, and simplified designs that remove unnecessary redundancy, also mass production saves heaps of money. All this is basically already covered in the way KCT works. I\u0027m not sure you can easily simulate an aircraft getting more expensive to maintain as it ages that easily, besides it takes decades before an airframe starts to fall apart. Perhaps just log the date a design was finalized and after a few years reduce the inventory effect for building that design, that would simulate the higher cost of reusing the same aircraft, but actually making more of them would in the long run be cheaper due to the other cost reduction from component use history.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a few ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T06:36:00Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 06:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MarcAFK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T15:54:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that a portion of the cost should still be required upfront, as a startup cost.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Svm420","CreatedById":136047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T16:14:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like what we have KISS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gryphon","CreatedById":58513,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T18:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Svm420\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Svm420\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI like what we have KISS\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree, I don\u0027t feel a desire for a more complex rocket logistics simulation than KCT.

Some people obviously really like the idea (I think it would be interesting - it would allow me to start building a big ship that I don\u0027t have all the funds for right away, or at least put it in the pipeline to be built without actually having to pay for it). Other people will be against it wholesale. Once you have a way to implement it as a choice, then we should be talking about what the different choices could be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now, I\u0027m seeing three major options that have been voiced: the pay-upfront (as it is now); pay-as-you-go (the idea that started this off); and pay-in-instalments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe pay-upfront option wouldn\u0027t have anything that would need to be calculated. However, the other two COULD be tweaked by formulae. For instance, assume that there are three stages to the build: 1) upfront cost; 2) building cost (pay-as-you-go); and 3) finalization cost (or launch cost). By setting a formula to calculate the percentage for the building cost (and also how quickly it is paid - quicker at the start, or slower, for instance), and another for the division between the upfront and launch costs (similar to your rollout/pad-repair calculation), you would then be able to tweak these three costs, giving you a range of options. For pay-upfront, all you need to do is set the building cost to 0, and the upfront/launch costs to be 100%/0%. For a completely pay-as-you-go, you would need to give some formula for building cost, and set upfront/launch costs to be 0%/0%.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m leaning this way.

I believe there are MM patches floating around for it either in this thread or the KW one. Basically KW never updated properly to the 0.90 part catalog where engines and fuel tanks are separate. KSP has some code to figure out whether a part is an engine or a fuel tank for backwards compatibility, but KCT trusts that the authors actually update from using the generic \u0022Propulsion\u0022 category to the new \u0022Engines\u0022 and \u0022Fuel Tanks\u0022 categories. The code that handles the parts in the inventory doesn\u0027t care about part categories, just the display does, so they just won\u0027t show up until they\u0027re placed in the right categories.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T22:21:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk i found the invetory... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.) but then i found out I have an ridiculus ammount of parachutes? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had realchutes installed for a while, could this be the problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c67DNLB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022c67DNLB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.) how do I store planes for refueling?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T22:52:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 10:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by WeirdCulture\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
