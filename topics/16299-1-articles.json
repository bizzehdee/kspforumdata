It\u0027s a little fighter-y jet, all stock, that flies hands-off with just a hair of nose-up trim. If you apply this trim before takeoff, it flies itself off. It turns on a dime, and stalls at 30-35 m/s, so it\u0027s pretty easy to land as well, though tends to shed its engine on uneven ground. The only bad habit is a tendency to dutch roll as the air gets thinner. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-07T17:42:20Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2012 05:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Rickenbacker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FunkMunki","CreatedById":37574,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-07T17:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFun to play around with.

Takeoffs are a little less smooth, but it works. It also works fine with the regular jet engine (slower, but longer endurance) and the aerospike (insanely fast, but NO endurance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E).
