Instead of having snacking varience a function of both traits, simply making it a function of Stupidity. This trait should determine a kerbal\u0027s \u0022snacking variance\u0022 (how many snacks are consumed each meal). The stupider the kerbal, the greater the variance. A 100% Stupid kerbal would either eat 0 snacks or 2 snacks each meal. A 0% Stupid kerbal would always eat 1 snack per meal. Perhaps some formula like Stupid/2 = probablility that 0 or 2 snacks are consumed and the remainder is 1 snack consumed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECourage would determine a kerbal\u0027s fortitude during a snack shortage. At meal time, a kerbal tries to eat some number of snacks. If there are not enough snacks, then that kerbal would have a \u0022snack deficit\u0022 and would suffer ill-effects. There are two ill-effects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Cstrong\u003ENon-lethal\u003C/strong\u003E - When under a snack deficit, a that kerbal suffers a delayed reaction. A larger deficit leads to a larger reaction delay. Perhaps something like [baseReactionDelay*SnackDeficit = EffectiveDelay]. EffectiveDelay would be mediated by some function of Courage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. \u003Cstrong\u003ELethal\u003C/strong\u003E - If a kerbal has a snack deficit\u0022 at meal time, he runs the risk of dying from hunger. Again, the larger the deficit the more likely of death. As an example, let\u0027s say that once a kerbal reaches a snack deficit of 10, he has a 100% risk of death. So a kerbal that has a snack deficit of 1 would have a 10% chance of death that meal time. At the next meal, that kerbal would have a 20% chance of death because he has a snack deficit of 2. This increases in a similar fashion until the limit (in this case, 10). A kerbal\u0027s Courage would lower that chance of death in a similar way it lowers it\u0027s reaction delay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf kerbal\u0027s have a snack deficit and gain access to more snacks, they will immediately consume enough snacks to bring them to 0 thus saving them from suffering any further ill-effects. Furthermore, these ill-effects could be set via a .cfg file allowing people to customize Snacks! to their liking (even perhaps turning off either or both of the ill-effects).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully I\u0027ve adequately described these suggestions and they wouldn\u0027t be too difficult to implement if you think they are a good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T04:11:31Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 04:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Epiphanic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-15T21:07:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs this working in v1.0.4?
