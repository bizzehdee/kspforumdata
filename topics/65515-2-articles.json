For most Eve landers I have seen, the margin of error is much, much lower, maybe something like 500-1000 m/s.

During the ascent, at least 8150 m/s is spent fighting drag and gravity. On Kerbin, the numbers are 2250 m/s, 4550 m/s, and 2300 m/s, respectively, so you can afford getting a much higher fraction of the delta-v from low TWR stages than in Eve ascents.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cerberusti","CreatedById":89638,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-17T22:25:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you fly it up with a perfect gravity turn it would matter, I did not actually expect to reach orbit on the first try (my DV estimate was lower than the total mechjeb is giving.)

Drag is still quite significant, but as the terminal velocity starts rising rapidly, you need high thrust to keep up with it. You can keep accelerating and pushing your apoapsis higher even with low thrust, but what you really want to do is to keep the climb rate high enough while gaining horizontal speed, so that time to apoapsis keeps increasing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an efficient Eve ascent, you should be close to orbital velocities before reaching 60 km, while drag remains significant until about 80 km. Climbing those 20 km takes a lot of time, and every second you spend below 80 km costs you delta-v due to drag and gravity. I\u0027m not sure what\u0027s the optimal climb rate at those altitudes, but it\u0027s certainly better to climb 200 m/s too fast than 200 m/s too slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T03:24:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlright - tonight I tried a test water landing on Kerbin.
