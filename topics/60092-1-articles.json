However, there are some very convincing arguments that antimatter behaves the same in regards to gravitational fields. For example, photons are their own anti particles, so when light gets bend by gravitation you\u0027d expect half to bend 1 way and the rest to bend in the other direction. However, when we look at gravitational lensing all the photons bend the same direction. This in combination with similar indications gives a strong reason to believe that antimatter follows the same old boring gravity that we do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InfinityArch","CreatedById":66832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T15:17:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the curvature of the universe, weren\u0027t there some recent results that implied the curvature constant was very, very close to being exactly 0, which would correspond to no curvature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ralathon","CreatedById":71537,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T15:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022InfinityArch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022InfinityArch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERegarding the curvature of the universe, weren\u0027t there some recent results that implied the curvature constant was very, very close to being exactly 0, which would correspond to no curvature.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027ve been getting data that implies a flat universe for ages now.
