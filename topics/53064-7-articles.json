Pretty sure that once a career is started, you run off the locally saved copy of the tech tree you loaded initially. Let me know if I got that straight, because I want to make sure I\u0027m messing people\u0027s games when I perform updates. From what I could see, my old saves still had the old version of the trees.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is because of how TreeEdit works in comparison to TreeLoader. You are the \u0022owner\u0022 of the tree, so you have a \u0022local copy\u0022 of the tree stored. Unfortunately, the F5 save functionality does not seem to work the same between reloads of KSP for trees that you are not the \u0022owner\u0022 off when using TreeEdit - you have to reload the tree each time you restart KSP from the online version, so your career gets updated to whatever the lastest public version of the tree is. This is a large part of why TreeEdit is not in \u0022general release\u0022 yet as far as I understand, and why trees need to get \u0022approved\u0022 before they go into public display for TreeLoader users (which does save local copies of the tree.cfg properly, only needing to be loaded once per career save).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Aazard - I agree that you don\u0027t have to pull months or days of aerobraking, but as you said it means you need the proper insertion angle - thus needing the extra dV that I mentioned unless you happen to have a very well timed return window and a good launch orbit from whatever body you are returning from. I was also thinking about it as I was doing a stock-scale Munar landing earlier in sandbox, and it\u0027s also possible that some of my extra dV usage is because of how I do my landing profiles on non-atmospheric bodies - largely due to the poor framerates the current laptop gets when loading the surface texture chunks, I use a somewhat less-efficient decent profile which kills all horizontal surface speed at a much higher altitude than a more efficient pure-suicide-burn landing would (this means that I only get one spot of framerate lag for that texture chunk, which then doesn\u0027t change because I am descending straight down over the same surface location, rather than still travelling horizontally and loading progressive texture areas as I do so). Can hardly wait to get the new computer here (KSP being the first thing being intalled onto it beyond basic system utilities, lol) and see how it changes my \u0022piloting/lack of control workarounds\u0022 that I\u0027ve been using thus far \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: btw, it\u0027s not memory issues I\u0027m having with the current laptop, it\u0027s just simply that it is about 6 years old with integrated graphics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E It\u0027s actually got 8G of RAM on it, with more than enough free for KSP to utilize to the best that it can, and I\u0027ve done some pretty serious texture reduction and parts pruning so that I usually am only running about 2.7G of memory in use by KSP at runtime. But it still takes 20-25 minutes to actually get through the load process (and even with no mods it takes about 15 minutes just using stock KSP) and has horrible issues when swapping textures in game even at 1/4 res.

(Collect X data, around Y body, in Z situation, for A science points) Feel free to send me your suggestions via PM. In order to get a full experience of scientific missions, MCE is apealing to allow for impact missions which can then also payout science. Simulating impact objective with the science modules, even with my plugin, it\u0027s not really feasible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people have expressed concerns about SRBs and their usefulness. I tend to use them to give me a little boost to my core stage and allows me to cheat with a slightly lower than 1.2TWR on the LP. I\u0027ll put a ring of 8 Globe I\u0027s around my 2M core stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was talking with Nathan, and one of the useful things of KSP (which can be modeled in KSP) is their price. They are cheaper than than rocket fuel engines. So once money is in play, using a quick SRB fix rather than get better engine or add liquid boosters will be more meaningful. I\u0027m considering perhaps lowering the cost of SRBs by maybe 50% and see how that plays in the whole thing. I\u0027ll keep that for V19.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to add experiments to the \u0027mercury\u0027 and Gemini capsules. And adding with a MCE mission, you could do the Gemini docking mission and have it payout science. Not really possible in the science module mindset. (Although I could add a \u0027docked\u0027 situation check) Well see. I don\u0027t want to turn the plugin into this huge thing that does more than it should.

The only way to reach that much dV for me was to invest in the rocketry tree, which is currently at level 3. So more thrust, less mass and better isp means you can make much better rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly try to steer away from the 500 rocket asparagas staged with a bajillion boosters on it setup. Aerodynamics plays an even bigger role with FAR that sticking on more fuel/engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-26T02:21:39Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2013 02:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by stevron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T02:18:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MedievalNerd\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MedievalNerd\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith RSS you have to plan your payload wisely. My early satellites are in the range of 175kgs. I don\u0027t recall the payload % in average to certain types of rocket, but it\u0027s a very low percentage.
