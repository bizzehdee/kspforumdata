The satellite is designed to facilitate transmission of entangled photons from a ground station in Beijing to one in Vienna; this would allow quantum key encrypted communications over about 7,000km, versus the current record of a few hundred kilometres over fibre. The satellite is also intended to demonstrate quantum teleportation over this distance, again compared to current records of a few hundred kilometres.\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-satellite-is-one-giant-step-for-the-quantum-internet-1.20329\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EAccording to one of the physicists on the team,\u003C/a\u003E the satellite could be followed by others if successful, allowing transmission of quantum information across the globe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"insert_name","CreatedById":150339,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T22:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the entanglement experiment a FTL comms test, I heard that somewhere but it wasn\u0027t a very credible source and I am doubtful for hopefully obvious reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-15T23:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222718386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022145987\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221471301552\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150339\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022insert_name\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n19 minutes ago, insert_name said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the entanglement experiment a FTL comms test, I heard that somewhere but it wasn\u0027t a very credible source and I am doubtful for hopefully obvious reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, entanglement is used for light-speed (or slower) communication.

There are existing methods to amplify one of the\u00A0entangled photon pair via lasers/masers for example. At that point, satellite itself can be just a mirror. The trick is then to have it be a very finely tunable mirror that lets you bounce that beam precisely and without significant losses.

But that merely shifts weight of the amplifiers to the sat. Tech remains exactly the same. The challenge is to take a single photon and turn it into an avalanche of photons while preserving entanglement. A laser already does this, so long as distance you are trying to send the beam to is within the laser\u0027s coherence length.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm.
