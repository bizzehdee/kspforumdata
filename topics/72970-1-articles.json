What I do is connect the various ships to a fuel tank that is attached a Kethane refinery and then use the TAC Fuel Balancer to set that fuel tank to Transfer out so all the tanks on the connected ships fill up when the refinery is running. I did see the \u0027Pump from here\u0027 option on the pipe ends but don\u0027t really use it. Is there a better way to move fuel about using the KAS pipes that I am missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SSSPutnik","CreatedById":91745,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-22T03:58:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHeh I landed too far from my Kethane refinery on Bop yesterday.
