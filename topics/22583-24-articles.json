I was trying to set up a screenshot with all the different craft I was playing with this weekend and after 4-5 planes were placed, the radial props would explode violently on the parked craft when an active one approached. I was arranging them on the tarmac in front of the SPH, so I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a craft problem or a world problem. Seems to occur around the point where my active craft gets within say 500-1000 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snjo","CreatedById":57198,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T13:40:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo only the engine explodes?
