The simulation code doesn\u0027t cope correctly when a decoupler is the root part of the ship or is attached to its parent the \u0022wrong\u0022 way round. This is a flaw in the code that simulates the decoupling action, basically the entire ship gets decoupled so the next stage(s) effectively doesn\u0027t exist and no calculations are done for it. It currently removes the decoupler and all children of it from the vessel, but if it is the root part then this removes the whole vessel. The decoupling code needs to be changed to only discard those parts that are \u0022under\u0022 the decoupler. The same \u0022issue\u0022 can be seen in the core game, with the staging of the decoupler causing a vessel switch (complete with messages about focus and timewarp) that doesn\u0027t normally happen when staging a decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The in-flight display needs a mode that ignores the staging of the vessel and simply shows the deltaV available with the engines that are currently active, e.g. it will burn the engines until they run out of fuel and then stop. This will enable people that activate and deactivate engines outside of the staging process to get a readout of deltaV for the current state of the vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Something needs to be done to account for the velocityCurve of jet engines while in the SPH/VAB so the user can see the thrust/TWR at various airspeeds and a control to adjust the atmospheric pressure to intermediate settings would also be useful (you can currently switch between sea level and vacuum but you may want to know figures for your spaceplane in high altitude flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to fix these in the simulation code (and make various other tweaks/optimisations) in the near future and Cybutek is working on a substantial UI rewrite that should result in an even more \u0022polished\u0022 KER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI respectfully disagree. A rocketry game that doesn\u0027t calculate delta-V is incomplete, in my book. It\u0027s like a shooter with no ammo counter, or an RTS with no resource counters.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with this. The message from Squad is somewhat contradictory, with the \u0022kerbal\u0022 comical way on one side and the \u0022we\u0027re partnering with NASA\u0022 serious way on the other. The only reason I can see to vote no to this poll is if you feel really strongly that there are other things the devs should be working on first (and then you should actually vote \u0022not yet\u0022). Adding various KER style readouts to the stock game in an optional way and defaulting them to off would have no impact on players who don\u0027t want them but would make the (apparently large) majority of current users happy. I would suggest an in-game training scenario \u0022Introduction to rocket science\u0022 so users that want to can have Wernher vonKerman introduce the basic concepts of TWR, ISP and deltaV and introduce the readout displays along with showing how various edits to the vessel affect the numbers. Running this tutorial would automatically enable the readouts and Wernher would explain that they can be turned off again in the options if desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for saying it would take a large development effort to implement, if I were working on KER full time, the changes I have done so far would have taken less than two weeks and the changes I still plan to do would take about another week. If I were a dev working for Squad, most of the issues caused by the recent 0.23.5 update would simply not have happened, they would have been fixed almost instantly as soon as the underlying change was made (e.g. changes to struts making them transfer fuel in the simulation, the flow changes for monoprop and xenon etc).
