Here\u0027s what I know so far: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWings have the FARWingAerodynamicModel module and other parts have the FARBasicDragModel module. It sorts through all of the parts in a ship and sums the Cd calculations. Shielded and nonphysical parts are ignored. For each part, I assume most of the Cd value comes from open stack nodes (relative to their size). And it seems like there\u0027s a 0.003 added for skin friction? (all parts?) The Cd for each part is multiplied by some function of velocity/mach number. For wings I expect it\u0027s a bit more complicated- has to account for drag created by a nonzero angle of attack. Surely they produce some drag even for 0 AoA? Maybe that 0.003 applies? Area is calculated based on open stack nodes (relative to their size).

At first I thought it might be because of poor stability with the tanks emptied, then I noticed something odd: all control surface input seems to be inverted when I try to reenter this plane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://puu.sh/aBDbY/e6292f3371.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://puu.sh/aBDbY/e6292f3371.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://puu.sh/aBDhJ/454eeb9694.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://puu.sh/aBDhJ/454eeb9694.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s also odd to me is that it\u0027s showing a negative L/D and Cl, even though the plane is clearly pitched up in the second picture. I have tried exiting the game and reloading after undocking to see if it would be fixed, but nothing seems to help.
