While type cannot be changed in game (it is determined by chamber pressure, area ratio, cycle type, etc., all abstracted as \u0022engine type\u0022 and applied, as well as can be done given how unrealistic most KSP engine models are, to most stock and mod engines), tech level can. Tech level represents the advances that are applied to a specific model of engine over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, the venerable LR87 used in the Titan rocket went through upwards of 11 revisions over time, and was converted to use all three main fuel types (kerolox, i.e. Liquid Fuel [kerosene] and Liquid Oxygen; hypergolic NTO / Aerozine-50, simulated through the similar NTO/MMH combination ingame; and hydrolox, i..e. Liquid Hydrogen and LOX). Its Isp and thrust-to-weight ratio increased considerably through revision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETerms: SL = sea level, TWR = thrust to weight ratio. Note that in MFSC, all engines include the mass of their thrust plate, so MFSC TWRs will be about 20-30% lower than real life engine stats.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, first MFSC classifies each engine it supports by type. The types are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EO = Orbital maneuvering system (like the Apollo SPS or the Shuttle OMS, designed for tons and tons of restarts, and vacuum-only use). High vac Isp, very poor SL isp, lowest TWR. Example: LV-1, LV-909, Poodle. Usually hypergolic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EU = Upper stage. At most a couple restarts. Same Vac Isp as O, better SL Isp, better TWR. Like the Titan\u0027s LR-91. KSP doesn\u0027t really have any of these, they\u0027d somewhere between the LV-909 and the LV-T45. Given the way it\u0027s shaped, I made the Skipper one, for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EU\u002B = Upper stage optimized for vac use. Highest Vac Isp (higher than O). Lower TWR than U. That\u0027s what \u002B means, higher vac, lower SL, lower TWR. Real life: Centaur\u0027s RL-10. KSP: doesn\u0027t have any examples, but KW\u0027s Apollo-SPS lookalike performs like one (though it is properly made Type O by me). Hydrolox is the fuel mode of choice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL = lower stage. No restarts. Lowest Vac Isp, highest SL Isp barring Aerospike, highest TWR. Real life: Saturn V\u0027s F-1. Stock KSP: the Mainsail, obviously. (Although with its Isp unchanged, it\u0027s really an L\u002B, so that\u0027s how I rate it.) Fuel is usually kerolox, though could be hypergolic or even hydrolox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL\u002B = same changes as U\u002B: higher IspV, lower IspSL, lower TWR. Designed for a single-stage-to-orbit stack (or at least an engine that\u0027s never staged away even if boosters are). Example: Space Shuttle SSME. KSP example: LV-T45.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA = Aerospike. Note that in real life nozzle losses are only 15% or so, and most of the efficiency loss at sea level is because there\u0027s air there, not because the nozzle is the wrong shape. For now they have the Isp of a U in vacuum, and 0.9x that at sea level. Real life examples: J-2T-250k (plug nozzle mod of the Saturn V J-2), the linear aerospike on the X-33. KSP Examples: obvious.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES = Solid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ES\u002B = Solid for vac use, lower SL, higher Vac Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that I haven\u0027t integrated support for HoneyFox\u0027s engine ignition mod, so all the talk of restarts is just for information purposes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat Isp an engine has is determind by grabbing its type, checking its tech level, and getting the appropriate entry in the TLTIsps area of RealSettings.cfg. Then any appropriate multipliers are applied: Hydrolox gets 1.3x to Vac Isp and an engine-specific amount (usually less than 1.3) to IspSL. Hypergolic fuel mode gets only 95% of the Isp in either case.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines have minimum tech levels; they aren\u0027t available before that. You can, however, upgrade past that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E===============================================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, as to how I recommend using tech levels. Note that the KSP tech tree has, roughly speaking, tiers, going from left to right. Start = TL0. When you\u0027ve researched all techs in the tier after that, you get TL1. When you\u0027ve researched all techs in the tier after that, you get access to TL2. And so forth. If there are any remaining TLs, you get them all at the end, or impose a delay on yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Eventually I will make this happen by code. For now, you\u0027re on your honor.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou ARE, however, highly encourage to upgrade any engine, after placing it in the VAB, to your maximum available TL. So if you\u0027ve researched 3 tiers of KSP techs, upgrade that LV-T45 to TL3! Otherwise your Isp will be horrific.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERough TL to year comparison:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL0: 1945\u002B, WW2 and immediate postwar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL1: 1955\u002B, early Space Age rockets, Sputnik\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL2: 1960\u002B, Mercury\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL3: 1963\u002B, Gemini, early Apollo stuff\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL4: 1968\u002B, Late Apollo\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL5: 1972\u002B, Apollo Applications Program, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL6: 1980\u002B, the Shuttle era\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETl7: The present day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-25T21:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, yes, if you\u0027re running Mission Controller Extended, cost does change for procedural parts.
