All objects have a center of mass, and solid objects can spin stably on any axis passing through that center of mass as long as the angular momentum around that axis is maintained. However, with a liquid-filled object, the centrifugal forces caused by spinning produce internal forces on the liquid, causing it to circulate. The circulation transfers angular momentum away from the spin axis, producing a new spin axis, which produces additional force, further misaligning the spin axis. Plus, if there are bubbles in the liquid, this can also alter the center of mass, further messing things up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the long cylinder, the liquid still circulates, but the shape of the body causes it to circulate in perfect alignment with the spin axis, so there is no misalignment and no shift in angular momentum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T21:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n-HMSCDYtM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one is also interesting\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsomeone built that in KSP, but i can\u0027t find the video to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T22:07:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222435744\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133204\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456783028\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022136352\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022micr0wave\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, micr0wave said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n-HMSCDYtM\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one is also interesting\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsomeone built that in KSP, but i can\u0027t find the video to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat one is weirder, I guess the air bobbles in liquid forces them center of gravity to change, this changes rotation who moves the bubbles and change it again, it then reach an point where the bobbles are close to center and keep rotation for some time until unbalance build up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-29T22:32:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222435617\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133204\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456776718\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Einsert_name\u003C/strong\u003E is right.

Solid objects can only have a stable spin around one of the principal\u00A0axes. There are typically just three that are mutually orthogonal, unless there is a degeneracy. An example of a fully degenerate solid body is a sphere, which can have a stable spin around any axis through its center of mass. But take something like a brick, and it will only have a stable spin through the three axes that exit perpendicular to the brick\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRotation around any other axis results in what is called axis tumbling.

Note that what you are seeing is a rigid object, with no flex or sloshing responsible for this motion. It does, however, have\u00A0two axes\u00A0with very high moment of inertia, and one axis with very small moment of inertia. The short peg sticking out of the handle breaks symmetry just enough to prevent the two large moments from being degenerate, and initial spin axis is just a hair short of being perfectly aligned with the slightly smaller moment of inertia principal axis.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is pretty unique combination of rigid body configuration and initial conditions, and it results in rather unique motion. I hope this example is sufficient to convince you that rigid body spin stability isn\u0027t quite as simple as it sounds at first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yourself","CreatedById":4465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T05:33:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222435810\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022133204\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456785167\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n6 hours ago, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut take something like a brick, and it will only have a stable spin through the three axes that exit perpendicular to the brick\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rotation is only stable around 2 of the principal axes if each of the principal moments is distinct (the axes with the minimum and maximum moments of inertia will be stable, while the one with the intermediate moment will not be).

The fun stuff happens when your axis of rotation is a tiny bit deflected from the intermediate axis. That\u0027s when you get a tumble. If we were looking at it from perspective of EQMs on\u00A0\u03C9 in phase space, I\u0027d call it an unstable equilibrium. But in that case, I\u0027d have to call tumbling itself a stable orbit on\u00A0\u03C9, which is all sorts of confusing. When we talk about axis stability, we usually talk about lack of precession, rather than stability with respect to perturbation. By that measure, all three axes are stable. But if you\u0027re an engineer, and you\u0027re just trying to build a flywheel that doesn\u0027t wobble, all you care about is that any perturbation on\u00A0\u03C9 die out.
