That\u0027s not to say I don\u0027t like modularity, but whenever I modularize something, I confuse myself. It\u0027s a confusing conundrum of confusion-inducing confusion. Are you confused yet? I sure am.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething confusing to me right now is the fact that, when using DDS textures, even the stock unmodified ones, the game seems to want to selectively not load some of them properly and display the default white texture on the parts affected. It\u0027s apparently a completely random occurrence, and even affected my own conversion of the KF parts into DDS. I\u0027ve been reverting to using PNG on all my modified textures for the time being. My latest theory is that KSP is not forcing mip-map levels instead of only using them if they are present in the file. Because KSP is forcing the mip-map levels, if the level is not present in the file it will display a null texture. Because KSP has a setting for less-then-full resolution textures on load, then it detects the lack of certain mip-levels when loading the assets and outputs a \u0022texture not found at -insert url here, which \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E be confirmed to have that texture present and accounted for-\u0022 and displays the default white instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on proving this theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBack to modularity... it would actually cease to be all that necessary if we could just reduce the number of duplicate textures being loaded. Right now the repulsor diffuse texture is being loaded for every part that has a repulsor in it, including the model for the medium wheel which is based on the model that was used for the currently perpetual-WIP part \u0022repulsor wheel\u0022 and the newer repulsor effects which include that electric texture, and its accompanying emissive. There\u0027s also that arrow texture which is being loaded several times for each part that uses it. I\u0027ve talked before about texture sharing, but I suppose I\u0027ll need to reiterate it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short... there are two ways we can rectify this. First off though, that wheel which needs the repulsor texture for the deleted object within it could either be re-compiled without the need for that texture \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E the texture itself can be reduced to a 1kb dummy texture. For the others, we need to identify if certain textures can be unified. I suspect that a number of the tread textures could be reduced to one unified texture that would cover all of them, or at least a large number of them. Except for the RBI conversions, I\u0027ve noticed that the treads are pretty much identical in a number of the more recent tread designs. The next step can be done it two ways: you can use MODEL nodes instead of \u0022mesh\u0022 parameters to define the models for the parts in the configurations. This allows you to put the full resolution textures in a separate directory, then reduce the textures in the part folders to dummy texture sizes and use the following to redirect the model to use the full resolution versions such as in this example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EMODEL\u003Cbr\u003E{\u003Cbr\u003E    model = KerbalFoundries/partname/partmodel\u003Cbr\u003E    texture = texturename, KerbalFoundries/Assets/texturename\u003Cbr\u003E}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere the first \u0022texturename\u0022 is the local dummy file name, and the second \u0022texturename\u0022 and it\u0027s accompanying path are the path to the full resolution texture in relation to the GameData folder. The model itself must also be referenced by its path from GameData onward (not including the model extension \u0022.mu\u0022 in this case). This leads to an even better ay of doing this...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second way of doing this is actually my preferred way. This is to emulate what is commonly done for mods in the USI line. While not done in all of Roverdude\u0027s mods, the practice is usually to have all models \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E textures in an \u0022Assets\u0022 folder, with each model having a unique name instead of the default \u0022model.mu\u0022 that Squad likes to use, and then to put the configs into a second folder called \u0022Parts\u0022 without any extra subfolders, and each config to match the name of the part they are assigned to. You still use \u0022MODEL\u0022 nodes, but you don\u0027t need to set a \u0022texture\u0022 parameter because, from the model\u0027s perspective, it\u0027s loading all of its textures from the same directory as it is currently residing which is what most models in KSP do by default. You simply enter the location of the model in the \u0022Assets\u0022 folder within the config and the game does the rest on its own. Each model can then use the same textures, assuming the duplicate textures are named the same. That\u0027s where the model-recompilation step takes place. If you have duplicate textures that have unique names, the models need to be recompiled with those referenced textures renamed so that they are the same. The major benefit to this second option is that no dummy textures need to be loaded into memory which, while the dummies are extremely smell (and thus not much of an impact on memory) they still need to be loaded which, in theory, slows down initial asset loading time when starting the game. The second option also makes the directory structure a lot less confusing and, since all the configs are in a single folder, editing the parts on the config level is a lot easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027m perfectly willing to re-assemble all the assets to accomplish this myself, but I cannot necessarily recompile the models if textures need to be unified. the one downside to all this is, of course, that modularity of the parts is reduced a bunch. However, if multiple parts can use the same textures, such as the case with those which use the generic brushed metal texture or whatnot which is used in a few of lo-fi\u0027s creations, then you can easily release mini-packs which re-use the same assets and don\u0027t need to bloat the game any more than a few more configs would do. Roverdude often makes use of the same textures for multiple parts, sometimes even in completely different models from completely different mods. The best example is where a texture is named something like \u0022common.png\u0022 in which a lot of commonly used images are used in multiple models across all of his mods which gives them that unique look and feel that Roverdude likes to put in his models. He still has to distribute that same file with all of his mods, but it simply overwrites the old copy of it when installing and doesn\u0027t bloat the game with duplicates because he loads it from a common \u0022Assets\u0022 folder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI sorta miss this kind of unifying texture management from previous games I\u0027ve modded. For instance... in the line of games made by Bethesda, most textures are loaded in relation to a \u0022Data/textures\u0022 directory. In the models (they use the nif model format, very easy to edit after compilation because... well... they\u0027re not a compiled format) you can simply reference the texture by name, leaving out any path. If the texture is located in the root default for the game\u0027s search paths, then it uses that. If that is unavailable, then it searches for a possible like-named texture either in the directory that the model resides in, or in alternate locations such as within a compressed game assets file. It prefers the loose file in the root texture folder, but will use the alternate if need be. This is similar to how TextureReplacer will use a texture within its own folder if the texture is present, otherwise KSP will be allowed to use the texture located in its compressed assets. It makes texture management and memory management so much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I\u0027m done now... wall of text completed successfully.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-21T14:40:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2015 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T14:58:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lo-fi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lo-fi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThought about it, but people are easily confused :/\u003Cp\u003EThe rover body I thought about spinning off as it doesn\u0027t have a plugin dependency, and there will be a few more to come eventually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve gone for the modular approach with the IR Rework and it\u0027s proven good:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECore Pack - Parts I consider to be essential to the mod\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EExpansion Pack - Parts that are cool but that most players don\u0027t need day-to-day\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EUtility Pack - All the parts with dependencies or that aren\u0027t robotic (e.g grippers, wheels, struts)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I find interesting is the difference in number of downloads on KerbalStuff, the Core and Utility packs are far more popular than the Expansion pack (or they were before KSP 1.0 hit)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T19:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes you get certain mods that show up on the first page, but the third in the series gets buried to the second page and people just move on to other things rather than go to the next page.
