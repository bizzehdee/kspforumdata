The OMS\u0027 TWR was too low to boost her into orbit from that altitude and kicking the SSME\u0027s back on burned through just about all of my fuel which negated the benefit of the extra fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just wondering if the engine efficiency was tweaked a bit for Phase II, because with Phase I, I was able to put a payload that weighed a couple tons into a 250km orbit and land with just a bit of fuel remaining in the tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T15:07:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone having problems with the 6 way connector cant get it to connect to anything\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazari1382","CreatedById":62013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T15:40:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDelivery of the observation module to the initial version of my station:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/YV9gQ\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

The 3-way coupler is won\u0027t connect at the stem of the T. Only it\u0027s two opposing sides will attach to anything. Fixing this would be great, as the 3-way coupler is the only coupler that can fit on something like a power module without being too big for the cargobay. The second thing is the lack of stackSymmetry on #-way couplers. Turning this on would allow easier placement of symmetrical parts (like docking ports) to the various coupler nodes. The stock 6-way node doesn\u0027t have it and it\u0027s the first thing I change, as it makes building stuff much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is how it works.

You need to post on that thread for customized configuration files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I put that in bold in the OP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENothing against FAR, just that it requires customized exclusive versions of all the cfg files. Either the KSOS runs Stock or FAR, we\u0027re not doing both. We\u0027re not spending the time to balance both, we have enough issues as it is getting this to work in Stock KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t care how popular FAR or DRE is. If they become part of KSP Stock installation, then the KSOS will be 100% FAR compatible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that answers that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-21T16:58:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2014 04:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by helldiver\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyHook","CreatedById":31496,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T17:04:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyone know the rescaleFactor to make the new parts 2.5m?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nazari1382","CreatedById":62013,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-21T18:22:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Percebob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Percebob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI forgot to mention that I had cargo, actually the problem occurs when there is cargo\u002Bbooms extended\u002BSAS.
