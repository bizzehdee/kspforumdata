So, without further addue:\n\nIntertia Dampener\n\nCost: 30.000\n\nSize: A tank-like 3.75m part, around a meter high\n\nWeight: 15 tons\n\nCreates a dampening field around your vessel reducing it\u0027s overal mass at the cost of 300 electric charge/second. The dampener cannot work under strong gravitational fields, and will therefore not reduce mass within 1000 Km of a body equal to or bigger than Kerbin. It\u0027s efficiency then increases to up to 40% mass reduction the further away it is from a gravitational source. (Does not take Kerbol/Sun into consideration, this means that in orbit around the sun unaffected by any planet/moon it would have 40% reduced mass when activated).\n\nThe device needs 10 days to recharge once used (Costs 30 electric charge per second, can be turned off manually)\n\nWhy I think the game could use this: There still aren\u0027t many way to efficiently travel between planets other than Nerv engines, and this part could make other engines a possibilty with huge interstellar ships, since its mass and electric cost would make it useless on smaller vessels.\n\nDiscuss"},{"CreatedByName":"Bug_","CreatedById":140851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T00:52:37Z","Content":"Sounds like a mod thing not a core game thing."},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T01:02:11Z","Content":"There\u0027s sacrificing realism for gameplay.\n\nAnd then there\u0027s things like magically reducing mass with a single part."},{"CreatedByName":"Unfawkable","CreatedById":93524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T01:11:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s sacrificing realism for gameplay.\n\u003E And then there\u0027s things like magically reducing mass with a single part.\n\nWell it says that the orbital surveyor uses witchcraft to find Ore.

I already said there isn\u0027t any realism, you don\u0027t have to repeat yourselves.\n\nNow, 23 tons could be the bottom limit of benefit, but you also need a lot of electricity, and with that solar panels, and taking burn times with the amount of electricity required to sustain them makes it hard to make it worthwhile on a small vessel, so I think somewhere around 40 tons would be the right number. Didn\u0027t crunch the math, but it just seems like it. Anyway, the mass of the device can be increased for balance reasons if needed anyway.\n\nNow for the gravity part, it\u0027s meant as another downside to keep the balance, and to keep the device niche of interplanetary travel, and not to just use it anywhere because it\u0027s useful.\n\nI would design a whole lot of mods, I have ideas levels more unrealistic than this one, but I don\u0027t know the first thing about modding sadly.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Ugh...
