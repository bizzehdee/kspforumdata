I can now officially do single-stage-to-duna without using jets. So, yeah. Yay FAR. But with all this extra DV, I want to actually do stuff. Since I\u0027ve already combined a launcher and a transfer stage, I\u0027m feeling the need to go full-on rocketpunk and build a rocket that can launch from kerbin, transfer to any planet (probably including moho) and do a fully powered landing/take off from the surface of every body except Tylo and Eve (and can land on Tylo) with one refueling in LKO or at the destination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027m really running up against the limits of stock landing legs. The rocket is quite tall, and also rather heavy without many good places to mount/strut landing legs. Basically, I need a bit of inspiration to make this little dream of mine work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(For those who are curious, the mods used were procedural fairings, FAR, Stretchy Tanks, and MechJeb for the info panel)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the fairings cost ~200 m/s of (LV-T30) DV. Such is the price of beauty. Though there may be some savings due to reduced drag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac29/TalkingHat/adsadsadsdsdas.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022adsadsadsdsdas.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac29/TalkingHat/sdfasdfsfdaasdffsda.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sdfasdfsfdaasdffsda.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac29/TalkingHat/afdsfdsdfsadsffsda.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022afdsfdsdfsadsffsda.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-02T04:18:19Z\u0022 title=\u002209/02/2013 04:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Sauron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
