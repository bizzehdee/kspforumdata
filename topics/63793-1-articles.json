So you indeed pay for a freeze-induced sleep/coma, for about $100,000 for 150 years, and you lay in the chryo-tube and slowly fall to sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYear 2089- The awakening:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe unknown sense you awaken to is astonishing, as your eyes sear from the red light flashing in front of you, after being asleep for over 60 years. The noises around you seem to have a female voice, scrambled and unrecognizable until it is drowned out and silenced. The screen above you says \u0022Power outage\u0022 for a few seconds before turning off. You finally reclaim your limbs, and you pull the lever to open the tube, and you stumble out of your tube, and fall to the floor, working your legs to wake them up, you are cold, extremely cold. You begin to thaw as the biochemicals begin to drain from your body. As you regain your vision, you begin to notice something about this that isn\u0027t right, everything around you is broken frayed, and destroyed... So, indeed this seems like a very bad situation to be in, but what would you do if this happened? What do you think humanity would have done in order to prevent extinction from thermonuclear war?
