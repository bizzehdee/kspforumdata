If my understanding is correct, the Commercial Crew capsules are more advanced, considerably cheaper, and will be ready far sooner than Orion. If the Commercial Crew capsules begin flying in 2017 as currently planned, why does NASA need to wait another five or six years and spend a whole load more money to develop another capsule?\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I\u0027m aware, the only advantage Orion has over the Commercial Crew capsules is that it gets to launch on the SLS, which can send it to cislunar space. If this is the only distinction, then all SpaceX have to do is build their own big rocket! In addition to Falcon 9 Heavy, which begins flying next year, SpaceX are working on their next generation rocket, which is provisionally referred to as the \u0022Big Falcon Rocket\u0022 (BFR). Needless to say, BFR is expected to be vastly cheaper than SLS and capably of flying far more frequently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESLS and Orion have drawn some heavy criticism, due to the expectation that they will be far too expensive to allow any useful exploration to occur. Meanwhile, once the ISS program ends, SpaceX and other commercial space companies are expected to sit back and do nothing while SLS and Orion paralyze NASA with crippling costs for many decades to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECasey Dreier painted an exceptionally pessimistic picture during a debate at the Mars Society Annual Convention in August. I had a chance to speak to him after the debate. His view is that SLS and Orion have too much political support to be cancelled, and that NASA are stuck with them for decades to come. His view is that SLS and Orion should be allowed to fly make-work missions in order to defer the cost of hardware needed for real missions for as long as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oo4-ros2yEk?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been disscussions to why Orion and DragonV2, or CST-100 are not interchangable.

You could modify a Mini to cross the Kalahari Desert, or you could use a Land Rover to drop the kids off at school and go shopping downtown, but neither would be the best vehicle for those purposes. The Commercial Crew vehicles are Minis. Orion is a Land Rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, you could modify CST-100 or Dragon for BEO missions (I would actually advocate using them as a dinghy for a MTV instead of Orion because they are lighter and smaller), but it would probably cost more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, Dragon carries a lot of extra weight with its landing system. It\u0027s a good idea for a reusable vehicle designed frequent commutes. But it\u0027s a useless (and unwanted) feature for an expedition that will only fly once every 2 years and that has a tight weight budget. On your trip to Mars and back, would you rather carry more science equipment or fuel for landing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOrion has communication and navigation systems that are designed for leaving Earth orbit. It can be depressurized for EVAs. Its shape makes it capable of skip reeentry and provides more lift than Dragon, making it more adequate for high energy reentries. It has an ECLSS that can keep the crew alive for 3 weeks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDragon has none of those things. It would need extensive modification and system certification to do BEO work. Can it be done? Sure. (although the skip reentry thing is probably unsurmountable with the current mold line and CST-100 is probably a better candidate for the conversion).

For the latter, just brake in Earth Orbit instead of direct reentry.ION Drives are almost certainly to be used for a Mars Mission- packing more Xenon for this purpose would probably need another 1-3T fuel MAX. A lot less than ~23T for a direct-to Earth reenty capsule. Not to mention it allows for reusability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dkmdlb\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow would a pressure suit have saved them?\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not an answer to my question, then, is it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESoyuz 11 depressurised right before reentry, killing the crew- wearing pressure suits probably would have saved them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T23:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESoyuz 11 depressurised right before reentry, killing the crew- wearing pressure suits probably would have saved them.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question was about how the US paid the price for not sending crew up in pressurized suits.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fredinno","CreatedById":143381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T23:04:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TeeGee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022TeeGee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENasa was founded to beat the Russians to the moon. That\u0027s the ONLY reason they were founded. Since the Americans beat the Russians, Nasa has no more use to anyone. \u003Cp\u003EMark my words, the ONLY reason we\u0027d go to Mars anytime in the next 100 years is if Russia or China threatens to beat the states there first. Competition is what fuels space exploration and I find that fact very disgusting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say we cancel Nasa funding for manned programs until someone else threatens to go to mars first. All Nasa seems to do is burn through billions of dollars spinning its wheels on programs that take too long to develop that ultimately get cancelled. It\u0027s painfully obvious to me that Nasa shouldn\u0027t be given the funds for manned programs anymore. Build probes and launch them on private rockets. That\u0027s all they should be doing right now. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENasa is no longer the go-to space administration anymore, spacex will do it cheaper and more reliably.
