It will, of course, take a lot of work. So here is it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be the highest structure you could build, from the ground up? I mean from the surface of Kerbin, into the sky. You would first build some kind of base structure, then use rockets to put additional parts on top. You could put ladders on everything, so the Kerbals could, in theory, climb up all the way into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould I run into framerate issues? Can it be done? These are the questions I may, or may not, answer in the future.
