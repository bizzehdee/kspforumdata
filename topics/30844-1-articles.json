Plus it\u0027s the heaviest command module (I think), which will affect your TWR considerably. If you really want to up your torque, you\u0027re much better off with s lightweight thing that will give you pretty much the same up in torque. And the new stackable probe cores have the advantages of both being very lightweight and demanding (not much) electrical power, just like real torque wheels do. And they are a lot easier to add to a ship than the small probe cores. So they won\u0027t modify your TWR by much and give you pretty much the same amount of torque than the cupola module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I get your idea of wanting more torque, I made the suggestion to add actual torque wheels in the development thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywa^y, have fun, and I hope I helped! ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"creator1629","CreatedById":61446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T05:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eoh hey thanks chris, thats actually good advice, i had not considered the actual torque to weight ratio. yeah the cupola pod is the heaviest one. do you happen to know what a good torque value per metric ton ratio will give decent maneuverability? i want to measure the total weight of my ship, then add probe cores till i get the desired amount of torque.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T05:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat I do not know though. The torque given by the command modules .cfg files aren\u0027t in any unit of sort. However, I guess you could see it that if your mass/torque ratio is .15, you would have the same angular speed (theoretically, although I highly doubt it and it would require experimentation) as the cupola module alone floating in space. I suspect wobble would slow you down a bit (or a lot), but you could base off your calculations from this base value.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"creator1629","CreatedById":61446,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T05:31:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat makes sense, ill base it off those values then, and adjust as needed. ill just experiment off of kerbins orbit before i commit to any long term interplanetary voyages. thanks again chris, you have been very helpful.
