I only have two mods installed - the protractor one that gives you the ejection angles for going to other planets, and the one I used here, camera docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe approach and docking were all done manually, but using the read-outs on the camera docking window, I was able to do it without having to juggle the camera view around. I am confident that I could use this mod to dock when in darkness behind the planet. The only difficulty there is picking out the docking node you want to set as your target. I really should have put lights on the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/KSP09.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP09.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/KSP10.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP10.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/KSP11.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP11.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/KSP12.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP12.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll docked and ready to detach the tug for de-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.88qv.com/KSP/KSP13.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP13.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hiddos","CreatedById":65501,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T11:52:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat\u0027s quite a neat refuelling station you\u0027ve got there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T11:59:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhere do you have this station?

The idea is to eventually have a Mun shuttle docked for transferring personnel to a similar station that I intend to set up around the Mun, so it will be used for fuelling the shuttles.
