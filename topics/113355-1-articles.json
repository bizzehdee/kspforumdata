This means that it\u0027s a very efficient engine. With this engine you get a large amount of delta-v using a relatively low amount of fuel.\n\nThis advantage is offset somewhat by the fact that the engine itself is rather heavy.

However, if you have a larger payload and you\u0027re going on a long journey then this rocket is definitely worth it."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T20:27:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 2km/s dV single stage is basically take-off from Kerbin.\n\u003E So you\u0027re saying that LV-N is only for interplanetary transfers, say.. from Kerbin orbit to Eve?\n\nIt doesn\u0027t do well for landing/launching activities where atm Isp and/or TWR comes to the picture.

Those are usually not very powerfull but are economical and the nuke is extremly economical so it\u0027s often the engine that gets the best range. 909, aerospikes and poodles are all very good engines and are often picked over nukes when the craft is very light, or needs a high thrust engine. Landers need to burn very quickly sometimes for example. Nukes are also terrible for orbital insertion burns when there\u0027s no chance of airbraking. They\u0027re also very heavy and the craft needs heat management.\n\nI don\u0027t think it\u0027s hype per se, it\u0027s just that it\u0027s damn hard to find a reason not to use them simply because of the glorious range they offer. Since spaceplanes use LF tanks and are usually not too heavy they are very well suited for nukes, and SSTOs are very popular so there\u0027s some hype there. Tugs or fuel tankes also also ideal craft for nukes. Basically any craft that isn\u0027t too light or too heavy, or doesn\u0027t need to be thrifty with fuel or high Dv burns done in very little time, is better off using the nuke than anything else.\n\nThe fact that is\u0027t heavy, bulky and hot is for balance and to give other engines a purpose. They\u0027re far from underpowered. They\u0027re pretty balanced with their problems, otherwise they\u0027d be OP."},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T23:31:03Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E They \\*are\\* quite lacking, and I heartily agree about them being underpowered.

Still, it was not a complete engine, but rather just the parts required for the test.\n\nThey tested that successfully, went back to the drawing board, produced the design for the second-generation NERVA-2 that incorporated all the many lessons learned from the NERVA program and far exceeded the performance of what was previously tested, and presented it to the government... and promptly got a big fat \u0022CANCELLED\u0022 stamped on their foreheads for their efforts.\n\nLater-on, at the height of the cold war, there was a program called Project Timberwind which studied nuclear engines in an \u0022end of times\u0022 scenario. Basically, high performance open-cycle nuclear engines for atmospheric and space use when nobody cares about radiation anymore because the nukes are already flying. Thank god that project remained a paper design study that lost all reason to exist with the fall of the Soviet Union...\n\nThe performance of the LV-N ingame, TWR and Isp wise, was actually pretty much a carbon copy of the NERVA-XE test article before 1.0. But then it was nerfed some because in KSP\u0027s tiny solar system with its tiny dV costs, the advantage it offered over chemical engines was so large that it made everything else pointless.
