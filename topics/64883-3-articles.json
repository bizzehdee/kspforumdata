You can only affect the second derivative (acceleration) directly. To make matters worse, you only have binary control over acceleration (at least with keyboard, I haven\u0027t tried using a joystick with KSP), so the controls are both coarse and indirect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeyboards and joysticks are ultimately poor controllers for docking, because they are directional. A positional controller such as a mouse or a touchscreen would be much better. Imagine a docking interface, where you just hover the mouse pointer over navball, and the prograde marker follows the pointer as fast as RCS allows. You can of course simulate a positional controller with a directional controller (this is, after all, what you are doing during docking).
