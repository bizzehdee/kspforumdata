And by the way, those engines are the KAX electric motors. Same as normal engines, except it requires electricity to run instead of fuel. And I somehow managed to get a suborbital trajectory. I think it\u0027s mainly due to the low gravity, light design and big wings. There was so little atmosphere, I was getting speeds of 800 m/s\n\nI had to use a ramp to get enough lift to get off the ground though XD\n\nLove the planet, it\u0027s cracks and rivers look amazing! I\u0027m working on a huge exploration mission, including ISRU and colonisation.
