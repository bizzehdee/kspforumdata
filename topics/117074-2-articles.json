Well, second actually. I had a peek at your old drop-ship with the rear stock ramp a while ago. Remember that?\n\u003E  Anywhoo, once I release the thing I\u0027m working on I will give the base-in-a-box a go.\n\nThat sounds interesting. Keep us posted! Which deployment method are you going to use, simple or complicated?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How do you keep the Trident from burning up on reentry?\n\nAs Selfish\\_meme points out, even if they don\u0027t have airbrakes they have enough control authority that you can use *the whole wing* as an airbrake. When you see the first temperature spike, pull back like there is no tomorrow and watch the G\u0027s pile up.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What is the reason for using shielded docking ports on the modules, which are already hidden within the container? Not challenging the choice, I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a good reason.\n\nSure! First and foremost, that way the ones that I don\u0027t use look better, that\u0027s the main reason. But also, any unused ports stay closed, meaning they are not using physics to check if another docking port is nearby. Should give a fractional performance increase.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How the .... do i breakup the base in a box? I got it docked to a station around Minmus. And its just small dockingports everywhere. Do you use some kind of special tug to drop em off to the surface?\n\nI\u0027ll have you know, you picked the most complicated deployment method. As you have guessed (and is written in the OP), you need to use another vehicle to drop them. Originally I was using a simple rocketcrane, which is linked in the OP, but now you can also grab the very good-looking [Trident](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/132722-Trident-SSTO-V-STOL-Dropship!), which you can see in the above pictures. But if you are having issues with complexity, the Base-In-Several-Boxes version comes with integrated lading systems, for the lazy out there.\n\nAlso, I am about to update *all* files, so you guys might want to hold on if you are about to use these. I\u0027ve been retouching things, and I have managed to shave about 20-30% of the parts of a finished base. Most changes are invisible (and excess of lights and such), except a new, much more part-efficient node (down to 14 parts form almost 30), and I have also managed to put the control electronics for the corridors in such a way that you can drop them with the landing gear, so once installed it goes down to a mere three parts and nothing clipping ruining the looks.\n\nRune.

Fortunately this was never intended to be an easy build (come on! it\u0027s a modular surface base!), more of a \u0022experts players only\u0022, so with time, I think it has become more accessible, not less. In fact, the CRADLE version is dumb easy, with the only caveat of having to land all CRADLES relatively close to each other. I have a tentative blueprint for the Deluxe version that is intended to be dumb-proof, BTW, but landing this horizontally in relatively one piece without pilot input ain\u0027t going to be easy to engineer, I\u0027m telling you that.

Pretty much every module can right itself on low-grav bodies, except the horizontal modules, which you might have to roll over with the rover so you can extend their legs.\n\nBut on Kerbin and likewise high-grav bodies, such shenanigans are much harder to do. The lab module, in particular, is tricky to handle, and as such it comes with a righting mechanism: don\u0027t get rid of that until you have it securely in place.

Oh, and departing the kerbin system from one of the moons is actually rather easy: just leave the moon like you would do if you wanted to come back to Kerbin, but keep the periapsis out of the atmosphere. The idea is that very elliptic orbit retains most of the energy you picked up to go the moon, but letting you take full advantage of the Oberth effect by burning the last m/s when you are going very fast. Then, if you picked the right time to do so, you will just need a few hundred m/s burn at periapsis to complete your transfer. The only tricky thing, is to find the time to leave so you end up with the right ejection angle, it\u0027s very important to get that close to the right value.

Especially for spaceplanes...\n\u003E \n\u003E btw: ingenious reuse of the Nerv drive section on your ssto. That is a very useful trick to use in space, where your choices are limited.\n\nThanks! It was a completely improvised solution because I didn\u0027t want to overload the rest of the stacks headed to Moho part-wise, but once I thought of it, I immediately decided it would be the standard method for delivering these guys around the system. And about my building-fu... I\u0027ve been at it *a long time*. And I\u0027ve stolen from the best around these parts! ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nAlso, if you want to see a really good example of puller configuration... here!\n\n![DaaE0G8.png](http://i.imgur.com/DaaE0G8.png)\n\nThis is the third ship making the trip to Moho, the *manned* one. A VB ring with four nukes around it, pulling with it humongous amount of fuel and assorted modules (lab, refinery, a sensor sat, couple of Klaw Pods...), and the crew SSTO, at the end of a very flimsy string of connections. I still have to bring up more ore to fuel it so it gets to Moho with enough fuel to kickstart the base deployment... mass injected to Moho orbit should be upwards of 70mT, so I need *at least* as much propellant to do that, even with nukes.\n\nRune. I have no doubt you\u0027ll improve the same way! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-03T19:48:04Z\u0022 title=\u002210/03/2015 07:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Rune**"},{"CreatedByName":"CrashTestDanny","CreatedById":151030,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-04T01:22:42Z","Content":"Rune, what is that thing with the green stuff at the top of the center stack?

Consider it an in-testing model. It is a bit too tight on dV for Kerbin with the payload I want it to have (2.5mT on the bay), so maybe a short of advanced Heinlein. But that would short of take the Heinlein\u0027s spot...\n\nThe green thing on the top is a USI-Life Suport 2.5m greenhouse to handle the crew\u0027s need once the base is deployed. I also have a KIS/USI-LF module there to stay on the ring to handle things in orbit. In the meantime, redundancy or something.\n\nAnd yeah, I saw them on the phone while I was out. Nice! Reminded my of my 0.90 save, when I started tinkering with ring stations. Pic for nostalgia\u0027s sake, and so you can see that you did pretty much the same thing I did:\n\n![5IQupad.png](http://i.imgur.com/5IQupad.png)\n\nRune.

It waited for under 1km before it started burning too... will try it again later on and see if I can get some useful feedback, but it was probably something dumb on my part. In the meantime I just stacked them all in a 35km orbit at about 30 minute intervals."}]}
