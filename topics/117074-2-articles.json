She is a nice little rocketship. Oh, and departing the kerbin system from one of the moons is actually rather easy: just leave the moon like you would do if you wanted to come back to Kerbin, but keep the periapsis out of the atmosphere. The idea is that very elliptic orbit retains most of the energy you picked up to go the moon, but letting you take full advantage of the Oberth effect by burning the last m/s when you are going very fast. Then, if you picked the right time to do so, you will just need a few hundred m/s burn at periapsis to complete your transfer. The only tricky thing, is to find the time to leave so you end up with the right ejection angle, it\u0027s very important to get that close to the right value.
