If you go to your KSP directory (ksp-win-64 or something like that) and go into saves, then go into your save (sandbox) there should be a lot of .sfs files for various quicksaves. There will also be a persistent.sfs, which is the corrupt file. If the file size is less than the most recent quicksave, it probably got cut off while it was being saved and is corrupted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso in that save file should be a folder called \u0022Backup\u0022 if I remember correctly. First off, take the corrupt persistent.sfs file and move it somewhere (in case it\u0027s still good) and take the most recent .sfs file from Backup and copy it to your save file. Rename it to persistent.sfs if it isn\u0027t called that already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you boot up the game again it *should* load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I haven\u0027t had to do this for quite some time, so I may be wrong about the file structure. I\u0027d recommend a confirmation from someone else before attempting this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
