Ohwell..  If I hear of any more problems I\u0027ll just start bundling it and moving the LH2 patch stats into the part configs.  One less thing I\u0027ll have to swap around for the 1.1 update.\n\nSpent a bit of time yesterday working on shuttle landing gear.  And then I remembered what a PITA the stock modules were to use/set things up for (ModuleLandingGear does not support suspension or built-in steering; ModuleWheel does not support animations; I need both)... so spent the remainder of my modding time yesterday writing up the preliminaries of a custom wheel module (which should be usable for wheels, landing gear, or landing legs, of fixed/extensible/animated/non-animated varieties; with support for multiple independent wheel colliders being managed by a single module).\n\nSadly, this module will be short lived, as I\u0027m 100% certain that it will break with 1.1 and need to be rewritten.  I can only hope that whatever wheel package Squad picked up is usable by modders without having to pay for another license.  Can also hope (but do not anticipate) the stock ModuleWheel is usable, useful, and easy to setup, and that I do not need to (re)write a custom solution; only time will tell.\n\nAnd spending a bit of time today writing up a module to manipulate the GUI fields of other modules. This will be capable of renaming or hiding any GUI field/action/event for any other part-module, based on some simple syntax/nodes added to their configs.  Ideally this will work for nearly any module / field / event / action, though there might be a few cases where there are some things it cannot override (due to the module itself constantly changing the name/status).\n\nThe reasoning behind this is to cleanup some of the extraneous right-click menu options for some of the parts -- such as removing all of the RCS \u0027thrust limiter\u0027 and \u0027enable/disable\u0027 buttons from the SC-E parts; or renaming or hiding/removing the \u0027Control From Here\u0027 options (\u0027Control From Cockpit\u0027, \u0027Control From Docking Port\u0027, \u0027Control From Outhouse\u0027, etc).  Will see how useful this module is... it should work for many cases, but I know there are going to be a couple that it just won\u0027t work appropriately for (would need someway to hook into the modules own code / use logic to determine naming/status etc)."},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-22T18:17:55Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/) Please don\u0027t spend too much time on a short-lived module.

I need the landing gear working and integrated in order to complete the model; or at least I need to model the landing gear/etc before I can start texturing, and it is helpful if they are rigged properly from the start.\n\nPretty sure I already have the module to a mostly workable state for what I need for the shuttle parts, may take a few more hours of work to add in the steering and brakes code, and probably a few more hours after that in order to get it balanced and working smoothly.  Should likely have it done and working by the end of the day.\n\nRS-68 -- possible, sure, but not really anything I want to mess with at the moment.

A few bits to sort out on it as i was sure there would be (some modules update their fields during Update/etc ticks, and will need to overwrite those values per-tick).  But, at least it cleans up all the extra RCS thrust/isp/enable/disable buttons from the SC-E fuselage, making the right-click menu of reasonable length.  Can always improve on it in the future.\n\nRS-68 will be receiving vectored roll-exhaust (and thrust) with the next update.  It does mean that the engine is no longer perfectly balanced, but even with the slight thrust offset/differential it is still very flyable, and actually has some roll-control now with single engine setups.  Still doing tweaking and testing on it, but should be available with the next update.\n\nWheel module is... coming along.  Deployment/retract works, suspension follows the wheel collider appropriately.  Wheel properly collides.  Have some wheel-collider setting based stuff to clean up (target position and spring force I believe).  Still need to implement steering, brakes, and motors.... but those shouldn\u0027t be too difficult to get working after I get the basics online.\n\nAnd the wheels are coming along as well.
