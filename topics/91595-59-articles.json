dual-manifested rockets.\u00A0 Sometimes, it costs less to launch a pair of spacecraft on two small rockets versus one big one, but I don\u0027t mind spending a little extra to avoid the time required to conduct two launches and a rendezvous.\u00A0 Not to mention depending on your proficiency, you may end up eating into your mission propellant conducting the R\u0026amp;D maneuvers.\u00A0 So it really comes down to weighing the pros and cons of single- or dual-manifesting a rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Neil
