Many games screw up at that point, and it\u0027s important to remember that in terms of \u0022realistic\u0022 outcomes (the desired simulation should be to have realistic outcomes, right?) the game is only as realistic as the least realistic bit. In may cases a game would do better to have a board-game style damage table than \u0022simulation\u0022 if the simulation is done wrong, honestly (think of a old board/tabletop/paper game like \u003Cem\u003EHarpoon\u003C/em\u003E as an example).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat\u0027s the mass of a KE weapon (missile) in this game? What do closing velocities possibly look like? Several km/s? More?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can argue that the hull is a tin-can, and the missile, call it 100kg (incredibly light, IMO) hits at 5 km/s. There was some talk about it going on one side and out the other. I don;t disagree, but it\u0027s considerably more complex than that. The volume it passes through is not empty, it is filled with propellant. This means that there will be at the very least a shockwave moving through the tank, which means some of the energy is deposited along the way. Any sensible projectile in this situation might detonate some distance from the target, and pepper the craft with many, smaller fragments at the same velocity. It might not wreck the target outright, but I see almost any hit as a mission-kill on the target unless the propellant tanks are very compartmentalized (which is a mass-expense).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe mentions spaced armorm, which is light, but effective vs the sorts of threats that ISS faces... but the weapons hitting these warships are not flecks of paint at 5 km/s, they might be more massive penetrators at those kids of velocities. The spaced armor in this case means that more energy, not less, is delivered to the target. If you stop a round, that energy is left in the target, and this means heat. I\u0027m honestly unsure what would happen... it\u0027s a non-trivial aspect of the game, and in fact much harder to get at than the orbital mechanics, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-08T14:34:10Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2016 02:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by tater\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"weissel","CreatedById":81306,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T03:17:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222557347\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462240288\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022543\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Accelerando\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/3/2016 at 2:51 AM, Accelerando said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSloped armor is still an assumption as you admit, and that is important, since the structure of a spacecraft\u0027s armor (or lack thereof) is certainly one of the defining features of a warship. \u003Cstrong\u003EYes, this means that they have a \u003Cem\u003Evision\u003C/em\u003E of how things should be.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Just because you agree or don\u0027t agree with it, or that it makes/doesn\u0027t make sense to you, does not mean it is not an assumption.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI ... disagree. \u00A0A \u0022vision of how things should be\u0022 is starting with the \u0027this is how things should be\u0027 and fixing the universe to allow that, if necessary. \u00A0The WWII plane and sub \u00A0games had a vision of sorta-realistic simulators\u00A0with many/lots tweaks towards playability. \u00A0They know the end goal fairly well from the start.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCoaDE is more of an experiment, or like maths: we start with a (fairly)\u00A0small number of axioms (which at least seem to make sense), and see where they lead us.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0I also challenge you to show\u00A0a spacecraft shape that has equal or\u00A0better properties in interior size, mass of armor \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thickness of armor at any given spot (say, frontal, 45\u00B0, 90\u00B0, 135\u00B0,\u00A0180\u00B0).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222557347\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138457\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462240288\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022543\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Accelerando\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 5/3/2016 at 2:51 AM, Accelerando said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd CoaDE makes many other assumptions, such as:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nAvailable technology (no, you cannot use photon torpedoes or shields)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpecific impulse - MPD thrusters and NTRs are the upper limit, limiting your Isp to some tens of thousands of m/s at most, and the game assumes a situation where it is economical to manufacture these en masse.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe theater of space combat.

Ball shot goes into the gun deck. No game I have ever seen tracks the ball, did it hit any metal going in, say a latch on a port lid, turning that into shrapnel? What about splinters, does the game model crossed planking, so that you get variant shard of oak many cm long flying? What about the ball ricocheting off a gun? The reality is that modeling a single round shot hitting a warship would likely be a daunting task to do properly at the scale size of the ball.

I said that a lookup table might be every bit as accurate as a poor \u0022simulation,\u0022 where \u0022simulation\u0022 is here defined as a computational damage model making simple assumptions at each step (say following a particle as is passes through a target).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA particle can be any size, I\u0027m using the term for ease of discussion, nothing more. We\u0027re dealing with space, and astronomical velocities, so anything smaller than masses that matter for solar systems is a \u0022particle.\u0022 \u0022Macroscopic\u0022 to me would relate to the general picture of significant events being modeled, ignoring the low-order stuff that doesn\u0027t matter (paint chips, etc). We can pick another indeterminate word if you like, for whatever particle size has non-trivial damage, if it was entirely natural we might use micrometeorite/meteorite/asteroid, but we don\u0027t have vague terms past small, medium, and large. Note that I\u0027d call anything heavier than Helium a \u0022metal,\u0022 as well (old astronomy habits die hard).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy entire point in this discussion is to suggest that unless this can actually replicate known data accurately, \u003Cem\u003Ewe have no idea how accurate a simulation it is\u003C/em\u003E, and it might in fact be no better than a lookup table with \u0022intuitive\u0022 damage filling the slots. \u003Cem\u003EIt might be far better\u003C/em\u003E, but we won\u0027t really know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the damage done by micrometeorites and orbital debris is well-characterized with spaced armor, then that is a good anchor point for a model... if the model replicates what is known to happen (with a similar armor level in game to ISS applied vs similar particles). Then we know that the model works for small particles of a given type (X mm Al ball at Y km/s). What happens for larger particles, and how shape matters is another issue. Impact angle is at least somewhat straightforward as there is decent data on sloped armor penetration (it is slightly more complex than just a longer path length through armor because of angle, but well characterized). So that\u0027s a plus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s forget every particle that is defeated by the armor. Those deposit energy to the hull to be radiated away (or not), and nothing more. That\u0027s easy to characterize. Where it becomes non-trivial is where the penetrators actually do their job and defeat the armor. Now is when the tricky damage modeling comes in. Above someplace we talked about through and through hits (in one side, out the other). That\u0027s is a clear case where what the particle(s) hit, and what happens when that occurs,\u00A0matters (again, the particle might be a telephone pole chunk of metal for all I care). If the interior is not actually modeled, then it\u0027s functionally a lookup table, right? X cm particle enters crew compartment at Y km/s\u00A0that is not modeled fully down to an X cm scale. The game has a check for crew compartment damage, and applies it. That\u0027s not substantially different from a miniatures game, it\u0027s just likely finer grained (the ship might have many thousands of hit areas instead of hundreds or fewer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe extent to which this damage model mimics reality is the quality of the simulation. Since we have little real data, it is by definition speculative past the range for which we have data. I have no problem with this, while you seem to be insisting that it is a great simulation without evidence. I am making no positive claims whatsoever, as I have said a few times, it might be a great simulation, it might be no better than a lookup table in a board game mapped to correspond to whatever real data we have on one end, and it might in fact be worse than that table.
