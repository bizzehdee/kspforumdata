I argue that MechJeb is way more \u0022legit\u0022 than doing everything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also know you don\u0027t get the same sense of accomplishment also. But seriously, docking takes way too long (At least on my computer, even with the set target, and maneuvers.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So I decided to test the legitimacy of this. After a few minutes, I found out that there are already fully automated rockets, I knew for ICBMs they were automated, but not ones that could dock. So I realized, Using MechJeb is way more \u0022legitimate\u0022 than actually carrying out every tedious process. I even bet the only reason they have people in the control room is to press \u0022abort\u0022 if anything goes wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, SAS helps, but, you can only go in a straight line.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheCanadianVendingMachine","CreatedById":59684,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T05:51:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease, don\u0027t bring this up...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T06:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-25T11:19:11Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2014 11:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T09:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood point. Of course, what is more realistic is something like kOS scripts to do what mechjeb does.

I don\u0027t use the ascent autopilot for my rockets as i can fly them as the flight profile in mechjeb suggests. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of all, I do not care what others think about mechjeb, I feel it needs to be a part of the stock game.

Space flight, as I see it, isn\u0027t about grabbing ahold of the controls and flying it like some pre-autopilot days airplane. It\u0027s very much computer orientated. As has been said, kOS is in some regards closer to what\u0027s actually used, but both kOS and MechJeb, for ME, are a much more realistic experience. But this is how I play the game. MY way isn\u0027t the right way or the wrong way, it\u0027s just MY way. To call MechJeb cheating is ludicrous. I could understand if this were a multiplayer game, but as it is, it\u0027s a single player sandbox game where anything goes.

Otherwise, get ready for arguments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMe? I consider mechjeb a too powerful tool that kills the experience both on old and new players. It\u0027s something that should never be stock (And hopefully wont according to the devs). It goes against the vision of the game and kills half of the gameplay.
