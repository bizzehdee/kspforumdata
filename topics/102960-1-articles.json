They also deattach and the cabin drops down simply by it\u0027s weigth. It splits either between cabin and adapter or adapter and greenhouse. Different every launch.\n\nThis is not even finished craft, but a simple part with some fuel tank for counterbalance and show the issue. When it is balanced the problem with the cabin occurs.\n\nSo, is there a way to reinforce the link between the 3.5m dock and 3.5m part and mk3 and mk3 (that should have strong wielding anyway?) or why are my kerbineers so bad at wielding ?\n\n![image.png](http://s2.postimg.org/4q26luv55/image.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-31T08:25:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/31/2015 08:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Mapoko**\n  \nAnswered"},{"CreatedByName":"Aser","CreatedById":139420,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T09:39:34Z","Content":"Moar struts? ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)\n\nThere\u0027s a mod called [Kerbal Joint Reinforcement](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55657-0-90-Kerbal-Joint-Reinforcement-v3-1-2-3-26-15).

Unless it is the only way.\n\nI can strongly reccomend getting KJR for two reasons. It strengthens ALL connections between all parts and it slowly turns up physics when loading a vessel or coming off rails.\n\nAbout the kraken, this can be a problem (although only for very few people) but if you do have difficulties you simply delete the KJR folder and everything is back to normal. I musw admit I started using KJR with some trepidation (I even made a backup of my save file) as I had heard similar reports but I started really getting used to it. Then I had trouble because I was building a really huge 700 ton space station and after docking the last part KJR did no longer want to deal with my crap so it started wobbling the station apart.
