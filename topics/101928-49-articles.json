In orbit anyway. Of course this would need to be a different function than \u0022grab\u0022, because you wouldn\u0027t grab and hold a single part. Basically like docking, without docking ports.\n\nDisassembly like that should be fairly simple, since the game often does it (albeit unplanned). Assembly might be trickier, unless you can somehow activate the magnetism function of docking ports for other parts, to make them come in close contact. Otherwise maybe it could be done with multiple winches lightly pulling the parts together so that the engineer just has to \u0022fasten the screws\u0022.\n\nNot sure if this is feasible, there\u0027s probably a reason you haven\u0027t implemented it... but it would be cool."},{"CreatedByName":"Kowgan","CreatedById":116874,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T14:26:25Z","Content":"Is anyone else not able to detach decouplers?
