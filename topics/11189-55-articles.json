Nice to see a runway turnaround on refuel and launch and the second mission as an interesting and satisfying completion of the first mission. Can you clarify the monopropellant status? Looking at the screenies the monopropellant tank does not appear to be full on delivery. Since the second mission was not originally intended to be a K-Prize mission it would be understandable if the rules followed were not K-Prize rules. Was it launched part empty? Or was some monopropellant used in the orbital maneuvers taken from the payload tank? Not sure if the mission met the K-Prize decoupling proviso rules.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Rules\n\u003E 1.
