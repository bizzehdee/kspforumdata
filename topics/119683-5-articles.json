I had intended to point out the things I believe are unfinished, and I will. But rereading that post impresses me very much with how far we\u0027ve actually come, and how many interesting and enriching new features have been added to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that KSP has come a long way, despite some pretty big bumps in the road.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to things that make it unfinished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Biomes.

I\u0027d reallly like to see four and five star skill levels in the various roles actually be useful/important in gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I wonder if some sort of set pieces/milestones/moar easter eggs would improve progression in career mode. The challenge of exploration is interesting in it\u0027s own right, but the more there is to discover, the more there is drawing you to reach for distant destinations. This could make career mode (and exploration in general) feel a little more fleshed out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Other UI issues such as mouse clickthrough at different parts of the interface will also hopefully be solved by the UI rewrite, but until they are this seems unfinished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Game balance. This, of course, will always be a work in progress. One of the biggest issues with the release of 1.0, in my view, was that so much game balance work was lost because the drag bug was discovered so late in the process. Aero, thermal, economic systems all seem to need significant balancing to me. While I know the dev team works very hard to find game balance, it does seem to me to still need more tweaking or another balance pass after the fact and, therefore, unfinished. I\u0027m fairly sure that if that bug had been caught earlier before the release of 1.0, it would have seemed much more balanced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping this doesn\u0027t sound too \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:line-through;\u0022\u003Ecritical\u003C/span\u003E negative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy landings!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-01T15:46:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/01/2015 03:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starhawk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dsonbill","CreatedById":115997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T16:56:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFunny, I can\u0027t seem to find the 5% option anywhere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T17:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an engine without a game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tannerz","CreatedById":150674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T17:28:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emore complete than the majority of the AAA titles that launch into 1.0 status from the major publishers.

And you need science only for unlocking tech in the tech tree. And this tech you only need (more or less) for science missions. This is the serpent Ouroboros with a very, very small diameter. Du to the very unbalanced Science Lab, flying to M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and Minmus is totally sufficient to unlock more or less the complete tech tree. And after that (career is then Sandbox with money) you may ask yourself: Why in the hell should go to any other place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s one of the biggest failures of the game: There is no real motivation offered by the game to visit other planets/moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other big mistake is that Squad wasn\u0027t very good in choosing ideas for the game mechanics and that they refused to abandom concepts, after a lot of people found out that they won\u0027t work. In fact, they tried to \u0022heal\u0022 bad conecpts by incorporating additional weird concepts or rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I mentioned in another thread: Due to to fact, that you can rescue Kerbals and getting funds AND reputation for it instead of hiring Kerbals for much funds in the astronaut complex, the astronaut complex is rendered now completely superflouos. I think, Squad should have taken more time for brainstorming/designing the game mechanics as a whole instead of implementing them step by step without looking for side effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I think, the whole career mode is so screwed, it should be completely rewritten.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-07T15:51:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is finished for me, when it runs stable and all sound effects, visual effects and animations are in.
