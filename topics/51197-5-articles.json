In addition the shuttle is too high on the tank. The shuttles engines must be able to turn the shuttle as the CoM shifts. Your CoM is almost at the same height as the shuttle engines. The best thing the engines can do here is pushing the shuttle sideways but they can hardly turn it.\u003Cp\u003ETry reducing the thrust on your tank side or increase the thrust on the shuttle side.

Take the boosters off and then look at your Center of Mass and your line of thrust. You want to have the line of thrust practically pointing at your CoM. Now, here\u0027s where it gets interesting. Boosters... If they are too weak, you dont get off the pad or your shuttle\u0027s thrust will be pulling back against the stops trying to prevent your shuttle from nosing over. Too strong, and you\u0027ll notice that your shuttle engines are pointing nearly strait down with the control maxed out pushing forward.... but instead it fall over backwards.... This usually happens at higher altitudes when the CoM is shifting towards your shuttle and away from the tank.. But the booster is still going just as strong as it was on the ground... just lighter. So the trick is to find a booster that will last til roughly 18km-20km giving you as close to pegged vertical speed as possible... but will burn out prior to your tank becoming too light.
