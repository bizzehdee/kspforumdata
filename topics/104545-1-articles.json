However, the Mobile Lab is not a command pod and cannot control your vehicle. You must also have a command pod or probe core. I\u0027m not certain if you can move your crew from the command pod to the Mobile Lab, leaving the command pod unoccupied, and have your Mobile Lab work (assuming no probe core). Even if you can do that, I wouldn\u0027t recommend it. Having your command pod unoccupied will mean you\u0027ll have no way to control your vehicle (you\u0027d be adrift). I\u0027d recommend a three-kerbal crew so you can move two to the Mobile Lab and leave one in the command pod. Of course if you have a probe core then you don\u0027t need a crewed command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-20T23:18:10Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2015 11:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Solarapple","CreatedById":137606,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T00:02:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks.
