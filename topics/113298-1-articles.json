But like heroine addicts or retired mob enforcers, I keep getting sucked back in, thanks to TV and movies. There was some space movie on Syfy that made me want to play again. I stopped for a few days, and then the new season of Defiance started back up featuring scenes of alien ships floating through debris fields, and I had to play again, and yesterday, damn Apollo 13 was on TV, and I had to start up planning my first landing on Minimus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery time I get away from this damn game, I see a show dealing with spaceships, and I have to fire it back up.
