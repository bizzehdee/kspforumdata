I\u0027ve never much liked playing with planes, so this thing surprised me. When I became good enough that I got bored with regular career, I started looking towards mods that made things more difficult, coupled with increasingly fancy mission requirements. But apparently, a lot of the most skilled players are trying to save every possible gram of fuel in their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003Essto\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen i realized, it\u0027s actually the most challenging things in the stock game; with stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003Eisru\u003C/abbr\u003E and some decent mastery of interplanetary transfers, completing a grand tour is relatively trivial. And I can\u0027t imagine any challenge more difficult without involving atmospheres. To me it was natural to keep running convoluted space missions with mods, but most people did something different. Surely a lot of them left the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m asking out of curiosity, to see how far the gamer imagination has gone to keep a game fresh.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat are your ways to keep things interesting after the regular stuff becomes too easy?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xavven","CreatedById":100398,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-08-28T19:34:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter getting to the point where unlocking all the career nodes was pretty easy, I set my sights on more sandboxy things like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nJool 5\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEve manned return mission\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTylo landing \u0026amp; return vehicle\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nDo it again but this time it must be a single-stage from Tylo orbit to landing and back to orbit (no dropping any spent stages)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nLaythe spaceplane\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuild a spaceplane that has the same launch and return profile as the Space Shuttle\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nQuad-copter exploration of Eve and Duna\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBuild a space station inspired by the ISS\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E operations on Mun and/or Minmus that include the mining rig, ore processing on-site, trucks if necessary to transport fuel to a ground-anchored and custom built (by Engineers using the i menu) launchpad, transport of fuel to orbit, optionally to a space station, acting as a refueling gateway for other missions.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nApollo 11-17 (pick one) reenactment\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd you can do a whole career with additional self-imposed rules like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbals require extra roomy spacecraft with multiple rooms for any mission lasting longer than 14 days.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKerbals require the above, plus artificial gravity by some means of centrifugal force if the mission lasts more than 1 year.
