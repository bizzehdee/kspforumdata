I build a simple moon-orbiter, which launched fine the last few times, but now after an upgrade it no longer wants to leave the launchpad, like it is super-glued to it (despite enough TWR). But after some seconds of burning it seems to hit a magical number and suddenly skyrockets upwards (literally).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s27.postimg.org/5ypywdvpv/rocket.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rocket.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first stage launches only the T30 engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem seems to be related to the total weight.
