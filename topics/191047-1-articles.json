Each one is powered by a NearFuture fission reactor, and uses storage trusses from NearFutureConstruction to hold ore, xenon, and pure \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E for my NERV-powered interplanetary ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTwo ISRUs are used to convert ore hauled up from Minmus by the two miners docked in the background, which refuel both on Minmus and from their own dedicated \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E/OX tank. In the long run, there will only be one miner, with the second being transferred to my under-construction Ike station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe miners themselves can hold 18,000 units of ore, and run off a smaller fission reactor. The six Poodle engines and accompanying mini-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E provide more than enough Delta-V (~3,000 m/s when under full load) for landing, takeoff, and rendezvous, all of which is handled by MechJeb due to my twitchy fingers not playing nice with razor-thin maneuvering margins. The actual mining process is quite speedy, since I took the time to use a scanning satellite and a rover to identify the greatest possible ore concentration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
