I had the first loaded up with almost 500 data. I then moved some science to the second, and tried to add data to it. But data won\u0027t load into this second lab for some reason. Is there a restriction to using two connected like this?\n\nIt says \u0022not enough data storage to research xxxx while in spae near Minmus\u0022. It will also say sometimes that it has already been researched in this lab, although nothing has been researched in this new lab yet."},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T00:07:27Z","Content":"Multiple labs on a single station do not work.

Only when adding new data does it become problematic. The code doesn\u0027t look where the data is coming from, but rather where it could be used... and stops looking at the first lab."}]}
