I can take off no problem, i can reach speeds over 1000 m/s, the plane doesn\u0027t spin out of control and flies straight. And there is the problem, it just flies straight. It takes me forever to turn this thing. It either turns very slowly or starts to turn fast but then returns back straight even tho im still pressing S ...Altho recently, with my latest attempt at it, the plane steers very slowly. What\u0027s going on? Im on 24.2, i dont have FAR or NEAR and i am typing from my phone so i can\u0027t post pics about my plane.Currently my center of lift is slightly behind the center of mass.Ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-15T13:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESteering issues with spaceplanes (well, planes in general) are usually due to a lack of a sufficient number of control surfaces.
