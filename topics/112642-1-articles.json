I get doing them as a challenge or contract, but do they really work for anything else?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thinking was, an outpost would be natural for resource mining. Ok let\u0027s say we have a processing plant, ore tanks, and fuel tanks. We also need a separate excavator vessel with a drill. Our ultimate goal is to get the fuel to orbit, so ships can refuel there. So we also need a shuttle to transfer fuel to the orbit. That\u0027s a lot of moving parts there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother scenario: our entire processing plant is on the orbit. In this case excavator is also the shuttle, the difference is it shuttles ore instead of fuel. Docking in orbit is way less difficult than on surface, so this structure is much less of a pain in the ass. Now, my first thought was lifting crude ore is ridiculous, but turns out KSP ore is like super refined and is basically the same mass as fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus, in reality I would use an assortment of ground vehicles to maintain the surface outpost. There would be construction equipment to move modules around, ore trucks, actual ground excavators, etc. I would love to build all that, and it is almost possible in the game, but not quite. Basically the main focus is on rockets, and every piece is really designed for a rocket. Rovers are fun to play with, but actually driving them anywhere? It\u0027s just not that kind of a scale. As for loaders and such, there\u0027s a key piece missing: some kind of controllable lifting arm or platform that would allow to operate large weights with reasonable precision (entirely not a rocket concept).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, am I missing something, did anyone actually had a success with surface outposts?

Simplest is to pick one of the many wide flat spots on Minmus and drop an all-in-one rover with ore mining and processing there, making sure to put a claw on front of it. Have a fairly basic drop-ship that is mostly tank land near the rover, which trundles over and claws the lander, refuels it, it then returns to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T06:00:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes there have to be a practical purpose?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T06:09:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022 data-cite=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes there have to be a practical purpose?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the answer is no.

They\u0027re also a common feature on Eve, though how many permanent Eve bases were designed as such is less obvious. Another option is to send drone refineries to your intended destinations ahead of time. Then you land next to them with a lander that has low/no fuel, and fuel up for the return trip at the destination. That means less fuel taken on the initial trip, which means much lower delta-V required for the manned launcher, which saves costs quite nicely for many destinations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T06:23:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 06:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SAI Peregrinus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gnawer","CreatedById":144512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T06:41:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMakes sense, thanks SAI Peregrinus.
