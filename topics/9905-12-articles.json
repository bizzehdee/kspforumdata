Easy to blame it on someone else....., let me explain. I noticed that the stability enhancers are moved to the lazor vessel exactly at 6000m distance. This is beyond the normal unload distance for ksp which is 2250m. But lazor system expands this distance up to 95000m to handle the onboard camera and remote control better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i think what is happening is this: The Launch Stability Enhancers obviously has some code that makes it ...err..follow the vessel on the launchpad. And this behaviour is controlled within 6000m. Beyond this distance it might be looping back and placing the decouplers on the vessel again. I have notified NovaSilisko about this. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fx1","CreatedById":27358,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-26T16:28:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood to hear, hopefully they will address this issue in the next patch.
