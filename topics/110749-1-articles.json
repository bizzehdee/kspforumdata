As counterintuitive as it seems this helped me a lot. I was given the advise to do so as the gigabyte power saving features might have choked the cpu to death.. i was experiencing BSODs on high load scenarious in various games, but especially when doing cpu-heavy stuff (you may want to try SuperPI!). \n\nIf possible you could try this.. it helped me to get only about 1/10 of the BSODs i had before.. then again i swapped mobos and the BSODs were gone.\n\nGood luck!"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T17:17:44Z","Content":"Also, you can try running [Memtest86\u002B](http://www.memtest.org/) or [Windows memory diagnostic tool](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer) to check memory, [Prime95](http://www.mersenne.org/) in stress test mode to test CPU, [VMT](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmst/) to test Video memory, and [FurMark](http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/) to test GPU (and video memory). \n\nFirst, clean out any dust from heatsinks/fans.\n\nI\u0027d start with FurMark.
