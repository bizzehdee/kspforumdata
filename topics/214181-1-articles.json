If you believe third-party sources regarding such a problem, then this is a bug directly with DirectX 11, probably related to an error in the execution of some shader.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nScreenshot from Vtune Profiler:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/a/yGEkXrE\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://imgur.com/a/yGEkXrE\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
