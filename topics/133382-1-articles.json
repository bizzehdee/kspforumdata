He seemed to develop more and more interest over the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe even asked me to teach\u00A0him how to play the game! (I almost lost a tear in that moment) I told him lots of things about the game and space in general, even though i doubt, he understood everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis evening after coming home from a long work day, he surprised me. First, I was about to send him to bed. (How dare he stay up so late?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy wife calmed me down and told me\u00A0to wait. He took out a large piece of paper, he had rolled up behind his back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was a watercolor painting he did in school, titled \u0022Alex and Pa together on Dune\u0022 (I think he meant Duna).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI almost cried, Never been so proud.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll certainly spend more time with him now. I\u0027ll have to switch some shifts and maybe do one or two extra, but spending time with my son, see him grow, see him develop an interest in science, that is \u00A0just priceless. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere it is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EsYSpmp.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022612\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EsYSpmp.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHe\u0027s planting the flag, while I\u0027m landing with my spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sivnet","CreatedById":89765,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T01:32:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is amazing.
