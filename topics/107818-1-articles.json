So far I have figured out how to react to the onOffered event of a contract, but I actually want to control the piece that is doing the offering. Where should I look to start making changes to that? In my search of the forums here, I have not found any hint of where to look. This is my first time developing any sort of mod for KSP, so please be nice. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E Cheers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
