Like a cheat if you will? I got an asteroid or 3 from space port, and I want to throw one into a large eliptical orbit around kerbin and go after it. I just want an easy way of getting it up there, wether its through consle commands, or what have you. Sorry fi this is a common question. Im not trying to cheat the game for proper rocket launches, I just see no feasible way of modofiying it in any way if its larger than the VAB itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPardon my grammer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"painking","CreatedById":69085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T00:23:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you wanna do it modfree, alt\u002BF12 and turn on infinite fuel and stick some powerful engines underneath it.
