The mod has been a little rough around the edges for some time, and while I don\u0027t care much about contacting servers without opt-in, I know a lot of others do. Moreover, once the new TOS for KSP come into effect, this mod will be in violation as it always contacts a server for the choose-tree prompt without user consent on first load. The community hasn\u0027t stepped up and built a better mod here mostly because this one has worked, more or less.
