My current plane seems to be rather unstable, it likes to wobble and try to flip over.\n\nEdit: Tried moving tailfins out, no significant change.\n\nEDIT 2: It seems to become stable when it hits 500ish m/s\n\n![2B83881B10CDC1CE7873F582612BE48BC8C09939](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/441699353663531628/2B83881B10CDC1CE7873F582612BE48BC8C09939/)\n\n![FF108DB1F007BA97C19C39E12E9043F6F3763CA8](http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/441699353663531916/FF108DB1F007BA97C19C39E12E9043F6F3763CA8/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-24T19:09:05Z\u0022 title=\u002206/24/2015 07:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by locustgate**"},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T00:38:11Z","Content":"Try to move the center of mass a bit further to the front / move the center of lift a bit more to the back. It will cause the plane fly more like a dart (= more stable). You can also lock the gimbal on some of the engines. This will decrease control authority causing SAS to oversteer less (= more stable).\n\nIf the plane wobbles use more struts. Struting the outer engines to the monopropellant tank should eliminate most of the wobble.\n\nAlso remove the radial intakes. They cause too much drag compared to the amount of intakeAtm they give. Air hogging doesn\u0027t give benefit anymore."},{"CreatedByName":"TokiTech","CreatedById":131500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:05:52Z","Content":"Center of weight will always need to be infront of center of lift to prevent place flips out itself.

You need a lot of counterweight in front of the Center of Lift to compensate for the mass of your engines, but if fuel is a part of that counterweight, you\u0027ll run into trouble.\n\nSolution: try positioning your fueltanks very close to, if possible right on top of, your Center of Lift. Do the mass balancing with different parts. \n\nYou could even take a full fuel tank and disable it to act as counterweight to your engines as well. That way, you\u0027ll always lug around a tank full of unused fuel, so it\u0027s not really elegant, but it does add stability."},{"CreatedByName":"Daveroski","CreatedById":93896,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:41:38Z","Content":"An easier solution might be to remove most of those radial air intakes.\n\nYou no longer need to max out the air intakes. \n\nThese intakes are adding mass to the rear of your ship removing them will move mass forward somewhat.\n\nThey also produce rather lot of drag.\n\nIf you feel that a few are needed for the middle engines mount them further forward.

Flight stability is affected by several factors. Just because you found one way to improve it does not mean it\u0027s the only way or even the definitive way. I don\u0027t know why you need to attack the observations of others.\n\nOP made an observation of his craft that you don\u0027t generally see in threads about airframe instability. My comments at drag was to explore why he saw subsonic instability when he had supersonic stability. You have yet to provide a plauseable alternative. You merely show a similar craft with a more stable flight profile all around.\n\nWhere in the thread was either of my two points mentioned? As I see it, I was the first to question the engine array choice and the first to try and explain the velocity component observed.
