It was just so poorly done that it looks like 2 stage hands were playing catch with a toy and just tossing it back and forth over the child actor. The irritating fact that kennedy forced grogu back into the show by way of iirc book of boba fett which lets face it turned into a veiled season 2.5 of mandalorian is frankly gross. Kennedy needs to let favreau do his job and up the budget to avoid the horror of what we saw in the show this week with grogu.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nside note: they could not have chosen better with the actor who got grogu away from order 66.

But this week they go from being a semi serious \u00A0show that isnt about Din Djarin any more but Bo Katan and somehow go stupider by turning it into a total farce\u2026 especially with the mental gymnastics they used to give Bo Katan the darksaber\u2026 no wonder ratings are going down hill.
