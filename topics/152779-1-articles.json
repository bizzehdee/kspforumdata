I was wondering if there\u0027s a mod to make multiple kerbals\u00A0leave their seats simultaneously on the same craft. Does the Follower Mod do that?

My use case is trying to teleport a bunch of kerbals from their seat at the same time into an active engine (\u0027cause i\u0027m cruel). \u00A0You can kinda see what I mean here.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/-NCor27CSvs?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nProbably think of something else....\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
