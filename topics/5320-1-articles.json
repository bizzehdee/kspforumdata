I personally haven\\\u0027t been to the mun in quite some time. I have been heading down the block and back to practice landings, (got a rather nice little VTOL in the works). Anyway, I have been thinking, I need to start some work on ships. Let me clarify; planes are great, and rockets are as Kerbal as it gets, but, what about some space ships, the kind designed to more or less hang out in space all the time? Granted, just watching orbits for hours at a time got old a week after the mun suddenly popped into existence, but the ship ideas abound. Pics if i come up with anything worthwhile.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RedDwarfIV","CreatedById":11716,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-01-10T19:02:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy C7-built \u003Cem\u003EKestrel\u003C/em\u003E spaceplane is capable of Mun landings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah.
