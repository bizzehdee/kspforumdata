There are many numerical algorithms to calculate approximate solutions for Navier-Stokes equations. If general solution would be simple enough, it would be possible to decrease developing costs but it is not necessarily true. For example, there are some solutions for restricted 3 body problem, which are impractical because numerical algorithms give same accuracy with far less computer time (several order of magnitudes). However, proven existence of these solutions are very important piece of mathematics of such differential equations and in any case solutions of Navier and Stokes equations would be too. It is the reason of prize and possible practical applications would be bonus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tullius","CreatedById":168049,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-04T07:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, I am a mathematician that looked up on wikipedia what Navier-Stokes and the question are about and not a physicist, but I think that is not a bad thing for answering the above question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Navier-Stokes equation, like the heat equation or most differential equations, can be solved numerically, i.e. approximately, and that to a rather high precision (given sufficiently large computing power). And that is also the most we can ask for, as explicit solutions generally can only be found for special cases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo everything is good and your question is pointless?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, it is not so easy. If you want to approximate a solution numerically, it needs to exist and be sufficiently nice. And usually it is also very nice to have a unique solution. This is were the mathematics come into play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the heat equation, under minimal restrictions on your domain (the shape of your object) and the initial values (the initial distribution of the heat in your object), you can mathematically prove the existence and uniqueness of a bounded solution (boundedness is good, since it prevents the temperature from rising to infinity). So while mathematics is in general incapable of providing us with an explicit solution, it ensures us that the equation actually makes sense for physics and more importantly that our numerical approach to find a solution is sane (approximating a solution, which does not exist or is not unique, doesn\u0027t make sense).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Navier-Stokes, we don\u0027t know under which conditions a solution exists: So trying to find an approximate solution might, under some circumstances, make no sense, since there is no exact solution to approximate. And to make matters worse, we don\u0027t know when this happens.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo everything you do with Navier-Stokes on the beaviour of fluids is based on the wild guess that, in the case you are looking at, a sufficiently nice solution exists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the Navier-Stokes approach seems to work nicely in practice, people have come up with the hypothesis that there exist minimal assumptions for the existence of a sufficiently nice solution. If you prove that hypothesis, you would earn yourself a nice prize (the problem is one of the Millenium Problems) and would make the physicists and engineers happy, because you just told them that the approach they were taking all these years in approximating the behaviour fluids actually makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-04-04T07:03:27Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2017 07:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Tullius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
