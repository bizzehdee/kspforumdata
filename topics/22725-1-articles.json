My earth departure stage had just enough fuel to get into a near perfect Munar encounter and the CSM has plenty of fuel to do all the things that it needs to do to get the kerbals back safely to Kerbin. Any way after a few of theses missions going off with out a hitch I decided to put a munar rover to my MEM, so i did a very minamalistic design and weighs next to nothing and really shouldn\u0027t affect the rocket what so ever but now when I try to launch the damn thing it just blows up on the launch pad for no reason. The first thing to go wrong on the mission log is the stack seperator that connects the descent stage and ascent stage of my MEM is \u0022coming into contact with\u0022 the fuel tank for the descent stage and everything goes to hell which is suppose to happen, so i dont really understand why its failing so bad if anyone has a suggestion that would be very helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore attaching the rover\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s7.postimg.org/o0u7xkdej/screenshot39.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot39.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter attaching the rover\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s15.postimg.org/yvwz6dqnf/screenshot38.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot38.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso as you can see i didnt really change anything except remove a few struts (that i feel were unnecessary anyway) to keep them from clipping into the rover.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-19T04:18:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat this probably means is that your rocket has too much thrust, and the weight above the stack separator is crushing it when you launch. Usually, the fix is to add more struts (spacetape fixes everything!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s not the case, then this is probably the result of some funky attachment bug.

If you\u0027re using the CSM engine to get to the Mun, that\u0027s not right.
