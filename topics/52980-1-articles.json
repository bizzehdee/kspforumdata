Do I just burn vertical until I get about 100km apoapsis and then burn horizontal to get an orbit and then burn to make the apoapsis on the opposite side of the planet to about 2800km and then wait until the KSC is under the new apoapsis and make the periapsis 2800km? Seems like it uses a lot of fuel. Remote tech makes it tough which is what I\u0027ve wanted. Am I going about it correctly?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T16:27:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBurning vertical until the desired altitude and then turning horizontal is the \u003Cstrong\u003Eleast optimal\u003C/strong\u003E way to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to reach GEO is to perform an ordinary gravity turn, but don\u0027t let off the gas until your apoapsis is at 3468.75 km. circularize at apo like any other orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one catch is that if you are launching your first satellite with remotetech, you can\u0027t let it get out of view of mission control. So, a slightly suboptimal ascent is needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically you want a compromise between the fully horizontal burn, and the vully vertical burn such that your apoapsis is just above the eastern horizon from the point of view of KSC. That way, you can raise your apo while you have control of the rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you need to fine-tune the phase of the orbit, don\u0027t circularize completely, leave your peri down lower so your orbital period is shorter than a kerbin day, then go around a few times until the apo is where you want it and circularize. Or if you want to do the math, figure out exactly what orbital period you need to place your apo correctly in one orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomuchbrew","CreatedById":57346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T16:35:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat, that helps a lot.

Its possible to send a manned orbiter with 6 little relay satellites attached. This way you dont need to time launch or orbital manuvs to keep contact with KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can launch strait to geosync alt, make a nice round orbit, drop first sat. To deploy the other 5 just burn retro to reduce your orbital perdiod by 1 hour (a geosync orbit being just over 6 hours). When you come back around to apo circularize again, drop next sat......then do it all again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce your done you should have 6 sats evenly spaced around equator in geosync...can launch the rest of the network unmanned with no problems from there.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"toomuchbrew","CreatedById":57346,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T17:28:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh.

But if your inclination or apoapsis/periapsis are off, then your satellite will move in a track across the sky, returning to exactly the same spot over the planet every six hours.
