One to get the core up there, and then two launches each containing three ring sections. The Kerbal engineers call them \u0022Banana Boats\u0022 because they\u0027re not very imaginative--you\u0027ve met Bill, right? When the interstage fairings blow, the capsule is free to re-enter with its tiny little rocket motor and fuel tank. The stage containing the ring sections has no reaction wheels or boosters, only RCS thrusters, which it uses to dock with the station. The robotic arm plucks the sections off the Banana Boat and places them into the ring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part I like best is the way the docking ports for the ring sections could be rotated using docking washers, so that it didn\u0027t matter how the section was oriented when it was attached. All you had to do was rotate the docking washer until the other end lined up and it would just click into place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOkay, I lied. There\u0027s something just incredibly cool about turning on the motor and watching the core spin up and then slow down and finally become stationary as the RCS thrusters bring the ring up to speed. If I had the tools to capture video I\u0027d have done so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be something a tad wonky about the way the Imgur album is displayed. Sorry about that. I couldn\u0027t figure out how to get it to work better.
