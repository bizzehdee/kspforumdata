You lowered the friction at the front end (which is helpful) ... but did you reduce the braking force from the front wheels?

It\u0027s better to drag the attachment base out from the fuselage and rotate them so they point straight down. The easiest way to do this is set mirror symmetry to 2 and place your gear on the midline under the craft and then use the translate arrows to drag the bases outwards. The wider you can get them the better. You might get away with placing them under the engine nacelles if your center of mass is far enough forward. If not, consider one at the nose, one at the back (but not too far back) and one on each engine nacelle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t think you need two landing gear at the nose of the craft. One in the center of the nose should be fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you enable Advanced Tweakables from the settings menu you will find an option to set the landing gears\u0027 Friction Control.

That will let you take off much easier. Also, the plane will be much more controllable, and sturdier, if your engine nacelles are affixed to the fuselage instead of way out on the wingtips. You can then put your rear gear on the nacelles, which will give you a nice wide footprint for ground stability.
