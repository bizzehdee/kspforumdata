Most \u0026#39;Space Opera\u0026#39; or Sci-fi in general in TV/Film doesn\u0026#39;t seem to be overly concerned with the impracticality of what it portrays or how unrealistic it is - the strange way the main character of Gravity gradually deorbits being a good example.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem really being how you explain how something happens in the setting - no one wants to really have it shown to them how something actually flies in space - such as the space shuttle depiction in Armageddon, to take a terrible example. Of course some shows might state they are in orbit but they never really expand on it, any Star Trek episode would be a good example of that, or Star Wars\u0026#39; \u0022Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity\u0022 of the Death Star - because somehow they picked the exact opposite side of a gas giant to drop out of hyperspace on.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nCompare such things to Literature Space Opera such as \u0026#39;Ringworld\u0026#39;, where the protagonists ship gouges out an enormous chasm as it decelerates from orbital speed by crashing into it, or \u0026#39;Revelation Space\u0026#39; where ships with near infinite Delta-v take months to reach .99c cruises.
