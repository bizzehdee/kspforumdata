I\u0027ve been playing KSP now for about a year, (Yeah slow learner, hey) but still very prideful that I had finally gone \u0022Interplanetary\u0022. I had quick saved it a couple of times while I circularized the orbit, wanting to be damn sure if I screwed something up, I\u0027d still be good. I went back to the KSC and then quit the game. Got back to it today hoping the .24 update had been released but, nope, not yet. Well at least I still had that ship orbiting Duna. Started the game, went to the tracking station to find that my ship was just gone! I went to the archives in the R \u0026amp; D and confirmed that the goo experiment done in high Duna orbit was there, and it was. But what happened to my ship?,,, Bug?, Kracken? So anyways, I launched the same ship hoping I\u0027d get the same easy encounter I got the night before but, to no avail. So, I\u0027m looking for a little more education on getting to Duna. A link would be greatly appreciated. And, what the hell happened to my ship?
