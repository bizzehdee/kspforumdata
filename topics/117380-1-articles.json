And you need to shield only habitation module which is probably not going to be very large, and of course Orion Command pod, which is already shielded (and crew wouldn\u0027t have to spent there very long time - they can be inside the hab most of the time). Another issue aside from radiation is blurred vision caused by body fluids pressure on eyeballs.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T12:00:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 12:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Thomassino**"}]}
