Now, in stock KSP I\u0027m quite competent with the Shuttles as I have done many missions and it\u0027s not that big of a deal, but I really can\u0027t land at the space center in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. I am trying to land from a\u00A05 degree inclination orbit at Kourou, which is kinda similar to landing at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0from an equatorial orbit in stock. If I use the mechJeb landing guide and before re-entry I get an expected landing at say 63 degrees long W (the center is at 52 degrees W, so I take a marge of error for the expected landing of 10-11 degrees) I am still overshooting by at least 3 or 4 degrees longitude, and I don\u0027t have enough DeltaV for a longer burn before re-entry. Do you guys know what could I do to get a hold on how am I supposed to de-orbit in order to land where I\u0027m supposed to, or at least some mod that is competent enough to calculate a trajectory through Earth\u0027s atmosphere?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-02T17:32:52Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2021 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by vinterskugge\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lemon cup","CreatedById":199693,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-02T16:47:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am not able to provide much advice since my experience with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is very limited, but I could point in in the direction of\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtube.com/c/RaizSpace\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERaiz Space\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(links to Youtube channel).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTyler has been exploring the concept of using DECQ\u2019s Space Shuttle mod in KSP 1.8.1(\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) for the past couple\u00A0years, he has tons of great \u00A0content going into lots of detail, perhaps you could search his channel and find something of use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn particular, he has published some KOS scripts on deorbiting and landing the shuttle - maybe that is something you\u2019d be interested at looking into.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-02T16:49:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2021 04:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by lemon cup\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
