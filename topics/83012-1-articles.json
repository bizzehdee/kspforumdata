There was this really cool one that allowed you to duplicate Kerbals. Basically, when you transferred a Kerbal, put it out on EVA, then got it back on the ship, it was duped.

But since more details will be revealed on Max\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Kerbalcast interview, i thought i\u2019d share an update to the mun mission i posted last time. \u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/sZ6FS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/sZ6FS\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;HERE\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is the link to that mission btw.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;It was bugging me that i wasn\u2019t able to return the plane to Kerbin after the mun-landing and the mission wasn\u2019t single staged to begin with. So i re-designed the plane, made it into a single staged version and threw away a bunch of fuel tanks. This plane has two important features: 1. A lot of air intakes so you can almost get to orbit using a single turbojet engine. 2. The jet engine is put on top of an atomic rocket motor. This is mostly for mass reasons but it also makes it easier to pass the burnout threshold. Using two jet engines while passing that threshold usually means the plane will start spinning because the engines doesn\u2019t burn out at the same time. \u0026lt;a href=\u0022\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/eipMs#HArDbk1\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/eipMs#HArDbk1\u003C/a\u003E\u0022\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;HERE\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; are some screenshots from the mission. And now it is bugging me slightly that i had 75 oxidizer units left, scrapping that off would likely mean an even lighter plane. Help me answer this question please: What is the least amount of liquid fuel you need to bring a kerbal to the mun and back?\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Jesus (Chuchito):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span\u0026gt; Hello everyone, I know it is just has been a while since my last update.
