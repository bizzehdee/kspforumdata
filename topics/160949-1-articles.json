If you come up from behind and pass above it (from Kerbin\u0027s point of view), for example, it will accelerate your ship like a slingshot, causing you to leave the sphere of influence with more speed than you entered - this might even result in a trajectory that escapes Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence later-on. Similarly, if you come up from behind but pass below it, it will actually slow your ship down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe magnitude and direction of this effect depends on your specific direction of approach, and how close to the surface you pass - it\u0027s even possible for your trajectory to be nearly completely reversed (but that would actually\u00A0be a surface impact trajectory, since it requires you to be closer to the Mun than the Mun is large).

Okay. I see what you mean now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s due to the way Kerbal Space Program calculates trajectories. See, in real life space, there are dozens upon dozens of objects with significant gravity wells, all of which influence one another, while the whole bunch of them is also spinning around each other at different speeds. This royal mess is called, in mathematics, a \u0022N-body problem\u0022, and it has no general solution. In other words, it is incredibly, \u003Cem\u003Eincredibly\u003C/em\u003E complicated, and the tiniest difference in initial conditions can dramatically\u00A0change everything down the line. And while you can solve a N-body problem for a known set of actors and initial conditions, such as the KSP solar system that always spawns the exact same way at game start, the devs still decided against doing it, for three reasons. One, it\u0027s very difficult to debug and fix if something goes wrong, because it is so complicated. Two, it takes a lot of CPU power to simulate with sufficient precision, especially when trying to fast forward. And three... because it is so complicated, it would be difficult to play in, especially for newcomers. Every orbit you assume with your spaceship would constantly change, and you\u00A0would find your space stations randonmly deorbited or ejected from the system by subtle gravitational perturbance built up over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat the devs did instead is use a simplification. Instead of simulating all the things in a N-body problem, KSP only ever simulates two things: your spacecraft, and the currently dominant gravity well. Thus it becomes a \u00222-body problem\u0022. And that is very easy to solve into very consistent and easily understandable results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, it comes with an inherent issue: if you only ever calculate against the currently dominant gravity well, then what happens\u00A0when which gravity well is dominant changes? When you get far enough away from one body and close enough to the other that the new one overpowers the old? This is where, finally, your dotted purple line comes into play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn order to be able to smoothly transition from one body to the next, KSP employs what is called \u0022patched conics\u0022.\u00A0The game has precalculated\u00A0areas in which\u00A0one body becomes stronger than another: the so-called \u0022spheres of influence\u0022. If you want to transition from one to the other - say, to go from the influence of Kerbin into the influence of the\u00A0Mun - then the game first solves the 2-body problem for your spacecraft with Kerbin, and then solves the 2-body problem for your spacecraft with the Mun (using the result from the former as the initial conditions for the latter).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the game has two partial pieces of orbital trajectories (\u0022conics\u0022). It takes them, and \u0022patches\u0022 them together where they meet, to form one full and coherent line.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the purple line you see sometimes is a different \u0022conic\u0022. It\u0027s a part of your orbit that is colored differently because there was a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E transition somewhere\u00A0before it.\u00A0And that\u0027s a good thing! Because they only show up when your orbit changes from one sphere of influence to the other... which is precisely what you want to do, right? You want to go to the Mun. And to go to the Mun, you need to travel into its sphere of influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe purple line is exactly what you\u0027re looking for. It is the sign that you have found an encounter. In fact, it\u0027s probably already the third conic in the series - the part of the orbit you get after exiting the sphere of influence of the Mun again and returning to that of Kerbin. There\u0027s probably another differently colored one in between the yellow line going towards the Mun, and the purple one that leads away from it. That\u00A0middle line is the segment of your orbit that is inside the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. That\u0027s when you have arrived where you want to go, and where you then have to perform a \u0022capture burn\u0022 to stop yourself from coasting back out again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-05-23T11:45:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2017 11:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Silverwood","CreatedById":177391,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-23T15:34:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWow, very technical but needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have retried the tutorial now and achieved the orbit around the Mun.

Usually only when I want to test out aspects of my communications satellite network. I think you are on the right track just running various test flights. That\u0027s the Kerbal way of doing things. I\u0027d recommend using the cheats sparingly, or not at all unless you find there is something tedious that requires \u0022simulations\u0022 to get right. Just make sure that you put in the practice to do it \u0022for real\u0022 at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I have to agree with Cpt Kerbalkrunch that there is no better feeling in the game than finally nailing a landing on your own. Flying by the seat of your pants, pulling off dicey maneuvers and then coming out looking like an ace at the end of it is very satisfying (no one has to know if you planned it that way or not, haha.) Even if it was a bumpy ride that just adds to the drama and fun of it. It\u0027s a game. Have FUN playing around with it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd MiffedStarfish is right too. Minmus is a great target to practice landing on.
