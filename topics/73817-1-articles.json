You are allowed to use this mod. FMRS will allow you to drop stages deep in the atmosphere (where they would normally be destroyed after exiting physics-range), and manually fly them back to the ground- once landed it lets you recover the vessels and/or merge them into your main save. This should make more realistic Space-X style launches (with the Falcon 9r, the lower stage would never actually exit the atmosphere) and Space-X style launches while using Real Solar System without insane upper stage TWR values possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3.\u003C/strong\u003E Balanced mods are allowed.

The reactors must all be located outside of loading distance from both the launchpad and runway- but need not be located near the KSC (mountains and the island runway both work well as reactor sites, for different reasons).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You may supplement your ground-based Microwaved Beamed Power with up to 3 MW of beamed solar power from orbit (no orbital reactors allowed). Relay networks are allowed to help get this power to your craft, as well as the ground-based beamed power (only really useful if you circularize on the far side of Kerbin).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No use of DT-Vista engines.

In real life, jet engines are heavy and have terrible TWR- thus they\u0027re not useful for vertical ascents. The engines on the lower stage of the book variant were designed for raw TWR and power (more similar to LV-30\u0027s) as the majority of the power had to come from the rocket engines- not the jet engines, which have much lower ISP in real-life (due to a major dev error- including IntakeAir in ISP calculations, the jet engines have approx. 12-16 times the ISP of those in real life) and become practically worthless at the high speeds a rocket eventually reaches... (real-life orbital velocity is much higher than in KSP, but the velocity curves are much the same)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemove the jet engines (and I suggest the intakes- which will then be useless), stretch the lower stage fuel tank a bit to compensate (the lower stage in the book you\u0027re copying used LiquidMethane:Oxygen mix, which is significantly denser than the LH2:LOX used in the upper stage. Since both your stages use the same stock fuel, you need a relatively longer lower stage than in the book to get the same fuel mass ratios...), and consider using LV-30\u0027s in the lower stage so the thing can still get off the launchpad (the extra fuel mass you can lift will compensate for the reduced ISP in the lower atmosphere- and the vehicle in the book lifted off with engines similar to LV-30\u0027s and a TWR barely over 1...) Oh, and the vehicle in the book uses static solar panels on the upper stage, like the OX-STAT panels, to allow for supply of electrical power even in-atmosphere- they\u0027re also lighter, and theoretically more reliable, so I would recommend switching to them entirely over deployables...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe one thing you \u003Cstrong\u003Eneed\u003C/strong\u003E to do is remove the jet engines. They\u0027re simply too OP\u0027d in the stock game. This is why I edited the OP a while back to warn players to avoid using jet engines in their rockets (I\u0027ll allow them in \u0022mothership\u0022 vehicles, but that\u0027s mainly because those use jet engines in real life anyways... Rockets don\u0027t.) The rest is just advice I\u0027m giving you on how to make sure the thing can still achieve orbit without jet engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd no, you won\u0027t get the same performance without the jet engines- but neither did the vehicle in the book. The leftover Delta-V values you\u0027re reaching orbit with are just absurd (much more than the rocket in the book), and mainly due to your use of OP\u0027d jet engines...
