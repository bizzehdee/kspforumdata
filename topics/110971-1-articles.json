Do you maybe think that you could have seen it coming that a full fur suit is kind of hot, that your friend had the easier part and that that she only had a one day pass? These things hardly sound like force majeure at all, more like slightly faulty planning.\n\nOh, there was definitely some faulty planning in there. If you thought I was implying anything else, you may have been seeing something that I wasn\u0027t. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just savour the good bits and forget the bad bits, or learn your lessons at least. Mulling over those does not really help much.\n\nI actually really enjoyed a *lot* of Comic Con, especially my time with Das and Day 3 (though I haven\u0027t written about those bits yet, of course). This story is going to have more \u0027good bits\u0027 soon, trust me. I realize I may have cut the narrative off at a particularly negative moment, which you seem to have picked up on...\n\nLet me also say that the main purpose of this post wasn\u0027t to vent my irritation or to be negative about the entire Comic-Con affair. Rather, it was just to tell the tale of \u0027that one time I did that thing, and all the other things happened too.\u0027\n\nTrust me, I\u0027ve learned my lessons. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T14:34:26Z","Content":"Well on the bright side you met DasVeldaz (should be a good thing)...I have pretty much zero chance of meeting any KSPer other than the one friend I convinced to play it."}]}
