However. Once you HAVE an image to use in your signature, you\\\u0027ll need to upload it somewhere (imgur.com ; photobucket.com ; imageshack.us etc) and get the \u0027direct link\u0027 they give you once it\\\u0027s uploaded. Go into your Profile on the forum and find the section for editing your signature, then put the URL the hosting site gave you between image tags. For example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ img ]\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.photobucket.com/albums/etc/image.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.photobucket.com/albums/etc/image.png\u003C/a\u003E[/ img ]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust make sure there\\\u0027s no spaces in the tags -- I put them there so you could see the tags and the forum wouldn\\\u0027t try to parse them and show a nonexistent image. Tags like that are called BBCode (Bulletin Board Code); you can Google it for a full list of common BBCode, although each and every forum often has unique ones for videos and various other things. Text formatting and image tags are pretty universal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\\\u0027s basically it. If you want to make your signature look especially pretty, you\\\u0027re going to need an image editing program. The top-notch one is probably Photoshop, closely followed by the free (but much less user-friendly) GIMP -- it tends to be very difficult to work out what you\\\u0027ve gotta do with it -- and then there\\\u0027s also the less feature-packed Paint.NET for absolute beginners. Pretty easy to use. Any of the three (and many others) can help[ you there, but only you really know what you want and it\\\u0027s often up to you to get your image polished up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust keep in mind that signatures probably shouldn\\\u0027t be more than 120 pixels high, and no more than 800 pixels across -- otherwise, they\\\u0027ll start to stretch the forum pages for people with small screens. I haven\\\u0027t actually tried to put a signature up here yet, so I don\\\u0027t know the restrictions (most forums automatically limit image sizes in signatures).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\\\u0027s anything else I haven\\\u0027t mentioned, ask.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-01T08:24:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the info \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually use a lot of GIMP but are planing on putting that image in [ spoiler] so I don\\\u0027t have to re-size it.
