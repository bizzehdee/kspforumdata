To try to get my Eve launch vehicle right I created a computer simulation to test various designs. I adjusted many different factors, such as TWR, to try to optimize the design the best I could. My actual final design configuration ended up a little different than what I simulated, but the simulation provided a good basis to start from. I haven\u0027t actually flown my mission yet, so I can\u0027t vouch for how well it will work out in actual game conditions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe simulation is based on the stock game, so if you\u0027re using any mods the results will likely be different. My simulated design used a three-stage central core with three pairs of strap-on boosters. The strap-ons and the first stage were arranged to utilize asparagus staging. The two upper stages of the core were ignited in series after the strap-ons and first stage were jettisoned. The simulation assumed launching from am altitude of 3,000 m, and I was shooting for an orbital altitude of 105,000 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found that TWR is critical to a good design, thus I spent quite a bit of time going through multiple iterations until I hit on what appeared to be the optimum. Below is a graph of my simulated launch vehicle\u0027s TWR versus time. Each peak represents burnout of one of the stages. The first three peaks are the pairs of strap-ons and the final three peaks are the stages of the central core. The TWR is based on Eve gravity, where g\u003Csub\u003Eo\u003C/sub\u003E = 16.677 m/s\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E. If your launch vehicle\u0027s TWR is significantly outside the range represented by the graph below, I\u0027d recommend modifying it. I found that being significantly outside the optimum range yielded disastrous results in most cases. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/pics/KSP_001.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_001.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControlling the rocket\u0027s attitude is also an important factor, though I didn\u0027t find the altitude of initial pitch-over to be all that critical. I started a slow gradual pitch-over immediately after jettisoning the last of the strap-ons stages, which for the simulation was at an altitude of about 18,000 m. I think it is important that we don\u0027t put too much emphasis on what the pitch needs to be, but rather on what the flight path angle should be. The flight path angle is the angle that the velocity vector makes with the local horizon. We alter the pitch simply to maintain the correct flight path angle. Below is a graph of the simulation\u0027s surface velocity flight path angle versus altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/pics/KSP_002.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP_002.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some point during ascent the NAV ball will switch from surface velocity to orbital velocity, but by the time that happens the two vectors should be pretty close to each other. The result shown here was obtained by keeping the pitch vector just barely ahead of the velocity vector throughout the gravity turn (the pitch led the velocity vector by a constant 0.23\u003Csup\u003Eo\u003C/sup\u003E). In practice it\u0027s unlikely that a proper separation between the pitch and velocity vectors can be constantly maintained, thus frequent small adjustments will undoubtedly be necessary. Furthermore, your rocket configuration may require a different ascent profile than what I simulated. You\u0027re going to have to find out what works for you. I would definitely recommend trying to make a slow smooth transition from a vertical velocity vector at about 20 km to a horizontal velocity vector at about 100 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the simulation, engine cutoff occurred at an altitude of about 99.5 km with a flight path angle of \u002B1 degree.
