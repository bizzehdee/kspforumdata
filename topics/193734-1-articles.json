No need to go hell-for-leather at 4g. Accelerating at 1.001g (to take an absurd example) wouldn\u0027t be the most efficient way to get to orbit but with your indefinite-acceleration drive, efficiency isn\u0027t a concern. And in some respects, low acceleration is a positive advantage in that it reduces aerodynamic stress and aerodynamic heating on your spacecraft during its ascent to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs usual, you haven\u0027t given us enough information for a definite answer (is your drive capable of pushing a Tomahawk or a Tomahawk \u002B booster at 900g for example?) but for the sake of argument, I\u0027m assuming its capable of pushing a Tomahawk and its booster, so 1.6 metric tons, at 900g. I\u0027m also assuming that relativistic effects are negligible - which seems reasonable for interplanetary velocities - so that we can use Newtonian physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForce is mass multiplied by acceleration (Newton\u0027s 2nd Law).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore a drive capable of pushing 1.6 tons at 900g is capable of pushing 3.2 tons at 450g or 6.4 tons at 225g or 12.8 tons at 110.5g.... etc. etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you want that drive to accelerate a spacecraft at 4g, the spacecraft needs to weigh 1.6 x 900/4 =\u00A0 360 tons. The same drive will accelerate a spacecraft weighing 720 tons at 2g, which seems like a more reasonable acceleration. For comparison purposes, 720 tons is approximately 1/3 of the mass of the first stage (S1C stage) of the Saturn V rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, if I was building a ship around your drive, I would go with a 720 ton vessel and dock it in orbit with another 720 tons of shielding, giving me a 1440 ton vessel capable of a constant 1g acceleration. It\u0027s by no means an original idea (I forget where I read it) but the shielding would probably be made of ice since that\u0027s cheap, readily available and easily workable into whatever shape you need. Assuming my arithmetic is correct, 720 tons of ice is approximately 774 cubic metres, which should provide a nice thick shield against radiation as well as dust and micrometeorites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-09T19:42:18Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2020 07:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-09T19:48:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntomahawk \u002B 900 g = tomahawk pancake\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(also what should its wings, fins, and turbojet do in vacuum?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-09T19:49:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/09/2020 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 9, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by kerbiloid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-09T20:27:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would make it so it gave one g trust, more is pretty much overkill.\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou might want 2 g\u00A0for takeoff and landing unless you make an spaceplane.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is obviously an starship an real one.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou main problem will probably be power, on the other hand we have an tricks.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis thing is also an perpetuum mobile, how? well mount it on the end of an fairly long arm with an counterweight.

Accelerating at 1.001g (to take an absurd example) wouldn\u0027t be the most efficient way to get to orbit but with your indefinite-acceleration drive, efficiency isn\u0027t a concern. And in some respects, low acceleration is a positive advantage in that it reduces aerodynamic stress and aerodynamic heating on your spacecraft during its ascent to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs usual, you haven\u0027t given us enough information for a definite answer (is your drive capable of pushing a Tomahawk or a Tomahawk \u002B booster at 900g for example?) but for the sake of argument, I\u0027m assuming its capable of pushing a Tomahawk and its booster, so 1.6 metric tons, at 900g. I\u0027m also assuming that relativistic effects are negligible - which seems reasonable for interplanetary velocities - so that we can use Newtonian physics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nForce is mass multiplied by acceleration (Newton\u0027s 2nd Law).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore a drive capable of pushing 1.6 tons at 900g is capable of pushing 3.2 tons at 450g or 6.4 tons at 225g or 12.8 tons at 110.5g.... etc. etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you want that drive to accelerate a spacecraft at 4g, the spacecraft needs to weigh 1.6 x 900/4 =\u00A0 360 tons. The same drive will accelerate a spacecraft weighing 720 tons at 2g, which seems like a more reasonable acceleration. For comparison purposes, 720 tons is approximately 1/3 of the mass of the first stage (S1C stage) of the Saturn V rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, if I was building a ship around your drive, I would go with a 720 ton vessel and dock it in orbit with another 720 tons of shielding, giving me a 1440 ton vessel capable of a constant 1g acceleration. It\u0027s by no means an original idea (I forget where I read it) but the shielding would probably be made of ice since that\u0027s cheap, readily available and easily workable into whatever shape you need. Assuming my arithmetic is correct, 720 tons of ice is approximately 774 cubic metres, which should provide a nice thick shield against radiation as well as dust and micrometeorites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou were right.
