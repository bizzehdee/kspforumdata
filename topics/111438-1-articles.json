This series will start off with the basics of scanning, land a ground base for drilling, launch a large space station for refining and refueling, and will serve as both entertainment and tutorial at the same time. All ships are Stock with the exception of some added [Surface Lights](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57778-1-0-Surface-Mounted-Stock-Alike-Lights-for-Self-Illumination). You\u0027ll be able to download all .CRAFT right here too. This mini-series will temporarily preempt [Project Odyssey](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/76021-Project-Odyssey-adventures-getting-home-from-an-alternate-dimension) to give me time to create episode 46 of that series, which is going to take a while to produce. I already have a couple episodes of Operation Gold Strike finished. Here are some images of what you can expect.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled. View full album](//imgur.com/a/I7MGX)\n\nThe idea for this episode came out of the following tutorial video. People still wanted to see the entire process in real use operation, and then along came my idea for episode 46 of Project Odyssey. It\u0027s going to take me a few weeks to create, so this mini-series will provide a little something in the meantime instead of nothing at all for weeks.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/haJrgF-gVWE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**CRAFT FILES**\n\nIn here --\u003E [![PTasv9K.png](http://i.imgur.com/PTasv9K.png)](https://goo.gl/wSdWBm)\n\nYou\u0027ll need this too: [Surface Lights](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/57778-1-0-Surface-Mounted-Stock-Alike-Lights-for-Self-Illumination)\n\nNone of the following mods are needed to run my craft files other than Surface Lights, linked above.
