On MechJeb\u0027s \u0022landing guidance\u0022 page, just tick the \u0022show landing predictions\u0022 box and it will show you what your orbit will be after you pass thru the atmosphere (if your periapsis is below the top of the atmosphere, that is). If it detects that you would end up hitting the surface first, it will tell you the coordinates of the predicted landing site instead of the orbital parameters, and if you told it you want to land at a specific site (KSP launchpad, for example) it will tell you how far off target you are. Even if you end up flying the landing manually, the information that it provides is incredibly useful for planning aerobraking and pin-point accurate landings.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-02T07:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, there is not a simple formula for aerobraking, regardless of whether you want to land or establish a new orbit.

If you go much lower than 32km Kerbin pe when returning from the mun, you will instead execute a direct re-entry and landing, and that trajectory will not exit the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat might be a \u0022rule of thumb\u0022 to some, but for the spreadsheet I\u0027m thinking of, it could represent a data point, and even if it\u0027s not a very accurate or precise one, it\u0027s still useful data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the whole \u0022curve fit to a spreadsheet based on thousands of test runs\u0022 idea does feel very much like a \u0022brute force approach\u0022 to solving the issue.
