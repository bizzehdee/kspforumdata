This is especially obvious with the atmospheric nosecone package. First-time use in any area reports that it\u0027s going to return 120 data, but ends up returning base 12, with a 0.3 multiplier, for a measly 3.6 science. Note, that this is *first time* use. The Negative Gravioli Detector is likewise returning far less than it should. Anyone else seeing this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T18:45:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep. That\u0027s a known bug: the readout for how much science you get from the Gravity Scan, Seismic Scan, and Atmospheric Analysis is off for all three. The game erroneously calculates data * planetary multiplier instead of science * planetary multiplier for the readout, but correctly uses the latter for actual science gained. You don\u0027t notice it for any but those three experiments because all experiments outside of those three have a data scale of 1.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DonLorenzo","CreatedById":13642,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T19:03:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was noticing this as well, this explains it!
