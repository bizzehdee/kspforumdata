So much so, that Valentina had felt compelled to compliment her on it. Midway through her own scream, Valentina realized that might not have been the wisest thing to do, as her shoulder was popped back into place. It was sore, now, but the large mustachioed Kerbelle was confident full use would soon return. Somehow, she seemed disappointed. \n\nIt also turned out, Valentina *hadn\u0027t* been bleeding to death, after all. She\u0027d hardly bled at all, really. It was just that sticky goo smeared all over her side. Waiting to meet up with the *Zarya* in M\u00FCnar orbit, she had stripped out of the flimsy rescue suit and what remained of her water cooling garment, and spent an hour prying bits of broken glass from little pockets in her skin. That was unpleasant, but... considerably less so than the alternative. By the time she had docked and made the return burn to Kerbin, even the pockets seemed to have disappeared. \n\nOne transmission was all she had been allowed. A single coded flash of bits, sent out after MechIVAN had computed her likely landing site in the middle of the Tethys Inland Sea. It was all that was needed. Minutes after splashing down, an unusual thing in a *Zarya*, a fishing trawler had appeared to pluck Valentina from the bobbing capsule. An explosive bundle was tossed back in. With a gentle nudge from the boat to submerge the open hatch, the blackened craft slipped beneath the waves, disappearing forever with only a muted *thump* and a ring of bubbles foaming on the surface. \n\nThe crew bound her injured arm, gave her food and water and a warm, if noisy, berth near the engines, but never spoke to her or even looked directly at her. A few days later, as the boat motored along the shore just before dawn, one by one they jumped overboard carrying waterproof satchels, until only Valentina and the captain were left. He still said nothing, only pointed her to a landmark as he lowered her into a dinghy that was little more than an inflatable pool toy. \n\nShe stood there on the shore for a long time, watching the rising sun and the thin trail of smoke before it, until that, too winked out. It was a short walk in the brisk morning air to the spot, where a nondescript kar was waiting. And now, she found herself back in the office of the Kommissar, sitting in a chair with her arm in a sling, giving a report that sounded ever more insane while he stood there impassively, staring at the broken-tipped knife on the shelf. \n\n\u0022I could *feel* it in my head, in my *mind*, trying to get inside,\u0022 her voice was taught and thin, stretched near to breaking, \u0022and I could see things, *horrible* things...\u0022\n\nThe Kommissar didn\u0027t move. Valentina didn\u0027t think he\u0027d moved at all since she began. He just stood there, hands folded behind his back, his knees ramrod straight. A smoldering rattail dangled from his fingers. He might have been made of iron. \n\n\u0022I ran after that,\u0022 she continued, studying the floor, \u0022I wanted to *do* something. I wanted to fight back. But I just ran. I have never been so terrified. The shadows, I could swear they\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022The structure, what did it look like?\u0022 the Kommissar said abruptly, eyes never leaving that knife. \n\n\u0022I, um..\u0022 she stumbled, \u0022I did not get a good look at it. It was... *wrong*, it... it didn\u0027t *want* to be looked at.\u0022 \n\nThe Kommissar remained silent, so she pressed on, \u0022the rover ran out of power when I reached the base again, I think I might have hit something. I had to\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022Did you touch it?\u0022 he broke in again. \n\n\u0022The... what?\u0022\n\n\u0022The structure. Did you touch it?\u0022\n\n\u0022Touch it? No, I... I do not think so. It\u0027s all getting fuzzy now, like trying to remember a nightmare. I just wanted to leave there. I felt like I was going mad.\u0022\n\n\u0022You say you felt it in your mind,\u0022 the Kommissar didn\u0027t turn. He ran a finger along the edge of the glass case, \u0022and you ran.\u0022\n\nIn spite of herself, a tinge of irritation crept into Valentina\u0027s voice, \u0022er... yes. It was like being... I wanted to get away, anywhere, I\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022Do not lie to me,\u0022 a single eye flicked her direction. His voice was a knife in silk. \n\nHer head twitched, \u0022I am not lying, it\u2014\u0022\n\nWith speed that defied his size, the Kommissar spun around. He swooped up the chair, Valentina and all, and slammed it up against the wall to the sound of splitting wood. \n\n\u0022Do not *lie* to me!\u0022 he roared. \n\nValentina could only gape in shock. Holding the chair up against the wall with one hand, he gripped her chin with the other. Like so many time before, his frigid eyes bored into her. Deconstructing, dissecting, prying. Panic flared for an instant, as she recalled fetid, dank tendrils of shadow... But, no... this was entirely *un*like that. Not prying, *searching*... Her memories, her feelings of that horrible time once more paraded across her mind\u0027s eye, but nothing moved to enter... only... to draw out.\n\nThe intensity in the Kommissar\u0027s eyes faltered, then of all things, *confusion* crept in. His features softened. He released her chin and let the chair slide down with a thump.\n\n\u0022You *have* seen,\u0022 he whispered, more to himself, \u0022and yet... there is no taint. No stain.\u0022 Staggering backwards, he collapsed against his heavy wooden desk, eyes never leaving hers. He looked on her with the awe of one beholding divinity. \n\n\u0022It *is* you,\u0022 his head shook slowly back and forth, eyes still locked, \u0022until this very moment... I did not believe, myself...\u0022\n\nValentina blinked in bewilderment, \u0022have... have you gone quite mad?\u0022 then slapped a hand to her face as she realized what she\u0027d just said and to *whom*.\n\nThe chill returned as quickly as it left, and he was once again looming over her, \u0022do not *lie*... to yourself.\u0022\n\nShe... didn\u0027t quite have a response to that. \n\nThe Kommissar turned back to his desk, studying the few items there, \u0022you have felt it. Long before the M\u00FCn, you have felt it. Sensed it working in the dark places. Perhaps you have heard it whisper to you, tempting you. Placating you.\u0022 He looked to her, \u0022do you deny this?\u0022\n\nA slight shake of her head was all she could manage. \n\n\u0022You have stood before the infernal Shadowwell, looked into its phantasms, yet your mind is still your own. And your soul.\u0022 He stepped up to her, and with a thick finger, lifted the titanium chain around her neck that held Dibella\u0027s M\u00FCnstone and the sliver of Anastasia\u0027s m\u00FCnrock, \u0022though I suspect you had help. Many, much greater than you, have broken long before.\u0022\n\nSomething tried to form in Valentina\u0027s mind, some understanding of all this madness. It seemed almost within reach, but circled, just beyond comprehension. \n\nShe forced voice from her lips, \u0022the thing on the M\u00FCn. What *is* it?\u0022\n\n\u0022A shadow. There is no better word for it in any language you would know. The shadow of an entity not of this world or any other. It is the embodiment of chaos, destruction given will. It remains imprisoned somewhere near Jool, perhaps one of the moons. The Shadowwell is its beacon, to draw the unsuspecting like moths to a flame. Technology has now removed the final barrier to that cursed place. Anyone who stands before it will find their mind twisted and lost, and become one of the *shadar\u0027skemmd*,\u0022 his eyes flicked to her, \u0022the shadowstained. Like your friend, Edmund Kerman.\n\n\u0022Anyone,\u0022 he leaned closer, \u0022except *you*.\u0022\n\nWith a *thunk* Valentina was sure could be heard *outside* her head, the final piece dropped into place.\n\n\u0022You knew...\u0022 her eyes widened, \u0022all this time... you *knew*. You knew what I would find up there. You did not need intelligence, the whole time it was nothing but\u2014\u0022\n\n\u0022A test,\u0022 he went back to staring at that odd little knife, \u0022I needed to know it was really you. That you would not crumble like the others. And truth be told, I am... disappointed.\u0022\n\nThat brought her train of thought to a screeching halt, \u0022what? *Why?*\u0022\n\nThe Kommissar turned again, his look as icy as ever, \u0022because... *you will die.*\u0022\n\n*I am expendable...*\n\nThe thought had long wandered her mind, but to hear it aloud from another person settled an unpleasant lump in her gut. \n\n\u0022The Songs are unusually clear on this,\u0022 he said. \n\n\u0022Songs?\u0022 she managed. \n\n\u0022Since before the Deluge, the People sang of the rise of the Kraken. But with it also, the rise of Bane and Scourge. From among the People *hope* would arise, so that *hope* might not vanish from the world. Those songs are now silent, like the People. And yet, here you are.\u0022\n\nValentina put a hand to her swimming head, \u0022you... you really have gone mad!\u0022 She pointed to the nub of a rattail still clenched in his fingers, \u0022its those *things*, they give you an abnormal brain.\u0022 Squeezing her eyes shut, she waited for the world to stop spinning, \u0022and you think I am this... hero?\u0022\n\nThe Kommissar only continued that frigid, weighing look.\n\n\u0022You...\u0022 she groped for words, \u0022you have made a mistake. I am no hero! I found your thing on the M\u00FCn, and I was terrified! I *ran!*\u0022\n\n\u0022Of course you did,\u0022 a trace of anger edged into his voice,  \u0022you are *not* a *fool*.\u0022\n\nHer mouth flopped open and closed for several moments before she jumped out of her seat, \u0022I-I-I-I am just a peasant girl from Kerberia! I grew up in a shack! I fly airplanes and space capsules! Andandandand... the whole *world* has gone mad! And! And! And..! *ST\u0414LI\u0419S S\u0428\u0417\u0414T\u0423 **S\u0424C\u041AS** \u0424\u0419 **P\u0426TI\u0419S \u042C\u0414LD P\u0414T\u042D!!!!!***\u0022\n\nIncredibly, her eyes remained steady, if slightly trembling, before that unmovable glower. \n\n\u0022You have your mother\u0027s fire,\u0022 he said after a time, \u0022and your father\u0027s mouth.\u0022 \n\nThat mouth then flopped open for a moment. \n\nEventually, speech returned, \u0022you... you knew them? You know *something*... of course, *you* know something! You must tell me!\u0022 She grabbed the lapels of his uniform coat, seeming to have lost all fear, \u0022please, you must tell me!\u0022 Then she collapsed back to the chair, rubbing at her temples again. \n\n\u0022Have you really no memory of them?\u0022\n\nNot looking up, she just shook her head. The Kommissar gripped her chin, gently this time, and again stared down into her with that piercing gaze. \n\n\u0022You have,\u0022 he said at length, \u0022you have merely forgotten. I will help you. You are, I think, owed that much.\u0022 He turned to a box on his desk. \n\nValentina rose, a question forming on her lips.\n\n\u0022Sit.\u0022\n\nAnd plopped back down. The Kommissar pulled the other chair over, and sat across from her. In his hand was some sort of short, ragged, brownish tube. He lit it from the stub of his rattail, before snubbing that out. A thin trail of grey smoke rose from the tube, and the air filled with a faint odor of cinnamon. The Kommissar watched it intently, muttering something rhythmic under his breath. \n\n\u0022What is that?\u0022 Valentina asked with apprehension. \n\n\u0022A leaf. A refugee to this world, from a time when it was yet young, and the People already old. \n\n\u0022What... does it do?\u0022\n\n\u0022Nothing. It gives your senses something to occupy them, so that your mind may move freely.\u0022\n\n\u0022How\u2014\u0022 she never finished the question. The Kommissar raised the smoldering tube to his lips, and blew through it, sending a dense cloud of smoke into Valentina\u0027s face. As he had said, her senses were instantly *very* occupied. Immediately, her eyes teared up and swelled shut. Her lungs heaved, her skin burned. The subtle scent of cinnamon became an overwhelming, desiccating fire, as if she\u0027d tried to swallow a spoonful. She could just hear the Kommissar\u0027s mumbles become subvocal chants before her ears began ringing, drowning everything else out. \n\nThen the burning on her skin became tingling, which quickly passed to numbness. It felt like she was floating... falling... *rising*...\n\nShe was... she...\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-21T06:01:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2016 06:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T05:18:17Z","Content":"**Chapter 90: Truth**\n\nShe sits on a cold, dirty floor, playing with Dolly. The floor is always dirty, no matter how much Mama sweeps. And always cold. She doesn\u0027t like Dolly, but there is nothing else here to play with. She misses the toy airplanes She had in the Big House, and the mobile of all the planets that hung over Her crib. But even those memories are fading away now, and will soon be oblivion. \n\nMama and Papa are fighting again. They fight a lot, now. Nearly all the time. Once again, Mama is throwing their meager things into a worn, old trunk. \n\n\u0022...get away to Kerbelsk. I have an old colleague there, he can get us passage on a ship to the East.\u0022\n\n\u0022No, we must go north!\u0022 Papa\u0027s eyes are sunken and red. He never sleeps. He is always watching. Always listening. \u0022There are rumors of an outright rebellion in Erakonia. They are holding the line. It is not too late!\u0022\n\n\u0022We cannot bring *Her* into a war zone!\u0022 Mama gestures without looking, \u0022not based on stories! We have to get *out!*\u0022\n\n\u0022We stay off the roads, travel overland. If we can make it to the Tethys perhaps we can find a ship...\u0022\n\n\u0022Listen to you, you\u0027ve gone mad! Do you even know what you\u0027re saying? In this weather?\u0022\n\n\u0022We cannot just give up!\u0022 Papa is raging.\n\n\u0022There\u0027s nothing *left* to give up!\u0022 Mama slams the trunk, \u0022it\u0027s over, we\u0027ve lost. All we can do now is flee.\u0022\n\n\u0022And become refugees?!\u0022\n\n\u0022What do you think we are now?\u0022\n\n\u0022No!\u0022 Papa screams, so loud it hurts Her ears, \u0022I will not abandon my homeland! I will *not* abandon\u2014\u0022\n\nHe points to Her, sees Her eyes, and in an instant, the rage is gone. There is no crying in this place, somehow She has sensed the futility of it, but Her eyes are wide and wet as she clings to Dolly with trembling hands. Papa drops to a knee and flings his arms wide, his features softened as his own eyes well up. She runs to him, tiny hands outstretched, Dolly forgotten on the floor.\n\n\u0022*Moya Zvyozdochka, prosti mi*,\u0022 he whispers as he pulls Her close. In his words is regret for far more than merely yelling. Mama approaches, and runs a hand through his greying hair. He wraps one tightly around her hips, presses his cheek to her. \n\n\u0022It was not supposed to be like this,\u0022 he says softly, like one in a dream, \u0022it was supposed to be *better*. I thought we were... I thought...\u0022 His tears are warm on Her cheek.\n\n\u0022*Lyubov moya*,\u0022 Mama breathes, \u0022we all did. But it is lost, now. For Her sake, we must leave.\u0022\n\nThey hold each other in this dark, freezing place, and for just a few brief, perfect moments, She is happy. But in this place, such things can never last. \n\nThe door slams open, bringing with it a cold blast and swirling snow. *Deda* is here, now, his eyes wide with fear.\n\n\u0022They are here!\u0022 he cries, \u0022they are searching house to house!\u0022\n\nPapa bolts up, \u0022out the back door. Quickly!\u0022 But Mama is already there, peeking through the window. She doesn\u0027t say a word, only shakes her head, her face pale. Screams and shouts carry in on the biting wind, and a popping sound like knots exploding in the fire. \n\n\u0022Trapped...\u0022 Papa barely makes a sound. Conflict, anguish rampage across his face, and he grabs *Deda* by his worn old coat, \u0022*you* must be the one to turn us in.\u0022\n\nDeda staggers as if struck, \u0022Vladimir...!\u0022\n\n\u0022You must!\u0022 Papa pleads, \u0022or they will take Her! And they will take you too!\u0022\n\nThe same struggle plays across the old Kerb\u0027s face, in a mirror of his son\u0027s, \u0022hit me!\u0022 he says.\n\n\u0022Papa...!\u0022\n\n\u0022You must! It must be real!\u0022 *Deda* sees his son hesitate, he turns to the wall and smashes his own face against the shelf there, opening a gash above his eye. He places a single hand to his son\u0027s cheek, for one last moment, before turning to the door.\n\n\u0022Help! Help! They are in here! Come quickly!\u0022\n\nPapa scoops Her into his arms and runs to the closet, \u0022you must not open this door, do you understand?\n\n\u0022No matter what you hear, you must not open this door!\u0022\n\n\u0022But Papa...\u0022\n\n\u0022No!\u0022 He slams the door shut, plunging Her into darkness. All at once, the noises come. Yelling. Cursing. Smashing. Shattering. Fear and panic fight to own Her. The darkness seems to close in, envelop Her. She can *feel* it, squeezing,  searching. At last, at the sound of Mama\u0027s scream, She can bear it no more, and kicks the door open. \n\nWith a nascent talent that will be honed over the years, her eyes take in the scene at once. Papa is gone. Mama is disappearing out the door. There are soldiers in their long coats, holding big sticks with little metal tubes at the ends and long, cruel spikes. And *Deda* cowers before the Big One, who has a thick mustache and gold braid on his shoulders. \n\nSomething deep inside Her, long dormant, stirs, and everything goes *red*. Though She can barely reach it, She grabs the kitchen knife from the table. She charges forward, instinctively putting Her slight weight behind it, a wordless cry on Her lips. For an instant, just an instant, their eyes meet before She drives the knife into the Big One\u0027s knee until she feels it hit bone. \n\nHe screams. A soldier shoves Her back. She lands hard. He raises the stick. Points it at Her. And\n\nSound.\n\n*Sound.*\n\n*...the world becomes sound...*\n\nSomething hot kisses Her cheek. But\u2014\n\nThe Big One. He has knocked the stick away.\n\n\u0022Oaf!\u0022 he rails at the soldier, \u0022you would shoot a *child?*\u0022 \n\nThe soldier gapes at him, his own mouth wide and fighting for words, \u0022I\u2014I\u2014I\u2014I...\u0022 he glances to the knife, \u0022I will pull it out, Comrade Captain!\u0022\n\nHe reaches but the Big one shoves him away, \u0022it\u0027s cut the artery, do you want me to bleed to death?!\u0022 The soldier backs away, shaking. His face has gone as white as the snow blowing in. \u0022Argh, I think the tip broke off. I can feel it in the joint!\u0022 He grabs the soldier and pushes him out the door, \u0022get the medic!\u0022\n\n*Deda* wakes from his shock, scoops Her into his arms, shields Her with his body, \u0022mercy, Comrade! Please! She is just scared!\u0022 \n\nTears and blood wash Her cheek, but the fear has departed. She peers over the old Kerb\u0027s shoulder, meeting eyes that are more frigid than the cutting wind outside. Eyes that have never known warmth. She can feel them, cold, calculating, weighing. Yet She holds his gaze, the fire in her burning against the ice in him.\n\nFinally, he smiles. Bitter. Mirthless. But... also...\n\n\u0022Of course she is,\u0022 the Big One says softly, \u0022of course.\u0022\n\n*Deda* turns, the smile evaporates, \u0022she is your charge now, old Kerb. Take her far away from this place. It would be best for you both... if no one even knows you exist.\u0022\n\n*Deda* nods, backs away. For a moment, those warmthless eyes meet Hers again, \u0022we... will be watching you.\u0022\n\nAnother soldier enters, \u0022medic, Comrade Captain?\u0022\n\n\u0022Ugh, help me to the truck. These two, put them on the next train going north, with papers. They are...\u0022 one last time, his eyes meet Hers, \u0022of no concern.\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*, Comrade Captain! And what of the village?\u0022\n\n\u0022Burn it.\u0022\n\n\u0022*D\u0414*, Comrade Captain!\u0022\n\n\u0022You, move!\u0022 another soldier roughly leads them out into the cold. The wind scrapes against Her face, scouring the fire away. Suddenly, She is so tired. Soon, She is in the back of a truck, heading away, watching the bottoms of the clouds glow orange.\n\n\u0022Shhh, Tinka,\u0022 *Deda* says, hugging her against the cold, \u0022we will do as we were told. Remember this night. Do not make noise. Do what you must to survive. And never, *ever*... take sides...\u0022\n\nShe feels numb. Like floating. \n\nFloating, drifting, *rising*...\n\nRising...\n\nShe is...\n\nShe is...\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBack in the chair, in the Kommissar\u0027s office. Skin still burning, Valentina looked around groggily. He stood by the wall, staring at the knife again. Knees straight, hands folded behind his back, a fresh rattail dangling. \n\n\u0022It is still there, between the bones. I feel it, with every step. Every movement.\u0022\n\n\u0022You... this whole time, it was *you!*\u0022 In a single motion, she leapt from the chair, smashed the glass case, and pressed the knife up against his throat. \u0022*You* took them away!\u0022\n\nThere was no surprise in his eyes, \u0022do it. Do *it!* Strike me down. It would be fitting, no? It would be...just.\u0022\n\n\u0022No!\u0022 she screamed, pushing the broken tip against his flesh, \u0022you do not get to walk away, and claim a bad knee as your penance!\u0022\n\n\u0022Then *do* it! Have your vengeance.\u0022\n\nHer hands trembled. Little rivulets of blood ran down his neck. \n\n\u0022Do it! There is money in the desk, and papers. You are already dead. You can disappear. Back into the woods, or across the globe. \n\n\u0022Do it. And while you hide, the shadows grow stronger. They spread and search. They will come for you. They will come for *everyone*.\n\n\u0022Do it!\u0022 he pressed his neck against the blade, \u0022and spare me what is to come. You have *seen*. There is no escape. I cannot save the world. Only *you* can.\n\n\u0022So do it, and be done,\u0022 those frigid eyes grew wide now, *burning* into her, \u0022or put away your anger, *curse* the Shadow, and embrace *who you are*.\u0022\n\nHe leaned in, the knife dropping away listlessly, \u0022put down the knife, take up the *lash*... and **drive. The shadows. Out!**\u0022\n\nValentina looked down, at the blood staining her own hands.\n\n*...blood on my hands...*\n\n*...Billy-Bobrim... Donald... the Director... the Political Officer... Anna... **Sergei...***\n\n*...NO...*\n\n*...drive... the shadows... out...*\n\n*I choose to go into the shadows, to seek them out, to find their limits. I ride the ragged edges of understanding. I fly into the dark places in the sky, the places others fear and fear well. I chase the shadows, harry them, **scourge** them. I drive them out, so that others will not have to know them.*\n\n*...I drive them out...*\n\nThe knife dropped to her side, and she looked up, meeting that piercing gaze as she had years before.\n\n\u0022Are you strong enough?\u0022 he raised his brow, \u0022*are* you? If you do this, it will break you. You will not be able to trust yourself, what you see, what you hear. What you feel. You will not be able to trust *any* of the threads that have held you together in the past. *Can* you do this?\n\n\u0022*Are* you strong enough?\u0022\n\nShe thought for a moment, then rammed the knife down into the heavy desk, burying it up to the hilt. \n\n\u0022I.. am a test pilot.\u0022\n\nFor the second time she had ever seen, the Kommissar smiled, \u0022good. I will tell you more when you return. You must leave at once.\u0022\n\nValentina nodded, \u0022where am I going?\u0022\n\n\u0022To Cerima.\u0022\n\nSomewhere across the cosmos and deep in her psyche, a needle scratched across the vinyl record of reality.\n\nOnce she had finished twitching and pawing at her ears, she said, \u0022I am sorry, I do not know what came over me. I must have something in my ear. What did you say?\u0022\n\n\u0022You are going to Cerima.\u0022\n\nSTACK OVERFLOW ERROR  \n\nUNABLE TO READ FROM ADDRESS 00F90000  \n\nDIVIDE BY ZERO, DOES NOT COMPUTE  \n\nVALENTINA.EXE HAS STOPPED WORKING  \n\u003Cu\u003EA\u003C/u\u003EBORT, \u003Cu\u003ER\u003C/u\u003EETRY, \u003Cu\u003EF\u003C/u\u003EAIL?\n\nIt was some time before her senses returned. She had to struggle to piece together a sentence.\n\n\u0022Cerima? Why... why am I going to *Cerima?*\u0022\n\nHis expression as dark as ever, the Kommissar pressed a small envelope into her hand, \u0022read this. Burn it. Swallow the ashes. A kar is waiting for you outside.\n\n\u0022You are dismissed.\u0022\n\nValentina staggered out into the strange little room, with the strange little clerk typing at the blank typewriter at the strange little desk, holding the strange little envelope before her.
