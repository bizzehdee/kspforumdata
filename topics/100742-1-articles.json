In real liquid rocket engines usually the ratio is not the optimal ratio due to excessive heat from the burn that cannot be dissipated quickly enough among other factors. In KSP, the adjusting the ratio could boost delta V but at the cost of overheating the engine quicker as a way to add a higher level of later gameplay as players advance and possibly result in some spontaneous rapid disassembles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JPmAn","CreatedById":121564,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T19:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 on this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T20:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis seems like the exact type of complexity Squad doesn\u0027t like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it sounds like a neat idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
