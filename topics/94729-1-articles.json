About one in three times when I launch something interplanetary, the game will assure me for several days that it\u0027s on course. Then after a few other launches and contracts, I\u0027ll check in on the long distance ship, and it\u0027ll be heading absolutely nowhere near where it was going in the first place. My first Eve probe with a 200km planned periapsis now doesn\u0027t even get an encounter and needs 1100 delta-v to correct it... It only just exited Kerbin\u0027s SOI one game-day ago! On the other hand, the probe a day behind it has had a 40km periapsis all the way and hasn\u0027t changed its mind after also leaving the Kerbin zone. They were identical ships apart from the time separation (in case of exactly this sort of Kraken attack \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s definitely not an encounter with Mun or Minmas disturbing things on the way out, I always check for that after a certain incident in my early days \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t really know where to start with this one... I run a bunch of mods, but as far as I\u0027m aware none of them should be changing the on-rails behaviour. On the up side, I can fix it with the debug menu and infinite fuel to put me back on track, but it feels so dirty and knocks out my arrival time, and I\u0027d love to know if there\u0027s something I can do to avoid it happening in the first place!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-28T01:11:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat where you doing when the ship change SOI from Kerbal to the Sun?
