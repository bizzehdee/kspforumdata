I\u0027m using KIS 1.2.0 and KAS 0.5.3. First, here is my base. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/suPmhnZ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022suPmhnZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPathfinder relies heavily upon KIS/KAS for assembly; I\u0027m enjoying building my mod around KIS/KAS. Anyway, you can see that I\u0027ve attached batteries, solar panels, and using the ModuleKISPartMount, I\u0027ve attached a crew transfer tube (essentially a modified connector port) and two Chuckwagon inflatable storage modules. What I\u0027m trying to do is set up a second Ponderosa and attach it to the first via crew transfer tube. Bill is having a problem though, and cannot pull the Ponderosa from its mounting rack:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/1AA0Yor.png\u0022 alt=\u00221AA0Yor.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the looks of it, KIS is looking at the already setup base instead of the part that is attached to the landing craft, and incorrectly determining that it has parts attached to it and thus cannot be carried. I tried pulling all the parts off of the established base but I get the same error.
