If you dont want the ship any more, you just go to the tracking station and the craft will have a red button instead of the dark blue. You can abort the flight if you dont want it or you can chose to remove the conflicting part. This will save people a lot trouble when a new update happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
