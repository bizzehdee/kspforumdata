Generally speaking, using a mix of torque and RCS is a good start if you\u0027re making something large. RCS seems to put a bit less bend into the joints.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpreading out your torque a bit is better than putting it way out at the ends. Concentrated right at the center is often impractical and isn\u0027t ideal either, but is often better than at the ends. Usually distributed about, but mostly near the core (if that makes sense).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that if you put a torque part on a module that is relatively weakly connected, all that twisting translates into a lot of bending force on the joints. This can also be a problem if the part is relatively long before it connects to significant structure. Even if the joint doesn\u0027t break, the long portion of the structure flexes as the SAS controller tries to fine tune, which starts driving it crazy. That\u0027s when you start to get into resonating SAS modules that rip the ship apart. (Parts moving away, then toward each other repeatedly.) If you can move the torque module closer to where it connects, that often helps keep the wobble and breaking down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nature of the tree construction that KSP uses forces some of this. So be careful about connecting a really long part and putting a torque module at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"m4v","CreatedById":67965,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-14T03:54:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Taki117\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Taki117\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is a common misconception with KSP.
