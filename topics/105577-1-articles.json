On large vessels, you can simply use the huge heat sink capacity of large fuel tanks. Big fuel tanks have big weight, and this means they can absorb a lot of heat. You can fairly safely fire a nuke on a big ship without dedicated heat radiators, because it will take a long time warm up the high mass of your ship. The bigger the tank right next to your nuke, the better. Avoid placing heat sensitive parts near the nuke ( batteries, sensors) and you are good to go. The radiators are mainly useful on smaller ships where the nuke quickly floods the whole ship with heat and you need a good way to radiate the heat into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: thanks to everyone who found my research useful, I think you guys just doubled my rep rating. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teutooni","CreatedById":76518,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:55:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s great you need to deal with some kind of complexity with the engine as a tradeoff for ISP. The heat management is kinda backwards though. As I understand NERVAs, the process of pumping fuel through the reactor and out the nozzle actually cools the system down. The more thrust, the more it cools down. The nuclear reactor would have some kind of control rods to control the reactor temperature. Higher temperature would produce higher specific impulse, and there would be a balance of reactor temperature and fuel flow rate and these would determine specific impulse and thrust. This might be too complicated for what squad wants for the base game, but I think it would be neat to have the engine heat up when you activate it (it could blow up if you leave it like that without thrust). The specific impulse would reach its peak 800 seconds at near max temperatures, and you could cool the engine down by applying more thrust or shutting it down completely. I imagine around 90% thrust should reach steady state at 800s ISP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frozen_Heart","CreatedById":118627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T17:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think it\u0027s great you need to deal with some kind of complexity with the engine as a tradeoff for ISP\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplexity is one thing, having to put 20 to 30 parts sticking out is completely another.
