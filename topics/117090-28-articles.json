Looks like I should have 3-6 new mounts with the next release, including a decent selection of fairly detailed upper-stage mounts (lifter oriented mounts will still be very basic; there is really not room for extra detail in their geometry (without killing the aerodynamic look), and they only stick around for the first minute or two of the flight, while upper stages might be around for the duration of the craft).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso got the majority of the existing bugs squashed last night. Still a few that I\u0026#39;ll have to tackle Saturday morning, but overall in a much better state than it was yesterday.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, this weeks additions will be the J-2 engine (and clusters), an increased selection of mounting options for all of the engine clusters, tons of code-side cleanup, and an official 1.05 .dll recompile/update (to match the ablator and solar panel updates from stock) (might offer the 1.05 dll as a side-download; so as to not break the 1.04 compatibility quite yet).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHave updated the OP with more detailed list of the plans and timeline for the mod (for at least the next couple of releases). Please look it over before requesting features (especially \u0026#39;can you do this next\u0026#39; type of requests), as I will not be deviating from the set up schedule without good cause (or my ADD/boredom kicking in and making me work on something \u0026#39;new\u0026#39;). I\u0026#39;m still open to new requests and ideas, but please keep the above in mind before posting them. Trying to get a handle on the feature/part creep, and get things moving along towards some level of \u0026#39;completeness\u0026#39;. I can always add more engines/mounts/whatever later after the initial dev work is done.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn short: I will be finishing up the RS-68 and H1 engines, and moving on to the upper-stage stuff. Any further engines will be waiting until -after- the upper stage stuff is complete (so the J-2X, any others, will be waiting). Aiming to get the upper stage stuff, and release 0.3.x, complete -before- KSP 1.1 hits. If, after that, there is time remaining before 1.1 lands, at that point I will return to trying to get a few more engines complete while I wait for the update (and all the breakage it will bring).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso have a new concept that I would like to share / get a bit of feedback on -- \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPre-built symmetry parts for solar panels, RCS, landing-legs, ??.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThese would essentially be a single editor-part (each... one for each type of solar panel, one for each model of rcs) that would contain a full set the models (e.g. would contain 2, 3 or 4 solar panels, or 2 or 4 rcs ports). Would be surface attachable, and would have a built-in adjustment to set the \u0026#39;radius\u0026#39; to use for the symmetry (similar to the radial-booster-decoupler that allows you to set the radius). If I do the plugin side of things right, these could work like the engine clusters and allow you to use stock/other mods\u0026#39; parts/models in the pre-built symmetry part.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nParts that require symmetry (such as RCS) are one of the last bits of the \u0026#39;too many parts in use\u0026#39; problem that I would like to find a way to solve. Disappointing that you \u0026#39;need\u0026#39; RCS but it takes at least 2 parts to get even the most minimal RCS setup balanced.
