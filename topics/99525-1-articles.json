These images date from September of last year, to a week ago. These images help determine cloud cover, sea temperature, thermal imaging, vegetation, and so on. If you want to know exactly how I got these, please ask, I got the time. If any of you live on or near the Eastern Seaboard and want an image of a certain time, please send a request. These satellites make passes a various times during the day, and the whole process can take up to an hour. I also can record SSTV images mainly from the ISS, but I will have to know ahead of time of when these will occur.
