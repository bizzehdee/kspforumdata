Very few space programs actually deorbit debris (none) even though I\u0027m sure a few of you will prove me wrong. Space debris is one of my favourite parts of KSP. All those pretty flames...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModern space programs try to minimize it, because it\u0027s a very real problem for us now. NASA actually tracks every piece of debris in orbit right now, dating all the way back to the first space program. It\u0027s a lot of junk, and the smallest collision could destroy a billion dollar mission. There are some plans in the works to design and implement vehicles capable of deorbiting derelict satellites, but as of yet the cost of doing so is too high to be worthwhile. It\u0027s far easier to just plan the missions to leave everything out of orbit apart from what you plan to keep there. It\u0027s why we stopped using things like explosive bolts on orbital craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin is a much smaller planet than Earth, and most players use a smaller range of orbits than we do, so a debris problem can crop up faster. I deorbit what I can, but generally ignore what I can\u0027t, or that which would require too much effort. My trash collectors stay in orbit but are very infrequently used since .20. Every once ina while I might have a catastrophe in a heavily populated low parking orbit, and decide to deorbit the larger pieces before they can hit something important. I strive for realism where I can and don\u0027t like using the magic \u0022solve problem\u0022 button if I can avoid it. I make an exception though for catastrophes which are caused by some glitch in the game and are no fault of my own, like spontaneously exploding stations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-21T19:21:32Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2013 07:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Colonel_Panic\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T20:07:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo with all this talk of debris, has anyone ACTUALLY had a collision?
