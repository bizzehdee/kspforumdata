So far, we have used the Kerbal Space Center as a target, but that is not enough. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hKQJs.png\u0022 alt=\u0022hKQJs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChallenge:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake off, complete 1 full orbit, and then land on the Island of Kersica, approximately 50 kilometers northeast of the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReasoning: While landing near the KSC requires precision timing, it does not require changing your orientation; you simply head east until you circle around. Landing someplace off the main axes should add a degree of difficulty. Additionally, the Island of Kersica is quite small, relatively flat and surrounded by water so if you miss your brave Kerbonauts should survive for another mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock parts only for now.

I tried this for the first time yesterday. Retro\u0027ed at 300k just passing 180 degrees from the pad, passed over the pad just entering atmo and splashed down in the sea (I think most people\u0027s typical aiming zone) to the east. Not within visual range of the pad. I went a bit long, but acceptable. I thought the added challenge of the precise timing, as well as thrusting needed to hit a target area 30 minutes of flight time away with just one course change would be nifty.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-19T20:18:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL well default reentry manoevure is a lot like a Hohmann transfer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like low quick orbits and smaller stacks pushing a single tank liquid fuel reentry stage and usually have zero fuel left after retro burn and have to rely on atmospheric drag on reentry to slow down over the target so timing final burn is critical and it all depends on that. There would never be enough left to move a significant distance in the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETiming the final decouple matters a bit but its orientation seems to make little difference to capsule trajectory. Chute deployment adds drag but its really only a few meters worth as it only seems to deploy when the capsule has already slowed down enough to drop near vertically. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket Surgeon","CreatedById":3719,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-19T22:20:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022boolybooly\u0022 data-cite=\u0022boolybooly\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELOL well default reentry manoevure is a lot like a Hohmann transfer. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E..And that would be why I suggested it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
