The side of the servo with the yellow \u0022tape\u0022 and arrows should be connected to the subsection of the craft that containing the root part. This won\u0027t always cause a transform problem, but I have seen it happen sometimes. I haven\u0027t been able to pin down exactly when it happens and when it doesn\u0027t. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Struts. Even if struts aren\u0027t accidentally placed such that they cross the servo and fight against it, struts on the child of the servo part can sometimes cause issues. Again, I haven\u0027t been able to pin down the exact cause, but try moving or removing your struts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Certain mod parts resist transform by the IR servos. The KAS anchor part definitely does not like being moved by IR. I\u0027m not sure what other parts might have this issue. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://gfycat.com/SevereElaborateIndianglassfish\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHere\u003C/a\u003E is an example where the anchor part on the left toe doesn\u0027t want to move.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) When using multiple servos in a \u0022closed loop\u0022 structure created by docking ports. My understanding is that IR parts figure out their orientation relative to the root of the craft in the VAB/SPH. Docking a craft to itself (or to another craft) can apparently cause the root part to change, which has a chance of messing up the servo orientation (ie, the two servos will potentially start to fight one another). No real solution to this problem since I don\u0027t think the change is necessarily consistent. IE, on one launch inverting the servo might fix the problem, but on another it might cause the problem. Related to case 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) \u0022Other\u0022. Sometimes the problem occurs even when the servo is the right way around, there are no struts, and there are no mod parts. I haven\u0027t been able to determine the cause in these cases, but reassembly sometimes fixes it.

What I\u0027ve been doing for my new v1.04 mechs is turning them into, basically, a mod. I create an assembly, then weld it all together as a new part, then edit the config. This overcomes a whole bunch of issues specifically when it comes to using IR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) It lets me set the mass to something super low. This may seem cheaty but given the limitations of the unity joints that IR has to use, there\u0027s really no alternative if you want joints that appear to be \u0022realistically strong\u0022. You can always add mass back to the root assembly if you want realistic overall mass for the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The part welding mod doesn\u0027t rely on tweakscale, \u003Cem\u003Eeven if you use tweakscale to build your assembly\u003C/em\u003E. Once the assembly is welded into a single part it simply sets the value for the scale on each model reference. Some stock parts don\u0027t work well with tweakscale, for those (like the mk1 structural fuselage) I literally copy the squad part config file, save it as a new part, edit the rescalefactor to what I want it to be, and add that to my assembly. Once the welding is done \u003Cem\u003Eyou can delete the modified config you created\u003C/em\u003E, because the welding mod just holds a reference to the actual model and the scale, \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E the part config file that was used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) You don\u0027t need to strut pieces together \u0022downstream\u0022 of the IR joint, eliminating that as a source of transform issues.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside, of course, is that if you want to share your creations you have to distribute your welded parts as some kind of mod.
