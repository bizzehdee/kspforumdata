I need the thing to be able to detached at will, but without having to decouple it in the first place. The plan was to use those powered hinges at the back to point the satellites away from the back of the cargo bay before launching them. But if I use struts, the hinges will not be able to move the thing correctly (will just bend the satellite). Without struts though, the thing just fall through the cargo bay floor in 1G.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried active strut, but since the plane, with the addition of the 2 satellites, is about 333 parts, when I tried to fly it with active strut, apparently it just froze at the \u0022waiting for unity to catch up\u0022 process (and that is with Aggressive Active Texture management).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo cap up, I need:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EA way to detach struts at will without the use of further mods.

Then manually decouple that side only. Keep in mind the struts will break even if the decoupler is attached to the plane, so with careful positioning you can make it so the (radial) decoupler ejects out into space from the bottom of the plane to avoid damaging the sattelite.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-18T19:15:56Z\u0022 title=\u002211/18/2014 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"endl","CreatedById":119320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T20:46:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can use radial decouplers as strut anchors when you activate them the struts get released you can then use your infernal parts as i have noticed to reorient your satellite for launch\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sedativechunk","CreatedById":112761,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-18T21:01:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the others, you may need to use a mod like active struts for this. I used to used the tiberdyne shuttle mod and build a massive space station piece by piece like the real deal. It became a huge hassle with trying to use decouplers with cargo. The problem is, all decouplers in the game are created specifically for rocket use to push objects away from your rocket. You are going to run into some problems if you try to use that approach.

The person already tried active struts! The answer is simple, put small decouplers on the outside wall of the cargo bay, place the first end of the strut on the sat and then move the camera out of the cargo bay and place the end of the segment on the decouplers. It won\u0027t look like it\u0027s attached, but in the eyes of the game it will be.
