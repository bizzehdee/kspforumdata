Space is the first place our where species has ever declared total peace. At the height of the Cold War, the two biggest rivals of the world that were threatening each other with nuclear arms signed a treaty promising never to weaponize space (well, strategically, anyway).

First of all, you wouldn\u0027t put it to the shoulder, you\u0027d plant it at your centre of gravity. There are some unconventional firing positions that involve planting the butt of the weapon about where your belt buckle is. That would work in space for preventing undue rotation I would have thought. You\u0027d need to be using tracers and walk your fire onto the target, laser dots would help too.

Presumably you\u0027d be using some kind of MMU, it wouldn\u0027t be hard to get it to compensate for each shot, an attachment to the barrel that detected each shot (a la laser training systems) and sent a signal to the MMU would be easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YX33A","CreatedById":73184,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-15T19:34:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, that was my main issue with all the complaints about the level, Recoil issues aren\u0027t an issue if your EVA suit is linked to your firearm so that the recoil is canceled out.
