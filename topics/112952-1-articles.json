Having only flown twice in 1982, here was her one and only second chance. And who would be a better pilots than Jebediah Kerman and his brother, Bill, to test this machine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Calm yourself Bill, you don\u0027t have to keep gimbal-turning the rocket.\u0022 Jebediah assured Bill. \u0022She\u0027ll turn herself now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I know Jeb, but its not me. The whole dang rocket keeps swaying.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb stared at the navball, and just as he was about to blame Bill for the anomalous behavior again, a loud bang filled the cockpit. \u0022What did you do Bill!\u0022 Jeb yelled, but just after scolding his brother again, the shuttle started shaking rapidly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know I did not-\u0022 Bill was cut off as a bright light blinded him and flames enveloped him. Before Jebediah knew it, he was thrown out of the cockpit like a bullet from a gun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJebediah stared up at the crumbling rocket in awe and terror. But he soon was flooded with fear. \u0027What happened to Bill?\u0027 He thought.

So many in fact, that half of the crowd had to stand outside of the old building. The old building was the Astronaut Center, or at least what was left of it. The entire KSC complex was shut down only a year after the Resolute Disaster that claimed the life of Bill Kerman. This time it was KASA\u0027s one and only second chance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 2 full hours, the crowd of hundreds sat and listened to Gene Kerman\u0027s speech on the history of space exploration, and live interviews with real kerbonauts, but Gene had one last treat for the crowd. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I want to see a future\u0022 Gene started his speech \u0022Where cities as big as the KSC dot the surface of Duna. I don\u0027t want this to be on some crappy sci-fi movie, I want this to be real.\u0022 The crowd held their breath in anticipation-\u0022I want to send a Kerbal to Duna.\u0022 At that moment, the crowd exploded into applause. Excited Kerbals screamed like jet engines, children started jumping for joy, and parents held their mouths open in awe! Of course, not everyone was happy. Madame President despised the KASA, thinking that it was a bad waste of billions of KerbCoins. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGene saw the President\u0027s death glare, and responded rather well. \u0022Here we have Watney Kerman discussing the mission plan for such a mission.\u0022 Gene said before walking off the stage, only to be greeted by Jebediah. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Did you really beleive what you said?\u0022 Jeb asked Gene. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Of course I did.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Good.\u0022 Jeb replied, before walking onto stage with Watney.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hello everyone, I\u0027m Watney Kerman, and here is the famous kerbonaut Jebediah Kerman.\u0022 The crowd, once again, cheered with delight. \u0022Okay, lets get started.\u0022 Watney addressed the crowd. \u0022Launch 1 for the mission is a reusable rocket that launches the Duna Ascent Vehicle(DAV) to Duna on a low-energy transfer. After 8 months, the DAV lands and begins mining ore and converting it into fuel to be used in the ascent. We are not bringing our fuel with us, as that would require a rocket too massive to launch.\u0022 The crowd stared at him, most likely confused. Watney still went on, oblivious to his surroundings. \u0022Launch 2 happens the same year, but this time with the habitat module. The hab is unmanned, and lands as close as possible to the DAV. It sits and waits for 8 months for the crew to arrive. Launch 3 happens 2 years later, at the time of the next Duna launch window, this time carrying the ion-propelled Kerbin Return Vehicle(KRV). The KRV is launched to Duna on a chemical booster, but uses ion engines. The KRV uses a giant heat shield to aerocapture into a low Duna orbit.\u0022 Jeb felt like telling Watney to slow down, but he soon dismissed the idea. \u0022Launch 4 happens at the same time as Launch 3. This launch has a copy of the Hab Module, but this time, its manned by a crew of 2 Kerbonauts. The Hab II lands near the other 2 spacecraft, and the crew is unloaded onto the surface, where they stay for 7 months before departing into LDO. The crew use the DAV\u0027s command module to dock with the KRV, before taking a 3-month-long burn to reach Kerbin. The crew then enter the DAV\u0027s command module where they re-enter Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and land.\u0022 The crowd stared at Watney, wide eyed and completely lost. \u0022Well, uh...here are our 2 that will fly on the mission.\u0022 The crowd cheered again as Valentina walked onto stage, and stood beside Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0027She\u0027s cute\u0027 Jeb thought. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022They will be departing on our first, Explorer Class mission to Duna in 3 years!\u0022 Watney exclaimed. \u0022But, before then, we will be launching our first DAV and Hab to Duna in only 6 months, so you guys better watch out.\u0022 Watney finished his speech before pausing to stare at Jeb and Val, and finally walking off stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00223 years, not that bad.\u0022 Jeb told Val.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Believe me, it will go by a lot faster than you think\u0022. Val replied.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExpect episode 2 in a while, as there is low revenue right now. Episode 2 is when the DAV will launch. Also, should I ship Val and Jeb in the story?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust so you know, I plan on putting pictures in the story, so it is more like an actual mission report.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-15T20:00:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2015 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by VASMIR\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T20:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut....
