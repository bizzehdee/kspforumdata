But the next generation of Uranium reactors will ALSO be breeders, so instead of the highly radioactive, rare and expensive enriched uranium in current reactors, they will be able to use depleted uranium or natural uranium, which are both abundant and cheap (and as safe as thorium in most respects, though their oxides are slow poisons [similar to lead]).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be clear, I\\\u0027m massively in favour of Thorium reactors, but it needs to be said that the Uranium reactors are (at this stage) a much more practical concern.
