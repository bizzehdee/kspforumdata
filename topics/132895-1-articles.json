So far I can create IVA props and move them about:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/E8s5g#47\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/E8s5g#47\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I ever get FreeIVA finished, I plan to make a customisable IVA mod.\u00A0It would use a node system on the control panels similar to part attachments, with the IVA panels having a number of slots available. For early craft, you\u0027d have to choose which instruments were the most important to you to fit within your panel\u0027s slots, available power and weight, but for later ones you could place have a gauge for every individual fuel tank and engine. Ideally you would have researchable instruments available on the tech tree, plus upgrades to capsules to provide more panel space for mounting instruments at the cost of weight and power consumption. You could start off with simple analogue instruments, on to single-purpose CRT screens, and eventually unlocking RPM\u0027s multifunction displays for full glass cockpits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt doesn\u0027t need to be limited to gauges either. Placement of seats for crew and passengers, as well as oxygen tanks and supplies for life support mods could be made possible. With FreeIVA you\u0027ll be able to travel around inside the capsule and use these items, or discover that you\u0027ve blocked yourself from getting to the hatches from the inside \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would be beyond amazing!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MatttheCzar","CreatedById":135304,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T06:35:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like the idea of putting down seats. \u00A0Imagine the kerbal clipping montstosities people would have. 74 kerbals in one Mk 1-2...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
