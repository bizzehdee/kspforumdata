Its called TD-25 Decoupler and is about twice as big as the fuel tanks, engines etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wierd thing is if I just switch that for the normal decoupler on my suborbitter rocket, the icons for Aerodynamics, Centre Of Thrust/Mass all just stay exactly the same , BUT when I try to launch it with the TD-25 the rocket gets to somewhere around 3000m high and starts to curve back down to earth gradually. If I switch back to the small decoupler and change nothing else it flies directly up without needing to be piloted at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow can I complete this mission?
