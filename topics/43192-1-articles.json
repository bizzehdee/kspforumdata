Small inline and radial fuel tanks have been done before but I was looking for other types of containers that carried some things that Kerbals crave when they\u0027re on break, like Snack food and cold drinks. Don\u0027t they ever have the munchies?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen and a rare flash of inspiration hit me. Why not CRATES! I haven\u0027t seen those in the game. How would they be delivered?

After all they\u0027re just a bunch of debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeing debris would the crates vanish as soon as I went back to the Tracking Station? During my practice runs they didn\u0027t remain around KSP Center and I was not reverting back either. Was it just a local thing? Maybe it was the Kerbals. But all 48 crates at once? This needs another, longer distant, test. I sent a ship to deliver some crates to my Mun base, flew the ship back to kerbin, then recovered it. I go back to the Tracking Station and select my Mun Base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I saw...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mEdM5XGh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022mEdM5XGh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYay! The crates do remain! But what would be even better would be to see them disappear one by one over time. I guess as I add more debris in game they\u0027ll eventually get deleted. Just like Kerbals were using them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn another note, how would you go about adding additional icons for stuff? We have icons for Ships, Rovers, Probes, Stations, Landers, Bases, and Debris.
