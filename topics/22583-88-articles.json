It is possible to do proper roll and pitch control in Unity, and the newer FS rotors do it by altering the pitch of the blades as they rotate around. There is wing code running on each blade. (It worked so well that by default I turned off adding real world speed into the math because it caused too much asymmetry of lift in anything but a dual rotor setup.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe older rotors do it by altering the thrustTransform angle instead of moving the thrust average position, but the effect is pretty much the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheels are a cheat, and I have never been a fan. You might notice reaction wheels are off or incredibly weak on the FS cockpits, because it doesn\u0027t let you simulate the actual effect of the rotors, or control surfaces and wing setup. Which for me is the whole fun of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the old and the new rotors have functioning hover (or did last time I checked, which is a while ago). Instead of checking the mass etc, which would not give the right result when at an angle or while not vertically stable, it checks the split second changes to vertical speed and compensates as needed. It does however require the engine be powerful enough to get you out of a jam. If it\u0027s not powerful enough to lift you at 50% throttle, it\u0027s probably not powerful enough to reliably hover your vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played with the fuel flow in a long time, so it\u0027s possible there are better solutions now for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pinguino132","CreatedById":145175,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T23:25:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello, i got a problem with Firespitter 7.3 when its loading it gets stuck at \u0022lancaster engine gear\u0022 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T14:57:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey I just popped by to ask a question about the FSbuoyancy module, I am thinking about making some pontoons that are animated so they are mounted on pistons that extend them down into the water (for amphibious craft) but I was just wondering if this was actually possible, since it says buoyancyVerticalOffset is determined by the Global axis, so would that mean its ride height on the water would remain the same deployed or undeployed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elove the mod by the way, the plugin introduces some of the most useful modules in the game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:59:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snjo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Snjo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI can\u0027t say I agree about the reaction wheel approach. It is possible to do proper roll and pitch control in Unity, and the newer FS rotors do it by altering the pitch of the blades as they rotate around. There is wing code running on each blade. (It worked so well that by default I turned off adding real world speed into the math because it caused too much asymmetry of lift in anything but a dual rotor setup.)\u003Cp\u003EThe older rotors do it by altering the thrustTransform angle instead of moving the thrust average position, but the effect is pretty much the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReaction wheels are a cheat, and I have never been a fan. You might notice reaction wheels are off or incredibly weak on the FS cockpits, because it doesn\u0027t let you simulate the actual effect of the rotors, or control surfaces and wing setup. Which for me is the whole fun of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the old and the new rotors have functioning hover (or did last time I checked, which is a while ago). Instead of checking the mass etc, which would not give the right result when at an angle or while not vertically stable, it checks the split second changes to vertical speed and compensates as needed. It does however require the engine be powerful enough to get you out of a jam. If it\u0027s not powerful enough to lift you at 50% throttle, it\u0027s probably not powerful enough to reliably hover your vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t played with the fuel flow in a long time, so it\u0027s possible there are better solutions now for sure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI said it is quick and dirty solution, not a proper one \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked Firespitter again, heli rotors works just fine, hovering function too. But there is issues with collision meshes. nuFAR use those to create voxalizations. Some of parts, like landing gears are not voxelized properly. Heli rotor for example, have voxalization only for one pair of blades, when you increase number of rotor blades, those are not recognized properly by FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso heli rotor, when you crashland heli on port or starboard side and engine is still runing, rotor blades go trough ground without collision at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably KAX use only some part of FS mod and wing code for blades are not properly included trough unity functions. With overhelming changes to aero system, for both stock aero and FAR, lately it is probably not easy to maintain changes for all parts trough proper code. If you need to use cheats (reaction wheels) to make something to work at all considering gameengine limits and time needed to make it work properly, then why not ? Regular user will probably never know difference if pitching works trough wing code or trough other hacks as long it is works for gameplay purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand your concerns, I\u0027m also all for realism as much as possible, but if you are short in free time to maintain this mod at all, you will need from time to time to make some shortcuts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, thanks for maintain this mod.
