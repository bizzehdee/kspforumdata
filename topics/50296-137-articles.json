Sure, on Kerbin where I have lots of practice, I don\u0027t need it, but I haven\u0027t ever tried a parachute anywhere else, and I could definitely see the attraction in having a handy dandy warning to tell me when it\u0027s safe to open my chutes on e.g. Duna (whose atmospheric composition is quite different), since I have no real idea based on my Kerbin experiences.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T07:48:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd by the way MartGonzo, before you ever even THINK of telling me what you think this mod is \u0027obviously\u0027 geared towards, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eon any given day, this thread is liable to have half of its posters complaining that reentry is not hot enough and the other half that it\u0027s too hot. \u003Cem\u003EOn stock Kerbin with stock aerodynamics!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you think you can do better, then fork the mod and name it \u0027MartGonzo\u0027s Deadly Reentry\u0027 (or Lukewarm Reentry, whatever) and then you get to do the balancing act.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mecki","CreatedById":116929,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T07:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding DeadlyReentries RealChute behavior:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould it be possible to disallow chute deployment when the speed is too high?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd to also only deploy when the speed is safe when the chute is armed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be a great addition!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MartGonzo","CreatedById":65764,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-27T07:56:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EHeat multipliers are too high.
