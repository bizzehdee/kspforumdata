I know the actual altitudes, and how to get there. The problem is, the predicted altitude for the periapsis upon entering an SOI never matches with what actually ends up occuring. On my first attempt on Eve, I brought the predicted PE to 60 km, but the hyperbola ended up passing through the planet itself. No problem, I\u0027d simply compensate for the planet\u0027s radius. This worked well enough for Eve, Jool, and Laythe. However, on a recent Duna mission, I attempted the same thing. Somehow, I ended up with a PE \u003Cem\u003Ehigher\u003C/em\u003E then what was predicted. Thinking I screwed up, I attempted to lower the PE from the same maneuver node. This ended up being even higher then before. I eventually had to resort to hyperediting the PE after an hour of frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my question is, what the heck is the predicted PE centered around?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rhoark","CreatedById":57151,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T14:52:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think there are just unpredictable hiccups when crossing SOI boundaries.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion","CreatedById":75111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T14:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rhoark\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rhoark\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think there are just unpredictable hiccups when crossing SOI boundaries.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis definitely tallies with my experience. Unfortunately, KSP can only resolve maneuvers and predictions to a certain degree of accuracy, especially when interplanetary distances are involved. The best thing to do is just make sure you check how the motion has changed as soon after you enter the body\u0027s SoI as possible, so you aren\u0027t deep in its gravity well and it only take a few m/s correction to make the necessary tweaks that are required.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-29T19:46:30Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2013 07:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by rodion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T15:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThese differences are caused by small arithmetic errors when swapping spheres of influence. Don\u0027t rely on just single burn, you need to apply corrections - at least right when you enter the SOI, but sometimes it\u0027s better to make a stop or two on the way.
