The lander works perfectly with one of the probes at the head.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027d thought that if I simply added a lander can to that craft, it would allow me to launch an unmanned lander. It lets me configure the ship that way by just removing the Kerbal, but as soon as I hit \u0022launch\u0022 it puts someone in there. Is there a way around this?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lukaszett","CreatedById":77230,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T09:56:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry launching by clicking directly on the launchpad instead of using the button in the vab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027ll open up a menu in which you can chose if you want to man a craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-28T10:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the VAB there are three blue buttons at the left part of the top of the screen.
