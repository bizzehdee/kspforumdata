But don\u0027t worry, cuz I\u0027ll also have MechJeb to land and maneuver for me, but the rest is in my hands. So send me some complicated designs and math equations (don\u0027t forget launch test vids, so I know how to fly it, obviously). Also, give feedback, cuz I need support, the good and the bad. So Come One Come All, and help me in my quest for solar domination!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote to self: don\u0027t tell anyone else of my plans. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T08:17:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can\u0027t land on Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hannu","CreatedById":60596,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T08:46:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you actually want? Probing of Jool\u0027s atmosphere do not demand equations, but if you want them, check links in alexmoon\u0027s porkchop plotting page for basics of orbital math. I made my own porkchop plotter with them and it works fine. You do not need equations even structural planning. KSP\u0027s physics is simple. You just put parts together and maneuver probe to Jool\u0027s vicinity and then to atmosphere. You need about 2000 m/s from 300 km orbit around Kerbin to collision at Jool (2500 m/s should be safe in any case, if you even try to use optimal transfer window). Solar panels would be destroyed immediately after opening in Jool\u0027s atmosphere, even at very low velocity, so put enough batteries or RTG\u0027s. Notice that transmitting of atmosphere analysis takes much energy. Jool\u0027s atmosphere is thick and dense. It takes several minutes to fall through so you have plenty of time to transmit scientific data. You do not even need parachutes and if you use them, you would be bored before crash. Jool has not landable or visible surface. You see through the planet, when you approach to zero height. When you are at about -250 m, your vessel explodes always.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
