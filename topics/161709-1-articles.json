But I\u0027ve come upon another issue in finding a mod that seems to have vanished, and I can\u0027t for the life of me remember the name of it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s not Hangar Extender, although it does something very similar. At the click of\u00A0a UI button with two arrows pointing out, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E walls/floor/etc would disappear, leaving just the grass to build upon. Clicking the UI again (however now the arrows would be pointing in) and the walls would reappear. I prefer\u00A0this method for\u00A0building large vehicles and would like to try and find this mod before having to use\u00A0Hangar Extender. That\u0027s just me being picky.\u00A0I have no screenshots of the actual UI button (unfortunately) but the icons looked as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://scontent-sjc2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/18952568_1557969367577512_3576771007554586933_n.jpg?oh=b0afd5cc6e4d6661b4a67071cdb66251\u0026amp;oe=59E9FCC6\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esuch\u003C/a\u003E.
