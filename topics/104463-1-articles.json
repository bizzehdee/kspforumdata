Good job, especially that you managed to keep TWR enough to actually land (this is an issue with most of my SSTOs that use ions (hard to get above 0.25 TWR on kerbin).\n\nI based the design off my take on the SR-72 blackbird, the wing style made for a fun plane to fly so i figured i better refine the design and make an SSTO out of it to really make it my own ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) As far as the TWR goes honestly i found getting it to take off while full of fuel yet not pull 20g turns and stall when out of fuel to be the hardest part, managed to make it so the centre of mass never moves so that was a bonus during the build stages at least.\n\nIn saying that i doubt it would ever fly in FAR or NEAR, it is 36 tons. \n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/eLwf0e7ZQ-0?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-21T00:15:02Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2015 12:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Roflcopterkklol**"}]}
