The ones that I have found seem to be for vrs. .23 or .90 and I have the current 1.0.5. I know that 1.1 is coming out sometime this year but I really would like to start getting someplace in the game. My problems arise mostly from trying to put outposts, with wheels, into orbit. Well, for that matter, anything that is bulky and a bit lopsided. I have thought about trying to use more Aspperagus? staging and maybe will have to build my bases in orbit or while landed at site. it I do that I realize that I need a rover type of deal to move parts around. I can not seem to figure out how to build one.\u00A0The ones I have made seem to fall apart the moment I test them on Kerbal. Kerplow and Kerblewie or kerplunk they all go.

I was able to reach the correct altitude (Apoapsis: 11,537,900 to 11,538,250 or so;\u00A0Periapsis: 1,503,890 to 1,503,100 or so)\u00A0with my spacecraft by using the low powered ion engines over a long period but it is on the wrong plane with the ascending node being 16.1 degrees and descending node being -16.1 degrees. When I am at the moon\u2019s altitude, I find I am well south of my target. How would I fix this?\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks,\u003Cbr\u003E\nMycroft\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I interpret your question correctly, you\u0027re asking how to change the ascending / descending nodes to 0.0 degrees. To do this, you want to make burns in either the normal or anti-normal directions when passing over a node. Set up a maneuver node and play around with it, you can learn a lot \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E. Also, I highly recommend checking out Scott Manley on YouTube. He does a ton of really great videos and I\u0027m sure you can find guides for anything KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
