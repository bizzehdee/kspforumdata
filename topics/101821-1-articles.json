If it didn\u0027t have a lot of risk to fail without having already advanced tech (nuclear thruster) or simplifying the whole things (exploiting Asteroid you can put unto orbit), it would get tedious fast.\n\nRealistically we would need far more advanced technology to make exploitation of space resources economically sound (not that the economy is intelligent but it\u0027s what we use).\n\nAnd that for the rarest materials like Platinum, else the rest isn\u0027t worth bringing back unless you can use in on place."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T01:02:57Z","Content":"I hope the new resource we\u0027re getting is going to be pretty rare on Kerbin, and have a high price when recovered."},{"CreatedByName":"QuantumInc","CreatedById":137889,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T03:31:35Z","Content":"I keep thinking one could have \u0022Kirbidium\u0022 as an analogue to Iridium, an element that\u0027s extremely rare on earth, but relatively common in asteroids.

Making money with ressources sounds good to me, but it would rly require some kind of new material implemented, an iridium or platinum analogue could be reasonable. \n\nFrom a realism point of view Xenon doesn\u0027t make sense. It\u0027s definetly not cheap, but it\u0027s produced by filtering redicuolus amounts of air here on earth (with massive energy consumption) just to get a ziny amount of it and as far as I know it\u0027s even rarer in other places... \n\nHow about selling fuel to customers in low kerbin orbit via contract? There have been proposals IRL by some companies to do that in LEO by establishing an unmaned mining operation on the surface of the moon. Not that this is likely to happen soon, but to me that sounds far more sane than literally burning tons of high tech equipment to extract a small amount of ore and land it on earth.\n\nI would think of this like a regular contract for satelite deployment, but in this case it requires you to have a vehicle with a certain amount of fuel in a specific orbit. The payoff needs be too low to generate profit with a regular launch. Those contracts could certainly be done with SSTO\u0027s by the rly experienced players, but I think it\u0027s not a problem since the next patch is likely to balance SSTO rockets anyway."},{"CreatedByName":"QPDO","CreatedById":104760,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T08:48:28Z","Content":"Those things are ALL implemented as mods already.

Simply put: there is a power requirement for kerbalkind (the amount is irrelevant) and the starting price of Ke-3 would be $100 a ton (or whatever, the number I picked was purely arbitrary); as the player brings back more and more Ke-3, the price per ton drops until it is no longer economical to bring it back. As the Ke-3 on Kerbin gets consumed, the price begins to rise again until it becomes economically viable to mine Ke-3 once more.\n\nIt has all the advantages of an economy without actually requiring one to exist, and the fact that it can be saturated eliminates the risk of exploitation. It also adds a lot of possibilities for gameplay expansion, both in the main game and in DLCs that pop out down the road: an economic incentive to explore beyond meandering from geome to geome for the sake of science points; and a futuristic resource for whenever the devs decide we\u0027re allowed to go beyond the Kerbin system.\n\nThe best part: it isn\u0027t required. A player can completely ignore it if they want to. Or, they can alternate between contracts and mining depending on their mood.
