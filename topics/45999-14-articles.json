They will most likely be able to help you more as they regularly talk about retexturing projects. You could also try and get ahold of SWDennis and see if he had similar problems making his parts. It could be you need some special settings in the config. Have you tried your modded parts with one of the shader mods that changes how KSP\u0027s lighting system works? If they work under those conditions you know it is an issue with the stock shaders. Also, all of the parts seem to be either light or dark, did you get any of the panels that were between shades?
