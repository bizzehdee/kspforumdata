I found that it is really, really sparse of stars. If this is an indication to what kerbals really observe in their sky, then I would have to say: Not in the same fashion as what we are used to. True they do have stars that are a constant, but when you take into account that there are just a couple handfulls up there, and that Kerbin\\\u0027s speed of rotation would introduce new factors, it makes me think they would probably have employed a tool different from a sextant or an octant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also makes me think it is quite possible that the Kerbol system sits further out on the edge of its galaxy than where Sol lies.
