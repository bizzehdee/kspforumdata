I never liked letting kerbals orbit forever until a rescue mission, and I want wasted time to come at a cost. One problem though: My motherships and bases, while self sufficient in terms of water, oxygen, and electricity, I always run low on food, and continuous resupply missions are both costly and boring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to extend TAC-LS, perhaps with a different mod, to somehow allow growing food or something else that allows for self sufficiency in that area as well?
