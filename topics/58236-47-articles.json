Only problem is that the part is using two ModuleEngineFX modules. So, my config only applies to the first. If you set it with indexes in MM (i.e. @MODULE[ModuleEngineFX],0 and @MODULE[ModuleEngineFX],1) only the first one will change fuel types in the VAB/SPH. Is there any way to use both \u0022engines\u0022 with variable fuels?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could simply restrict that engine to hydrolox (which would be appropriate) and that would work, but tech levels still wouldn\u0027t work unless I just set it to TL7. I believe that dtobi has two separate transforms for each \u0022engine\u0022 within the part, so I don\u0027t know if I can nuke the ModuleEngineFX nodes and start over without actually using two nodes (which just gives me the same issue). I\u0027m hoping you all will have some ideas. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-12T00:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EModuleEngineConfigs supports only one engine module per part.
