I would very much like to use Eve to finish off my science, and I want to send a probe. My general mission statement is: it cannot be manned, and must use Ion engines (cause I\u0027ve just unlocked them and they\u0027re still in the shrinkwrap), and must be able to do high and low orbit science. It should also be able to return from orbit to Kerbin (shouldn\u0027t be too difficult), and land if at all possible (I want full science marks, rather than transmitted, but I\u0027m carrying a transmitter if necessary anyway). So, I\u0027m wondering if anyone has any advice on probes and that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I have so far: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fjMRoyk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022fjMRoyk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s only one engine, but three gigantor arrays because I\u0027ve yet to figure out how to group three ions into a triangle configuration on the bottom, without using the massive tricoupler.
