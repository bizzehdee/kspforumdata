I had just taken off with my spaceplane, turned on the Lazor system to control attitude and bearing. I had set my bearing (heading) for 90 degrees and for a climb to 21000 meters. At about 15000 and over Mach 1.2, I wasn\u0027t on course anymore and I had stopped climbing, in fact I was starting to pendulum, but actually the swing was increasing. I\u0027ve had no problems with getting the craft to altitude before, and thought the Lazor system would help me to perform some long range flights, without me having to babysit.\u003Cp\u003EI have also had instances, where I had no keyboard control when I tried to recover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid you try this with one of the planes that comes with my mod?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Darkeldar","CreatedById":83293,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T15:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, I tried out the Vampire, and I used the lazor configuration on my craft. My craft still oscillated about \u002B/- 12 degrees from my chosen bearing making it difficult to climb to the altitude I wanted. Putting in desired altitude and bearing into the interface is an adventure in itself, as I can\u0027t just type in the values I desire, as I have to activate these settings to change them, then backspace and hit keys so I hopefully end up with the heading I want, not 10 or 220, while I\u0027m trying for 90 degrees.
