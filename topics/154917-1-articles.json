Instead, it would be used for upgrading the stats of current parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere would be 4 paths of research you can take: Cost, Pressure, Effect, and Capacity. Each path would have 5 research nodes, increasing in cost similarly to how the current tech tree does. Pressure would be for making parts increasingly resistant to extreme pressure (\u002B10% pressure resistant per level), cost would slightly lower the cost of parts (-2% cost per level), capacity would increase fuel tank capacity (\u002B5% fuel tank capacity per level), and effect would increase the effect of boosters and science instruments (\u002B5% booster power and science bonus per level).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blaarkies","CreatedById":153700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-13T04:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about all the stock-only challenges? Of course it would be stock then, but how does someone compare a top speed plane if one has upgrades and the others don\u0027t?...just kidding, that was the worst nit-picking i could achieve\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe upgrades, do they happen overall, or per part basis?
