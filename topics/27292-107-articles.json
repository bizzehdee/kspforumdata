Had to burn a little of the payload\u0027s fuel to acheive orbit; looking back over the numbers today, I see why - I put it on one of Temstar\u0027s Zenith Nova boosters and the payload mass was 117 tonnes (max payload capacity of the Nova is 110, so I should\u0027ve used a Supernova instead). Still, the numbers say the transfer stage has more than enough juice to reach Tylo, so I\u0027ll probably be heading that way come the next transfer window. My first foray to the Jool system.
