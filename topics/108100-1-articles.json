That means that if your interception is in the next orbit behind the waypoint it won\u0027t update. If it is in front it will update. A simple workaround is to place another maneuver node on the opposite side of your orbit to look half an orbit ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"quyxkh","CreatedById":78547,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T01:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Harry Rhodan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Harry Rhodan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP only calculates one orbit ahead.
