You\u0027ll probably also want a strut from the outboard stacks to the sides of the Command Pod. Nose cones if you wish; they shouldn\u0027t take too big of a chunk out of your delta-V. The LV-T45 should give you sufficient steering authority on the way up, so you shouldn\u0027t need aerodynamic surfaces (not that you have that many). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that this will get you up there. You\u0027ll still need to get back down again. I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E there\u0027s enough juice for that with this design (just leave the booster attached, swing around and burn a little bit to deorbit); going to depend on how well you fly it. So that: this is an SSTO rocket design, so watch your gee meter as you go up - throttle back when you get out of the green zone. Straight up to 10k, 090 at 45 degrees to 25k, then follow the navball. Go horizontal at 50k. Ordinarily for something this small I\u0027d say \u0022pack RCS\u0022 to deorbit, but you don\u0027t have that yet. If you decide to add an FL-T100 and an LV-909 for deorbiting (and a stack decoupler to ditch that for landing), make your fuel stacks three FL-T800s each (nine total) instead of what I said above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat should get you started - lemme know how it turns out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: Almost forgot. Now that you have them, add a pair of Z-100 Battery Packs to the sides of the Command Pod. You should last long enough to conduct your experiments, deorbit and open your chute that way. Might even be able to perform a spacewalk or two. Their mass is low enough that you\u0027re only talking about a ten m/s hit to your delta-V, tops.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T20:49:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 08:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T20:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOP, you\u0027d better be leaving some good rep for capi1301 here.
