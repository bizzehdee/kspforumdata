As Harv said the drag is modelled the same as the mass (and as posters above mention, this is added to the base part and seems working), the drag should be added to the base part (which is directionless if talking about a single part AFAIK). Unless parts now have a direction of drag/resistance and a direction for low drag. In which case, is the heat shield accidentally \u0022flipping\u0022 the games understanding of the direction of drag?\n\nMy guess from reading the new aero description is that the part does have drag. It is calculated before hand. The shield is then placed below the capsule which for reentry purposes is putting the drag ahead of the CoM since the capsules drag is occluded but it\u0027s mass isn\u0027t.
