Being able to rename vessels in flight! It would be great if this worked in both Flight and Map view modes. The method in the tracking center doesn\u0027t work, and that\u0027s not very convenient anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SoulCandy","CreatedById":225508,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T17:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a temporary workaround - I\u0027ve found that I can rename ships mid-flight in the Tracking Station, but only when I have them in Focus. It seems that Focus overrides where you\u0027re clicking in the dropdown menu, which is funny because I accidentally re-named a couple planets without realizing it at first.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
