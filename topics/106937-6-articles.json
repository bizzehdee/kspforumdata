They see aircraft flying unreasonably slowly, and naturally blame the drag settings. Naturally... but wrongly.\u003Cp\u003EThe drag is fine. Capsules slow down in reentry just right. (Heat does need fixed.) Airplanes in lower atmosphere slow down for landing just fine.

Not the drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1.0 physics.cfg, liftMultiplier = 0.038\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the 1.02 physics.cfg, liftMultiplier = 0.055\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a pretty big change. The values for liftDragMultiplier and bodyLiftMultiplier both changed as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a very easy experiment, I designed and flew a small, simple airplane in 1.02 aero, noted that it landed at a very slow EAS. Next I changed liftMultiplier to 0.038 and flew that same airplane. It took off and landed at faster airspeeds, subjectively felt like more of hot rod, and was overall \u003Cem\u003Emore fun to fly.\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ll leave the number crunching to smarter heads, and only say that changing that one lift value while leaving the drag at 1.02\u0027s setting just plain \u003Cem\u003Efelt\u003C/em\u003E right; it felt like how a little jet airplane is supposed to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOoooooh, so that\u0027s what felt wrong about flying spaceplanes!
