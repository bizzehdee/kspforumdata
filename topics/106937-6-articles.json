This is, as said, part caused by unrealistic reaction wheels (do not dare to criticise them :\u003C ), and otherwise the toughness of cockpit sections, which is generally quite a bit stronger than the fuselage. If you can get a horizontal touchdown with minimal vertical speed and avoid tumbling, which is again stabilized by our wonderful hercules level reaction wheels, then you can land at very high speeds on the even runway without dying.\n\nThink about the countless planes we all crashed during starts, and how often the crew sections would miraculously survive.
