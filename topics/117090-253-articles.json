I don\u0027t really understand how TCA\u0027s code works but my guess is that this would require some (non trivial) changes in both SSTU and TCA.  Best bet for now is probably not to use engine clusters.\n\u003E \n\nYeah, as TCA works by controlling different ModuleEngines on the craft, and not manipulating the per-transform thrust of any given module (or per gimbal transform), it would be....very difficult.... to get it working on the individual engines\u0027 in a cluster. \n\nI think the only way this could work is if the modules\u0027 manipulated the per-transform-thrust split in the engine module in combination with adjusting the main throttle for the module/part.  But I\u0027m unsure how well the stock code would cope with runtime adjustments to the thrust-splitting.\n\nEither way, not something that I will be implementing.
