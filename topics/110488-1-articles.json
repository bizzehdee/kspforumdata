But all the same, I feel like sharing it. This was also the first time I sent crew to another planet in career mode. Until now I had only ever done it with probes. \n\nThis was our mission briefing. \n\n[http://i.imgur.com/asd80G0.png](http://i.imgur.com/asd80G0.png)\n\nThe mission doesn\u0027t actually call for any of the fly-bys being manned, I\u0027m sure I could have done it with a probe, but I wanted to try for a manned craft. And while I was going to give a kerbonaut all that experience, why not bring all of them? I did feel bad for leaving Valentina behind, but she\u0027ll be on the mission that actually sets foot on Duna, so I\u0027ll leave the fly-by to the guys. I also included the science lab, partly so I could science spam on the way to the other planets, partly as a more realistic crew habitation module. I\u0027m sure if they all had to spend 5 years stuck in just the little 3-man capsule that they would go mad (in roleplay terms at least).\n\nThis is the ship I ended up using for lift-off. Quite costly, but the end rewards would make it well worth it.

But very quickly I realized this would be too dangerous, I wasn\u0027t lined up for a Gilly encounter and the amount of DeltaV needed to change course would strand us in interstellar space on the way home. \n\nSo we finished the Eve fly-by (with only the Minmus and Mun flybys left for when we got back home) and initiated some awkward return maneuvers. Sadly, I arrived in the Kerbin sphere of influence moving at around 4 km/s. This was too fast to break using our remaining fuel, so Jeb came up with a crazy/brilliant plan. Despite our lack of heat-shield, we would aerobreak just enough to be captured by Kerbin. After some tense moments and some scorch marks on the hull, we were in safe orbit. \n\nThis is the ship as it was when we finished the last fly-by.

[http://i.imgur.com/3Eu4Lgh.png](http://i.imgur.com/3Eu4Lgh.png)\n\nAnd the map to show our fly-by position. [http://i.imgur.com/PlkeT2t.png](http://i.imgur.com/PlkeT2t.png)\n\nOriginally I was going to send a recovery ship, since I didn\u0027t put a decoupler or heatshield on the craft itself (too heavy, I reasoned). But I figured... what the hell, let\u0027s bring the whole thing home. I had proved earlier that if the entry trajectory is shallow enough it shouldn\u0027t burn up.\n\nAll\u0027s looking good so far. [http://i.imgur.com/jtuys5i.png](http://i.imgur.com/jtuys5i.png)\n\nAfter more than 5 long years they make it back home with most of the ship intact (mostly...) [http://i.imgur.com/tiVfusK.png](http://i.imgur.com/tiVfusK.png)\n\nThey each upgraded to level 4 thanks to the experience and with the science lab I collected about 6000 science. Mission accomplished!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T16:22:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 04:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PTNLemay**"}]}
