That\u0027s all well and good, but we know that thinner atmospheres are well-simulated in KSP, and they are common throughout the real-life solar system. Perhaps Duna could remain as it is, but it would be nice for some of the other bodies to have trace atmospheres, just to spice up the game a bit. It could be neat for, say, Tylo to have an atmosphere like 0.1% as thick as Kerbin\u0027s. It won\u0027t slow you much on a vertical descent, but if you make a few low passes it could make landing slightly easier. Also, it might just give the horizon a cool glow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-15T21:24:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2014 09:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by thereaverofdarkness\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-15T21:41:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgreed, I would like to see Tylo have a thin atmosphere.

I hope that gets made at some point. It would be awesome to make vacuum landings on the mountains, then cannonball-parachute down into the valleys. You could save fuel getting back up the mountainside with a crawler-hopper that rolls up as high as it can, then rockets the rest of the way up. If you\u0027re really adept, you could make small rocket jumps to breach gaps in navigable terrain, and perhaps make it up into the upper atmosphere or even to the mountaintop without burning much fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought it would be neat to have a very large planet with a thin atmosphere but with a large scale height, so it would take a while to get past it. That would give you more time to use it for slowing on entry, though could make takeoff significantly more expensive. 10kpa should be plenty. Large planets at all would be nice, since currently Eve is the biggest one you can land on, and it\u0027s barely bigger than Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
