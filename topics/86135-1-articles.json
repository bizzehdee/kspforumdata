You\u0027re more likely to lose money on them than to gain it. If you can get a series going like 1. fly a basic rocket 2. establish orbit 3. mun landing 4. minmus landing 5. duna landing you\u0027ll be swimming in money. The system does not work in such a way that you have to save up money for big missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a few other tips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. with explore missions, transmit the crew report from the surface immediately, go back to the space centre. Maybe there will already be a \u0022plant flag\u0022 mission ready for you to complete instantly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. With kerbal recovery missions you can get good money if you\u0027re down on funds. Once you\u0027re near the kerbal, press [ or ] to take control of them and get them back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Look at the part test contracts to see if there\u0027s some in there with big payouts, and then look if it\u0027s a realistic mission. I once got some 200-300k for testing the nuclear engine near either mun or minmus, which you can imagine is really easy. However, sometimes it can be something like testing the mainsail near the mun so watch out for that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. You don\u0027t have to stage a part for the first time to complete part test contracts.
