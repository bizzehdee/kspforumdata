Then I went to career mode and was off to a good start using less complicated rockets. Finally, i have spent the last 8 hours trying to get even a slightly more complicated ship to remain stable to no avail. Ive searched threads and have seen the suggestions to turn SAS on. However, from what I can tell, SAS is something you cant get until you unlock quite a few research levels to get to. But with the trouble I have putting together stable ships I will never advance that far in career mode. On a side note, I did go to sandbox mode and attached an SAS ring to a few ships I had previously tried to put together and this made the flights almost easy. Ive messed with with the center of mass and all that alot and just cant seem to pull off a ship thats gets me over 20,000 meters elevation in career mode. Seems almost impossible to get anywhere from scratch in career mode, does anyone agree with this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceExplorer","CreatedById":138160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T22:50:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey fistfullofnails and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have only dabbled in career a bit (sandbox is my favorite) but I would suggest that you build some more basic ships and complete science/contracts that way. After you have done so, unlock the nodes that have fins/wings or even the SAS module itself, thus allowing you to build bigger crafts to complete bigger missions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also suggest that you pop over to the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/54-Tutorials\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ETutorials\u003C/a\u003E section of the forum, there is some really great stuff out there to help you out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope to see you around, and all the best with your career save! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fistfullofnails","CreatedById":144017,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T03:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIve built basic ships to the point where I cannot complete anymore missions without a more advanced ship. To unlock the SAS module, I will have to complete three more research levels, which to me, seems pretty impossible with what I have. I have fins as well and have tried them in many configurations. Thanks for the advice, ill head over to the tutorials section again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
