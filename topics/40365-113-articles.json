Been having a very bug free experience thus far until now. I built a small space station with a stack of 10 computer cores, an antimatter power system, and an auxiliary nuke power section. I sent two such stations to low Moho orbit. I\u0027ve upgraded the top three computer cores on both stations (so 6 upgraded computer cores total) and they both show 6 science per day on each computer core. Sounds awesome and should generate a very tasty amount of science. However, the issue I\u0027ve run across is that neither station will generate science while not focused. My other science stations (just a lab with kerbals orbiting various planets and moons) generate science perfectly while not focused; I\u0027m only having issues with these two unmanned stations and only while not focused. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve considered it was a power issue, since the small nuke power section is just a little underbudget on thermal power generation, so thermal power will drop to zero slowly over time. However, I\u0027ve turned the antimatter reactor on, changed to the other station and then time warped and still have the same issue. The antimatter reactor on that test has plenty of antimatter, the reactor is using antimatter and is generating a bit of thermal power (only operating at like 0.01-0.03% capacity). So that station should have had all the power it needed for the test time warp. When I went back to it after a day of timewarping while focused on the other station, I gained no science. I did notice a signigicant portion of antimatter burned, so all the basic and upgraded computer cores were getting full power. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is a picture of my MSOSC station: \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/pAwC8Na.png\u0022 alt=\u0022pAwC8Na.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am getting a few lines of the following text on debug printout when swapping to the MSOSC stations: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Log]: dT is NaN! tA: 5.11966133117676, E: 0, M: 0, T: NaN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Log]: dT is NaN! tA: 3.7263018488884, E: 0, M: 0, T: NaN\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a unifying station under development that will provide a ton more nuke and antimatter power that I will dock my smaller MSOSC stations to and this unity module has a lab on it so kerbals can reprocess the nuke fuels as needed.
