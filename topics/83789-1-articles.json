Your best option is to come in engines first, Not the most ideal, but it will put your engines in a position where you can use them to slow down. Another option is to put a couple of radial chutes on it and use them high in the atmosphere to reorient your craft (Have them semi-deploy at a really high altitude and fully deploy at a really low altitude and then cut them before they fully deploy).
