Last time I was here was pre-Science.\n\nAnyway, I am having a great deal of difficulty collecting the Science that the window says I should get. For example:\n\n- I send my rocket up with a Science Jr Module and Observe the Bay.\n- The window says that I should get 25 Science by collecting, or 12 (I think) for Transmitting.\n- So I click the green clipboard to collect it.\n- I then send my Kerbalnaut out on EVA and take a report (and Clipboard it).\n- I then click the capsule, and choose to Store the results. (The green text seems to say that it is only storing the EVA report?)\n- I then splashdown and recover.\n\nNo Science gained.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nI feel I have left a LOT of Science on the table. I have progressed to unlocking the entire 3rd \u0022vertical column\u0022 (has 5 items), but progress has been very slow - I think most of it has been from cruising around KSC for the \u0022easy\u0022 Science.\n\nAnyway, what probably very simple thing am I missing?\n\nThank you\n\n![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T23:17:27Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 11:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by vonKerbin**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kesolo","CreatedById":142887,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:45:33Z","Content":"About Science Jr and other science components (termomether, atmospheric pressure ecc...) to collect data you need one of those 2 options:\n\n1st recover all science part when you land on Kerbin\n\nor\n\nright click on each science part with a kerbal and select option collect data, so at this point you can detach those parts and have all science data inside your main capsule.\n\nHave fun!"},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:17:36Z","Content":"If you want a good walkthrough about how to do this I suggest watching Scott Manley\u0027s new series where he is laying out how to do most basic operations:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEkUeJRCh083UT-Lq5ZIKI75\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIt is especially good at showing how quickly you can start to access different parts of the game and that making mistakes doesn\u0027t necessarily end your game."},{"CreatedByName":"vonKerbin","CreatedById":68959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T14:28:00Z","Content":"Hmm, I have been watching (and re-watching, and re-watching ...)
