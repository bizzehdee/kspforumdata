You need to know what the IP address is of the machine you\u0027re running the server on for him to connect. The IP 127.0.0.1 is likely a root/local ip which works the same as using the Localhost as the IP address. To find out the IP address of your machine on a LAN you need to up a command prompt and type ipconfig you\u0027re looking for you IPv4 Address. It should be something like 192.168.32.2 it usually starts with 192.168 but he last to numbers vary based on the type of lan and how many computers you have on the lan. If he\u0027s in a separate house altogether you\u0027ll need to visit a site like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.nirsoft.net/show_my_ip_address.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.nirsoft.net/show_my_ip_address.php\u003C/a\u003E. Also, if you\u0027re in a separate house from your brother you\u0027ll likely need to activate connection routing on your router which is done by setting up a virtual server in your router configurations.
