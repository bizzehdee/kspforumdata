I put 2 wing hardpoints ontop of each other on top of the cockpit (the ones that aren\\\u0027t decouplers) and put the usual parachute ontop of those. There was also a landing gear wheel underneath the ASAS and 2 AV-R8\\\u0027s on the cockpit itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHit space, the decoupler blows, the parachute deploys. Because of its height above the point it is decoupled from the parachute pulls the cockpit upwards over the body of the plane. i tested it at 50ms^-1 on the runway and the cockpit survived fine, tried it at 150ms^-1 on the runway again and once again the cockpit survived (but the asas module still attached didn\\\u0027t), 200ms^-1 on the runway I couldn\\\u0027t hit but at a height approximately 10 metres off the ground it survived ejection from about 220ms^-1. I think the winglets help keep the cockpit gliding for a little bit even with the parachute dragging it. Only tests I\\\u0027ve done that it failed was an upside down ejection from approx 50meters and an ejection at 500m from a 10000m dive, upside down was obvious, it just flicked into the ground, the dive god knows what happened, more research needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T20:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00226677\u0022 data-cite=\u00226677\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo bad its not stock, then it would be precisely 42 times cooler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy, stock is lame :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENever understood the appeal of purists... ugly, ungainly creations abound.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
