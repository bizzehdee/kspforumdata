Expand the Mice and other point devices category and see if the Joystick shows up there with a yellow triangle by it. If not it may be under unknown devices. Then you can see if the drivers are not being installed by windows. You\\\u0027ll have to go to the manufacturers page and download the product drivers manually."},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T13:44:18Z","Content":"Unfortunately, OP, no. This is not the first ejection system. I\\\u0027ve been doing this since before the SPH came out. I used the radial parachutes and would fired the pod away from the plane with the ullage boosters if I had to. Every one of my planes has an ejection system because when I\\\u0027m test piloting, I\\\u0027m never sure if it will be able to land."},{"CreatedByName":"6677","CreatedById":890,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T14:01:32Z","Content":"Too bad its not stock, then it would be precisely 42 times cooler.\n\nMy current spaceplane testbed has an abort feature of sorts anyway, I experimented with powered cockpit removal but I now prefer my current method, I have the non stackable plane cockpit (the one that looks like it belongs on the front of a fighter), behind it is my ASAS module then a decoupler. I put 2 wing hardpoints ontop of each other on top of the cockpit (the ones that aren\\\u0027t decouplers) and put the usual parachute ontop of those. There was also a landing gear wheel underneath the ASAS and 2 AV-R8\\\u0027s on the cockpit itself.\n\nHit space, the decoupler blows, the parachute deploys. Because of its height above the point it is decoupled from the parachute pulls the cockpit upwards over the body of the plane. i tested it at 50ms^-1 on the runway and the cockpit survived fine, tried it at 150ms^-1 on the runway again and once again the cockpit survived (but the asas module still attached didn\\\u0027t), 200ms^-1 on the runway I couldn\\\u0027t hit but at a height approximately 10 metres off the ground it survived ejection from about 220ms^-1. I think the winglets help keep the cockpit gliding for a little bit even with the parachute dragging it. Only tests I\\\u0027ve done that it failed was an upside down ejection from approx 50meters and an ejection at 500m from a 10000m dive, upside down was obvious, it just flicked into the ground, the dive god knows what happened, more research needed."},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-24T20:54:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Too bad its not stock, then it would be precisely 42 times cooler.\n\nWhy, stock is lame :/\n\nNever understood the appeal of purists... ugly, ungainly creations abound."}]}
