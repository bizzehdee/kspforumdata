In essence it\u0027s no difference than realizing that your senses are fallible and things are not as they seem. Compare it to knowing that \u0027movies are not real\u0027. Ofcourse while dreaming the realization is a bit more.. shall we say immersive. As to controlling the dream once you know it is in fact a dream, this isn\u0027t so outlandish a concept either. Consider these sort of figures: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Dancer\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_Dancer\u003C/a\u003E where the big question is \u0027DO THEY SPIN CLOCK- OR COUNTERCLOCKWISE???\u0027 The answer is neither, since it\u0027s a 2d figurine. The perceived direction is controlled only by you. Once you realize this you may be able to \u0027control\u0027 which way the figurine appears to turn. There you have it, conscious control of the perceived world. Again, in a \u0027dreamworld\u0027 such control is a bit more immersive \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChances are that you\u0027ve been lucid dreaming before, or even often, but you don\u0027t remember it. If you want to get into it (and it\u0027s something anyone can learn and practice, and it\u0027s pretty fun!) the first step is to learn remembering your dreams. There\u0027s no night where you don\u0027t dream. Doesn\u0027t exist. So for every night that you\u0027ve got no recollection of a dream, you\u0027ve forgotten one. If that was one where you were lucid and did all kinds of awesome stuff, too bad! One good trick is to keep a dream journal and record your dreams directly upon waking. It doesn\u0027t have to be page long prose, just a few keywords will suffice. You\u0027ll probably remember instances where you wake up from a vivid dream, remembering it all but having it slip away in but a few minutes. In this case, lie still in bed, move as little as possible while consciously repeating the memories to yourself over and over again until you\u0027re confident you\u0027ll make it to your dream journal without forgetting them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you\u0027re consisently remembering your dreams, it\u0027s time to start getting lucid. The key to doing that is to somehow realize that you\u0027re dreaming, that the world you currently reside in is NOT in fact real. It sounds almost impossible (most outlandish things in dreams appear normal, after all) but fortunately there are a few tricks. An obvious one is jumping out of a window and seeing if you die, but for obvious reason that\u0027s not quite so good a test (I did do it once, and fortunately it did turn out to be a dream! Funnily enough I did then dream that I fell REALLY HARD and hurt myself good). Naturally what exactly works varies from person to person but here are a few things to get you started that work with about 90% of people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Machinery: any kind of technology often straight up doesn\u0027t work in dreams or performs other than it should. If you find yourself in a car that doesn\u0027t control as it should, facing a printer that will print nothing but water or in front of a fridge that contains only pick elephants of sugar you might be dreaming. Make it a point to consciously consider if the device you\u0027re handling is performing a reasonable function. If you wear a digital watch have a look at it every now and then, does the time make sense? If not (say: 7778:22 or a picture of a tree or something) then you might be dreaming!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Consistency: In a dream things are more fluid than in reality. If you suspect you\u0027re dreaming, inspect something, look away and then inspect it again. Has it changed? You\u0027re probably dreaming. It helps if you try to mentally change something. For instance look at a bush and see normal leaves, look away and look back and try to fully expect observing square, yellow or otherwise outlandish leaves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you get more practiced it will usually be enough to just routinely think \u0027Am I dreaming?\u0027 If you can\u0027t recall a sequence of events leading up to what you\u0027re experiencing now, you might be! But in the beginning it\u0027s easier to go with \u0027tangible\u0027 tests. It might help to wear a digital watch of the kind that beeps every hour or so and make it a point to do a reality check then. Keep the watch by your bed as well and hopefully the beep qill cue the check whilst dreaming and.... bingo!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you\u0027ve done one of these things and now you suspect you\u0027re dreaming, what now?! You need to make sure. Don\u0027t immediately start going nuts or what have you (yes, you\u0027re gonna go nuts). MAKE SURE first. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I like to do is try a small supernatural feat. Say jumping up into the air and not falling down. No superman jumps, just hovering a few inches above the ground. Or try and change the ambient lighting by snapping fingers, trying to raise or lower the sun. Teleporting somewhere else. Spawning things or people. Blasting a fireball. Whatever floats your boat. If that works, then you\u0027re sure. Go nuts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve noticed is that (for me at any rate) doing anything supernatural is very much like in the movie \u0027The Matrix\u0027. It took me many times to learn how to consistently be able to fly and such. Along the way I faceplanted LOTS. You have to really really believe the things you want to do. Your mileage may vary obviously, but I\u0027ve adopted one of two paradigms; One is of magic, where I draw mana from a pool inside me and use it to cast spells or do whatever and the other is more Sci-fi, where I pull up an overlay over the dream and do whatever I want to do through there. They sometimes work, sometimes not. Experiment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you do get into it, you\u0027ll learn to recognize in what stage of sleep you\u0027re in whilst dreaming. Some have the dream be more detailed, or lit/unlit. Some even have dreams with only partial sensory immersion. Again, your mileage may vary but I found that as I approached waking up my dream would \u0027lose resolution\u0027 or horizon. Meaning things would become blurry and bland and I couldn\u0027t see so far anymore. This could sometimes be partially fixed by concentrating or spinning really fast (a trick to change scenery, or teleport). Maybe I was postponing waking up, maybe not. Quite hard to tell really \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne more note before I\u0027ll conclude this rambling post, and this is a good trick. It turns out that MANY MANY dreams, lucid or not, actually begin with a \u0027false awakening\u0027. That is, you dream that you wake up. Make it a habit to do a reality check immediately after waking up ALWAYS. I can\u0027t count the times how often I\u0027ve \u0027woken up\u0027 and it wasn\u0027t actually true. I\u0027ve counted strings of fake wake-ups as long as fifteen. It\u0027s really the best, when you think you have to get up to go to work and it turns out that NOPE, still asleep, still got godmode LETS GO AGAIN. Yep. It\u0027s fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis might warrant a thread of its own but heck, it\u0027s sleep related \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Deadpangod3\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, how long would it take to do all this?\u003Cp\u003EAnd would it be possible to bring things I think up in consciousness Ie some kind of massive city into this \u0022dream world\u0022? And if I were to like paint a building in this city, then wake up and dream again the next night would I come back to where I was or would it be like restarted?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould I also be able to like be in one city like dream, then think myself in some other theme, and everything would change to that theme?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DonLorenzo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DonLorenzo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThose are things that are rather impossible to tell you, as I\u0027m sure they vary a lot from person to person. I can tell you my experience though:\u003Cp\u003E1. From deciding I wanted to do lucid dreaming to having my first lucid dream? less than a week I think. Motivation is a big part here. If it sounds great to you and you\u0027re looking forward to it, chances are it\u0027s gonna happen. This is one of those things that\u0027s really \u0027all in the mind\u0027. Make yourself determined to do this. Decide before you go to bed \u0027I\u0027m going to have a lucid dream tonight!\u0027 You can even decide in advance what it\u0027s going to be about. Does this work 100% No, you\u0027ll find most of these things don\u0027t. But they do work. Learning how to consistently remember dreams was very gradual for me. It just slowly got better and better. I\u0027m sure I still forget many awesome adventures. One thing that does help a lot is getting enough sleep and not being too stressed out. Take your time to sleep. It sounds weird maybe but don\u0027t watch TV or be on the computer right up until the moment you go to bed. Tuck in, turn out the lights and take a few minutes to relax, maybe do some meditation where you focus on what and how you want to dream about. Then sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. As to what is possible, pretty much all you can imagine. Don\u0027t expect it to be like a game though where you turn on godmode and everything works the first time. Many things take practice, just like in the real world. It\u0027s just that they\u0027re pure mental skills and tricks with no real-world counterpart. Many of it will be completely new and won\u0027t come natural at all. Or it might. No way to tell really. For me it took lots of time to learn how to fly, and once I did I thought it was awesome. That was until I went bungee-jumping in the real world once, from that point on my dream-flights had the extra sensation of rushing air over my face and body. I suppose it got added because I experienced it once for real. Never did do that on purpose. It also varies from dream to dream. Sometimes I\u0027ll walk around like everything is a simulation, spawning people, shaping the world and doing things I couldn\u0027t very well write about in public. Other times I try that and it doesn\u0027t work. Yet other times the lucidity is on again/off again. I\u0027ll be lucid for a bit, but then something will happen in the dream and I\u0027ll forget that it\u0027s a dream. Then later I might \u0027snap out of it\u0027 again. Or not. It varies. Something that sometimes happens to me is that I\u0027ll get some sort of semi-lucidity. I know that I\u0027m dreaming, but am still not really in control. The narrative goes on, but instead of active control I get a weird sort of precognition of a few seconds. I always wonder afterwards if the dream is \u0027decided\u0027 by some non-lucid part of me and I get a peek behind the scenes, or if the precognition is a fugasi and it\u0027s actually what\u0027s driving the narrative.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. As for consistency from dream to dream, for me there\u0027s virtually none, apart from within myself. I\u0027ll remember tricks that worked and tricks that didn\u0027t. I\u0027ll try new stuff, or repeat old stuff that was fun. But the actual environments, characters, goings on and so forth are usually fresh every time. So what you\u0027re describing of building a vibrant and persistent dream world that you can visit and return to seems impossible to me. Yet if your memory is good and consistent enough perhaps you can do it. The only way I could imagine that is upon reaching lucidity to quickly rebuild that particular world. Then again it\u0027s not something I\u0027ve tried, and as it\u0027s all in the mind anyway; if you decide that dream X is going to be permanent, who knows, it might be!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturning to how long it would take you to \u0027learn\u0027 this stuff, that answer would range from instant to infinity. I\u0027d hazard a guess that if you try and do those \u0027reality checks\u0027 often (find cues that happen a lot, say a background noise, passing through a door or something mundane like that and do one everytime you encounter that) you\u0027ll have your first lucid dream within days. It\u0027s different for everyone though and it might take longer. Chances are you\u0027ll be so excited when it first happens you\u0027ll immediately wake up due to the adrenaline surge. If that happens, do remember to do your post-wakeup check, it could be a fake wakeup!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbove all, see it as a fun thing to do whilst sleeping. Some people might tell you that \u0027you\u0027re messing with unknown and dangerous energies\u0027 or that you should \u0027watch out that you don\u0027t become lost and never wake up\u0027 or \u0027make sure not to kill yourself in the dream!!\u0027. I\u0027ve heard it all, and after ample experimentation I\u0027m fairly sure there\u0027s no black hoodoo magic that\u0027s gonna kill you. It\u0027s just a fun trick. Like making the dancer spin counter- or clockwise. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tried to outline a rough spectrum of principles and tricks, there\u0027s a lot more nuance to be had in that regard. Just enter \u0027lucid dreaming\u0027 into google and find many forums, sites, books and even gadgets to help you lucid dream (there\u0027s apps that make your phone whisper \u0027You\u0027re dreaming!\u0027 every now and then. Or headbands that flash lights in your eyes. I\u0027ve never dabbled but hey, could work!) One thing I found is to read as much about it and other people\u0027s experiences, gets you in the right mood and you might have your first tonight \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there\u0027s that.

Now what I do is take some nice scenery and just relax. No smartphones, no facebook, no phone calls, just me and my thoughts (and the occasional dream oddity), which can be very nice. Sometimes (but not often!) it\u0027s the other way around where I crave some action and excitement and I\u0027ll do that. One of the first things I tried ever was.. ahem.. spawning a willing and gorgeous lady. When that worked I thought why stop at one? In the end I had a warehouse full of them and things got kind a little out of control. Sometimes my control won\u0027t be complete. For instance I\u0027ve tried changing the scene by teleporting somewhere or just outright changing everything. Didn\u0027t work that time.

One thing I predict you will be blown away by at first is how vivid and, well, REAL things seem. Dream memories are often fuzzy, not so while it\u0027s going on.

Now I\u0027ve never experienced teleporting, fireballs, unassisted flying and the like, so this goes more for the smaller chunks of things. For instance I have experienced fire, and know how radiated heat feels. I know what falling through the air feels like, I know what jumping feels like and I know what different places feel like so going between one and the other isn\u0027t really a thing. What I\u0027m trying to say is that for me all those amazing and extraordinary things in dreams are all cobbled together out of bits and pieces of actual experiences, which I think isn\u0027t so surprising.
