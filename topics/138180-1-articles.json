Heat was well in hand, and I was slowing down nicely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly, I started slowing down much faster; I thought it was peculiar, but I attributed it to being lower into the atmosphere leading to increased drag. Then, when I reached a velocity of 1,500 m/s, I started accelerating again. Not gently, as though air resistance was gone, but quite forcefully; the G-meter maxxed out, and in a matter of seconds I was back up to orbital velocity, and my ship exploded from the heat. The ship in question, at the time, was just a Stayputnik, a couple of goo canisters, batteries, parachutes and thermometers, with a mat bay and heat shield slapped on the bottom, and micro legs for landing, if it matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reiterate; during reentry I started accelerating toward the ground at 10\u002B G\u0027s. This wasn\u0027t my craft being too heavy for a gentle reentry, it was the almighty hand of God slapping me down toward the planet\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Konrad-Brabus","CreatedById":165005,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T05:25:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have almost the same problem, my space plane starts accelerating during reentry when i hit 68km and if the angle is too steep the ship will explode due to heating, also, the ship starts tumbling without control as soon as the bug kicks in, the more i try to control it, the more it tumbles, and the more it tumbles and moves around crazily the more acceleration is experienced, i reached 6800m/s once before exploding at 65km from Kerbin\u0027s surface... Sooo what is going on? How to fix this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-31T07:32:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat sounds like this issue:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8974\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://bugs.kerbalspaceprogram.com/issues/8974\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other players who saw it seemed to be experiencing upward forces, rather than downward.
