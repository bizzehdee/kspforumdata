First off I really like the new parts as it allows me to build rockets that are aesthetically more similar to real life on a vanilla file. But now to the question.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recently noticed a bunch of Asteroids all in close proximity of Kerbin, yet I actually have zero idea of what to do with them outside of landing and and capturing them, which is not looking like it\u0027s going to be easy due to them all being on rather unusual paths. The tracking station seems to be picking up any that are within a reasonable distance of Kerbin but no further, obviously these will eventually leave Kerbin at which point I figure they will no longer be tracked. So is there some way for me track these as they travel further into the system? I also read somewhere on this forum about the Asteroids have an orbit path inlcuding Ap and Pe, yet I have none of these readouts coming from them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help here would be really appreciated as I\u0027m having a bit of trouble understanding how to start with these floating rocks as I haven\u0027t followed this update much.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Greenfire32","CreatedById":36705,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T16:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kerbonautical\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kerbonautical\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethese will eventually leave Kerbin at which point I figure they will no longer be tracked.

I think Squad/NASA have done a really good job in introducing these in a pretty non-intrusive way. Yes, there are many more of them on Kerbin-intercept than there should be, otherwise we\u0027d have to wait (game) years to see one.
