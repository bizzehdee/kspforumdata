If mouse moves away or the camera is rotated, menus pop back to follow their part as usual.\n\nThis plugin simply solves one small problem so there is no plan to extend it further in any way.\n\n**License:** MIT\n\n**Download:** [MenuStabilizer.zip](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bhpbla6zqszs8cj/MenuStabilizer.zip?dl=1)\n\n[Source on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/angavrilov/909ae0026d5fa5adf261/)\n\nTo install, just put the dll file anywhere in GameData."},{"CreatedByName":"Clythoris","CreatedById":116254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:26:14Z","Content":"Cool."},{"CreatedByName":"bmyers831","CreatedById":113233,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T15:42:24Z","Content":"Great idea, can you put this on CKAN?"},{"CreatedByName":"NBZ","CreatedById":117892,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:36:50Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Great idea, can you put this on CKAN?\n\nI second that!"},{"CreatedByName":"DirkLarien","CreatedById":91662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T16:45:28Z","Content":"this should be stock"},{"CreatedByName":"Zorbaq","CreatedById":134243,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:33:04Z","Content":"\u0022...and there was much rejoicing.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T22:50:57Z","Content":"This is one of those tiny little \u0022quality of life\u0022 mods that you see and then you think \u0022Why doesn\u0027t stock do that?\u0022\n\nIt\u0027s so much more user-friendly, and I have a feeling that the code behind it is less complex than the stock right click UI pop-up, since it doesn\u0027t need to move around the screen.\n\nSo, why does the more complex, harder-to-use thing get picked over the simpler, easier solution?
