If you finally reach damn high speeds, over 2000ms, You have the problem, that you collide into the terrain. To solve that problem which already occurs at 800 m/s you can put your aerodynamic quality to minimal, then you can achieve speeds over 2000ms easily with sepatrons. But when you start to slow down, you crash into the ground again, but how can you fix that? I already put everything on the lowest settings and put some back to see if it\u0027s changing something. What can you do about it? Suggest me Mods or other solutions to fix that.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Stratzenblitz75 already posted something about it:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/160697-the-speed-of-ground-a-study-into-how-ksp-terrain-colliders-handle-land-vehicles-with-high-magnitudes-of-velocity/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/160697-the-speed-of-ground-a-study-into-how-ksp-terrain-colliders-handle-land-vehicles-with-high-magnitudes-of-velocity/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-30T18:29:26Z\u0022 title=\u002203/30/2019 06:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 30, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by TiTaNiUmCrYstAL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-30T18:34:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Game play Questions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swjr-swis","CreatedById":152460,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-30T18:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223572165\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022183276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221553969922\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022196544\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TiTaNiUmCrYstAL\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n30 minutes ago, TiTaNiUmCrYstAL said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut when you start to slow down, you crash into the ground again, but how can you fix that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s not much to fix how the KSP engine handles the collider/wheel physics - as players that\u0027s out of our hands. But you could try to brake harder - less time spent trying to stop is less time for the physics to cause an explosion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want an example how, check out this little craft, created as a drag race experiment: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalx.com/swjr-swis/The-Egg-5b\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://kerbalx.com/swjr-swis/The-Egg-5b\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe 2 sets of elevon 4\u0027s in the back start shielded from the airflow, so they don\u0027t cause any drag. But as soon as the fairing is staged, they are immediately exposed to airflow. Since they are placed perpendicular to the airflow, you get maximum drag, so they act as a very effective airbrake.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt works just as well in a 1.25m service bay, where you can add the \u0027toggle bay doors\u0027 action into the brake action group.

That could be any heading and by all means you have to find a new one to do the job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you have the entire vessel itself. You should have some means to push the vessel down using any elevon and have enough sepatrons to decelerate and to lower framerate. By all means your vessel should look more or less similar to that of stratzenblitz unless you\u0027ve come up with your own unique creativity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGot any pictures?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-31T05:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you need something to hold you down on the ground, maybe just get some air and slow down that way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
