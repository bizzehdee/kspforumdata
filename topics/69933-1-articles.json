It seems counterintuitive, but you don\u0027t want to gain even more speed - it will result in a high Kerbin orbit (very similiar to Mun\u0027s). Enter Mun\u0027s orbit normally, but set return maneuver node when your ship starts moving from east to west (basically it will be between Mun and Kerbin). It will result in lower overall speed, which will drop your periapsis low over Kerbin.

I realized on Munar orbit that if I went for the landing, he\u0027d be stuck there, so I stayed in high orbit; but still had lotsa dV. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first time, I burned for Minmus, after finding a surpisingly cheap solution; and was reveling in all the science he\u0027d be bringing home.

I used all my RCS to bring down my apo, then had nothing... I was stuck between waiting for the atmosphere to slow him down enough, or just reloading; and loosing all that precious science. On one of the peri\u0027s, Bill popped his nosetip parachute, hoping that would be enough to keep him in atmo. The lid didn\u0027t so much as pop off. Ultimately, that wait for drag had brought his peri\u0027s down into the 50k range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore that point, I think he was only out there about 9 days or so.

Of course he wasn\u0027t able to stay in line with Bill\u0027s craft, and crashed through; but all that remained was that his whole mission\u0027s hope; that nudge, was enough to knock \u0027em home. Leaving that to hope, Jeb reluctantly prepared for reentry himself. He landed, looking to the sky behind him; his craft recovering some scant 3 science, for any trace of Bill.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nudge was enough. Bill\u0027s first parachute held through reentry; and was joined in timely manner by the other 2, to be recovered, after almost a year in space without food, with Science Jr and the GooPods, and over 100 science for Kerbalkind.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirrobert","CreatedById":70591,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-20T23:58:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery nice sollution, but I AM going to have to tell you something now that will make you facepalm (sorry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could have send Bob on EVA, and use his jetpack to push the rocket\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pokletu","CreatedById":57597,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-21T02:16:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDamn.
