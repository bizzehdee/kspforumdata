They look like those jacks toys or an asterisk, or the above poster\u0027s picture. I don\u0027t have a picture of my own handy- but the \u0022core\u0022 is a node with conical adapters and clampotron seniors in each of the 6 directions just like the above one. From that central core, one direction has a science module, hitchhiker, and cupola tower. The other five directions have large orange tanks with large RCS tanks. Each orange tank has medium size clampotrons on the sides so smaller ships can dock, as well as large docking ports on the outward end of the fuel tanks for the bigger ships. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, my goal is to get a refuel star/asterisk/jack in orbit around each planet to serve as refuel stations for return trips. I launch at least one orange tank to planets during each launch window. After I\u0027ve gotten stations established at Moho, Eve, and Duna, I came to realize the only one I never used was the one at Kerbin. It\u0027s just simpler and fewer steps to launch a refuel shipment from Kerbin direct to my ships rather than deal with supplying a refuel station.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-16T15:45:01Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2014 03:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by UH60guy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
