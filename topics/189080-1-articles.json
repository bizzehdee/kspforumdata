There\u0027s one aspect of KSP though that bothers me to no end, yet nobody I\u0027m aware of has made a mod for it yet: experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t just mean leveling up as you play, as that\u0027s now just a menu option... in my opinion the entire experience system (being location-based) is just garbage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo illustrate, let me ask a question. Let\u0027s say you\u0027re a space tourist. You\u0027re looking to spend hundreds of thousands of roots (hundreds of millions of dollars in my estimation) to go on a tour and land on Minmus. You have two choices of pilot:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilot A: Abel Kerman. Abel has over one hundred\u00A0Minmus landings under his belt. He\u0027s done this exact mission dozens of times before, plus multiple Mun landings. He has almost a year of flight time aboard a Minmus-orbiting fuel and science station, has dozens more precision landings on Minmus with a fuel freighter, and boasts hundreds of launches and de-orbits from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPilot B: Baker Kerman. Baker has only ever gone on one mission. Though he\u0027s a pilot, he\u0027s never actually touched the controls himself; on his single mission, he basically rode shotgun for an AI probe core that actually did the flying because he can\u0027t figure out how to point toward a maneuver node or a targeted vessel. He\u0027s launched once, happened to ride to Duna and back, and landed once, and... well that\u0027s it. One mission, ever, zero actual flying time, just a year or so of floating in space as a fifth wheel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously you\u0027d want Abel, right? Clearly he\u0027s the more experienced kerbal, the obvious man for the job. In fact, if you wanted to send a mission to Laythe, I\u0027m guessing you\u0027d want Abel for that, too, wouldn\u0027t you? He\u0027s obviously a vastly better and more experienced pilot. Though he\u0027s not yet left Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, he\u0027s seen all kinds of crazy scenarios and emergency situations, and come out of all of them alive, while Baker... pushed a button once, then watched the pretty pictures go by as the probe core flew the mission for him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYet in the game, Abel is level 2, and the novice ride-along guy is level 4. See the problem? The XP has nothing to do with, y\u0027know... experience.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what I would like to create, or to inspire someone who knows their way around the deeper working of KSP than I do into creating, would be a total overhaul of the XP system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would ideally use some weighted average of total flight time, number of landings (with more distant bodies weighted more heavily than Kerbin but not obscenely so like it is now), number of docking maneuvers or rendezvous... Maybe that could even just be for pilots... Scientists would be total time working in an active laboratory module, number of surface samples returned (again weighted for distance of body), total science points earned. Engineers could be total resources mined, flight time aboard space stations, and (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E installed) number of EVA construction operations or something like that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously those would take some fine-tuning, and -that- is the kind of thinking and work that I\u0027d be happy to do, to game out statistically etc. What I don\u0027t know is if the experience system is even possible to modify at all. I\u0027m 99% sure it can\u0027t be just using .cfg file editing, and unfortunately I\u0027ve never gone into scripting at all. I probably could learn, but that\u0027d be probably a several-hundred-hour project, where I suspect a more experienced modder could do that part of it (assuming it\u0027s possible) in more like 10-20 hours.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone interested in this? Either in taking it on themselves, or in co-authoring a mod with me? Or even just guiding and mentoring me to learn in as efficient way as possible?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know of any mods in the annals of abandoned mod history that could be resurrected for 1.8?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-10-20T00:12:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/20/2019 12:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 20, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by FirroSeranel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zer0Kerbal","CreatedById":190933,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-20T07:33:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nclosest thing currently:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022190933\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3317731426\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/188841-171-kerbalnaut-training-field-training-laboratory-ftl-field-training-facilityftf/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FirroSeranel","CreatedById":144343,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-10-21T16:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, hey, nice!

That still exists... but with KSP2 on the horizon (which will hopefully do away with this abysmal XP system and replace it with something sensible), I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s enough by itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPractically, I\u0027m just -tired- of doing that \u0022Minmus Flag Plant, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E change, Mun-flyby\u0022 mission to get a pilot to be able to hold maneuver and point at another ship to dock, after doing it dozens and dozens of times. -That- problem is solved by the Kerbalnaut Training mod sufficiently that I think it kills my motivation to learn the inner workings of KSP to the extent I\u0027d need to to create my own mod for this. It isn\u0027t solved in an ideal fashion, or how I would personally do it, but... it works, and it\u0027s good enough for me, for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm... though looking at the Star levels and what they do... they could use some extra stuff. Maybe not random control inputs (or make that an option), but maybe a staged approach to adding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E locks by ship size... so that for small ships (what you\u0027d reasonably need to complete the tech tree in a normal sense), it\u0027s like it is now, but for 100t ships and above to get each unlock takes \u002B1 star (so 4* for Maneuver/Target for 100t ships), and for 1000t plus requires \u002B2 stars, so 5*. I\u0027ve seen other mods make pilot levels 4 and 5 start adding bonuses to engine \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, but the engineer in me just can\u0027t quite get around the lack of realism there. I can -almost- do it, like maybe the pilot is so good they\u0027re taking a more optimal trajectory through the system, but... at the end of the day what the engine can do is what the engine can do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScientists already have (or I thought they did; the wiki is saying they get basically nothing) a nice smooth progression of extra science recovered when they gather it, which makes sense. A better scientist takes better quality samples, doesn\u0027t contaminate samples during transfers, understands what details to notate, etc. And engineers get substantial progression with mining, with what they can repair, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I\u0027m rambling at this point. Point being, there are a lot of things I\u0027d change if I could, but I don\u0027t know enough about the game\u0027s architecture, or about how to program for it, to do it without tons of effort. I could learn, but with KSP 2 not too far off, and a solution to at least the practical side already existing, I just don\u0027t think I\u0027m up for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: I just strikes me that like so many things about KSP 1 (which I love, don\u0027t get me wrong, I have many thousands of hours in the game!), the XP system (along with the science system especially) feels tacked on and half-baked, and ends up being an obstacle to the fun of the game rather than a part of it, to me. I really hope KSP 2 really fully integrates both science and XP right from the get-go, along with colonization, to make a \u0022complete experience\u0022 rather than a \u0022core game plus tacked-on elements and mods making up the difference where they can\u0022 feel of KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-11-04T18:56:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2019 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by FirroSeranel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-04T19:00:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice to discuss, though.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beetlecat","CreatedById":92207,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-03T18:48:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223699991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022189080\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221572893609\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022144343\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FirroSeranel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/4/2019 at 10:53 AM, FirroSeranel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just strikes me that like so many things about KSP 1 (which I love, don\u0027t get me wrong, I have many thousands of hours in the game!), the XP system (along with the science system especially) feels tacked on and half-baked,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMost everything about KSP is tacked-on and half-baked.
