I had been fantasizing about space since I was 5 years old. When I got back from a two year experience in Europe, I found that the social structure at school had not only formed, but now ruled with a iron grip. I was literally the only nerd in my school, let alone space nerd. For two whole years I lived as a social outcast, I had no friends and I became depressed and silent. I found small consolation in books and \u003Ci\u003Elegend of Zelda\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0games. Then. On a normal school day, I came home and plopped down in front of the computer and stumbled across a website named kerbal space program...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0as I explored the website more, my eyes got wider and wider.

A few days later when my parents said they would let me buy the game, I knew the line had stopped going down on the depression graph. The scale models of imaginary missions, the endless scetches in my spare composition book, the huge brainstormed stations, one by one they all came to life. And then it only got even better. One day when I tiped\u00A0in KSP into the search bar and I was about to hit enter when I saw in the suggestions list \u0022forums\u0022 intrigued, I pushed a button and the awesomeness of the game instantly doubled. When I discovered forgotten space program and the saga of Emiko station the awesomeness tripled. All of a sudden I went\u00A0from a regected nerd living in the middle of nowhere to part of a \u003Ci\u003Ecommunity. \u003C/i\u003EI had friends. I had people like me.
