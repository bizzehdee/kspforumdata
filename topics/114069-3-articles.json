It might be nice to host the convention in a larger city with better airport access, especially if we\u0027re expecting international guests. Picking a convention in a more populated spot might result in more media coverage as well, which would be nice if we\u0027re trying to get more people hooked on KSP. Finally, Muscogee is only a few miles from Tulsa, and I\u0027ve always wanted to meet some Okies from Muscogee ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nGoing to Oklahoma would actually be quite convenient for me, at least. I\u0027m not sure about others (though that general Midwestern region did receive the second-highest number of votes on your poll).\n\nOnce again, though, it\u0027s important to consider the cost of the venue and the number of people likely to attend. The Tulsa spot has more than enough room to accomodate us, so it will probably be cheaper to only rent part of the building. \n\nAugust 7-9 would be good. It does, however, mean that we only have a month left to create our plans...\n\n-Upsilon\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T17:20:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 05:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T17:51:08Z","Content":"Lol, I sent them an email and they haven\u0027t gotten back to me, the request form had a crap-ton of requirements, half of which I didn\u0027t fill out.

(If we damage the property, which we almost certainly won\u0027t, they don\u0027t want to pay for repairs is basically what it boils down to.) If we are to organize our own convention, we must either piggyback off of another convention (as was my original plan) or figure out how to deal with the requirements that the convention center asks for.\n\nGetting the Reddit crowd involved wouldn\u0027t be sacrilege at all! We need as many hands on deck as possible. While I don\u0027t have a Reddit account, it would be nice if someone could briefly explain what\u0027s going on over here and include a link...\n\n...Oh, and at the risk of violating both Rule 2.2f and 3.4 (sorry, moderators! I hope you understand that this content is neither very private information nor intending to refuse to abide by staff decisions. And yes, I have the Rules practically memorized by now...), here\u0027s an excerpt from a PM that Kasper sent me regarding this convention:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m afraid we won\u0027t endorse this officially, which is mostly down to a question of liability. We exert no control whatsoever, but by endorsing the event we could be held liable if something were to go wrong.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a bit disappointing but not unreasonable. This means, however, that we are on our own. In other words, we must do our own marketing... which also means that it is in our best interest to come up with a convention location ASAP.\n\nI still think we can pull this off, but it ain\u0027t gon\u0027 be easy, folks...\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T18:06:23Z","Content":"If Squad isn\u0027t willing to endorse, why would a smaller con be willing to let us piggyback if it might be a liability?

Perhaps somebody could ask Max what he thinks about it on SquadCast tonight?\n\nBasically, here\u0027s the scoop.\n\nAny organization worth its salt knows that your average gaming convention is fun, informative, and safe. They also realize, however, that there is a tiny possibility that something may go wrong. A con participant might have some medical problem or a certain food and beverage stand could give a couple of people food poisoning, for example. Less likely but still within the realm of possibility: someone breaking bones falling down stairs or setting off a fire alarm. These sorts of things are unpredictable and can occur even if we do everything right, but they can make for bad press. And as Kasper said, he doesn\u0027t want SQUAD to be liable for the problems, for obvious reasons.\n\nThis is also another reason why conventions need insurance, by the way.\n\n**Tl;dr:** SQUAD isn\u0027t really willing to support a bunch of unofficial Forum-goers in their efforts to create a con, because a lot could go wrong and they don\u0027t want to be considered responsible for any mishaps.\n\nNow, if a preexisting con agrees to take us in, they understand that these sorts of things happen. They already have the infrastructure (and the insurance) to withstand such problems. More importantly, they view the convention as a time for people to get together and have fun, not as a risk for liability that makes them hesitant. (I\u0027m not saying that SQUAD\u0027s making a bad decision here... in fact, I think they\u0027re quite shrewd. It would be more fun if they supported our efforts to create a Kerbal-Kon though.)\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I think choosing a preexisting con might be the better choice. I\u0027m just not sure.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"FireFaced","CreatedById":141290,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T20:54:10Z","Content":"My only request is cheap, and close to the east coast."},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T21:43:15Z","Content":"Regrettably, the farthest I could go for a Kon is Seattle, and even that\u0027s a stretch right now.
