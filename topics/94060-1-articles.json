I\u0027ve got a mission in which I must \u0022Take an EVA report on the surface of Fabien\u0027s Region\u0022. The problem is a cannot enter the region (\u0022You are entering Fabien\u0027s Region\u0022 message doesn\u0027t show up). I\u0027ve done the mission about ten times already, even landed on the very precise spot where the marker is, collected the data, yet still nothing. Have you encountered this problem before?

Firstly, have you accepted the contract? I know that the markers show up in the Tracking Station before you even accept the contract, presumably to allow the player to judge if they can complete the contract. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, have you selected the marker and enabled the navigation feature to it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pedro102","CreatedById":132960,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-22T07:55:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your reply! However I did both of those things and I still can\u0027t detect the region.
