Well, before the sun died, anyways. Now it\u0027s just nothing. Just dust and gas. They sent in a ship to investigate, and what they found? They found the first extraterrestrial lifeforms. They were primitive, but they did have a space station and we saw remnants of a lander on the first moon of their homeworld, KH4R III. The dialect on the lander was unreadable to any of us, so we assumed it was \u003Cem\u003Esomething\u003C/em\u003E on the surface of KH4R III. After we put a probe in orbit of KH4R III, we detected other crafts nearby. After a while, a space station came into view. Primitive, about what the ISS looked like before it was de-orbited. There were also many debris nearby, suggesting failed docking attempts. We tried to open communications, but they didn\u0027t have communication abilities on any of their spacecraft. Afterwards, we sent an unmanned lander down onto KH4R III. It landed near what appeared to be a runway. We rotated the camera to see a spaceplane being rolled onto the runway. One of the beings noticed it and came running over. He had a large, green head, with big eyes. He had black hair on the top of his head. He was tapping the glass, very curious. He called some others over, with a high, distorted voice. They started dragging the lander into a large complex of buildings, which we assumed to be some sort of research area. When they dragged it inside, we lost communications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s all for now, this is my first fan-works ever, so please leave constructive criticism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI got the idea to do this from NASFanboy, who made this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49617-On-the-Origin-of-Kerbals\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/49617-On-the-Origin-of-Kerbals\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck him out!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
