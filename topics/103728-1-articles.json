Also, depending on how the UI is presented, it\u0027d make certain \u0027dependant\u0027 upgrades more intuitive (Rather than R\u0026amp;D saying \u0022Astronaut Complex Upgrade required for EVA Surface Sample\u0022, I might simply have a \u0022EVA Surface Sample\u0022 node that has dependencies on other nodes in both buildings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027d also allow certain upgrades to be more incremental, e.g. the current VAB goes from 30-\u0026gt;255-\u0026gt;unlimited parts; a tree system might have more \u0027steps\u0027 (30-\u0026gt;60-\u0026gt;120-\u0026gt;255-\u0026gt;unlimited, for instance)... so something like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Costs and such totally made up and not balanced)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVehicle Assembly I -\u0026gt; Cost: 0; Can assemble spacecraft with up to 30 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E. .
