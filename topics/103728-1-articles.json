The existing level-up system could still be used in such a way of \u0022Once you\u0027ve spent X amount on building upgrades, that building changes to the next tier\u0027s model.\u0022\n\nThis could allow to make building upgrades overall cost more than they do now, but in more manageable chunks. Also, depending on how the UI is presented, it\u0027d make certain \u0027dependant\u0027 upgrades more intuitive (Rather than R\u0026D saying \u0022Astronaut Complex Upgrade required for EVA Surface Sample\u0022, I might simply have a \u0022EVA Surface Sample\u0022 node that has dependencies on other nodes in both buildings).\n\nIt\u0027d also allow certain upgrades to be more incremental, e.g. the current VAB goes from 30-\u003E255-\u003Eunlimited parts; a tree system might have more \u0027steps\u0027 (30-\u003E60-\u003E120-\u003E255-\u003Eunlimited, for instance)... so something like:\n\n(Costs and such totally made up and not balanced)\n\nVehicle Assembly I -\u003E Cost: 0; Can assemble spacecraft with up to 30 parts.\n\n. . Vehicle Assembly II -\u003E Cost: 30,000; Can assemble spacecraft with up to 60 parts.\n\n. . . Vehicle Assembly III -\u003E Cost: 60,000; Can assemble spacecraft with up to 120 parts. [and so on]\n\n. . Control Systems -\u003E Cost: 50,000; Basic Action Groups Available\n\n. . . Advanced Control Systems -\u003E Cost: 150,000; Custom Action Groups Available\n\nTo still encourage players to fully unlock each building\u0027s tech tree, the final node can possibly require all previous upgrades -- i.e. you can\u0027t unlock unlimited parts until you\u0027ve also finished out the action group tree, etc.\n\nThoughts?"},{"CreatedByName":"StrandedonEarth","CreatedById":89439,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T01:36:07Z","Content":"Sounds good"},{"CreatedByName":"gmiddlemass","CreatedById":111037,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T07:23:37Z","Content":"Sounds like a good idea."},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T07:58:59Z","Content":"Someone make it and I will use it.
