This problem of getting bogged down smurfing science with dozens of Munar/Minmar missions in the early game is one of the key challenges in overhauling science. Chris Adderley did say in his AMA that this pacing and scaling problem has been the hardest hurdle in developing science, and that some of the key problems they hoped to address are opacity and balance. Folks have brought up introducing different flavors of science--atmospheric science, moon science, inner planets science, outer planets science, etc. I do think that could help. Another idea would be that bodies only have a 3 or 4 big general biomes but there were other much smaller biomes around anomalies that would need to be scanned for to find easily. That way most players would only really be doing 6 or 8 missions around the Mun and Minmus before they felt like the next step was to send out interplanetary probes.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224319276\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219170\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221693819836\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/4/2023 at 5:30 AM, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo clarify, I was thinking more along the lines of automated science experiments (taking temperature or pressure while you\u0027re in a biome without the need to click) and a few unique complex experiments that teach you something.

You can still collect science, advance a tech tree, build colonies, gather resources, build interstellar ships, and start fresh in a new solar system without ever having the game offer a single mission if the player doesn\u0027t want to engage with that. Does that make sense? That\u0027s what I\u0027d like to see in KSP2.

In my opinion the more a game can lean on rewards that are tied to the structural mechanics of the game the more flexibility and creativity players can employ to meet those intrinsic goals. Extrinsic goals for me sound more like a branch of the onboarding experience, providing a bit of structure and guidance to help new players through the important steps and helping them to learn the fundamentals and even teach experienced players new things like how colonies work. Thats where I could see explicit missions coming in, kind of like the hidden milestone missions in KSP1. As you say I think they could be automatic as well---so long as you do the task you get the reward and you don\u0027t really need to micromanage accepting or rejecting them. I imagine they\u0027d probably end up being a bit more dense at the beginning--getting players to orbit and to Minmus and the Mun, then giving a bit of extra incentive to go interplanetary. They could also create rewards toward your first docking, building a station and starter base or setting up telescopes and landing on new worlds.
