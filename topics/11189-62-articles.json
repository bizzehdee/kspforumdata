Ditto Aero jet engines for the two rocket powered craft. FYI if it reintegrated in orbit and landed as a single craft it would count as a K-Prize mission. The precedent for modular craft is that the mission counts for K-Prize purposes as far as the craft is intact, EDIT rethink... but the docking process would not count towards an Advanced Pilot Precision Award 1st Class because none of the three craft counts as payload it demonstrates pilot precision.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-13T19:44:54Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2014 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"},{"CreatedByName":"liufrain","CreatedById":116141,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T12:15:07Z","Content":"Easy enough to be boring, but the first time was really challenging =)\n\n1.

Can you explain how the Kraken drive works as I am having trouble working out how the fuel rules apply!\n\n Boolybooly,\n\n The Kraken drive exploits a weakness in the physics engine, sort of like infiniglide. The short version is this: It doesn\u0027t require any fuel to operate.\n\n The longer version: Kraken drive works by forcing a loosely connected part to attempt to be in 2 places at the same time. The physics engine sees that the part is out of place and attempts to reposition it. The K drive then immediately disconnects it again. Every time the physics engine reattaches the part, it imparts an acceleration to the entire craft. The downside is that decelerating below 750 m/sec is likely to destroy the K drive if it\u0027s active.\n\n So the way my SSTO works is fairly straightforward; use infiniglide to accelerate to roughly 1,200 m/sec in a climb, then engage the K-drive as necessary to establish orbit. Once in orbit, you can use the K-drive for unlimited DV, thus rendering \u0022transfer windows\u0022 obsolete. You can get anywhere in the system in a matter of days by direct intercept.\n\n Hope this clears up any questions,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T08:29:27Z","Content":"Thanks for explaining GoSlash27.
