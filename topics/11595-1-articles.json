I have had some luck with my first vertical design, it was a modified munar lander with basic jets and extra omni direction RCs thrusters. However most of my traditional horizontal designs I can\\\u0027t seem to balance well enough! Mostly they flip end over end, though one worked well enough to make it to the Mt. Flattop testing facility due west of the ksp. Any one else have any luck with designs of this nature?"},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T00:10:48Z","Content":"I\\\u0027ve had moderate success with something similar. I combined Tosh\\\u0027s cart mod with R4m0n\\\u0027s MechJeb plugin. Used in Surface or KillRot modes, the cart is much less unstable at high speeds. \n\nPerhaps MechJeb would help your design too. While it cannot use RCS to control altitude or vertical speed, it would enable perfect attitude control. (It also tends to spam the RCS and drain fuel too quickly. So I think your best bet would be to use only the single lateral jets for hovering, and reaction wheels for attitude control.)"},{"CreatedByName":"gtmattz","CreatedById":15075,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-29T20:00:59Z","Content":"Using the \\\u0027KILL ROT\\\u0027 function from the MechJeb SmartASS module helps immensely when trying to operate craft of this type. With it I have been able to successfully fly quite a few different contraptions that would have been completely uncontrollable otherwise."}]}
