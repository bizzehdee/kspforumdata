Anyway, the issue which I don\u0027t THINK is supposed to happen is that if I hit the two parts together not perfectly on the docking ports, even if it\u0027s REALLY slow, the entire thing (both parts) just instantly dissapears and turns into a puff of smoke. That seems a little extreme... is this supposed to happen? Haven\u0027t had a successful docking yet.
