All in all, he is unable to read words that he hasn\u0027t been told about. Like most other 3 year olds, I guess.\n\nThat was until today.\n\nI was preparing dinner (pasta), while he was tinkering with my phone (He loves to play [Bad Piggies](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.BadPiggies)). Suddenly, I hear him say \u0022That\u0027s the sun!\u0022. I wondered what he was referring to so I had to check: It turned out that he had opened up Kerbal Space App, which I like having handy. He had opened the app, and clicked Kerbol. Well, cute, I thought, and confirmed that it was the sun, and continued with the cooking. Not long after, I hear him once more: \u0022That\u0027s.... uh..... that\u0027s...... that\u0027s Pol!\u0022\n\n\u0022What the Duck???\u0022\n\nI checked, and yes: He was looking at Pol. There\u0027s no way he could have picked that up elsewhere, so out of curiosity, we had a look through the app to check which others he could read, and Here\u0027s the list:\n\nPol\n\nVal\n\nTylo (Well, first he thought it was Yoyo, but when I asked him to try again, he got it right)\n\nDuna\n\nMun\n\nJool\n\nAlmosts:\n\nIke - Pronounced \u0022Eek\u0022 because of our household language not being English.\n\nDres - kinda. The \u0022Dr\u0022 sound was a bit hard, so it became Des.\n\nSo... just thought I\u0027d mention it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nPS: Whenever I open a youtube video, he asks me if I\u0027m about to watch Scott Manley.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-20T19:02:25Z\u0022 title=\u002205/20/2015 07:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jarmund**"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T19:06:07Z","Content":"Pretty sweet.
