All in all, he is unable to read words that he hasn\u0027t been told about. Like most other 3 year olds, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was until today.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was preparing dinner (pasta), while he was tinkering with my phone (He loves to play \u003Ca href=\u0022https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.BadPiggies\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBad Piggies\u003C/a\u003E). Suddenly, I hear him say \u0022That\u0027s the sun!\u0022. I wondered what he was referring to so I had to check: It turned out that he had opened up Kerbal Space App, which I like having handy. He had opened the app, and clicked Kerbol. Well, cute, I thought, and confirmed that it was the sun, and continued with the cooking. Not long after, I hear him once more: \u0022That\u0027s.... uh..... that\u0027s...... that\u0027s Pol!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What the Duck???\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI checked, and yes: He was looking at Pol. There\u0027s no way he could have picked that up elsewhere, so out of curiosity, we had a look through the app to check which others he could read, and Here\u0027s the list:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVal\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo (Well, first he thought it was Yoyo, but when I asked him to try again, he got it right)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlmosts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIke - Pronounced \u0022Eek\u0022 because of our household language not being English.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDres - kinda.
