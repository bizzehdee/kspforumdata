When I tried using less engines, I could barely make it to 40km up, before I\u0027d be onto my last stage. Those speed/altitude numbers seem low, not saying they\u0027re wrong but food for thought to me. I guess I over-engine, even with throttling heavily back to get my station tanks up. Most of my rockets hit 250m/s by 4km up, and are pushing 1km/s by 15km, usually as 2-stage. First stage, like for my last failed launch, gets ejected somewhere between 50-80km up depending on how much I coast before starting circularizing of my orbit. And it\u0027s anywhere from a 60 second to 4 minute coast phase, which I use as a rotational period to lower from 45 degree to 90 degree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Red, I have a single a-sas, but it\u0027s with the primary launch stage, gets detached when I reach orbit.
