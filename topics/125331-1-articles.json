And it is very fun to fly (rolling feels maby a bit too sharp).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was not an easy task to replicate the design of the Hyper Tornado. i just watched some episodes of Sonic-X season 3 to work as my reference for the build. the design is very rounded and has a lot of parts that are impossible to replicate properly with stock parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I ended up making the new version fully stock except for prosedural wings and Flag decals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some picks of it in action.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/XlM5B6p.png\u0022 alt=\u0022XlM5B6p.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EBL0eaA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022EBL0eaA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wtudhNE.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wtudhNE.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple of picks of the original version built quite a long time ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy original version just didnt feel accurate enough to put it here on to the forum plus it uses a lot more mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yoif03I.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yoif03I.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes i ended up clipping the wingtip while i flew past the flagpole.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cub0BaB.png\u0022 alt=\u0022cub0BaB.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo there you have it folks and fans, the Hyper Tornado.
