Luxurious!\n\nBrakes: Toggles wheel and air brakes as default.\n\nAbort: Does nothing.\n\nGear: Gear up and down.\n\n1: Landing prep - toggles front gear lights and unlocks front gear steering\n\n2: Open/close docking port\n\n3. Open/close service bay.\n\n**How to fly:**\n\nAscent: Ascend like any other rocket - do a normal gravity turn, in other words. Mechjeb has no problem with using the default curve.\n\nIn flight: Firstly when you get to orbit it is essential to open your service bay and turn on one of the fuel cells as she has no solar power. Rendezvous and docking is pretty straightforward, though due to engine limitations of the inline docking port you\u0027ll have to eyeball the final approach.\n\nDeorbit and landing: **IMPORTANT**: drain any remaining fuel to the **forward tank** before deorbiting AND do not attempt re-entry with more than 1/3rd fuel remaining (burn it off if you have to). This is because the centre of mass is fairly daintily balanced on the centre of lift already and having fuel in the back tank (or too much in the front) makes it too rear-heavy.\n\nDeorbit as normal, aiming for a 25km or so periapsis. I use Mechjeb to help focus on a landing site. Point your nose into the airflow, and wait until your speed lowers to a sane value.\n\nThen engage SAS if you haven\u0027t already and glide towards the runway at KSC (if your\u0027re close) or a flat-looking piece of land (if you\u0027re not). Any remaining fuel can be used to boost your speed if you find yourself too far out. Use a combination of gentle gliding and airbrakes to get your speed down before touchdown and just land as normal.\n\n**Typical mission:** Fuel loadout is designed to ascend to 80km, circularize (boosters run out and have to be ejected before circularization finishes), rendezvous with a station or other craft in low or medium Kerbin orbit, and deorbit to land at the runway at KSC while transporting four Kerbal passengers, plus pilot and co-pilot.\n\nWith orbital refueling I\u0027ve taken it to Minmus, but fuel starts getting pretty low pretty quickly in this scenario.\n\nSo have fun and please let me know what you think if you give it a try!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-30T01:03:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/30/2015 01:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by moogoob**\n  \ntypography"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T17:44:54Z","Content":"And this is nasty in what sense?

It\u0027s even in the instructions. I just need to do another revision - move the wings back a tad. If you\u0027ve got 1/3rd fuel left it\u0027s not too much a problem but this is making re-entry just a bit difficult. :/"}]}
