The only purpose of the Spectrometron is to enable transmitting Surface Samples at 100%, but you can trivially recover a Kerbin Surface Sample for 100% as soon as you get it.

The way that you\u0027ve explained it above, it seems contradictory to (my perception of) Station Science. All of the Experiment modules require return to Kerbin, so why not just save my soil samples in the return capsule and get 100% science upon arrival? (Instead of hauling an addition 10 (?) ton Spectrometron out to wherever.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were to change the Spectrometron such that its analysis was a different experiment from returning soil sample to Kerbin, IMHO it could add to game play. Assuming that Spectrometron \u0022consumes\u0022 a soil sample, this gives players the following choices for each biome/soil sample:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Return the sample to Kerbin, same as stock game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Spectometron analysis, transmit results (for faster science).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Player can collect two samples from a biome to do both of above, but this requires them to make two trips or bring two separate capsules, since (as far as I\u0027m aware) a capsule can only store a single soil sample for each biome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-26T21:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like this mod, but have one issue (minor) with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station science experiments (such as those involving Kuarks, zoology lab, etc), are very disappointing.
