Also, Proxima looking at a cen A and B.\n\nCoronas are not finished, you\u0027ll notice that not all of them have coronas yet.\n\nSo we\u0027ll define star radius and mass as normal in relative units, but now we also define surface temperature manually in Kelvin. This is run through the Temperature-Color Generator and output as light color and surface colors. For main sequence stars, one of three sunspot textures are chosen: Big sunspots (M, Late-K), Medium sunspots (K, G, F), and small sunspots (ABO). No sunspots will be used for white dwarfs, neutron stars, and Giants. Giants will instead gain procedural PQSMods to give them unique bubbly (convection cell) surfaces that are based upon their radius and temperature. Their PQSMods are exported into a heightmap which is then inverted and used as the sunspot texture, which will give them the darker red lighting in the deeper regions. There will be 6 coronas. Orange-yellow (M, Late-K), Yellow-white (M, G), White-blue (F, A, B), and blue (O).\n\nThe stars are defined to be realistic at 1/10 scale. However, after I finish my work, this will be turned into an optional mode and the default version will be modifed by Sigma into kerbalized versions of the stars. (Scaled against Kerbol, G-type yellow stars are actually yellow.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Sigma88","CreatedById":113260,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-18T15:54:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 38 minutes ago, GregroxMun said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sigma has stated he wants to keep the stars scaled against the absurd stock sun, which is not my favorite idea at all, but eh.\n\u003E \n\nwelcome to the team greg ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)\n\nwe\u0027ll work on having a custom parameter to give realisting stars so purists will be happy and also those who wants a galaxy which is consistent with the stock system ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"JadeOfMaar","CreatedById":167617,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-19T16:13:42Z","Content":"Yes.
