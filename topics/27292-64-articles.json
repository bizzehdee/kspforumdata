On the descent I visually observed one of the Munar anomalies and made a point to leave my lander in place after filling up with kethane in order to serve as a landing beacon of sorts when I targeted a crewed lander visit to the anomaly. Last thing I did last evening was throw together a heavy Munar lander and put it into orbit around the Mun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETonight I spent ... way too long ... trying to land close to the anomaly. Turns out this one isn\u0027t just on the edge of one of the largest craters on the Mun, it\u0027s actually on the ridge between that crater and a much smaller one that almost overlaps the first. That means there is only a very small region right around the anomaly itself that\u0027s flat enough for my standard heavy lander. I guess I could have gone back to the drawing board and built something shorter and wider and hoped for the best with experimentation but hey, that\u0027s what Quicksave is for, right? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Quicksave was about 2.5 km almost right over the anomaly. It was offset toward the inside slope of the smaller crater so I had a heck of time getting lined up right over a level-enough spot to land. I kept drifting around a bit during descent and time after time, I\u0027d hit the ground and either gently rebound and then slide/tip over, or just set down and slowly tip over as the legs settled. Bits and pieces would begin breaking off and exploding. On one occasion, almost the entire lander exploded piece by piece as it slid and tumbled down the crater. Miraculously, on none of these failed attempts did the crew ever die. So, um, yay for Kerbal engineering I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, on about the 10th attempt, I finally got down close enough to the anomaly that the ground was level(ish) and my lander is stable, within a couple hundred meters from the anomaly at most. I will EVA the crew out for the obligatory photo op tomorrow. For now, I safed all the propulsion systems so I can\u0027t fubar it all up, deployed the solar arrays and then skipped back to the Space Center and closed out my game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat took WAY too long tonight but it was so worth it when I finally got down right where I needed to be.

The dockings went pretty good, I even had to dock more times than planned because when I detached from the service module, I realized it was better to undock while it was behind the SM, since it was supposed to then start burning retrograde, so I docked again, turned around, and detached once again. Everything went silk smooth up until the reinsertion burn, which was only possible thanks to my copious amounts of monopropellant, otherwise my trustworthy 3 man crew would be stranded around Kerbin on an elliptical orbit with a Pe in excess of 3,000,000mts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AncientAstronaut","CreatedById":36093,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T14:50:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMade 1000c, effectively traveling significantly through time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NGTOne","CreatedById":55972,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T15:01:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022AncientAstronaut\u0022 data-cite=\u0022AncientAstronaut\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EMade 1000c, effectively traveling significantly through time.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(10char)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"korntipton","CreatedById":67338,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T15:13:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECreated an Apollo mission to mun with a Columbia docking and all.. but I forgot Electricity on the first mission \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.. second mission..
