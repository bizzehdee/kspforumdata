At the moment we\u0027re dedicated to support the Twitch streamers that (as Cantab pointed out) put in a lot of time and effort into showcasing the game. There are many interesting streams out there, for example Das Valdez is currently streaming live from the USS Intrepid aircraft carrier, talking to all kinds of people from the museum there to astronauts. The Twitch Thursdays may not be the most popular edition of the Daily Kerbal, but that\u0027s okay. There\u0027s good quality content out there for the people who are willing to give it a go. I have thought about introducing a \u0022Spaceflight Saturday\u0022 in the past, to talk about current events in space exploration, but currently I don\u0027t have the time in the day to write an article every week.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EWhether you supported this suggestion or not, thanks for participating.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E-x- OLD POST BELOW -x-\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been looking at the amount of views and replies of the Twitch Thursdays on The Daily Kerbal, and from what I\u0027ve seen it gets the smallest amount of views and replies on the section, compared to the others.
