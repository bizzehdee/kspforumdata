I was really impressed with some of the ones I\u0027ve seen on here - and thanks for all the replies and the welcomes! I\u0027m a single Dad and have an 8yo daughter and we both get a kick out of this game. It\u0027s a little difficult for her but fun building model rockets and planes and then launching them off. She says I\u0027m addicted and might be a little right on that. I don\u0027t play games often but this one has me hooked. I hope it\u0027s one that continues to grow and be supported - the community is certainly awesome!
