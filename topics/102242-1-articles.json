In real life, the first vital sign remote monitoring system was actually developed for space program. If there should be a similar system, I think there should be ECG, SpO2, Non-Invasive Blood Pressure, Breath Rate and Heart Rate. The crew will respond to the flight status, such as Gs, spinning, and also some mental stress. You will also be very careful choosing kerbonaut then. It could be funny if you have a medical emergency on space station, and require rescue mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a huge fan and I have been in medical device industry for 10\u002B years. 4 years ago, I started up a company called Warp United Scientific to develop Medical Recorder. It\u0027s basically a medical Tricorder from Star Trek, but unfortunately, CBS did send me a warning letter, we are not allowed to use the name \u0022Tricorder\u0022... Anyway, my point being, we should introduce some medical and vital sign into KSP, and make it more, well, fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_8th_Bit","CreatedById":136735,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T04:39:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELife support has been discussed a lot and there are several mods.
