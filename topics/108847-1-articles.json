It is possible to build some concave shapes with more than one procedural tank. \n\nMy request concerns especially biconvex structures, but maybe it\u0027s just the other side of a coin for biconcave structures. I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s possible to code a plugin/fork for PP which has three new variables for two dimensions:\n\n ![5642.gif](http://m.schuelerlexikon.de/ma_abi2011/5642.gif)![fig_fct_convexe_02.jpg](http://melusine.eu.org/syracuse/bbgraf/albums/coniques/imagettes/fig_fct_convexe_02.jpg)\n\n1. Either variation of radius and angular or absolute value of x and y\n\n2. and the position of the minimum/maximum in z\n\n3. and style of curvature\n\nis needed to find a determined shape like this (halfed):\n\n![Deformation-surfaces.png](http://www.techno-science.net/illustration/Definition/520px/Deformation-surfaces.png)\n\n(Simpler) Approaches:\n\na. PP is using Bezier curves to determine the shape of the cones. Perhaps it is possible to create inverse curves\n\nb. creating a [hyperboloid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid)\n\nHopefully there is a great code writer for this!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T07:20:02Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 07:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funk**"}]}
