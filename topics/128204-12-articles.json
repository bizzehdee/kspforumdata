However, I actually value the functionality of ISFS. The more flexibility I have in designing ships, the better.

The more parts you have in the most-full category, the worse it gets, and it can get bad enough to make the game unplayable. Until that bug is locked down, I still appreciate mods that keep part count to a minimum. Even after that bug is fixed though, I\u0027d much rather have only\u00A0one part for each model, with functionality able to be adjusted to suit my build needs, rather than having (by the time I use Karbonite, Karborundum, Interstellar Extended resources, cryogenic fuels, etc) over a dozen \u00221.25 x 6 meter fuel tanks\u0022 for each resource type.
