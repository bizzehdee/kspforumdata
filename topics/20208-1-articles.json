They are not 100% ready to be released, because I have to face a few problems first. My experiance with 3d modelling and texturing is extremly limited so my parts are far from perfect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Any rocket with 5x8 fuel tank has a tendency to spin out of control which caused deaths of many innocent Kerbals. Considering that the 5x8 fuel tank weights 144 it equals 8 stock 2.5m long tanks, I\u0027ve build a rocket using quadcoupler with 4*4 stock tanks. 4*4 setup works like a dream, it\u0027s perfectly stable. What can make 5x8 fuel tank spin like mad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. All parts are acting quite wierd midflight. They\u0027re sliding on the surface of parts attached below. It\u0027s not gamebreaking, but looks awful. Is it possible to do something about that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Last but not least, question about collider-mesh size. Parts with collider-meshes as big as render-meshes cannot be connected with anything else unless allowCollision parameter is set to 1. I believe that doing that is only a mere workaround, not a proper way to do it. Is making collider-meshes a little (0.01 for example) smaller is a way to go?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have got any other helpful advice, or comments about the whole 5-m parts idea, I\u0027ll gladly learn your view.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpannerMonkey(smce)","CreatedById":50907,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T23:38:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EExcellent first parts sort of puts my first part where it belongs on the scrapheap, good luck with the adventure\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mivanit","CreatedById":22463,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T23:55:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emaking collision meshes slightly smaller worked for me, but then again i have very little experience \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elooks awesome for now, if a bit un-creative (NOT trying to be depressing-keep up the good work!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chromium","CreatedById":2173,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T02:00:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs I\u0027ve been creating my own parts, I\u0027ve ended up going the \u0022scale collision meshes to 99%\u0022 route, which I prefer to allowCollision 0 to avoid having rockets with (intentionally or accidentally) intersecting parts.
