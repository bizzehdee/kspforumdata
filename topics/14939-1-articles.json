So to combat this we just stack the RCS and SAS modules on top of the pod and put the parachute on top like a cherry on a cake. however, whenever I re-enter Kerbin and deploy my parachute it usually will just rip the RCS and SAS right off of the command pod and leave my poor kerbals falling to their doom.
