That would be a pretty good reason to do it early. Oh, and seriously? You\u0027re complaining that after 2 YEARS of playing a game, only addons are keeping you hooked? When did you last play a game that could be played for 2 years, almost every day, without mods and without getting boring? Because I\u0027ve NEVER found such a game. I\u0027ve never had a game that I played for more than 4 or so months without using addons. If you can play a SINGLE PLAYER game for a few months without installing mods, you\u0027re playing a game with a lot of content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Grammar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: And yes, there are many people who play KSP for many months on stock alone. I could go stock too and play for months, the reason I don\u0027t is that I find it more fun with mods. Stock gameplay is already great, with mods it is fantastic.
