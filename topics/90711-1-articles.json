I don\u0027t think it has anything to do with FAR. I know that playing FAR or stock aero, these days I\u0027ll usually experiment with sepratron placement and decoupler positioning to try and mitigate the effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leszek","CreatedById":119053,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T20:15:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnicalfool is right, this is a known bug with the decouplers. Nothing to do with FAR. The effect goes away after 750 M/s. There is a fix.
