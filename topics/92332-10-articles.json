It uses a biome specific result if it can find one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result, I think CSS ends up with less variability because it is adding biome specific results when Squad only had (multiple) situation ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: All my testing was with crew reports and eva reports, but the results were the same for both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT2: By \u0022results\u0022 in my first edit, I mean the real life results of my testing, not the results displayed for the science in game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-03T03:51:09Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2015 03:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wercho\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dre4dW0rm","CreatedById":91550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-13T18:18:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DuoDex\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DuoDex\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere was a nan error?
