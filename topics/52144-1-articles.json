It looks very much like what I use, for the same stability of landing reasons. Just make sure you have radial seperators on those tanks that support the legs and fuel lines from said tanks to the main one. By the time you touch down on minmus/mun you likely have little left in them so you can blow them immediately you start your ascent, leaving you a lightweight fully fueled return stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionaly, if you are having trouble coming back from the moons of kerbin even with these designs, read up on \u0027Free Return Trajectory\u0027 to ensure your return launches are efficient. I tend to land equatorial and just launch vertically when my landing site is pointing to the moons retrograde (back along it\u0027s orbit). This drops you back into kerbin soi with a very cheap burn to aerobrake and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: Ok, thought I\u0027d download this and see what I could do with it. Threw away almost all your inline stabs, you keep one below the probe head and one other per stage, all the stabs are on the centre of thrust, having them on your radial sections makes them work doubletime to achieve anything. Fewer stabs also draws a lot less power on the ascent so your energy worries reduce considerably. I kept sas on for the climb off kerbin then ditched it as i left the atmosphere. After this point its on only for burns and very briefly to stop momentum when realigning Major lander redesign now has the surrounding tanks on radial seperators instead of the modular girders, legs still on those tanks, symmetry has dropped to 3 here reducing payload weight considerably, i find 3 legs to be sufficiently stable when placed this wide apart. No engines on the radial tanks, new 200 fuel tank below the science bay and 1 of those little engines there instead. Ditched the parachutes on the radial tanks and installed radial chutes on the science bay itself since those radials are no longer returning to kerbin with the probe, for this reason all the batteries are on the main body along with 6 of the most basic solar cell. All in all your lander got lighter, this design does need fuel pumps ideally to push from the radials to the centre lander engine, I did manage with some manual fuel shuffling though since I dont know if you have those unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOtherwise everything below the lander is untouched, exactly as you had it and staging as you had it, there are doubtless some tweaks could be made, but this design is solid with very little alteration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot it into lko with a healthy transfer stage left, sent it to minmus where the transfer stage was enough to capture orbit, equatorialize, deorbit and was then thrown away not empty from a hover at 500m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the lander-radials not empty as expected i didnt jettison them on ascent as planned, but transfered some fuel across when i burned out the little centre tank just short of a kerbin aerobrake trajectory, this manual juggling to achieve a refueled engine and still have balanced CoM is tricky, yet as long as you are not under thrust while getting it all evened out it wont cause you any issues. there are mods to help them drain evenly, but fuel lines would fix it all. dropped em not yet empty as i re-entered kerbin, worried about parachute weight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect it will do Mun\u002Breturn, and I can probably put it on Duna with some tweaks, i\u0027ll try later on.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-07T13:10:53Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2013 01:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by celem\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Carl","CreatedById":2645,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-07T21:38:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheers for the feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@celem: Again the landers a prototype, i\u0027d absolutely re-jig it with fuel lines later on if i can, but i felt i might need more than one engine in some circumstances with that much fuel and didn\u0027t realise you could move fuel without lines so i figured i\u0027d need one engine per tank anyway.
