I wanted to see what it looked like in the sun after getting it into a 150Km orbit. So I used time warp. after the time warp my orbit was no longer 150Km AP/PE, it was now 350Km and crashing. So I time warped again to see what would happen and now my Module was now being shot out into space. The time warp completely broke the orbit. I had no force being applied to the vessel, no \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or other thrusters were being used. Unfortunately this is a pretty massive bug that is quite game breaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
