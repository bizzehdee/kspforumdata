When i was burning to orbit, i saw Jool. i checked the map and its perfectly lined up. Now 328 days later, when burning to gain orbit around jool, i got a capture to Vall, still in escape trajectory, what are the odds, of burning at a random time, only to make a capture to Vall, i landed on Vall and left one of my crew members there for my first landing there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i regained orbit around Jool, when burning to tune the orbit ready to go to laythe, i got a capture to go to laythe. at this point, i was like ohh my day is so lucky. Not, during landing, i was heading towards a slope. I tried to burn out but it was too late, One of my lander engine got destroyed, and only to find that jet-packs don\u0027t work on Laythe so i cant move to a new location quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bailed a crew member out, i now tried to get the lander upright with my only crew member left in the ship. Unfortunately, the lander exploded and my crew member died.
