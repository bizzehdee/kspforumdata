Deciding to send a probe there (never been anywhere except Kerbin (and moons) and Duna, so was pretty pleased with that regardless), I\u0027ve so far found started tracking two Class C asteroids in what seem like very well circularized orbits with no extreme inclinations that I can tell. I\u0027ve never caught an asteroid before, but these seem much easier to get to than near-Kerbin ones (aside from making it to Dres in the first place anyway), and as such look like they might be good for using as sources of ore for refining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing I\u0027m not too sure about though, is the idea of using a fuel dump in Dres orbit as a stop off point on the way to Jool a good idea? I know that it takes a lot of delta-V to reach Dres and so if I was just sending a small one way trip to Jool then it probably wouldn\u0027t be worth it on account of having to get into and then Dres orbit. However, I\u0027m planning on sending a couple of large carriers (part of the reason why I haven\u0027t been interplanetary much is I\u0027m determined to do it with large, inefficient, SSTO carrying carrier ships (Like my first one to Duna back in whatever version of KSP it was: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/aGMDH#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/aGMDH#0\u003C/a\u003E ), and seeing as I want to explore several of Jools moons I\u0027ve been trying to figure out the best (including coolest, not necessarily the most efficient or reasonable) way of making sure they have plenty of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve considered using landers to pick up ore from the surfaces, but the amount of extra equipment (mainly part count and space in the hanger bays I\u0027m worried about, rather than mass) seems like it might be best to use asteroids (obviously I\u0027d still need drills, refineries, etc, but I\u0027d save on other parts a lander would need). Two ideas that I\u0027ve thought of (and feel happy to tell me they\u0027re both terrible and there\u0027s a better way of doing it) are to either have a refinery and stuff in Dres orbit, which the carriers rendezvous at in order to refuel, or to send a separate mission in advance to Dres which grabs the asteroids and pushes them out from Dres and takes them to Jool as mobile ore sources.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main queries are simply based on trying to find out the feasibility of these ideas. Does anyone know how often a transfer window opens from Dres to Jool, how much delta-V does it take to get there, and overall how difficult is it to go from one to the other?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThankyou in advance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Johnny Wishbone","CreatedById":118096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-28T17:24:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is my understanding that the \u0027Dres-teroids\u0027 were added as a way of giving people a reason to go to Dres. Prior to their introduction, Dres was rarely visited because of its inclination and lack of anything interesting being there. People just skipped past it on their way to Jool, which is a much more interesting planetary system to visit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the feasibility of using Dres-teroids as a mining/refueling outpost, there\u0027s been a number of threads already about this. The consensus seems that it\u0027s not really worth it since getting to Jool isn\u0027t much more difficult than getting to Dres, and there\u0027s plenty of resources in the Joolian system to mine and refuel from.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, there\u0027s still no real reason to visit Dres other than to plant your flag and say you did it. Hopefully future updates to the game will start to focus on the planetary bodies (and less on parts/physics) and give us some cool new stuff to check out on all the planets and moons. If you dig up threads on this forum from years ago when people were still hunting for landmarks and easter eggs, there was a lot more excitement about exploring and visiting planets and moons. When people found the Vallhenge, threads about it went on for weeks. Today, people get excited about making pontoons for seaplanes and launching boats on Kerbin.
