It\u0027s a pain to have to support multiple versions and trying to figure out why something may or may not work.

But there still isn\u0027t any version that protects the mod and savegames of players using it from dying once the author is suddenly gone. Its sad that no license offered in the licensing thread or any restrictive license i know of from existing mods include such an abandonment clause.
