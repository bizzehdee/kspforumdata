I\u0027m no multi-threading expert, but it seems the issue is having real-time-like events that need to be aware of each other in real-time-like contexts must generally occur within a single thread. Otherwise things probably get bogged down with inefficient inter-process communications issues that cause the threading to slow things down rather than speeding them up. Basically any task the game can launch a different program to perform, and have that data come back later without synchronicity, can be easily offloaded onto a different core. the problem is there may not be very many of those things, or it may be difficult to design those things into the game without creating gaping holes for new bugs.

If a welding-like optimization was done as parts were connected together, you might be able to get the software to see fewer parts as the game was manipulating the joined object. Obviously you are no longer doing as much physics between each connected part, so to simulate reality you would have to continually analyze the cross-object stresses, and when certain thresholds were exceeded, the joined object would need to be partially un-joined to display the results of the physical stress. And by the way, this set of tasks could probably be performed as processes off-loaded onto different cores. It might mean that there would be a slight delay when you do something to make your rocket break in half, but it would mean that more complex rockets would fly with better frame-rates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut this would probably come at a cost, When you built a new craft, it would probably take longer to show up on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother way to use threading, which wouldn\u0027t help any of us, would to put other solar systems on other cores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s see what we get with .23, where I read that we will be seeing a lot of effort to improve efficiency.
