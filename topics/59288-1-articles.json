I think it was solely because of struts/lines appearing in the CRAFT file before the part that they were connected \u0022to\u0022. If you are building a craft, you probably put on struts and fuel lines last so they are fine. But if you copy a sub tree, it probably sorts the parts by parent, thus potentially breaking struts and fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
