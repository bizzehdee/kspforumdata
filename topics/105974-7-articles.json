I will be putting out part 3 and possibly 4 of the video series today and will pull myself away from an epic weapon for BDAFPS (I\u0027m so happy with it!). And finally do the last missile for R-10 and finish the unity stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER-10 will be a missile update but also add one new utility part. I am becoming more and more confident in my 3D modeling skills and intend to move into turrets and vehicle weapons in R-11 if I get into plugin making I intend to try some functional Explosive reactive armor. As for what kind of turrets I will making I am thinking something like the turret for a Russian T-90 and some lighter guns such as the turret of an M-2 Bradley or Russian BMP. I also want to make some aircraft cannons such as a Gsh-30. Perhaps some heavy artillery? R-11 however will be released only after a good break since I am currently involved heavily in BDAFPS as the primary modeler and texturer for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-09T20:23:48Z\u0022 title=\u002209/09/2015 08:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LORDPrometheus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
