The rest of the detailing will come from texturing the parts. I am done animating the antenna, it has 3 animations baked into one. The first animation rotates the antenna from a horizontal position parallel to the lander up in a 90 degree vertical position. It then extends its telecopic piston, and finally pivots and pans the antenna by using its hinge on the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll models are imported into Unity and I am currently working on the colliders for the \u0022c-bed\u0022 part, which turns out, is the most difficult one to get done.

It is not as easy as using a mesh collider or a box collider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway that\u0027s all I have to report at this moment.
