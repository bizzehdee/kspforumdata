That said, the greenhouse section is not the mod. The landing base is.

Interesting. Providing, at the very least, a template model with an example config for a properly oriented and configured \u0022module\u0022 for the rack would help other modders make use of this.\n\nFrom the image, however, it looks like orientation isn\u0027t necessarily required to be horizontal. For instance, the second building in the first image is oriented vertically (despite the height of it being almost identical to the width, which would beg the question \u0022which is height and which is width?\u0022) and *that* will be the trick: how to configure the part to accept connections from differently-oriented modular... uhh... modules.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T17:12:31Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas**"},{"CreatedByName":"liquidhype","CreatedById":112415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T17:10:04Z","Content":"Hello Felbourn, and everyone else!\n\nI\u0027ve been very busy at work the last couple of days, so have not been too active here unfortunately.\n\n**Just a small update from my side:**\n\nI\u0027ve improved the models since last time, geometrically speaking. The rest of the detailing will come from texturing the parts. I am done animating the antenna, it has 3 animations baked into one. The first animation rotates the antenna from a horizontal position parallel to the lander up in a 90 degree vertical position. It then extends its telecopic piston, and finally pivots and pans the antenna by using its hinge on the top.\n\nAll models are imported into Unity and I am currently working on the colliders for the \u0022c-bed\u0022 part, which turns out, is the most difficult one to get done. It needs multiple colliders in order to work how I envisioned it would, meaning I want to configure it in such a way that it is possible to surface attach parts to any flat area. It is not as easy as using a mesh collider or a box collider.\n\nAnyway that\u0027s all I have to report at this moment. If you (Felbourn), or anyone else wants to test out the models (untextured) as soon as I finish the colliders, I\u0027ll post a download link here. I\u0027d love some feedback on the models and animation before I finish the parts, in case there is anything I need to add/remove and so on.\n\nAnd for anyone who still doesn\u0027t understand which parts specifically we are working on, everything in this picture except the \u0022tank\u0022 is what we are currently adding to the game. The base is divided into two separate pieces, while the antenna is the third.\n\n(*Picture of the old mode*l)\n\n![5Wnc6bY.png](http://i.imgur.com/5Wnc6bY.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-12T18:01:38Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2015 06:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by liquidhype**"},{"CreatedByName":"Felbourn","CreatedById":97344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T18:49:21Z","Content":"Yes the cradle will have a surface node on the curve and a stack node on the base.

At the same time I see lots of artists who have awesome parts but no idea how to make CFGs, or do game balance, or program C# plugins. It\u0027s the perfect marriage if we get together.
