I have a craft that seems to be stuffing up, its made up of procedural parts, stock parts, infernal robotics and KAS/Kis, it used to work fine, but as soon as i added a part from Kas it went Nan at launch, before the screen loaded the craft, then if you go into hangar (the building i used) the whole space is light blue, upon exit to space centre you see only stars and the background stars beyond Kerbin. after quitting game i check the integrity of game cache and 1 file was broken, this happens every time i do this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat should i do?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DiamondExcavater","CreatedById":72325,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T00:16:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei tested further on which parts it may be, i tried every modded part i used on my craft all on one small pod, none made the nan issue, i flew other craft and it works fine, i remade it and it doesn\u0027t work, it used to be good, and then the picture of the ship when loading crafts went missing and previously it was there. obviously there must a certain combination of pieces, i double checked the versions of the mods, infernal robotics claims to be 1.0.4 but my game says 1.0.2 and USI exploration pack is actually up to date, i really hate this because this craft is my main transporting vehicle and if i use it, the whole game breaks to the Nan Kraken at launch...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei hate the fact that just before it broke i didn\u0027t touch anything, i was happy with design for a while and one day out of the blue it breaks..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
