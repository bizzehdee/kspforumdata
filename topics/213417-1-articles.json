Autosaves generate a new workspace every time, and it\u0027s very easy to accidentally delete a workspace you actually want while clearing out the clutter. There\u0027s no \u0022Save\u0022 vs \u0022Save As\u0022 so you have an opportunity to accidentally overwrite another workspace every time you safety-save. There isn\u0027t a way to merge individual vessels to a new workspace; you can only merge whole workspaces.
