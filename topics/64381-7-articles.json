I shared my two cents earlier. Might was well throw my whole dollar out there now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI joined the paid KSP community back under .20.2. I\u0027ve noticed the amount that each change affected the game has slowly declined. Each update is becoming smaller and smaller. HavesteR wrote about these \u0022development asymtotes\u0022 in a dev blog. Now, I respect the hell out of the devs for what they have done, how far they have come, and what they have produced. But I am slowly losing faith that the game is actually going to get to a point where it seems \u003Cem\u003Ecomplete\u003C/em\u003E without mods. While parts-wise, we\u0027re getting closer, there\u0027s still things that should be added to properly balance out progression. The tech tree needs to at least have the option for a less tutorial-esque tree which is more appealing to veteran players. I\u0027ve accumulated roughly an hour of game time for every 2-3 posts I have (I hit 1000\u002B hours this February) so I\u0027d consider myself reasonably skilled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat concerns me is the amount of major, game changing things being back-burnered. Resources: postponed indefinitely (no longer guaranteed for KSP 1.0). Improved spaceplane parts: postponed indefinitely. Improved aerodynamics \u0026amp; re-entry heating: postponed indefinitely. Roll all three of these into one update, and you have something as game changing as .18. Right now, the only way to get these functionalities is with mods, and I thank God and the devs that this game is as mod friendly and supportive as it is. My problem is that there is no roadmap, not even a rough plan even within Squad. We have no way of knowing even roughly how far away things are. For all we know, these might not even make it into KSP 1.0. Heck, even resource mining is no longer confirmed for KSP 1.0. last I checked, it was listed as planned, but not guaranteed for complete version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat concerns me is a trend I\u0027ve noticed recently with some other games. Things get pushed back and back to the point of \u0027postponed indefinitely\u0027 and then left to be forgotten. This is not unintentional. I\u0027ve seen studios use this as a way to get around a community that vehemently wants something that they don\u0027t want to do for whatever reason. I\u0027d like to think Squad is better than that, but following a more recent PR incident (dating back to around November 2013), I\u0027m losing faith that they are. If I am right, then something \u0027being put on the back burner\u0027 really translates to \u0027we don\u0027t want to do this so we\u0027re gonna push it back and ignore it until it goes away.\u0027 And believe me, I REALLY don\u0027t want to be right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAddressing another issue brought up earlier, multiplayer. It was a taboo on the forums for the longest time and even though locking may have been to prevent the ad nauseum discussions, the mere utter of the word would get a thread locked. And Vanamonde, before you say otherwise, I\u0027ve been around long enough to see threads which were intelligent, productive discussions locked purely because they discussed multiplayer. It was a massive taboo. It was also stated offically by Squad that multiplayer was confirmed as a \u0027never to be implemented\u0027 item for KSP. It wasn\u0027t until one modder said \u0022F this\u0022 and built a working multiplayer client and the massive fan reaction which ensued that Squad realized how badly we wanted it. I think part of that stemmed from the fact that, being the taboo it was, multiplayer discussions were effectively censored and Squad probably had no idea how badly the community demanded it. There is a distinct flaw with the WNTS list in that the community has the power to change Squad\u0027s mind. Multiplayer is proof enough, but the community shouldn\u0027t have to effectively do the work for Squad before they agree to put it on the roadmap. WNTS, in all reality, makes it very very difficult for players to a) attempt to change Squad\u0027s mind, and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E suggest a suggested-to-death item in a new way which often makes more sense and is actually feasible in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, that may have been more than a dollar, but there\u0027s my thoughts.
