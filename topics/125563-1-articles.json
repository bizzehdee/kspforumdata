L. Hunley\u003C/em\u003E is a submarine built by the Confederate States during the American Civil War. In 1864, it attacked and sank the \u003Cem\u003EUSS Housatonic\u003C/em\u003E, thus making it the first submarine to sink an enemy ship. Unfortunately, the explosive which \u003Cem\u003EHunley\u003C/em\u003E used to sink the \u003Cem\u003EHousatonic\u003C/em\u003E also damaged the sub, and it sank with the loss of all eight crew members. In 1995, \u003Cem\u003EHunley\u003C/em\u003E was discovered at the bottom of Charleston Harbor, a mere 100 feet away from its first and only victim. In 2000, the sub was raised from the water and moved to a museum in Charleston, where it is preserved in an underwater tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uhXXWg6.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uhXXWg6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy\u003Cem\u003E Hunley\u003C/em\u003E isn\u0027t really a sub, since it can\u0027t dive, but then again, neither could the real \u003Cem\u003EHunley\u003C/em\u003E. At the front is the spar torpedo used for attacking ships. It was supposed to have been rammed into the hull of a ship by the sub and detonated, but in the game it works best as a ram. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FxYJwh2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FxYJwh2.jpg\u0022\u003EThe sub is so manueuverable, you shouldn\u0027t have any trouble hitting a ship with it, and thanks to a new weighted keel made from I-Beams, the center of mass is nice and low to prevent capsizing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6CXHnYe.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00226CXHnYe.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHunley \u003C/em\u003Emakes about 14m/s in the water, and can partially submerge if you wish, but it should be noted that the real one could not dive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be honest, there isn\u0027t really much you can do with this thing except ram ships, I decided to share it because its the first weaponized sub I\u0027ve made, and I don\u0027t remember seeing any replicas of the \u003Cem\u003EHunley \u003C/em\u003Ehere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalx.com/pTrevTrevs/HL-Hunley\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EDOWNLOAD HERE\u003C/span\u003E \u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAnyway, tell me what you think, leave rep if you enjoyed! \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ffffff;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EAnd please don\u0027t get offended because this is a Confederate ship.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-15T20:35:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery cool!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T20:29:51Z","Content":"\nLooks great!
