That was the problem. sojourner, I had installed the 2.09 available at \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/21mechjeb209/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/21mechjeb209/\u003C/a\u003E and it overwrote the parts files and made each command pod MecJeb-ready. I re installed KSP to restore the original files, then installed the MecJeb from page 1 of this thread. It only installed the MecJeb 2 (AR202) module and the required plugin .dll. This is what I wanted.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think this one was posted by the devs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benie","CreatedById":70327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-28T21:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, guys.
