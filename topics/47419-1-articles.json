The initiation energy for fusion is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.polywellnuclearfusion.com/NuclearFusion/FusionReactors.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Earound 5KeV\u003C/a\u003E (see graph). Using the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_barrier\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecoulomb barrier equation\u003C/a\u003E we can show that the point where the strong nuclear force takes over from the electric repulsion is equivalent to a radius of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er = k*e^2/U = 8.987E\u002B9 * 1.602E-19^2 / 5E3*1.602E-19 = 2.879e-13m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you still need to get a factor 300 closer to initiate fusion. The energy to overcome that barrier is equal to the initiation energy minus the potential energy at the current position.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EU(kin) = U(ini)-U(pot) = 5KeV - 8.987E\u002B9 * 1.602E-19^2 / 1e-10 = 5KeV - 14.4 eV ~ 5KeV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the potential energy provided by the adsorption of the Palladium is negligible. Now, lets see if palladium interactions can provide the needed kinetic energy. Let\u0027s treat atoms as perfect billiard balls to get an approximation of the velocities involved. Lets also be generous and say the system is at 1000 kelvin. We can approximate the kinetic energy of a single deuterium atom after a perfect momentum transfer from a Palladium atom with using \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ev = m(Pd)*sqrt(3kT/m(Pd))/m(H) = 25.7 km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE(kin) = 25.7e3^2 *0.5 * m(H) = 1.101e-18 J = 6.87 eV\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea, that doesn\u0027t even come close to the 5KeV needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I know the above approximations aren\u0027t an accurate representation of reality. But I don\u0027t feel like dragging my Solid State Physics books from my shelf and while using more accurate calculations will shuffle the numbers a bit it won\u0027t change the result 3 orders of magnitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFusion is simply a very VERY violent process, the energies and temperatures needed are baffling.
