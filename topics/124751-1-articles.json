Cubesats are, well, cubic and it\u0027s not a very stable thing aerodynamically. I\u0027m no expert but i think that they would both tumble chaotically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, a cubesats with an heatshield filming another cubesat...

Its just not feasible. Or needed. We get all the data we need just by first person views and distant 3rd person views on top of all the telemetry we get. Itd be almost impossible to keep the camera pointed to the target and youd see nothing. Just the blinding light of the plasma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I do want to see in the future is the views inside a returning cargo craft just before breakup. Theres been talk of doing this iirc. Just need a satellite above the craft capturing the communications seeing is how anything below the craft is in blackout.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-08T21:34:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2015 09:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Motokid600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-08T21:40:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I think only the shuttle was able to stay in communications throughout the entire reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-09T04:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think we just need telescope (either on ground or on space) with faster tracking capability, then zoom in reaaal close and manage to track the whole thing. There is no need for the observer to reentry along with the object. And if you ever play KSP and have 2 things reentry close to each other, you know how dangerous it is if one thing somehow flew off path and hit the other at that speed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
