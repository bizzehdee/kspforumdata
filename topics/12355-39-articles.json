When it starts its initial braking turn, it starts very soon, but doesnt compensate for the shallow approach later on so you come in at a shallow angle and and often overshoot/smash into the ground. Also, it will frequently line up the orbits correctly initially, but continue to burn and put me in an escape trajectory. There have been a few instances where it will align the orbit, then proceed to spin my ship uncontrollably. Once the initial braking turn is lined up (manually or by the grace of God) mechjeb will exit warp WAAAAYYYY too late which will overshoot every time if the approach is shallow, or it will undershoot if the approach is steep.
