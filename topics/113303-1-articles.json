Don\u0027t turn too fast or make any aggressive maneuvers. I usually like to disable SAS and rely on precision controls and the trim settings to control my glide slope.\n\n100 m/s is completely landable, but you can definitely go slower, assuming that your craft doesn\u0027t have tiny wings for its size. Just pull up more (or use trim settings) to increase your angle of attack and slow your descent. You want to be descending less than 5 m/s to avoid bouncing. Just before you touch down, you may also want to pull up slightly to flare. This slows your descent further, and also quickly slows you down.\n\nAbove all -- practice. Save the game when you\u0027re a few KM from the runway. If you crash, reload and try again.

About dropping too quickly: does your plane have enough lift at low speed? it may not have wings large enough to provide lift at the final approach speed (please note, it is easier to take off with small wings than to land, because during T/O you use full thrust oriented by the angle of attack).\n\n2. Find what the minimum safe speed is with your plane at very low altitude. Just fly straight, low and slow, and see when you can keep altitude from dropping further. Any slower will bring your plane to stall. That speed is the absolute minimum you must never go below during approach. Also, take note of the angle of attack when you can keep altitude at the minimum speed.\n\n3. It is possible to fly with just a keyboard, but exercise with the throttle control (shift, ctrl). During approach the angle of attack is generally kept fixed, and rate of descent is a function of thrust, so you have to be able to change thrust fast enough to correct.\n\n4. SAS may actually fight against a plane natural attitude, and induce oscillations or worse. With a plane built to be stable there is no need to use SAS (e.g., center of lift above the center of mass and positive dihedral angle help to keep roll neutral). Could be better to exercise flying without SAS.\n\n5. Choose a correct glideslope for your craft. Most aircrafts do with 2.5 - 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. It should allow your craft to descend without changing speed, while keeping vertical speed under control.\n\n6. With all the above set (airspeed, angle of attack, glideslope, correct amount of thrust), you start aligned with the runway aiming for the gate. Correct thrust when lowering gear (due to increased drag). Just before the gate start a flare (increase angle of attack and cut thrust), it will increase lift so reducing the rate of descent, while also depleting airspeed. With proper timing and amount the flare will make for a gently touchdown, and that is needed to avoid bumping back in air. Immediately apply brakes and level (angle of attack down to 0).\n\nand sorry in case you already knew most of the above ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif), but some points could turn useful for others too."},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T08:20:17Z","Content":"Set the brakes for the front of the craft low (5 of 30 or so) and max the ones at the back, it will help with stability on braking. It can help to only start applying the brakes once all wheels are on the ground.\n\nKeep a bit of throttle on the engines to avoid stalling onto the runway and help with control (trust vectoring), just before or once the back wheels are on the runway cut throttle. The aim is to fly onto the runway gently (with the nose slightly up if you can) - As mentioned above it is your vertical speed that is key to successfully landing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T08:22:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 08:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dilli**"},{"CreatedByName":"BlueCanary","CreatedById":131301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T09:52:39Z","Content":"Try placing a flag at the end of the runway, setting it as target and holding the surface prograde vector over it. This really helps with judging glideslope from the third person, kind of fisheye-ey view ksp has. Also, watch the shadow to judge height over terrain and, at least on small planes, you can try and hold off a couple of metres above the runway for as long as you can until speed drops low enough that it just floats down. Big craft might run out of runway though. \n\nFor vertical speed the surface prograde marker on the navball is probably more useful than the vertical speed gauge, since it\u0027s nearer to the speed indicator and isn\u0027t logarithmic so it\u0027s easier to read.\n\nOr, try using something with lots of wings and drag as a trainer to get experience with landings before you try anything fast and heavy or without much wing. The stock Aeris 3a is quite good for this, it\u0027s maneuverable and slowish so it\u0027s nice and forgiving. \n\nAlso, don\u0027t rush, especially with big, heavy or fast planes. Take time to set up an approach from far enough back you have plenty of time to kill speed and make corrections, and if things are getting messed up don\u0027t overcorrect and crash, go around for another approach.\n\nFor runway alignment I find sideslipping works best for small corrections.\n\nAs diomedea says, what\u0027s the wing loading on your plane? As in, how much wing area does it have compared to mass? \n\nAs for design landing will be easier with lots of low speed control authority - so lots of control surfaces, and wide set undercarriage that points straight down so it doesn\u0027t roll and crash after touchdown.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T09:54:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 09:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by BlueCanary**"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T10:00:41Z","Content":"A drogue chute on the tail end goes a long way."},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T10:04:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Try placing a flag at the end of the runway\n\nOr better even, set a flag at both ends of the runway, so you have two dots to line up for a perfect approach!

For instance, spaceplane are harder to land, they usually have less wing surface.\n\n- If you plane turns too harshly, remove some of your control surface (especially for roll). \n\n- Airbrakes helps a lot on landing in the final few meters. Simply open them near the strip. You can then dive to the strip and you only have to nose up at the last minute.

You need to almost think about it as a completely different way of flying, and when you\u0027re in that sort of attitude, you work your elevator and throttle controls around the other way: if you want to go faster, push your nose down a little.. if you\u0027re falling too fast, give it a little more throttle. You should be able to just about stall it in.\n\nPractice makes perfect.\n\nkinda like this:\n\n![c130_13.jpg?w=1170](http://i0.wp.com/bp0.blogger.com/_JGRd43QLug8/RbEfpj6TYCI/AAAAAAAAAG0/v8CXT8_OK7M/s400/c130_13.jpg?w=1170)"},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T22:40:16Z","Content":"Landing is a balance of several things. Here are just a few of my observations.\n\nApproach: a good approach makes touch down easier. You want to line your flight up within 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 degrees of the runway (less is better) and tune speed for level flight (maybe a little less). The idea is to get closer to touchdown conditions so you don\u0027t need as much correction when you want to land. Runway flags can help with alignment and establishing a glide slope.\n\nFinal approach: you have good perspective on the runway. Align your approach. Remember you change heading with roll and pitch, not yaw. Check that gear and flaps are deployed.\n\nPoint of no return: this is where you make the decision to abort or land. If you are too high or not aligned with the runway, abort! Don\u0027t attempt to land. Large corrections before landing is a recipe for disaster. Control surfaces are to control attitude and lift from here out. Use yaw to align heading with velocity, keep wings level, and use pitch for decent control.\n\nLanding: right before touchdown, flare the craft, use airbrakes, and/or pop landing chutes. You can easily handle 120 m/s on touchdown, but less than 80 is more sane. You want less than 10 m/s vertical velocity on the gear. Gear can typically handle rougher landings than your airframe can. Get in the practice of level touchdown. Landing torque can create surprising force and tail strikes are misfortuneate. Once you touch down, use yaw only to correct heading to stay on runway steering with wheels at high speed is a recipe to tip.\n\nAll my craft to date can stop in less than \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BC a runway. This gives you more flexibility in your point-of-no-return. The more flexible/later you make that point the easier your landings. Landing a powered glider that can maintain stable flight at 60 m/s is trivial. Landing a space plane that needs 140 m/s for level flight requires some thought. Landing a glider with a 160 m/s glide slope is tricky.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T00:13:43Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 12:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"arien101","CreatedById":145813,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T23:31:51Z","Content":"Thanks for the great responses.
