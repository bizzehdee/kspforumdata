About dropping too quickly: does your plane have enough lift at low speed? it may not have wings large enough to provide lift at the final approach speed (please note, it is easier to take off with small wings than to land, because during T/O you use full thrust oriented by the angle of attack).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Find what the minimum safe speed is with your plane at very low altitude. Just fly straight, low and slow, and see when you can keep altitude from dropping further. Any slower will bring your plane to stall. That speed is the absolute minimum you must never go below during approach. Also, take note of the angle of attack when you can keep altitude at the minimum speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. It is possible to fly with just a keyboard, but exercise with the throttle control (shift, ctrl). During approach the angle of attack is generally kept fixed, and rate of descent is a function of thrust, so you have to be able to change thrust fast enough to correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. SAS may actually fight against a plane natural attitude, and induce oscillations or worse. With a plane built to be stable there is no need to use SAS (e.g., center of lift above the center of mass and positive dihedral angle help to keep roll neutral). Could be better to exercise flying without SAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Choose a correct glideslope for your craft. Most aircrafts do with 2.5 - 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0. It should allow your craft to descend without changing speed, while keeping vertical speed under control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. With all the above set (airspeed, angle of attack, glideslope, correct amount of thrust), you start aligned with the runway aiming for the gate. Correct thrust when lowering gear (due to increased drag). Just before the gate start a flare (increase angle of attack and cut thrust), it will increase lift so reducing the rate of descent, while also depleting airspeed. With proper timing and amount the flare will make for a gently touchdown, and that is needed to avoid bumping back in air. Immediately apply brakes and level (angle of attack down to 0).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand sorry in case you already knew most of the above \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E, but some points could turn useful for others too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dilli","CreatedById":142986,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T08:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESet the brakes for the front of the craft low (5 of 30 or so) and max the ones at the back, it will help with stability on braking.

This really helps with judging glideslope from the third person, kind of fisheye-ey view ksp has.

Here are just a few of my observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApproach: a good approach makes touch down easier. You want to line your flight up within 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 degrees of the runway (less is better) and tune speed for level flight (maybe a little less). The idea is to get closer to touchdown conditions so you don\u0027t need as much correction when you want to land. Runway flags can help with alignment and establishing a glide slope.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal approach: you have good perspective on the runway. Align your approach. Remember you change heading with roll and pitch, not yaw. Check that gear and flaps are deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint of no return: this is where you make the decision to abort or land. If you are too high or not aligned with the runway, abort! Don\u0027t attempt to land. Large corrections before landing is a recipe for disaster. Control surfaces are to control attitude and lift from here out. Use yaw to align heading with velocity, keep wings level, and use pitch for decent control.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding: right before touchdown, flare the craft, use airbrakes, and/or pop landing chutes. You can easily handle 120 m/s on touchdown, but less than 80 is more sane. You want less than 10 m/s vertical velocity on the gear. Gear can typically handle rougher landings than your airframe can. Get in the practice of level touchdown. Landing torque can create surprising force and tail strikes are misfortuneate. Once you touch down, use yaw only to correct heading to stay on runway steering with wheels at high speed is a recipe to tip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll my craft to date can stop in less than \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BC a runway. This gives you more flexibility in your point-of-no-return. The more flexible/later you make that point the easier your landings. Landing a powered glider that can maintain stable flight at 60 m/s is trivial. Landing a space plane that needs 140 m/s for level flight requires some thought.
