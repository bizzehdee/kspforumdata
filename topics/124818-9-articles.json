I can play several hours without memory or other problems. However, there are some rare sudden and strange things, nearly impossible to repeat. They are not due the memory leaks (bugs can happen at 3 G allocated memory whereas memory problems begin after 3.5 G) but restart of the game helps. For example sometimes some part of the craft hits to invisible part of the launchpad according at height of about 20-40 m from surface and explodes. Once a spherical tank near the pad exploded without reason before I hit the space to ignite engines.
