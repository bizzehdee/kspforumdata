I go ahead and pull prograde and then set a little bit of radial as the two apses get close to one another, then continue slow prograde pulls until they\u0027re relatively close to one another (that\u0027s probably not efficient at all, but it does work). I then split the burn - however long of a burn is indicated, I figure up half of it and begin my burn that many seconds ahead of the node. For short burns, I might multiply the time by three before splitting it, and then pull the burn at 1/3 thrust. I usually wind up with the apses within 500-800 meters of one another, probably more precise than what\u0027s absolutely necessary for most cases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kiwiak","CreatedById":82796,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T16:53:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EApoapsis surf, thats cool name of technique \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks, i wil try it out\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T17:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you have a really low TWR, have the time and aren\u0027t worried about falling back into the atmosphere (i.e. you are already above it), you can circularize over several orbits. Just do your burn near the Ap, wait till the next Ap, and burn again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cocoon90","CreatedById":102643,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T18:30:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you reach apoapsis, even with TWR \u0026lt; 1.00 you can circularize your orbit. When you plan you maneouvre node, for example your burn is 60 seconds, point your nose in the node direction, and at -30 start to burn. if you have a 2:00 minutes burn, at - 1:00 minute to node start to burn. To be precise, you have to consider that in that period of time you burn fuel, so your vessel gets lighter, and you accelerate linearly faster as you burn fuel (your TWR slightly raises). For a 60 s burn, for example, start the burn at more or less -25 s, not -30s, because as you burn fuel, you go faster and you estimated burn time variation slightly drops. I usually go full throttle, then when I get 20 m/s \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV i cut off the engines (X) and i fine tune the remaining \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACV at 10% thrust. Doing this you don\u0027t raise your apoapsis and you get a nice round (with an error of maximum 500 m between apoapsis end periapsis if you do it correctly). If you get periapsis = apoapsis you was lucky as hell, so don\u0027t expect to get a perfect orbit at first burn.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
