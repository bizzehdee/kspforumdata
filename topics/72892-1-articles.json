I built a simplified rocket to test various aspects (heat shield deployment, strut integrity, stability, etc.) and to my pleasant surprise it was able to make a 200km orbit flying manually without staging or using the last two stages (which had roughly 4km/s of dV between them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question to those who are more experienced with that purple orb than I is this: Does it sound like this would be enough to lift off from Eve and make a stable orbit for rendezvous?
