I don\u0027t always want this to automatically happen when I\u0027m close to the side of my spacecraft, however. Maybe make it a pop-up alpha key function option like boarding a spacecraft is. Honestly the first time this happened I thought it was a bug, and didn\u0027t know it was a \u0022thing\u0022 until reading about it in the forums.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
