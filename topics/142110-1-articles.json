Also, to land on chutes, you should reenter at the shallowest angle possible, to maximize aerobraking on the way to land. I once landed straight from an interplanetary encounter, and I started gaining altitude after I passed periapsis, a couple hundred meter above the surface. This stops you from going downwards too fast for you chutes to slow you down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strigon","CreatedById":123021,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-20T00:26:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m assuming you mean to land and then return?\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf it\u0027s just getting there, it\u0027s no different than going from Kerbin to the Mun, only slightly more intensive and finicky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor landing, don\u0027t bother with a heat shield; Duna\u0027s so small, and its atmosphere is so thin that it shouldn\u0027t be an issue.

Prior to 1.1 it was often hard to slow down enough for chutes to safely deploy, but I think the chutes can deploy at higher speeds on Duna now. If having that problem, wings can help a lot to keep your vertical speed low as you bleed off horizontal velocity. While you could spam chutes to touch down without rockets, its a matter of diminishing returns. To reduce vertical speed to 1/2, you need to increase your chute mass by 4x. Going from a 20 m/s to 10m/s descent velocity on chutes only saves you ~10 m/s ... the fuel for a quick retroburn of 10 m/s is going to be less massive than a 4x increase in chute area. So I would stick to 1 drogue and 1 main chute (or pairs of radials)... maybe more for larger vessels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs with many bodies in KSP, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E required is so low that you might as well single stage it rather than carrying decouplers and multiple engines.
