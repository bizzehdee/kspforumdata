The mission control building should be where missions are planned, and archived. Also this building is where the big mission control actually is, and based on the windows, launches would be observed by press and public. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think a new building, or buildings, for management would be appropriate at the space center. This building would basically be an office building where contracts are signed, loans made, purchases done, and reputation managed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Any related ideas to add to this thread?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.
