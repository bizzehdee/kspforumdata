Is it possible to remove, and or make the smoke or contrail effect dissipate as the vehicle gains altitude, and vanish as it leaves the atmosphere? I used this mod the other day and launched a kerbal x. There was still a trail of smoke behind the mainsail engine at 100k altitude.\n\u003E Also, has anyone started a config for procedural parts solid rocket boosters?\n\nThat smoke thing shouldn\u0027t be happening...
