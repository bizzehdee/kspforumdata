I swear I remember reading that C7 had a new wing module almost ready for release when v0.15 was released.

I only ask because the current lift model causes some... odd... things to happen, like any wing-part that breaks off the craft doing a a ridiculous, paranormal glide for miles and making stacking wings on one spot of a plane stupidly over-effective.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-23T16:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPriorities and schedules change in alpha stage development. I\u0027m sure an update in the future will be devoted to planes/spaceplanes in general. Probably right after a real drag model is in place instead of the placeholder code we have now.
