One was a relaunch of a mission I accidentally ended. The second was a Kethane support structure and crew return vehicle stacked on top of a nuclear interplanetary stage. Ejection for the second ship too longer than I thought it would, due to low TWR and the phase angle after the necessary passes to finish the burn the phase angle was 359.55. Will this half a degree prevent me from rendezvousing with Duna properly?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Closest approach according to Protractor before leaving Kerbin SOI is 1.13Gm.
