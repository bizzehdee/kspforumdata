I have only landed on Laythe, of Jool\u0027s moons. And as far as I can remember, I\u0027ve never actually had a successful landing on Dres (apart from a single extended landing leg... dunno quite how that survived the lithobraking). But I have put debris on a lump of rock at every planet. So i\u0027ve got that going for me, which is nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI... may have broken KSP at the moment. I can\u0027t figure out how to fix, or re-cause the problem, but I\u0027ve stopped seeing the science reports. That\u0027s fun. I\u0027m probably going to reinstall fresh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cannot remember not liking space. But at my heart, I\u0027m a writer. I hope to be an author, someday. Without a secondary job.
