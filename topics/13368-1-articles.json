Although maybe that was when the atmosphere just stopped at 35k. However if we do get info on the air density this will mean 1)Kerbals will have low voices (if get voices/have similar vocal systems to human ones) 2) The speed of sound will be higher (I\\\u0027d love this defined, maybe we\\\u0027d get some sonic booms) - I struggle to go much faster than Mach 2 with a jet at the moment so it could provide more of a challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-28T14:24:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VincentMcConnell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022VincentMcConnell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s the problem, though.

The game\\\u0027s drag equation has an extraneous mass term and there also seems to be an extra density scaling factor of 0.0008 that gets applied to the density equation I\\\u0027ve quoted above.

That would be approximately true for any rocket ascending vertically at a fuel optimal speed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EModel flight profile and .craft file attached if you are interested, and I have reposted a graph of drag and velocity vs. altitude for the close-to-optimal ascent profile and unpowered fall back to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease take a look at the ascent profile, which would be similar in shape for most spacecraft up to 18km. After the initial boost at 100% throttle, the combined effects of (1) decreasing mass and (2) especially the rapidly decreasing density with altitude, more than compensate for the increasing velocity-squared term in the drag equation, so that the total drag force decreases smoothly all the way to MECO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the fall back down to Kerbin\\\u0027s surface (here from 34500 m, but similar for re-entry from orbit) most of us have seen the rapid deceleration that occurs around 8-10 km altitude due to the exponentially thickening atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
