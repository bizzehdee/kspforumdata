You just have to hope that once you\u0027re picked to be in a space program, you\u0027re going to a good one. Everyone wants to be part of Scott Manley\u0027s space program, and everyone wants to be on a KSPTV Streamer like Shimmy or Kofeyh, and there are a whole lot of space programs no one wants to be in. Xactar, for instance, can be rather cruel, but he seems to value us to some extent, if not only for some small amount of conversation. And he does apologize whenever one of his Kerbal astronauts dies. But there\u0027s one space program none of us want to be redirected to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne shudders to imagine what inhuman, unkerbal thoughts lie behind that screen, what dreams of chronic and sustained cruelty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was once happy to meet the famous Jebediah Kerman. When I mentioned the Two Thousand Four Hundred and Sixty Second space program, his badass smile drooped. \u0022I fear no director. But that... thing... It scares me.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThroughout all of Kerbin Prime, The Director of that space program goes by many names. \u0022The Torturer\u0022, \u0022The Killer\u0022, \u0022Xactar\u0027s Evil Twin\u0022, \u0022Danny.\u0022 This space program has never held a good reputation since Stardate Zero-Fourteen. Since then, he has shown not only disregard for all kerbal life, but a disdain for it. He once taunted his kerbals with a nice christmas tree. Of death. He once promised he wouldn\u0027t kill a bunch of us, then magic\u0027d some Solid Fuel Boosters on top of the ship. This madman makes us all shudder. There\u0027s millions of astronauts, and only one Danny.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy story is no worse than any other of Danny\u0027s Kerbals. My name is Kirrim. I used to be called Anbur. I went from Hero to Zero, just like that. I was once one of Scott Manley\u0027s Kerbanauts, one of the more prestigious in fact. I was a special agent, deploying a space satellite. One wrong touch of the wire... anyway I\u0027m sure Manley would merely have used the power of Eff-Fiev to fix that. But instead of reverting, I was reborn at the astronaut megacomplex on Kerbin Prime. I was quickly shuffled into the Astronaut Line, and then... The horror of the moment made me drop down into tears as many Kerbals of this space program do upon being hired. I was chosen for The Two Thousand Four Hundred and Sixty Second space program. Worse of all, The Torturer cloned me, and would not hesistate to recreate me any time I died. And the thing about death in Danny\u0027s universe. I\u0027ve seen the other side. I\u0027ve been there. There\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Enothing\u003C/em\u003E there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I\u0027ve finally been respawned, and due to a glitch in the system, I\u0027m back on Kerbin Prime. And there\u0027s only one thing I can ask before I have to be chosen again.
