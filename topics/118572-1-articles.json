The YouTube comments section didn\u0027t help what-so-ever (and neither did a post in the FTD forums), and the campaign was going kind of poorly. The series was put on hiatus for awhile. Then EnterElysium streamed FTD today, and my interest in the game was renewed. So I\u0027m likely going to be resuming the series in the very near future, but I still have no names for my ships, and I don\u0027t want the series to become me naming every single ship myself. That just isn\u0027t including anyone!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I thought I\u0027d check to see if any of the members of my favorite forum would like to submit usernames or names to be used. Usernames (Along with usernames from other websites or real names, if that is your thing) will be selected before other, miscellaneous names. Names of sunken or scrapped ships may be re-used in the future as well, depending on how well said ship did. These names will not be applied to small boats BTW, only warships of significant size will get sub names (And I intend to make my fleet out of said ships). Names will be put into a pool and selected either randomly or with good reason 9I\u0027ll probably make two pools, one for usernames and one for miscellaneous names. I may start up another pool for names for the smaller boats in the near future. For now, try to limit yourself to 1 name submitted for every few episodes. This is to be fair to those who wouldn\u0027t have their names selected if someone submitted a large number of names. In the future, this rule may relax more. I do not accept inappropriate names, and I don\u0027t believe this forum does either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELink to my youtube channel: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/noname117spore/videos\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/noname117spore/videos\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice: I do use profanity in my videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice 2: I\u0027ll get a FTD playlist set up shortly and replace my channel link with that in the near future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to all those who submit names for my ships, and the first poster here will get to name the currently unnamed destroyer in my series.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whackjob","CreatedById":71402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T03:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can tell anyone here that FtD is a great game.

My previous series got axed with an update of FTD, and I just got the first 3 episodes of the new season recorded. From The Depths may also be gaining a bit of popularity from Robbaz and EnterElysium, so there may be more interest in this now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027m trying to stray away from corny/epic/futuristic names, I\u0027ve really only had 4 names I\u0027ve accepted (Whackjob, and 3 of Flymetothemun\u0027s), which isn\u0027t going to last me long into the series (especially if I want the ships of the first class to be named after viewers). So I\u0027m bringing this thread back as a new series starts.
