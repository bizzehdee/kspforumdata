between 2 and 10% reduction in costs for increasing the R\u0026amp;D budget probably between 20 and 50%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think most people here are mistaking my fundamental

person to Mars for 1-2 tons of payload, and enough people would buy a $280k ticket to send a million people at that price. \u00A0But you *NEED* at least 8-10 tons or so of cargo on the Martian surface in ADDITION to that to survive long-term, otherwise all you get is a \u0022flag-and-footprints\u0022 mission. \u00A0And too few people would be both able and willing to buy a\u00A0$1.4 million

SpaceX needs to draw up an even lower-cost plan than what they have now, and then take as long as necessary to fund its R\u0026amp;D out of existing operating profits if capital costs from borrowing

Railroad towns grew because people see opportunities in servicing trains stopping in a refilling stop, enough so that some people willingly build houses nearby to keep themselves available to the next train using the stop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s simply not accurate. \u00A0Yes, sometimes towns grew up around refueling stops- but railroads often also built spurs to the middle of nowhere (technically to tiny farming hamlets) in the American West because they knew that towns would grow up around the stops. \u00A0The towns had natural resources (farmland, metals, etc.), they just hadn\u0027t been developed yet. \u00A0And ultimately, just like with Mars, passengers were the most lucrative, sometimes the only profitable cargo from these small towns (where it simply wasn\u0027t worth the loading-time to pick up the small amounts of freight they generated).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EYou\u0027re obfusticating the facts partly by confusing the timelines.\u00A0 You\u0027re\u00A0talking about patterns\u00A0in the very early days of railroads, almost entirely on\u00A0the already-developed East Coast and to a lesser extent in more developed parts of the Midwest. \u00A0I\u0027m talking about what happened in the frontier of the American West, decades later.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-10T16:02:54Z\u0022 title=\u002210/10/2016 04:02  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 10, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-10T16:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222795773\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476115096\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291005\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n5 minutes ago, Northstar1989 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, sometimes towns grew up around refueling stops- but railroads often also built spurs to the middle of nowhere (technically to tiny farming hamlets) because they knew that towns would grow up around the stops. \u00A0The towns had natural resources (farmland, metals, etc.), they just hadn\u0027t been developed yet. \u00A0And ultimately, just like with Mars, passengers were the most lucrative, sometimes the only profitable cargo from these small towns (where it simply wasn\u0027t worth the loading-time to pick up the small amounts of freight they generated).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s because the railroad company knew ahead of time that there is actually something worth carrying elsewhere.
