Or is there a mod that changes parts properties at runtime, and then you could make the update in the .cfg file once the values are confirmed as good?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-30T05:31:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore the great forum oops, there was a thread discussing a mod that could reload a specific part without reloading everything, but I didn\u0027t track it down in time, sorry.
