How high are you?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How many jet engines?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. A picture of your plane would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELacking the required information, I\u0027m assuming you are using a spaceplane with at least two jet engines. So, you are probably flaming one engine out, which causes the plane to yaw right or left, depending on which engine flamed out first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is not really a good fix to eliminate asymmetrical flameout (in stock KSP at least). One solution is to cut your jet engines prior to flameout, and switch to rocket engines. You can delay the flameout by reducing thrust at altitude, but eventually you are going to run out of atmospheric oxygen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might also want to reconsider your flight profile. Pitching up at the top of your climb is not really an effective way to reach orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA different approach would be to accelerate horizontally, getting as fast as you can at the highest altitude which does not cause flameout. I typically achieve 2400m/s orbital velocity at 41,000m. At that point, I shut off the jets, and activate the rocket(s). At that point, a small amount of rocket thrust will push the AP above 72,000m (if it isn\u0027t already). There is no need to \u0027pitch up\u0027, just continue burning prograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt AP, another short burn from the rocket(s) will circularize the orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, not sure how KSP handles this, but jet engines typically only work well with the air flowing straight into the intake. \u0027Pitching up\u0027 is going to reduce airflow into the intakes, making your flameout possibly occur at a lower altitude. To see this effect clearly, fly level at about 10,000m altitude. Pitch your aircraft up (or down) so it is pointing away from the prograde marker. Watch your intake air as you do this- you should see the intake air indicator drop off significantly as you point the nose away from prograde. Rockets don\u0027t really care which direction they are pointed, but jet engines do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T04:07:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the very upper reaches of the atmosphere, there isn\u0027t much air to push against. Suddenly upsetting your attitude via rapid pitch changes might just be more than your control surfaces can recover from. An enormous tail is one option, but an easier fix might be to just add some thrusters and monopropellant (or Vernor engines) to help you maintain stability during that transitional regime. It could be one of those rare cases where you want to have reaction-control (R key) and SAS (T key) enabled at the same time. Probably would only be necessary for a very short period of time until you get completely out of the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW I also agree with the poster above. A sudden pitch-up may not be your best move (although to be fair, I\u0027ve used this approach a few times myself). A very slight pitch-up or no pitch-up, combined with cutting over to rockets to just get your speed up a bit more, should be enough to propel you up out of the atmosphere and might actually be more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-08T04:10:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2014 04:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Empiro","CreatedById":112072,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T05:01:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you in FAR?
