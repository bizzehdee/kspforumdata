All my testing was done without these strut ends, and I\u0027m worried that if they have any physics impact it might kill the mission. I understand struts themselves are physicsless parts but adding their properties to the parent part could have a significant impact. Launching the ship parts again without any struts and re-assembling it wouldn\u0027t be too difficult, but I\u0027m lazy and curious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo strut remnants have any physics impact on the craft they are attached to?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-03T06:32:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll notice after a save/reload that only the end of the strut placed\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Efirst\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0remains.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs I remember, the 50-kg mass is added to the part to which the strut is first attached, and remains on that part.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI tried to measure drag of struts and found it to be negligibly small or zero.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you placed the struts by starting them on the parts to be dropped, their second ends should have no effect on the later stages.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t tested this in a long while, so let your curiosity triumph over laziness when you get the chance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bayesian_acolyte","CreatedById":195886,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-03T06:51:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the quick reply.

I didn\u0027t see any drag.
