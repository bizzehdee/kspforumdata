Eeloo is just a far place.. minimal thought. I\u0027m also not counting Jool, because it does serve a gameplay purpose, but its to be like a mini-solar system (which does have unique gameplay effects), so I often consider it like the Sun. Its a backdrop, not a place you visit,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nightingale","CreatedById":119307,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-08T05:51:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223347931\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173595\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221523118444\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002273725\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the team that added Krakensbane and procedural Mun craters and multi-orbit-predictive patched conics could add separate axial tilts to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf only they still worked here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have confidence that the people on the current team (most of whom I\u0027ve worked with) would be able to make it work, if given the opportunity.\u00A0 I had a look myself back when I had access and it didn\u0027t look\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etoo\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Ebad (keep in mind that looking and doing are two very different things).\u00A0 The worst part looked to be the day/night cycle stuff, not the actual axial tilt itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, 5thHorseman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding \u0022should\u0022s, Kerbin should be tilted to the Sun, 20-25 degrees so it\u0027s Earthlike.
