I always thought that it was a little annoying that in order to build something in orbit, the only parts that are at your disposal are docking ports. To me, I feel like that is a problem. It limits your ships and stations to a more linear design because they do not support more radial construction effectively, due to their lack of fixed angles for alignment, and week strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is where my idea would come in. My idea is to add more parts for orbital construction for stations and ships. It will ad a couple pairs of connectors that will allow anyone to build in any way they like, linear or radially. Strong enough to endure stresses of massive ships, and able to fix at certain angles so that if you want to add engine pylons that all your thrust in going in the same direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far it is an idea mostly. I have modeled a few of the parts already, but I would like some help in some areas. Mostly in the texturing, and a little bit about the coding.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what i got so far. The first one is a Pylon Connector with the second being a 1.25m Connector.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv data-role=\u0022contentPage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv data-role=\u0022contentPage\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ptNzy04.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage ipsAttachLink_image\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/ptNzy04.png\u0022 style=\u0022width:960px;height:auto;\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OCSusUz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://imgur.com/OCSusUz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-11-03T03:13:13Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2016 03:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by SkeeterFly\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
