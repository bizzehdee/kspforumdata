Normally I don\u0027t post this sort of thing because I find it really tedious to read when someone *else* posts their let-me-tell-you-about-my-game stories, but this was the most fun I\u0027ve gotten from KSP in a long time.\n\nI had a dinky little probe in munar orbit-- nothing much, basically just a HECS, Oscar tank (half empty), Spark engine, thermometer, antenna, couple of batteries, some OX-STATs. Was one of the earliest ships I launched in the game.\n\nAt some point after I hadn\u0027t had anything to do with it in a long while, I happened to be in the tracking station going through my ships and-- whoa, what the heck is *that*? Something was making a high-velocity beeline out of the Sonnah system and was already halfway to the SoI boundary. (It really stuck out because this was before I had launched anything exo-Sonnah yet.) Yes, it was my little munar probe, leaving Sonnah at something like 4 km/second.\n\nI was about to write it off, but then thought, hmm, can I actually go anywhere interesting with it?\n\n...Lave? Jool? Vanor? ...no, none of them anywhere near where they need to be and I really don\u0027t have much dV left. Hey, look, there\u0027s Titanus, that\u0027s not *too* far off. Why not? So I did a burn (even before leaving Sonnah\u0027s SoI) that used up nearly all of my fuel but got me into a Titanus encounter a year or two later. That\u0027s when the real fun started.\n\nAt this point I only had a bit over 2 units of fuel in my probe, total dV budget around 200 m/s. What can I do with that? How many places can I \u0022count coup\u0022 on and return a thermometer reading from?\n\nWell, I found out (to my surprise) that Titanus\u0027 atmosphere is very aerobrake-friendly, it simply makes no reentry heat. So after a lot of trial and error (quicksave is your friend) I was able to finesse the probe into a single aerobraking pass that put it in an Ete-crossing elliptical orbit without too much orbital inclination, and the ascending node was out at apoapsis. A little correction burn at Ap to null out the inclination and raise Pe out of Titanus\u0027 atmosphere, and I was all set to get Ete.\n\nThis means I got: 1. high Titanus space, 2. low Titanus space, 3. upper Titanus atmosphere, 4. flying at Titanus, 5. upper Ete space, 6. lower Ete space. Great, right?\n\n...But then I thought, how far can I milk this? Can I get to Tylo? At this point I had only a few dozen m/s of dV left, so no way to do a direct attempt, but what if I do an Ete gravity slingshot? Well, Ete is teeny-weeny and only gives the very gentlest of nudges. So here began an epic saga of stingy orbital finesse-- figuring out how to give *just* the right nudge (generally under 10 m/s) at Titanus periapsis so that I can get an Ete gravity assist half-a-dozen orbits later. Do that again. And again. And again.... each time raising Ap just that extra little bit.\n\nAnd finally I get caught by Tylo (giving me 7. high Tylo space)... and slingshotted right out of the Titanus system. Which (again, with a careful 1 m/s burn a couple of orbits before) headed me right back into the inner solar system on an inclined orbit whose ascending node fell smack on Jool\u0027s orbit. Give me a few years, and I\u0027ll have another 20 m/s burn to get a Jool / Ike encounter, and we\u0027ll see where we can go from there.\n\nGood grief, that was fun. The challenge of being able to go so many places and hit so many targets with vanishingly tiny nudges of dV... got more advanced orbital-mechanics practice in that sequence than in the last year of playing KSP combined. The sheer joy of puzzle-solving was incredible.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to say thanks again for a great mod, and I don\u0027t mind the Mun bug. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-23T09:09:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Okay, I just got bitten by the Mun-orbit bug in this mod, and I have to say that this is the most fun I\u0027ve ever gotten from a glitch. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNot sure if cheaty... or brilliant and cheeky way to make use of an unexpected situation... xD"}]}
