Something was making a high-velocity beeline out of the Sonnah system and was already halfway to the SoI boundary. (It really stuck out because this was before I had launched anything exo-Sonnah yet.) Yes, it was my little munar probe, leaving Sonnah at something like 4 km/second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was about to write it off, but then thought, hmm, can I actually go anywhere interesting with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Lave? Jool? Vanor? ...no, none of them anywhere near where they need to be and I really don\u0027t have much dV left.

So I did a burn (even before leaving Sonnah\u0027s SoI) that used up nearly all of my fuel but got me into a Titanus encounter a year or two later. That\u0027s when the real fun started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I only had a bit over 2 units of fuel in my probe, total dV budget around 200 m/s. What can I do with that? How many places can I \u0022count coup\u0022 on and return a thermometer reading from?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I found out (to my surprise) that Titanus\u0027 atmosphere is very aerobrake-friendly, it simply makes no reentry heat. So after a lot of trial and error (quicksave is your friend) I was able to finesse the probe into a single aerobraking pass that put it in an Ete-crossing elliptical orbit without too much orbital inclination, and the ascending node was out at apoapsis. A little correction burn at Ap to null out the inclination and raise Pe out of Titanus\u0027 atmosphere, and I was all set to get Ete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means I got: 1. high Titanus space, 2. low Titanus space, 3. upper Titanus atmosphere, 4. flying at Titanus, 5. upper Ete space, 6. lower Ete space. Great, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...But then I thought, how far can I milk this? Can I get to Tylo? At this point I had only a few dozen m/s of dV left, so no way to do a direct attempt, but what if I do an Ete gravity slingshot? Well, Ete is teeny-weeny and only gives the very gentlest of nudges. So here began an epic saga of stingy orbital finesse-- figuring out how to give \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ejust\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E the right nudge (generally under 10 m/s) at Titanus periapsis so that I can get an Ete gravity assist half-a-dozen orbits later. Do that again. And again. And again.... each time raising Ap just that extra little bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally I get caught by Tylo (giving me 7. high Tylo space)... and slingshotted right out of the Titanus system. Which (again, with a careful 1 m/s burn a couple of orbits before) headed me right back into the inner solar system on an inclined orbit whose ascending node fell smack on Jool\u0027s orbit. Give me a few years, and I\u0027ll have another 20 m/s burn to get a Jool / Ike encounter, and we\u0027ll see where we can go from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood grief, that was fun. The challenge of being able to go so many places and hit so many targets with vanishingly tiny nudges of dV... got more advanced orbital-mechanics practice in that sequence than in the last year of playing KSP combined.
