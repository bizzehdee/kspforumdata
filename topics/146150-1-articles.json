Then a bunch of \u0022biomes\u0022 (low orbit, high orbit, surface, ocean, highlands, lowlands, etc.) show up. Now, you click on them and every possible experiment/objective available (would probably differ based on what kind of strategy AKA program you have picked in the Admin Building) shows up.\u00A0Each of them has a fixed reward.\u00A0Once you\u0027ve picked the ones that interest you, you click the green tick button and the mission becomes marked as accepted.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis part is an \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eextra\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, so don\u0027t treat it as set in stone (or however this idiom is used):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would be best coupled with the strategies (or rather programs) offered by the Admin Building.

These grant you money only.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPR - mainly the World\u0027s Firsts (probably the easiest ones).
