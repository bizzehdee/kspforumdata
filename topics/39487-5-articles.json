Most importantly is a look at the effect of terrain settings on performance with a weak GPU. I recently switched from an AMD 7850 to an AMD 7750 and noticed a significant frame rate hit when looking at the horizon or ocean. This is a well known problem and there is a thread detailing how you can fix this: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43253-Default-Terrain-Quality-Without-most-of-The-Lag%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/43253-Default-Terrain-Quality-Without-most-of-The-Lag%21\u003C/a\u003E. This basically changes the ocean terrain setting to low, while the actual terrain setting can remain on default or high. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI put this plot in the fourth post about testing conditions, but I\u0027ll put it here too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1191.photobucket.com/albums/z469/grandyd/Kerbal/CPU%20Test/viewcomparison7750.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022viewcomparison7750.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is with the terrain setting on default. You can see that keeping the horizon in view has a huge effect on performance, it basically becomes GPU limited at 20 FPS until you get above 160km in altitude. Leaving the camera pointed to the side (i.e. not touching it once the rocket loads) helps, but there is still a performance hit. The best solution, and the one I made more clearly in the first post, is to tilt the camera up a bit. Just enough to keep the horizon out of view is enough to alleviate the terrain performance hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last test, shown in green, was done using the method described in the link above (changing the ocean \u0022minDistance\u0022 setting to 3), which helps, but still becomes GPU limited at about 30 FPS when keeping the horizon in frame (this is the worst case scenario).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll also notice that none of this has an effect on performance during the first stage. That dip in framerate around 60s occurs during the first staging event, when the bottom ring of SRBs are dropped. It\u0027s only later on, when more of the terrain becomes visible, that this becomes a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy recommendation for testing is to move the camera up a little, enough to keep the horizon out of frame.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is especially important if you have a weak GPU with a relatively powerful CPU. And while your thinking about it, you might as well make that setting file change, it can make a big difference. For high-end GPU\u0027s this shouldn\u0027t really matter.

I made several crafts with around 300 parts.

You can see that, for the most part, the framerate was pretty consistent at around 40 FPS. There are a few notable exceptions, the cubic octagonal struts are ignored by the physics calculations and that shows, it stayed at 60 FPS. OX-STAT panels kill performance, dropping it down to 20 FPS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I noticed is that parts that don\u0027t add any extra calculations don\u0027t have much of an effect; winglets, engines, and parachutes all give about the same performance as batteries. But if those parts require something beyond the basic physics calculations they can significantly affect performance. I assume that each accelerometer is making its own calculations, each engine has its own effects, and each solar panel has to decide how much sunlight is falling on it. Something like parachutes on the other hand just seem to add drag to the craft as a whole, and alter its center of drag (performance does drop a bit while they are deploying though). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also gave me a chance to make some interesting looking crafts.

This is another CPU benchmark widely used as a general indicator of CPU performance. It\u0027s pretty easy to find scores for different CPU models at various clockspeeds. For the missing Passmark scores I had to search a bit harder to find user reported values. In some cases I had to estimate based on similar overclocks (a 4.6GHz i5 3570k instead of 4.5GHz), but I think they are within a reasonable range. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe general trend is the same.
