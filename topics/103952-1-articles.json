Possibly even a story/Mission of Exploration.\n\nThanks, WMC"},{"CreatedByName":"Jumpyyoza","CreatedById":129390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T08:16:57Z","Content":"Have you been to the Desert Temple or the Old KSC on Kerbin yet? There\u0027s also the Vall-henge, the Face of Duna and the Mohole. If that isn\u0027t enough just remember that I cannot remember the rest of the stock Easter eggs and that there is Kerbin-Side which has a pack that adds more land based sites to explore and find.

Just remember to install the textures and Kerbal konstructs first otherwise you are going to have a bad time.\n\nHope this helps!"},{"CreatedByName":"WMC","CreatedById":60442,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T23:09:29Z","Content":"Thanks man!!"},{"CreatedByName":"Jumpyyoza","CreatedById":129390,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T07:09:09Z","Content":"No problem, just don\u0027t forget about the monoliths...
