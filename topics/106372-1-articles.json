If the thermometer is attached to another part, that temperature is also modified by conduction.\n\nNote that a lot of factors go into that--radiative area, area exposed to the sun, area exposed to the body under you (and that body\u0027s radiative temperature and emissivity, and albedo), distance from the sun and the sun\u0027s angle, etc.\n\nAll this means that any two parts, let alone a part and a kerbal, will have different resting temperatures even at the same instant in the same environment.\n\nThe \u0022external temperature\u0022 reported is the mean temperature of the atmosphere at that location.
