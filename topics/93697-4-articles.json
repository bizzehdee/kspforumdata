Sure, it\u0027s possible to turn crops like corn or sugar cane into ethanol fuel; the Brazilians have been doing it for years. What\u0027s not so obvious is that they require several industries alive at once to turn that bushel of corn into a quantity of fuel. Even then, the product is relatively simple; ethanol has the formula C2H6O, while octane (the largest component in common gasoline fuels) is C8H18. The reason why gasoline (and oil-based fuels in general) are cheap today is the fact that it\u0027s already there, in the crude oil, just waiting to be separated via fractional distillation. Even without mentioning the relative simplicity of distilling crude oil compared to the farming, fermentation, and distillation typical of an ethanol fuel production cycle, crude-oil-based fuels already win hands down against ethanol in terms of price.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T19:09:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022shynung\u0022 data-cite=\u0022shynung\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere\u0027s a difference between \u0027chemically possible\u0027 and \u0027can be mass produced at an industrial scale\u0027.
