The face smoothing had undesired consequences in blender. In reality its because I would have to select specific vertices on the surface to apply the smoothing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECritiquing my own part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No Iva (since I have never built an IVA space)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- It needs an EVA port (Near the bottom)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Visible depression and attachment Node coordinates for the Ports are not deep enough, needs \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Horizontal nodes need symmetry = value\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- On the north and south sides it needs EVA holds (climb handles)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Glass windows lack \u0027reflections\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Smoothing on surface triangles (except around the attachment nodes, this had a spoiling effect)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The cfg needs a crew capacity, and since it has windows it can serve as a command. (it should be moved to a different catagory)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The decompression chambers on the ports need submarine door graphics. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eoh and most importantly it needs a vanity Decal for the blingy stuff. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe station needs docking lights. The problem is that the ports need to be back lighted, with a LED emmissive, but since this is a stock part the altnerative is a telescoping boom with lights attached that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
