So Mk2 parts are fine as they are, it\u0027s my reentry profile that needs a rework...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EHowever...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on a spaceplane capable of agressive reentry. In a nutshell, it has the inflatable heat shield as a nose and retractable wings (courtesy of Infernal Robotics). It\u0027s actually working pretty good, but I\u0027m facing a problem with drag, and I don\u0027t know if the problems comes from DR or FAR:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- With the shield alone as the nose of the plane, the drag is insane, be it inflated or not: it actually doesn\u0027t make a difference (Cd value is the same). My several tons ship in a nearly vertical freefall with the heat shield deinflated hit the ground at barely 100m/s after a return from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- puting anything in front of the inflatable shield (shuch as another shield, or an air intake) negates entirely its drag, even inflated. Which means a lot more time to slow down in the upper atmo, and more overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, is the inflating animation just a visual trick ? From the amount of drag it generates, I would have said FAR consider it always deployed, but since hiding its center behind a small part makes the drag go away, I\u0027m confused.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-11T12:16:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELeaving aside the mod weirdness issues...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ablative heat shield is going to be a fairly high-drag part. Any object moving through atmosphere is going to want to rotate to place its centre of drag behind its centre of mass.

A couple of well placed linear RCS are enough to keep the ship pointed in the right direction, even during the hardcore part of reentry. Obviously there\u0027s no way to change your trajectory during this configuration, but that\u0027s the behavior I\u0027m looking for: agressive pod-like reentry. Leaving the drag issue on the side, I\u0027ve managed reentries from 300km orbits with an apo of 25 with a really decent stability.
