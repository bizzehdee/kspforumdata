Believe me, if you ever wondered why they banned religion and politics on the KSP forums, just look on NS. It is biased toward a certain view (I won\u0027t name it, stupidity would result) and if you don\u0027t agree with them, well \u003Cem\u003Etoo bad, get in line or get out.\u003C/em\u003E New people are often shunned in favor of the movers-and-shakers who have played for years. There were even a few people who liked a certain hateful regime of the past, and people actually put them among the top of the hierarchy. Yes, really. It wasn\u0027t just a toxic community--it was basically one giant barrel of toxic waste. I checked it recently--it\u0027s only gotten worse. Obviously, this was a bad first impression of the internet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you understand why I was suspicious of the KSP forum at first. But as it turns out, the KSP community is not at all like that. We are warm and kind. We welcome newbies. We respect differing opinions, and can even have civil debate on them. In all the time I\u0027ve been on the forum, I have seen exactly one true troll, and he was banned when he started getting really nasty. In other words, it restored my faith in humanity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted to thank the KSP community for its awesomeness. We will never be NationStates.

Of course the years have passed and things have flew behind, i gained new interests in computers and was starting to loose my interest in science. Then it seems like one day i find this game and its great. Honestly i was amazed, i couldn\u0027t believe how great the game was, i started to play more games after related to space like space engine.
