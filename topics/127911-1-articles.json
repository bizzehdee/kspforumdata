My speed at atmosphere edge is 5000m/s and I can adjust the angle to as low as needed. However, as soon as I pass 90km and the barometer is starting to move to the right, I explode in a few seconds.

What is the first part that goes? Is it the heatshield? If so, does the heatshield burn through all of its ablator before exploding, or does it just randomly pop while still having ablator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you\u0027re encountering is the \u0022Mars Atmosphere Dilemma\u0022. You are trying to slow yourself with atmospheric drag, but the atmosphere is so thin that it doesn\u0027t slow you down in any useful way... and yet, at the same time, it is thick enough for heat to be a problem. So your issue here is twofold:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.) The very edges of any atmosphere, even Eve or Jool, are useless for aerobraking. You need to dip down a little further to have useful amounts of air resistance. This is why you\u0027re not seeing your velocity change much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.) Your vessel has difficulties handling a short-term temperature spike. Both skin temperature and internal temperature are relevant - and if either value exceeds its limit, the part explodes. Now, the heatshield is supposed to keep its skin temperature low by consuming ablator (essentially trading the consumable resource in exchange for losing heat energy). However, the consumption of ablator doesn\u0027t happen at an infinite speed. If the heat buildup in the heatshield\u0027s skin is especially rapid, then the temperature may spike past it\u0027s limit and the part explodes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is especially important for high-speed atmospheric entries, because at very high speeds, you get a phenomenon called \u0027turbulent flow\u0027. That\u0027s when the normally smooth, laminar airflow around the spacecraft breaks up into something chaotic, which destroys the protective hypersonic bow shock that normally keeps the really high temperature shock heating zones away from the hull. KSP actually models this by sharply scaling up heat influx above a specific speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it\u0027s possible that your craft is encountering turbulent flow here, which spikes the heatshield skin past its maximum temperature tolerance. How to fix this? Chiefly by going slower, I\u0027m afraid. Your tolerances for extreme speeds are unfortunately much tighter than IRL, because KSP needs to greatly fudge shock heating physics in the first place - else you wouldn\u0027t even get overly warm on a normal low Kerbin orbit reentry. Ironically, this is where KSP\u0027s tiny solar system with its tiny orbital speeds makes things harder, not easier. Your 5 km/s Eve reentry speed corresponds to going something like 20 km/s IRL. That\u0027s absurdly high - \u003Cstrong\u003Eway\u003C/strong\u003E faster than anything manmade has ever traveled. Even New Horizons left Earth at \u0022only\u0022 16.25 km/s, and it\u0027s the current record holder for fastest spacecraft ever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, it\u0027s also possible that something else is happening, but without knowing more information, we can\u0027t tell.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-15T15:57:13Z\u0022 title=\u002212/15/2015 03:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T15:52:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcellent explanation by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002298962\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/98962-streetwind/\u0022\u003E@Streetwind\u003C/a\u003E, \u002B1 to that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne question-- what\u0027s your ship mass?\u00A0 You\u0027re supposed to be able to aerobrake at Eve at 6000 m/s, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/127840-how-do-you-handle-interplanetary-aerobraking/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2322759\u0022\u003Eaccording to developer NathanKell\u003C/a\u003E ... but that\u0027s with a fairly lightweight ship.\u00A0 If you\u0027ve got hundreds of tons shoving that heatshield along in front of you, you\u0027re gonna have problems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, airbrakes used to be da bomb when it came to atmospheric reentry, but these days they\u0027re much less useful for that-- they tend to overheat and explode pretty quickly.\u00A0 So it needs to be the heatshield doing the work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-15T16:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis needs more information.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDid you run out of ablator?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nwhat altitude did you burn up?
