compared to the losses of going straight up to orbital height then gaining horizontal height. \u00A0The takeaway I took from this was, it doesn\u0027t matter that much how early you start your gravity turn on Duna/Laythe/Kerbin (Eve I wouldn\u0027t be so sure of).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally speaking gravity losses are greater than drag losses, so yes it\u0027s better to make an early, fairly aggressive gravity turn. The limit on Kerbin and Eve tends to be thermal, ideally the rocket goes as fast as it can as low as it can without burning up. Duna can effectively be treated like a vacuum world; its cold, very thin atmosphere and reduced orbital speed means it\u0027s pretty unlikely you\u0027ll burn up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
