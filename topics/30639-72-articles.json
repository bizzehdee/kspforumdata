This has sharpened the handling right up and made it a true STOL craft at the same time. The added lift on the wingtips takes out some of the front-end lift and gives it a handsome bow at low altitudes and under heavy loads. The only drawback is the lack of flex has exposed an odd behaviour in the physics engine which seems to randomise the joint strength of symmetrically placed girders. This often leaves the plane with a barely noticeable asymmetry once the lift starts to flex it. There\u0027s no real impact except for the tiniest yaw moment when you come in to land with ASAS turned off. And by tiny, I mean probably a total of less than 5 degrees over a 1km approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried to keep the part count low, some air intakes came out but, all the accessories for release added whole bunch of bits and pieces onto the craft.

I\u0027m playing and releasing with stock only at this point. Mostly to get my designs into as many hands as possible. If you want to modify the craft, definitely send me the craft file and I\u0027ll include it in my catalogue once the entry is made. Unfortunately, RL issues dictate that I\u0027m not going to be updating my catalogue for another 3-4weeks. [sad face] The update package is going to be massive though. We\u0027re talking dozens of crafts. Good crafts. Great crafts!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing about the action groups. I have some tricky business setup with the inside engines so that they are overlapping action groups. This is about addressing pitch balance under different loads. You can turn off the bottom turbos to counter-act the natural pitch-up moment that the craft will go through when outside your flight envelope above 20km. You also turn of your turbos from outside-in sequentially 33% at a time to maximise usable airflow for thrust once you get to the outter reaches of the atmosphere. So, my recommendation is to keep all engines as separate parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne easy way to ditch a lot of parts is to clip the intakes as I use zero debug part clipping(I\u0027m all about stock, yeah!). Also, you can weld the wings but, don\u0027t weld the skeleton or you will drastically alter the balance and handling. The design is a result of a very long and detailed analysis of the behavioural characteristics of that airframe. It now has the exact strength and flexibility I was looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I should mention that I created \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/72938-Flyingfox-SSTO-Heavy-Lifter\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea thread for the Flyingfox\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-03-18T13:35:13Z\u0022 title=\u002203/18/2014 01:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 18, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by O-Doc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T16:39:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am gonna pass - the internals would be formidable. On the Millennium Falcon project Weld It was essential, but for example, I absolutely could not have the domes as welded parts, to add to the main chassis. I also attempted to mount internally attached (but protruding) engines for the VTOL group, and this turned out to be impossible. Welding your wings would be a plus, there would be zero flex with zero struts or whatever you\u0027re doing. I am doing an A/B video right now with a current design non welded and welded and the aerodynamics are not identical, although close. COM is preserved in the welding process btw. Still, something changes. I get what you\u0027re up to with the engine groups, I have had to do it albeit on a simpler scale for the same reasons. I\u0027ll PM you a link to the weld / no weld video. One other thing to my knowledge Weld It is not working with 23 at the moment. It has other limitations as well but most have workarounds.

On the Millennium Falcon project Weld It was essential, but for example, I absolutely could not have the domes as welded parts, to add to the main chassis. I also attempted to mount internally attached (but protruding) engines for the VTOL group, and this turned out to be impossible. Welding your wings would be a plus, there would be zero flex with zero struts or whatever you\u0027re doing. I am doing an A/B video right now with a current design non welded and welded and the aerodynamics are not identical, although close. COM is preserved in the welding process btw. Still, something changes. I get what you\u0027re up to with the engine groups, I have had to do it albeit on a simpler scale for the same reasons. I\u0027ll PM you a link to the weld / no weld video.

If you use something like Weld It then, the best bet is to combine all the intakes. The other thing you could do is weld the two main engine blocks down their length and pull out some of the struts supporting the individual fuel tanks. I\u0027m guessing the part count could go as low as 600 before the handling qualities of the plane starts to get affected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-18T22:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust a couple thoughts. I actually am still on v 0.22 \u0027cos Weld It doesn\u0027t work on 0.23 at this time. UBoZur is too busy in the real world. Yeah - struts are completely redundant when using weld it, in fact, they do crazy things aesthetically - one end attached - the other hanging out in space onto nothing. On or off has no effect after welding except those visuals. Intakes - as of right now - I believe they cannot be on whatever is welded, and retain their function. They\u0027d have to be added after welding. Engines - yes they can be welded and truthfully on something like this with a lot engines you WILL see a drastic increase in frame rate and play-ability because engines are one of the number one frame-rate killers as you I am very sure well know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeld it is kind of an all or nothing ventur, in my experience, to this point.
