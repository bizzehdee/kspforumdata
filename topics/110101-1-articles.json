If it would be I\u0027m re-posting in some way I do apologize for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m fairly new to this game, and it is a lovely game indeed. I have though realized there\u0027s something missing at least for me, and that is a proper testing area. As an example, while building a rover for Mun, the only area to actually test it on was around the launch pad. I took it for a spin, and ended up driving a fairly long bit in the reasonable pace this vehicle achieved, and after quite some time reached the hills to the west(?) of the Kerbal Space Center. It did strike me then though that a small area connected to the Space Center would be a very useful addition to test rovers, as an example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest area added to Kerbal Space Center, with various testing possibilities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Dunes and craterlike holes for testing rovers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Free fall facility to drop pods with chutes to get an idea how well the chutes will work on a certain spacecraft construction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engine rack to run engines with different fuel loadout and examine how they behave.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Rail for kerbal-strapped-to-rocket horizontal testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Anything else that might be needed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do alot of testing on the launch pad, but as for the rover as an example, that\u0027s simply not a suitable place to test it considering the enviroment it\u0027s going to operate in. Most other things can be tested on the launch pad, but I think it would be an interesting concept to have an actual test area for it, and depending on how it is made one might actually discover stuff you wouldn\u0027t find out doing the tests on the pad (and who wouldn\u0027t love to strap a kerbal to a rocket on rails?).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, in career mode this area could be upgraded, from starting with just a free fall facility to test chutes, to at next level include the engine rack when it\u0027s time for longer travel, and maybe finally the rover testing area.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThnx for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T15:19:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAha, I was originally thinking that this would be something like the microgravity chambers others had suggested for testing crafts, but I would greatly enjoy a testing area for landing and perfecting rovers! At the moment I just use the KSC itself, driving along the roads and using the bumps for the tracks leading up to the launch pad to test wheel tolerance. That does the job for the most part for me, but having some rough terrain a little ways away for testing would be phenomenal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot so sure how the engine rack, rocket-sled rail and free fall chamber would work/be necessary, though. Interesting ideas, but perhaps not quite needed as much as rough terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ampen","CreatedById":144505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T20:18:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, the initial idea was all about the trying out different rover configurations, and the other stuff I usually do on the launchpad, wich works for what I need tested. But since I play career I thought it might be interesting with some stuff that actually could be upgraded, although a testing area for rovers could be that as well, with a bigger area in higher levels, and more bumps, larger craters etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GeneralGuacamole","CreatedById":144627,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T01:03:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWould it be outside or in a warehouse?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex","CreatedById":75164,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T01:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI assume outside would be best, for ease of implementation.
