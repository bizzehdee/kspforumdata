I also have ActiveTextureManagement to keep RAM crashes at bay. The problem is that having very low resolution textures bothers me. I hate being able to see the pixels on the textures; it just doesn\u0027t feel natural. Is there any mod that can save me enough RAM to not have crashes?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T00:11:06Z","Content":"If you are running windows there something like open GL."},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T00:35:17Z","Content":"Try DDSloader maybe? You can use the DDS converter tool: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98672-WIN-KSP-to-DDS-texture-converter) to convert the stuff to DDS. I use both that and ATM and the performance is definetly better.\n\nUsing DDS will even fix the low res textures."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Jet","CreatedById":99880,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T07:35:29Z","Content":"DDS saves you load time, not memory. Though it\u0027s strongly recommended. \n\nForced OpenGL mode is what should allow you to use plenty of mods staying under 3Gb memory usage."},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T08:08:19Z","Content":"The DDS converter can do the same job as ATM \u0026 resize images though ( or your own converter/paint package can ). OpenGL or DX11 modes offload textures to VRAM \u0026 Texture Replacer will unload textures from memory so you save a GB or so. OpenGL seems to free a little more memory than DX11 but has worse issues for me. REMOVE ATM if you do this - all it does for me is use 400MB of memory for no reason.\n\nVen\u0027s stock revamp will save a bit if you remove the original Squad parts it replaces."},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-14T09:43:04Z","Content":"Hello, you can try the mod [Loading textures only as required](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73236) but it\u0027s in WIP and there\u0027s only an unofficial update of the dll for 0.90 which you can find here: [https://github.com/jamesb6626/KspLoadOnDemand/releases](https://github.com/jamesb6626/KspLoadOnDemand/releases)"}]}
