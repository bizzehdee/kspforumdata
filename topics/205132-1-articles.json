Residents that lived near the Dessert Airport saw a strange craft high in the sky. It was, as we now know, a C-2 being transported to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E after the last of the retired, obsolete C-1s had been delivered to the graveyard. The flight was nothing special, a climb to cruising altitude, then relax until landing procedures commence, and land at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E runway. Easy to handle for any astronaut, who Jebediah Kerman of course was at the time. And he preformed as expected, except when he dropped his muffin and nosed the plane down hard. But all was normal! And then, a bit later, 34 minutes and about 20 seconds into the flight, while closing his eyes and yawning, he went to turn up the heater. But of course, he missed, and pressed the abort button, instantly throwing him out of the aircraft and deploying his chute. This should be an outlier in the whole aircraft crash 3 minutes after takeoff and 8 minutes before landing statistic, but it wasn\u0027t. This happened 6 minutes before scheduled touchdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLuckily, the air traffik kontroller\u0027s inexperience and paranoia paid off. As soon as they saw the plane wasn\u0027t following the predicted kourse, instead of radioing in with Jeb, desperately trying to find the \u0022Radio on\u0022 button, they thought something terrible had happened, and instantly went into emergency mode, notifying the military their prototype was going to crash into a building, which I shouldn\u0027t joke about, lest I get a horde of vengeful amerikans.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe military, initially panicked their enemies would get access to the prototype, decided to do nothing about it. The plane was close to the equator, far away from the USSW, and anyway, it was at 13 kilometers, cruising safely, until it ran out of fuel, at which point, it would be destroyed. And so, they sent a single Jeep to recover Jebediah in the grasslands next to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EWhile the military \u0026amp; \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s reponse was quite reasonable, the public response\u00A0was, well, one \u0022misklick\u0022 started the popularity of extraterrestrial konspiracy\u00A0beliefs.\u00A0\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nA lot of cities are close enough to the equator to see a strange, white craft drifting across the sky. And because of the appearance of the C-2, boomerang-shaped front attached to the rear with 1 strut, can look like 2 kraft suspiciously bound together. Instantly, the morning, or nightly news were reporting on, \u0022strange craft seen in the sky, what does this mean?\u0022 or \u0022Aliens exist! strange kraft seen in sky!\u0022 News krews were happy to get such in-your-face statements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, at the end of it, the XC-2\u0027s engines finally cut out, and it rolled to the left before diving into Roswell.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe military was sad to lose a prototype, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E lost the military\u0027s trust, and Roswell bekame alien kapital of the galaxy, bringing in thousands of tourists and boosting Roswell\u0027s ekonomy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, usually i\u0027d be in a place relevant to the story, but the crash site, aircraft graveyard with all C-2s are closed due to KOVID, and I can\u0027t interview Jeb while he\u0027s on route to Mars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EIn case you didn\u0027t want to read that, it was how I accidentally did a circumnavigation after pressing EVA and not view, presented in a short documentary-style\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003Ewhatwouldbeavideobuti\u0027mnotthatgoodsoit\u0027sa\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0script, with many fictional aspects to make it cooler and more accurate to the kerbal world.
