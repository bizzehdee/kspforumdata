Also, does your navball say surface or orbit when on descent? You are probably also touching down on uneven ground (pretty much everywhere on Mun) and are landing relatively hard. What is your touchdown speed? I try to land on Mun at less than 2m/s vertical speed. \u0026lt;1m/s is preferable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T22:10:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPut your nav ball into \u0022surface\u0022 mode.

That\u0027s to be expected, since you\u0027ll always have some small lateral component to your velocity. The Mun does rotate, but only slowly, slower than Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heagar","CreatedById":67859,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-06T23:27:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use any mods, unless i\u0027m forced to.
