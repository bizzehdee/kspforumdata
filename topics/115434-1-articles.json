OKTO2 probe core, I think, inside a 1.25m Service Bay, along with a couple of Z-100 batteries, 2HOT Thermometer, PresMat Barometer, Goo Container, and a (mod part) radial-style Science Jr. There were weird temperature things going on from the launchpad, but it didn\u0027t finally get out of control until the craft was hanging out in space, when something (I think it was the thermometer and the barometer, not 100% sure) spontaneously exploded. Unfortunately I don\u0027t have as much detail as you have to substantiate or flesh out the event, but I definitely got weird temperature behavior.\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, the probe core itself never exploded (I don\u0027t recall if it had a heating issue or not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found I have to open the Service Bay right away or the components inside overheat. I tried putting radiators on the outside of the bay and it didn\u0027t seem to make any difference. I went back and forth for a while over whether this was a bug or feature (kind of makes sense, that electronic components insulated by vacuum and inside a compartment so the heat can\u0027t radiate directly away, would overheat). But the heat stats get really crazy, with the conductive flux going strongly positive and strongly negative many times a second. Plus I\u0027ve now seen enough glitchy temperature problems that I\u0027m sure the enclosed-component thing is a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is, I open the service bay immediately upon reaching vacuum, and keep it that way until it\u0027s time to reenter. I haven\u0027t had any problems with overheating since I started doing that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-15T02:15:57Z\u0022 title=\u002207/15/2015 02:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Perry Apsis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
