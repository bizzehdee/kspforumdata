The color was always the \u0022cold\u0022 brick red and no temperature gauges ever appeared. Despite this, the reaction wheels would explode.

In 1 version a service or cargo by causes a part to jump back and forth between 2000\u002B and sub 10 degrees until it explodes, heating up the parts around it in the process. Once it blows up the other parts cool down, or if the bay is opened temperatures return to normal. In the second case one of my parts will jump from sub 400 to over 2000 instantly, this usually happens to a probe core entering the atmosphere around 65-70,000 meters. Once my ship gets hit with this crippling heat issue it persists through saving, reloading, or changing scenes- but it does not happen all the time and I have not been able to build a craft that when launched will experience the problem in a way that can be repeated. When this does happen to a vessel with radiators on it, they do not help in managing the out of control temperatures.\n\nI think (like a few others) that it may be related to the time-warp, I notice this when I move forward and then stop either to setup a maneuver node or to take more deft control of a vessel during re-entry.

A couple of things I found was to make the gravity turn later, and to reduce throttle as soon as possible, preferably below 50%. I haven\u0027t yet had parts on a craft overheat after I reduced throttle below 50%, but have many craft that came close.\n\nAny electronic device (probe core, battery, solar panel, etc.) will heat up the quickest and be the slowest to cool down. The problem with SSTO is that you need radiators close the stack just about the engine, the longer you intend to hard burn, the more radiators you need. Having said that the heat model is still whack, and some heat may remain under very unrealistic circumstances. \n\nBottom line is that long burns at full throttle need some remediation.\n\n-----\n\nYou can try putting a heat shield between the lowest tank and the engines and rigging a fuel line between the tanks, that had some effect up until 1.0.3\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-11T02:09:14Z\u0022 title=\u002207/11/2015 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666**"},{"CreatedByName":"annallia","CreatedById":75681,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T02:42:50Z","Content":"I haven\u0027t run into this problem with any of my vessels yet...
