Due to instability issues, i\u0027ve made it two garages and a Cargo platform. My craft came down at a considerable distance from Minmus Prime Base (as intended). To get the garages and landingplatform close to Minmus Prime base i used the slipperyness of the ice lake by pushing the parts to their target with rovers. I had to let the rocket stage fly off to get the platform clear. It crashed on the surface, unbelievably only exploding one empty fueltank and a node. The remainder still contains 4390 fuel for refueling purposes. Perhaps it can be usefull later on when the fuel transfer mod is added.

Multiple landers at one location would (in the real world) enhance the chances of survival and give more possibilities and time for research. In the game, it will make the challenges more demanding as you have to land close to the other craft(s) or find ways to get it close in an other fashion.

Wouldn\u0027t it be sensible to create a \u0027user\u0027 for every body in KSP? Participants who want to land a craft on body x should do so under the apropriate user. Crafts that have landed (and their debris etc.) on other bodies are saved under a different \u0022user\u0022 and will not be there. Thus lightening the load on computer and memory, avoiding lag and simplifying maintenance of the body x persistent file. However, the downside of this is that it will require a lot more \u0022bookkeeping\u0022 which mods have been added to body x.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"khyron42","CreatedById":8551,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T00:08:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing we considered back when Minmus and spaceplanes were added was splitting the community threads into separate ones per body. The problem we ran into then was twofold - one, we wanted the option to have multi-body missions, which so far very few people have done. Two, we weren\u0027t sure how well having separate threads for it could be kept moving.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was thinking of splitting them for 0.16, too, and decided again to keep the multi-body, move-a-ship-from-one-to-another option open.

That might make it hard to manage which mods are where, though, so I\u0027m torn about whether to do an overall mod list instead of per-save. I\u0027d start it out with MechJeb, Camera, CrewTank, and Carts already added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- One save per planet \u002B its moons. So there would be an Eve/Gilly signup sheet, Kerbin/Mun/Minmus one, etc. If anyone wanted to sign up to try some kind of high-temp-tolerance mod landing on Moho there\u0027d be one for it too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- this time around saw an awful lot of space stations added, I\u0027m not sure whether that was good for the community thread overall or distracted from building landed bases. Something to think about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- 48 hours per turn still, and if you come up for your turn on more than one save at the same time, you get bumped down one on whichever came second.

There will be a way to run multiple saves out of a single copy of KSP, but unless they do something more than what they\u0027ve announced, the Parts folder will be shared between all saves in a given copy. Most people haven\u0027t been adding mods on their turns anyway so it should work out ok even if everyone is allowed to add mods (worst case, that would mean 5 mods added in a single set of turns, but right now it\u0027s taken us a month to add 12 mods and I\u0027m sure there are many mods people would love to have added already.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis approach would also mean a lot more flights get flown, by setting up 5 separate pipelines - something I really hope to encourage.
