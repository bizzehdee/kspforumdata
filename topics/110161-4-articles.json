At the very least, I generally have at least two or three choices for most situations. Poodle, Terrier, 48-7S cluster, or radial 24-77s for a medium lander? Twin-Boar, Mainsail with boosters, or T30/T45 cluster for a mid-game lifter? Picking the most efficient option often gains me only a few dozen m/sec of delta-v on a ship with several hundred or thousand, so I often end up picking an engine based on other considerations--looks, TWR, configuration, cost, landing-gear clearance, whatever. \u003Cp\u003EThat said, I do think the current balancing could do with some tweaking for consistency.

First is the momentum thrust, massflow * exhaust velocity. Equal and opposite reaction, etc. The second is the pressure thrust, (exit pressure - ambient pressure) * exit area. (These terms are actually inversely proportional, and max thrust (greatest Isp) is when the pressure thrust is zero.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a vacuum the flow expands to fill the entire nozzle, and the nozzle exit pressure of the Descent Propulsion System is only 0.01 bar. If the flow expanded to fill the whole nozzle at sea level, the pressure thrust would overwhelm the momentum thrust term, leading to negative thrust. Literally the naive prediction is that the rocket engine becomes a gigantic vacuum cleaner that sucks itself backwards... by blowing in the same direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, this doesn\u0027t actually happen. The flow separates from the nozzle, like the flow over a wing separates near stall. The result is the effective exit area is much lower, but a lot of the energy of the propellent goes into turbulence in the nozzle. This is \u003Cstrong\u003Ebad\u003C/strong\u003E, by the way. The flow is unstable and the thrust goes off in random directions. It might even shake the nozzle to pieces and cause an explosion, or burn a hole in the nozzle wall and cause an explosion.

It still predicts a sea level Isp of -95 s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo how much thrust would the Descent Propulsion System produce at sea level? Very little. It might not even light off.
