It would be orbit-capable; it would also be SSTO because i can\u0027t imagine the size of a hypersonic launch stage for such a spaceplane. It will use a giant cluster turbojets and then RAPIERS to ascend. There i think would be 2 or 3 rows of each time 10 RAPIERS. The intakes for the jets will be located in a special section on the bottom of the spaceplane (similar to the XB-70 Vaklyrie); it would be housing the jets and it either would be jettisoned after those engines would be unusable at a high altitude or wing sections would be rotated to cover it using Infernal Robotics. The spaceplane would after disabling the jets and switching the RAPIERS to rocket mode perform the final ascent to orbit where it could be used as a heavy cruiser - it would be at least 5 times as big as a standard Shuttle. It could bring whole space stations into orbit; or maybe orbital weapon platforms. It would need HORRENDEROUS TONS OF FUEL; which all would be burned quickly, and i think it\u0027s zone of operations will be restricted to Kerbin\u0027s SOI; although it can be refuelled in orbit and have drop tanks. It would also have 4 small rocket engines for orbital manoeuvring; and also one pair of reverse ones (located in openable sections of the wings like in the Delta Glider) for deorbit. It will definitely not land on the runway; i think it would need the diameter of the whole KSC flat area to decelerate even when using parachutes.

It would be able to bring over 100 tons into orbit and would be the first of my REALLY BIG SHIPS. It would burn tons of fuel in a second and would be the ultimate King of all the Spaceplanes; maybe even going into Kuiness World Records.
