I think it is eloquent in the way that as the complexity of the crafts/ships you design increases so does the number of possible failure states. This is very much like the real world where adding additional complexity can be a detriment to the mission if it isn\u0027t absolutely needed. Add a strut? Sure. Well now that strut flew off and rips your fuel tank open. This works mainly in part to the lego block building style of the game. Failure states can be simulated in rigid body flight simulators of course, but it doesn\u0027t feel quite as natural IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-08T16:55:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice work.
