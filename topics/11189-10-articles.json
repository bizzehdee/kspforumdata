My main problem is that due to the imbalances that come about after burning my rockets for a little while (fuel tanks draining move my CoM!) I find I have to throttle down at high altitudes and use RCS to keep my nose pointing the right way. At this point the fuel bug hits, so it\u0027s hard to call it valid.\n\nWhat I really need is a AASAS which can also control my engine throttles individually. That way as soon as the imbalances start to occur it could correct by lowering the strength of the engines on one side to move the centre of thrust. It has the added advantage that fuel consumption would lower on the side with less thrust, so the CoM would close in to the CoT as well."},{"CreatedByName":"gyroscope","CreatedById":29986,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-15T18:32:38Z","Content":"![kerbal6.jpg](http://i581.photobucket.com/albums/ss259/wiffles/kerbal6.jpg)\n\nMy smallest ship so far \u0022The Bat\u0022. 2 Jets and one standard rocket\n\n![kerbal4.jpg](http://i581.photobucket.com/albums/ss259/wiffles/kerbal4.jpg)\n\nEven in jet mode, it goes vertical soon after takeoff\n\n![kerbal5.jpg](http://i581.photobucket.com/albums/ss259/wiffles/kerbal5.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T16:00:18Z","Content":"Congratulations gyroscope for success with the Mig, duly recorded on the roll of honour and the Bat too (did that get back OK?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Spazzkey","CreatedById":25987,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-17T03:17:59Z","Content":"Apologies if I\u0027m late to the party, but I too have a successful entry.

I went through them with interest and have been trying to work out which ones were successful missions and which were failed mission attempts. I am having a hard time because I have a wretched summer cold which I am not enjoying, messing with my head.\n\nI feel it might help to clarify a rule here FYI, the orbit must be totally outside the atmosphere ie both PE and AP above 70,000m.

Did you get the full orbit with PE over 70Km before landing because the speed / altitude in you screeny is suborbital. \u0027arrow\u0027 looks like its name and you said it was ssto which the screenies show, did you manage to land it in one piece as well ?! ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) If so it deserves another entry on the roll to go with your previous.\n\nsuzaku, you asked if I would believe you and I would.

Your word is enough but to put it on the honour roll it would help if you can check the mission fulfilled the main rules, name the vessel and specify your achievements. I am guessing from the X-15 results screeny that it didnt make orbit as the top speed over land was not high enough to make orbit and it clearly went up then down again, but it is a very unusual craft design especially the landing gear. Also by your own account the Kerborca\u0027s landing wasnt pretty so I am not sure if that is the 3 Kerbal craft which made the whole mission or not.\n\nnightynight all"},{"CreatedByName":"Suzaku","CreatedById":40800,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T08:01:29Z","Content":"No way, just a couple of minutes ago the newest version of my SSTO broke orbit of the Kerbin system...

Its in the game, hasnt been patched and its almost impossible not to use it so IMHO its perfectly OK to use it and allowance has been made for the advantage it brings by creating a separate honours list for this version. In fact I would encourage players to understand and exploit it to the fullness of their ability because in v17 it will be gone so we may as well have some fun with it while it is here. I dont think the fuel use and thrust to mass ratios of rockets are properly balanced for 100% throttle anyway in v16 and will need rebalancing when the bug is removed so really its not as if the bug is breaking an otherwise realistic computer model IMHO, meanwhile I have made some weird ships fly exploiting this bug.
