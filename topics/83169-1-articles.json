I don\u0027t recall the exact cut-off date for transferable purchases, but as a general rule of thumb if you purchased KSP before it was ever available on Steam, you should be able to transfer it. If you login to your KSP Store account and look at your profile, you should see a list of past purchases. KSP should be on that list, and if you still have a transferable purchase, there should be a button to get a Steam code for KSP. Be aware that if you redeem that code, your KSP Store account will become essentially non-functional. (At least, as far as I remember; they might just remove KSP from the purchase list there. It\u0027s been a while.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Steam transfer button isn\u0027t there, you can check with KSP official support by emailing \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b59082f7dac5c1dcdadb9082f1\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u002281f2f4f1f1eef3f5c1eae4f3e3e0edf2f1e0e2e4f1f3eee6f3e0ecafe2eeec\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E -- make sure you include proof of purchase (e.g., the email receipt and the email address associated with the KSP Store account if it\u0027s different to the email address you\u0027re sending from) just in case.
