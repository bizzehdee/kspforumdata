I can work out the ?v of a ship and all the separate stages, what i have trouble with is actually calculating the requirements of a maneuver.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the equations ?vo = sqrt[ (G * Pm) / Pr ], ?vd = gp * tL, tL = ?vo / A, ?va ? 610 (not sure how accurate this estimation is for Kerbin but without knowing more about the atmosphere i don\\\u0027t think there\\\u0027s much you can do about it) and of course ?tvo = ?vo \u002B ?vd \u002B ?va i managed to come up with an estimation for reaching orbit, assuming about 2Gs acceleration of around \u003Cstrong\u003E4250m/s\u003C/strong\u003E. I also figured i should probably take 100 off that due to the rotation at the equator but it can\\\u0027t hurt to overestimate a little.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen for starters i tried to work out the combined requirements for a mission to the Mun. Using Hoffman orbits i think there should be about six independent maneuvers (Kerbin orbit, Munar transfer burn, Munar insertion burn, Munar de-orbit burn, Munar descent burns and the Munar ascent/Kerbin transfer burn). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERespectively, i assume to work out each i would have to use the value i already have (which i am aware doesn\\\u0027t take into account altitude, so i assumed 100km above surface), the first Hohmann transfer equation (on wikipedia, although i was a bit thrown off with the Gravitational parameter given in the wiki for Kerbin being in km^3/s^2, so i used all km values and came up with an answer of \u003Cstrong\u003E0.842km/s\u003C/strong\u003E). Then... i got lost. I assume you would have to know how fast you would be travelling at the point in the transfer orbit where you got captured, and the orbital velocity of the Mun. Then is it just the difference of the two? Problem being i have no idea how to work out velocity at any given point in an orbit. I could probably do the rest using what i already know plus suvat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i guess what i\\\u0027m asking is - how do you work out velocity at apoapsis (which i believe is also the semi major axis?), are the figures i have anywhere near right/what anyone else has and also, with regards to Minmus, are the calculations much the same if you just rotate the craft on the launch pad? Just because i\\\u0027m pretty sure that changing your orbital inclination is one of the most fuel-intensive burns you can do... what sort of angle are you looking for then, or does nobody know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to anybody that can help/understand what the hell i\\\u0027m on about (i barely can).

MechJeb will record how much delta-V is expended during automatic ascents if you want hard numbers. It will also tell you how much delta-V is required for various orbital operations, including TMI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe the most efficient way to land on the Mun is to adjust your Munar periapsis so that it is just above the ground, then when you reach periapsis do one big burn to kill all your velocity and drop a few meters to the surface. When I do this I usually find that my velocity at periapsis is around 800 m/s, so that\\\u0027s the delta-V required to land this way. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s a little complicated to predict that 800 m/s figure from first principles. If you know your velocity at the apoapsis of your transfer orbit, you can subtract the Mun\\\u0027s orbital velocity to get your velocity with respect to the Mun at the moment when you enter the Mun\\\u0027s SOI. But then the Mun accelerates you toward it, so you\\\u0027re going faster when you reach the deorbit burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo find your velocity at one altitude given your velocity at another altitude you can use conservation of energy. Your orbital energy per unit mass is\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE/m = (1/2)v^2 - GM/r\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhere v is your orbital velocity, GM is the body\\\u0027s gravitational parameter, and r is your distance from the center of the body. E/m is conserved, so if you know your velocity at one value of r, you can compute E/m, then solve the above equation for v, plug in a new value of r, and find your new velocity at the new r. With this you should be able to calculate how much the Mun will accelerate you as you fall toward it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s true that plane changes are expensive. You can calculate the cost of a plane change as dV = 2 v sin(theta/2) where v is your velocity and theta is the angle by which you rotate your plane. For small theta this is approximately dV = v * theta if theta is measured in radians. Since v is large in low orbits, plane changes are especially expensive at low altitudes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne way to avoid that cost when going to Minmus is to launch into an initial Kerbin parking orbit that lies in the same plane as Minmus, instead of launching into an equatorial parking orbit and then doing a plane change. (This requires launching at the time of day when the launchpad passes through Minmus\\\u0027s orbital plane).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-01T21:52:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Superewza\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Superewza\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo i guess what i\\\u0027m asking is - how do you work out velocity at apoapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWhat semi-ninja said.
