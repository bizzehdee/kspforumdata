I dont want to be seen as misleading people as it worries me someone might get the wrong end of the stick, so just wanted to clarify that as far as the K Prize is concerned IMHO the stock fuel clause means it has to be done on one fuel load, so refuelling between launches on **Kerbin** is in the spirit of the K Prize if tanks are stock, refuelling on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn is very clever and more advanced and is not covered by the K Prize which is about a taking a reusable spaceplane to orbit and back on one fuel load.\n\nSo mid flight refuelling is gate crashing, but very cool gate crashing. \n\nIMHO I still think someone else should start up an advanced spaceplane challenge thread for 17. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-05T18:28:05Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2012 06:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by boolybooly**"}]}
