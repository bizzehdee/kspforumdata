Try to zoom in all the way. If that\u0027s not enough, you will have to slide the view around a little (if you\u0027re in the SPH) or move the view up/down (if you\u0027re in the VAB) so that the camera clips into your MPL. Then angle it so you can see the rogue part. Hover the mouse and make sure the rogue part is highlighted before you click. Camera clipping can be a little tricky, but is very doable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you\u0027ve saved before hand, in case you grab the wrong part...(much easier to fix)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
