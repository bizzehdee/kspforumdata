I\u0027m terribly tired, because I just had 5 hours of sleep tonight, just because that stupid SSTO had to be changed since I misaligned the payload docking port... Center of Thrust and Center of Mass were not aligned and it got uncontrollable in thin atmosphere. Of course moving that docking port also affected the truck that brings the payload over... Well, at least the last of quite a few \u0022one more\u0022 tests was a success. Although the plane didn\u0027t go to a stable orbit, it was nearly there, and definitely good enough to deploy the probe it had carried up (apoapsis at 75000 m, periapsis at 58000 m). Only bad thing: When finally circularizing the orbit of the probe using its own ion engine I crashed one of the solar panels into the spaceplane. Still not catastrophic, this just means I will not be able to go to full throttle with the probe for more than a few seconds, but \u0022nearly full throttle\u0022, which can be maintained until the xenon runs out is probably enough. The return of the plane was a near catastrophe, since it had very little fuel left and without some fuel in the front tanks it has an awful tendency to stall. Happened two times, both when I tried to do a turn to get it above solid ground. Well, in the end Jebediah got the plane stable again, just 600m above the sea, and he even managed a beautiful landing afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ximrm","CreatedById":111063,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T07:09:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Khorso\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Khorso\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBiggest lie in KSP:\u003Cp\u003EJust one more test flight, and then I\u0027ll go to bed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDito.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m still struggling to get to moho.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first try,yesterday,or maybe the day before was quite successful.
