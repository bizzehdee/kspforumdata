Or maybe it\u0027s supposed to work this way and I\u0027m needing to design around it better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have the ship in the screenshot below. The problem is when I throttle up the engine. The reactor and generators will gradually come up to the power level needed to run the engine at the selected speed, but this dips into my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E reserves. Now that would be fine, except when the reactor/generators catch up, they only reach equilibrium, and don\u0027t actually produce any power to replenish my batteries. Same problem with the radiators, but in reverse - my WasteHeat will rise until the rads panels catch up and begin dissipating the heat, but they never work hard enough to bring my WasteHeat back down (which means my part temperatures go up, which means my generator efficiency drops, which means the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E drain is bigger the next time I tap \u0022Shift\u0022 to bring the throttle up a little bit more.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ghnEqIY.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ghnEqIY.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was able to get this design up to maximum throttle by opening the throttle in very slow increments, but that\u0027s kind of annoying. How do I tell my generators and radiators to actually do their jobs (replenish my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E reserves and cool the ship)? Or am I somehow using the wrong combination of parts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E, TweakUI (hence the giant radiators), Procedural parts, and a couple other mods installed. Is it possible one of them is conflicting with Interstellar somehow?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-11-13T14:28:25Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2017 02:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by dvp\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-11-14T06:50:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoving to Add-on Discussion.
