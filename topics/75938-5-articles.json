Finally, wheels that don\u0027t suck! I was whizzing around KSC at 20m/s on the wheels in the first video with no worries, it was pretty fascinating watching the anti-roll numbers and stuff.. Though one thing I did wonder was what use the repulsor mode had? Maybe I\u0027m missing something (or the mod is) but it just flipped my wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027d like to offer pointers to areas of possible improvement (apologies if you know about any of these):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1, unless they\u0027re perfectly balanced around the CoM, the heavier side/end of the vehicle will droop and sag. I guess this is due to the advanced suspension, but it\u0027d be great if the effect was minimised by a fair amount. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2, they are, for the most part, really quite big. Almost unusabley big for me - I can\u0027t see anything using the big wheels fitting inside a fairing (which is needed because FAR). I\u0027d love to use them but, like with the stock large wheels, they\u0027re just too darn big. Are there smaller versions/ideas in the works?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3, the repulsors are a brilliant idea. Lovely stuff but they suffer from the above problems and additionally, they\u0027re not powered. If they were real, they could move and change direction by pointing in different directions - I know they\u0027re basically an invisible wheel so that\u0027s not possible here but it also means that it wouldn\u0027t really be OP to enable them to be powered. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027d be possible to make something that can be powered but has no traction with the ground but yeah.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo those are my ideas and feedback. I should note that I got these on the 27th, so if either of those things has been addressed/changed, I\u0027ll redownload. Also, when I get back tonight, I\u0027ll see about ideas for placement and cost (though, there\u0027s probably nothing wrong with using the stock wheels stats).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Also, I\u0027d like to throw my name into the hat for serious testing. I can run a clean install (on both 32 and 64bit versions) and with any mods you care to test against.

In order:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat, that\u0027s exactly what I was aiming for. Repulsor mode on the wheels is so you can have rovers that can stay planted on the ground and drive around for precise manoeuvring, while also be able to whizz about at high speed. Unless there\u0027s a bug, they should pick up, turn over and act like repulsors. Do not use the action group, this just triggers the animation!!!! (this is a bug). Use the GUI button. Proper action group support to come.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Anti-roll has actually been removed for the moment. The calculation is still there and I\u0027ve left the debug code in so it still displays, but it does nothing. Some KSP weirdness to overcome. See the GItHub commit comments for when I changed things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Yep, part of the reason they\u0027re stable. Have an eye on smaller designs, but I wanted big wheels so that\u0027s what I built. The big wheels were really only meant for Kerbin, though I\u0027m sure some crazy person will launch them all over the place! Open to ideas for smaller designs, just post some pics. Inspiration is always welcome, though I won\u0027t pretend I\u0027ll like every idea! A design that folds up flush has been mooted, so perhaps this would be better? I love setting animations up. The hard bit isn\u0027t really modelling, it\u0027s setting the code up and the damned texturing! The heavy code work is done now and it\u0027s a lot easier now I know more. Might actually get back to making some parts again! Justin is soldiering on with the texturing and hoping to get some stuff out this week to get a feel for how it all looks/fits in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) It\u0027s possible in a way, but I\u0027m in two minds about it at the moment. Making them too much of a magic bullet seems a bit OTT. Really good results with small engines or hefty RCS. I\u0027ve taken the approach that these take care of levitation and the rest is up to you! Smaller is actually easier than wheels; expect a downscaled version at some point.
