It was a ship I had been thinking of putting up previously, a probe-controlled rocket with a Claw, a large empty LFO tank, some xenon and empty xenon tanks, and some monopropellant in an R1. The idea was to grab and drain debris, push it into a decaying trajectory, let go and stabilise the Fuel Recovery Probe\u0027s orbit. It could then grab other ships and fuel dump stations to transfer fuel into them. It could also drain fuel from the lift core, which had probe control, no docking ports of any kind, and a bunch of leftover fuel that would otherwise go to waste.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/GEgIzL.png\u0022 alt=\u0022GEgIzL.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/2bL040.png\u0022 alt=\u00222bL040.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Skipper and Jumbo-64 is perfectly capable of vertical SSTO.

Some adjustment burning made it reappear, but with a high, retrograde trajectory. An adjustment just after the encounter brought the periapse to the other side of Minmus at around 20km. Then, he burned into a circular orbit and undocked the satellite. The science module would come with him. Also, he took reports and readings in high and low orbit over Minmus, transmitting the crew report from Minmus orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/Lq2mPN.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Lq2mPN.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/MjDHVp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MjDHVp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/B6JIWT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B6JIWT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill then waited in orbit until the Greater Flats were on the day side of Minmus, before deorbiting to land there. Once landed, he took more readings and reports, transmitting the Crew Report to complete the last mission. Well, I say last, but I then accepted Mun orbit science, Minmus orbit science and Minmus flag-planting missions. Those were quickly completed with the aid of the Mun satellite and Bill\u0027s earlier readings.

The crew transfer to Eve went smooth as well, yet I didn\u0027t dock the transfer stage and the lander, because both are horribly big ships.

Two engines obviously detached when they touched the ground, but Jebediah is convinced that it will still fly without them, because it was designed to launch from sea level, but landed nearly 2000 meters above, so that the first stage of the rocket probably isn\u0027t necessary anyhow. Sadly I copied the wrong screenshot before I went to work, so all I can show at the moment is a photo of Jebs back... Also funny: He could grab onto something here, but I have no clue what, so I didn\u0027t dare to press the F-button...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FuFYcJp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FuFYcJp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next time I play KSP I\u0027ll send down a rover for Jeb to drive around - the goal would be to get a \u0022water\u0022 sample ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Jeb is back in orbit, two other brave Kerbals will go to Gilly. Originally I wanted to do these two missions in parallel, but the transfer ship has a design flaw that would require an additional docking manoeuvre (I was just docking 9 tankers to the lander - no thanks), what makes it much more appealing to first finish the Eve landing mission, then gather all Kerbals into the transfer vehicle, go with that to Gilly and only undock the Gilly lander in Gilly orbit, although it would have enough fuel to go there from and return to low Eve orbit...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll post lots and lots of screenshots in the mission report forum once all Kerbals are back home. Since Jeb is currently looking forward for a rather long drive to Eves shores, it might still take a while.
