The method he outlines is not relevant to the actual math work, and simply affects the values I will be plugging in.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7oc1FLnWlY\u0026amp;t=438s\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7oc1FLnWlY\u0026amp;amp;t=438s\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI will only discuss\u00A0the resulting data in this thread to keep things simple, if you have specific questions about the math, let me know.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0With that out of the way, let me preface this discussion. The dominant method of powering stock props is by using RTGs, which makes sense. They continuously generate power, allowing stock props to run forever, this is great for Duna, Eve, and Laythe exploration. However, I commonly see this used on props built for fighter craft, transport aircraft, and others. While there are some cases where endless flight is desirable on Kerbin, such applications certainly do not qualify. Most people don\u0027t fly a single stock prop fighter for hours on end (without crashing). This leads to the question, are RTGs the most efficient way of powering these props? Short answer, no, but I\u0027ll explain in more detail. I am taking efficiency to mean weight in this conversation, although other uses of the term, such as part count, may also be referenced.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 First we must establish all of the possible methods of powering a stock prop: RTGs (duh), batteries, and fuel cells. RTGs we already discussed. Batteries would simply run the engine using their stored electric charge, and the flight would end once they run out. Fuel cells would burn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E (Liquid Fuel \u002B Oxidizer), continuously generating the engines power needs whilst draining \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E from on board tanks.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Of course, I wouldn\u0027t even consider the fuel cells to be an option unless I had a good reason. Doing some simple math, we can find that all batteries hold 20,000 units of electric charge per tonne. How much electric charge, then, is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E equivalent to per tonne? It depends on which of the fuel cells you are using, but for the small fuel cells this comes out to\u00A079,934 units of electric charge per tonne of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E, and for the large fuel cells it is 81000 units per tonne.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Looking at the raw data, fuel cells are the obvious winner. However, the additional weight associated with fuel cells throws a wrench into the works, and in either case this tells us nothing about how RTGs stack up. So I will analyze these three choices in an applied setting, where I will test their mettle in a hypothetical prop that utilizes 10 of the 1.25 meter reaction wheels with 2 dumpling fuel tanks used as bearings. I did these calculations presuming that this engine would also utilize the trick described and demonstrated by Bradley Whistance\u0027s video. Using this method the reaction wheels consume roughly 2.73 times their normal power (according to my own testing), I\u0027m using ball park numbers so any small discrepancy is irrelevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERTGS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0The 10 reaction wheels consume 13.65 units of electric charge per second, as such the engine would normally require 19 RTGs to run continuously, which themselves would weigh 1.52 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBATTERIES:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0To run this engine for 1 hour you would need 49,140 units of electric charge. This would require 2.457 tonnes of batteries, so those certainly aren\u0027t the best solution, although using the largest battery bank available, this would only require 13 batteries. Since the weight of the batteries required scales directly with time of flight, they are likely the most efficient in very short flights.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cu\u003EFUEL CELLS:\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0The smaller fuel cells generate 79,934 units of electric charge per tonne of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E, meaning only .615 tonnes of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E is required to run the engine for 1 hour. This amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E is almost perfectly held by the 2 dumplings in the bearing, plus two oscar tanks which altogether hold .62 tonnes of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E. In total the tanks would weigh .698 tonnes (including dead weight), and this engine would require 10 of the small fuel cells to run continuously. This adds another .5 tonnes to the total weight, bringing it up to 1.198 tonnes. As well as 14 parts, but really that\u0027s 12 since the dumplings have to be there regardless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 In every possible way, the fuel cells are more efficient, while the use of dumpling bearings may seem to bias the fuel cells, in reality this does not affect the weight, and only affects part count. Using a different bearing type would only add 1 additional part, making it on par with batteries and superior to RTGs. None the less, it is far superior to both in terms of weight. This leads me to conclude that Fuel cells are the superior method for powering stockprops intended for short to medium flight times.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 It should also be added that it is of course possible to mix these methods together. In this one instance, it is actually beneficial. While 10 fuel cells are required to meet the continuous power generation needs, this is only by a small amount, the raw value is 9.1 fuel cells. This adds the equivalent of 540 additional electric charge generation required over the hour of flight. Since fuel cells come with 50 units of electric charge storage each, this means that 9 of them would have 450 units total, leaving us 90 units short. These 90 units can be accounted for with a single of the smallest battery pack (which has 100 units). Weighing in at a mere .005 tonnes, this change leaves us with the original part count of 12 and a reduced mass of 1.153 tonnes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 So yes, it is possible that adding batteries will lead to a net increase in efficiency, however, the instance described above is the only type of scenario where this is actually the case. So limited is this possibility that even if the real value turned out to be just 9.3 instead of 9.1, then using batteries would result in a net increase in weight. Again, these results may be different for engines of differing sizes. however I can only see fuel cells being knocked from their throne with very different total flight times. For instance, short flight times\u00A0where batteries\u0027 ability to instantly deliver power gives them a major advantage, and long flight times where RTGs\u0027 endless power generation eventually overcomes their initial mass costs.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 This may be obvious already, but just to clarify, the fact that the math above uses reaction wheels affected by Bradley Whistance\u0027s technique \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIN NO WAY\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003Eaffects the actual math or conclusions. The math above is roughly equivalent to if you had simply used 27 reaction wheels functioning under normal conditions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 The objective of this thread was to demonstrate that fuel cell powered props are a lighter and more part efficient approach to powering certain stockprops. While it took a decent amount of complex work to arrive at this conclusion, in actual application fuel cell powered props are no more difficult to build or use then \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E props.\u00A0 There\u0027s also the small fact that a fuel cell powered prop will not only start out lighter than a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Radio-isotope Thermo-electric Generator (a.k.a. Mars rover heating device)\u0022\u003ERTG\u003C/abbr\u003E powered prop, but it will also get even lighter as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E is drained throughout the flight, further increasing performance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 I appreciate any questions or feedback you may have.

I won\u0027t bother describing the math since I imagine that you are perfectly capable of recreating it yourself \u003Cs\u003E(and I\u0027m too tired right now to bother)\u003C/s\u003E. Through testing I found that 2 axis rotation consumes 180% of the reaction wheels normal power consumption, instead of the 200% theoretically proposed. Presuming your 141% torque value, and an ideal scenario, 2 axis rotation produces about 20% more torque per tonne (that per tonne value is the weight of the entire prop assembly). For this math i kept the power generation constant, so I compared a 10 wheel 2 axis prop, to a 18 wheel single axis prop. The results would likely be different if one were to keep # of wheels constant instead of power consumption.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not all that significant, unless you\u0027re striving for that little bit of extra performance, 2 axis rotation with 1.25 meter props is not all that fantastic. This value would be higher with 2.5 meter props as they are around 39% more power efficient (the reverse is true of .625 meter props).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering the previously mentioned diminishing returns of the 3 axis rotation I\u0027d speculate that it would have maybe 30-33% more torque per tonne.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-03-09T23:09:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/09/2019 11:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 9, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by Kronus_Aerospace\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kronus_Aerospace","CreatedById":185084,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-03-12T03:20:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpon further in-game testing I have found that Large Fuel cells are especially useful, as they produce 12 times the power for less than 5 times the weight compared to fuel cells.
