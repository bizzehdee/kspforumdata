For me and probably a lot of other players that\u0027s what the payoff is for the effort of designing, testing, building, flying and landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I don\u0027t want to take in everything with a probe or rover (these should have visual limitations) - the full experience should be available \u0022through the eyes of a kerbal\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason for this post is that in most dev videos and posts it has been hinted that we are going to get a lot of interesting places to visit, crafted by the environment and creative teams. But we have seen nothing specific.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease add a lot of amazing content to discover and spots to travel to in the game - also to the stock system on EA release.
