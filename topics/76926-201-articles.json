Any realistic space battle is likely to happen at extreme ranges, so a very simple AI would probably boil down to trying to keep at whatever range was deemed optimal for that particular ship, while doing small RCS maneuvers to avoid some of the incoming fire, and that would look nothing like a Star Wars battle. Likewise, a more Star Wars-y space AI would be completely useless under normal physics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything, I\u0027d recommend kOS for Space Scumbag\u0027s next video, that way the AI would actually work in close range soup-space battles.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-25T19:04:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2015 07:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yski\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BahamutoD","CreatedById":72433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-25T19:05:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Oats\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Oats\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENot sure if im the first to find this or not, but im running a clean game except BDarmoury and this error occurs\u003Cp\u003EWhen reaching speeds of around 750 m/s and flying low to the ground objects on the ground will explode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully there is an easy fix for this or something but its difficult to find so i just posted it here\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.gyazo.com/b16c997af6dc5325390ba2f4db7825b8.gif\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://i.gyazo.com/b16c997af6dc5325390ba2f4db7825b8.gif\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt exactly 750m/s, KSP switches on \u0022Krakensbane\u0022 which makes it so instead of your ship flying through the universe, your ship is stationary and the world moves around you.
