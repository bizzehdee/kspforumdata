KSP does good in that it clips (to an extent at least) graphics that aren\u0027t actually visible.

This allows it to blend the two (or xn) images to remove the \u0022aliasing\u0022 around edges, often caused when the model data is larger than the screen resolution.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETexture Quality is memory consuming, but minimal cpu / gpu consuming improvement.
