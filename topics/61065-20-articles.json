Not sure if this bug requires specific circumstances or not. Happens with KSP 0.23.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartial workaround: award the kerbal with For all Kerbalkind (or some other ribbon you\u0027ll be able to recognize in the log), then after you\u0027ve closed the game open halloffame.ksp and replace X4 (etc.) with X3. The Certified Badass ribbon will stay in the log, but it won\u0027t show up in-game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-03T17:36:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2014 05:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starstrider42\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EVersion numbers matter!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nebula (ru)","CreatedById":104615,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-03T17:46:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can make your plugin in the ability to localize to other languages?
