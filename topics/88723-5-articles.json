Under load testing when new (to determine stable overclock), at present speed MAXIMUM ever attained temperature on any core was 49C. Under typical heavy use (running iRacing and associated ancillary programs, temps are around 41C. While playing KSC32 in Windows temps are about 38C.

The fact that the game freezes at effectively the same place also makes me think this isn\u0027t a processor related issue. My general experience is with overclocked systems failures are a bit more \u0022random\u0022 due to instability. There might be some credence to a memory issue, though again I\u0027ve never had an issue in Windows and I would think if I had flaky memory it would have at some point started freaking out once I filled up the registers doing things other then KSP, regardless of platform. Also, using HTOP to monitor resources, I see that when KSP freezes it\u0027s at about 3.3GB of memory usage. Also, worth noting that it seems it\u0027s locking Unity, not Linux. Previously I had mentioned that I tried (and failed due to my stupidity) to SSH into the system from another computer, and it responded to me (told me to get bent, but it\u0027s a response) and it responded to pings, which tells me the OS is alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust brainstorming, here are some things I am guessing about having potential issues.

Two are being fed by the display ports via Startech MDP2DVIS display port to DVI active adapters. The third is connected directly via the DVI port on card. There is a 4th screen that is connected via the mainboard DVI adapter served by the Intel video adapter that is on the die of the i5 processor. I have DISABLED this screen in Ubuntu as it was causing all sorts of display issues. I have NOT disabled this adapter in BIOS (since Windows is using it, I don\u0027t want to have to go back and forth into BIOS to turn it on and off). I have not modified or changed the default video driver that Ubuntu installed. At present, Unity seems very happy serving these three screens and is having no apparent issues. When I ran stock KSP (In a window, not full screen. I\u0027ve never run KSP full screen) I had no complaints about performance or smoothness. Is it conceivable that even though I have Linux ignoring the 4th screen on the Intel adapter that it is still somehow effecting the system? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the realm of trying to do things that won\u0027t require me materially altering the system, I\u0027ll test the memory and back the clock down to stock speeds, just to eliminate those things from the equation.
