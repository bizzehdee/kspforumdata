Your basic template looks like this:\n\n    @Kopernicus:FINAL:NEEDS[Kopernicus]{    @Body[Kerbin]    {        @Properties        {            @ScienceValues            {            }        }        @Orbit        {        }    }}\n\nDo this for every celestial body you wish to modify, by replacing the body\u0027s name in the square brackets.\n\nNow the thing is, the stock planets are loaded automatically, and not through Kopernicus. Only a raw shell is provided for them. So even though you are making changes (as the @ symbol on the nodes shows), for the variables themselves, you need to define them as if they don\u0027t exist yet.\n\nFor instance, the Orbit node has a variable called referenceBody inside of it. For Kerbin, that is set to \u0022referenceBody = Sun\u0022. Or it should be, but because it\u0027s loaded without ever actually creating a config, you cannot go and write \u0022@referenceBody = Jool\u0022. That will not work. Counterintuitively, you need to simply write \u0022referenceBody = Jool\u0022 without the @, even though you are making a change with respect to stock. It\u0027s just that, as far as Kopernicus is concerned, you are initializing the variable for the first time.\n\nThe simplest way to learn how all these variables are named? If you\u0027re running OPM anyway, just go into its install folder: GameData\\OPM\\KopernicusConfigs\\SarnusMoons\\Configs and load up Slate\u0027s config. It should be the most comprehensive (IIRC). You don\u0027t need all of them; in fact, avoid any that you don\u0027t need. Don\u0027t bother setting things like meanAnomalyAtEpoch or the like, just leave it out. Anything you don\u0027t explicitly set will use stock values, and only if something doesn\u0027t work out with the stock values should you look into changing them. Your main go-to settings will be semiMajorAxis and referenceBody in the Orbit node to resize orbits and move celestial bodies around.\n\nFor questions like \u0022what do I need to enter to give Kerbin the orbit of Bop\u0022, well, you\u0027ll have to look up those values yourself. Hint: the KSP wiki linked at the top of the forums is great for that. ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nOf course, after you\u0027re done moving everything around, you\u0027ll notice that you\u0027re not yet done and that things get very complicated very fast. For example, if you made planets into moons, or moons into planets, or changed a moon\u0027s SMA, your next question should be: should this planet-turned-moon be tidally locked? And that moon you just moved used to be tidally locked but it no longer is because the orbit size changed! And the moon that got promoted to a planet should probably get a proper rotation going. Also, the order that the bodies cycle through when you hit tab in map view is still the same as before, causing you to jump all over the place instead of going smoothly from the Sun outwards. Also, *all of the science modifiers except Kerbin\u0027s are now wrong* because you changed Kerbin\u0027s positions and therefore the order of which other bodies the player visits as he climbs through the tech tree. Then you need to doublecheck all your orbits to make sure that no celestial body ever enters the SoI of something that isn\u0027t its parent body - this is especially relevant for moving Kerbin with its giant SoI close to other Joolian moons. The SoI size scales dynamically with the SMA, so it\u0027ll greatly downsize Kerbin\u0027s when you make it orbit Jool, but it is still a very large body with the third highest gravity of all bodies in stock \u002B OPM. And should you be so foolish as to make orbits that cross one another, like Eeloo/Plock does with Jool/Neidon, you need to ensure that the orbital periods are in proper resonance and the bodies positioned in such a way that they can never encounter one another.\n\nGood luck and perseverance, you\u0027ll need it ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-02T14:21:00Z","Content":"\u003E For instance, the Orbit node has a variable called referenceBody inside of it.
