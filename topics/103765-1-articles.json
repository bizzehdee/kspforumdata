And I\u0027m not looking for a big fight\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I\u0027m just confused, and curious, so polite opinions please.)\n\nWith the recent talk about Squad and/or Steam \u0022taking\u0022 the 64b version away, I\u0027m finally confused enough to ask. I\u0027m old-school: when I bought, I downloaded from the website, and never gave a thought to this \u0022Steam\u0022 thingie all the young whippersnappers are raging about. So\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6why Steam?\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6why Download?\n\nHonestly because I download, I have complete control over my personal system\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 which I very much prefer. I can get what I want, when I want it, and nobody can remove something. For KSP that means I always have the back-up version sitting there to compare to for example. So how does Steam work in this regard? Are you giving up some control, and allowing a remote server to manipulate, without your explicit permission your machine? and if so\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 why would you (the user, not the game designer) prefer this method? Just for the social interactions? Because checking for a patch is something you never do on your own?\n\nHelp a confused old-school guy out here."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T14:33:16Z","Content":"I think there\u0027s been a few of those threads.\n\nSteam doesnt die everytime an update comes out. The official site tends to do that a lot. You just need to dig through some more Steam stuff to get to the KSP folder to install the mods."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T14:40:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E (Note: somebody shuffle this to the appropriate forum, I\u0027m guessing here.

I can replicate games among multiple PC\u0027s without have to worry about licensing issues, entering activation codes, etc.\n\nAnd I *do* have perfect control over my KSP -- since what I play is not the Steam version but a copy that lives somewhere else on my hard disk. I just don\u0027t have to download the latest version as I get it automatically, without having to do anything for it. That\u0027s what computers are for. Do things *for* you."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T14:46:16Z","Content":"One thing that I absolutely love about having KSP on steam is the streaming feature. Used it a couple of times to show KSP to friends and also to watch over their shoulder, giving tips and whatnot. Good stuff (you just need to get used to the ~5-10secs delay).\n\nThis is meanwhile the #1 thing why I prefer to have games on steam if its available there."},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T14:51:47Z","Content":"Steam is your way if you already have it, or plan to buy a lot of games in the future. It is a platform for lots of games, and a easy way to manage your gaming programs. \n\nDownload is your way if you don\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t play too much or just want this single game and no other ones."},{"CreatedByName":"thadisjones","CreatedById":134649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T15:06:55Z","Content":"Because I found KSP through a Steam recommendation, and that weekend it was cheaper on Steam than download (I think). Other than that I\u0027m not a huge fan of Steam\u0027s quirks, but it\u0027s generally less stupid (on OSX, anyway) than a lot of the license management that retail box games get saddled with. Things like limited install counts and the stupid \u0022You must have the DVD in your drive while playing this game, not because it\u0027s loading content but just to prove you\u0027re the owner\u0022 message.\n\nI mean, of course you take your legally purchased game and crack all that stuff anyway for convenience but still."},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T15:49:37Z","Content":"I regret transferring to steam. There\u0027s more freedom from the store. But, the Store has no price cuts on steam sales."}]}
