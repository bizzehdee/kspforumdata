I can get what I want, when I want it, and nobody can remove something. For KSP that means I always have the back-up version sitting there to compare to for example. So how does Steam work in this regard? Are you giving up some control, and allowing a remote server to manipulate, without your explicit permission your machine? and if so\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 why would you (the user, not the game designer) prefer this method? Just for the social interactions?
