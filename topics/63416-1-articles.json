This is pretty vexing, and I\u0027m not exactly sure why it occurs. So I thought I\u0027d ask for help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The part\u0027s root (with the PartTools component) is centred directly on the Unity origin and contains the engine mesh, colliders and the thrust transform. As I understand it this defines the CofM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The thrust transform is directly below the origin, pointing exactly straight down (typed the rotation in numerically) and aligned exactly with the origin in all but one direction (again, numerically entered). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis seemed correct. Am I doing this right? Because some of my engines have an offset thrust and some don\u0027t. Anything else I should be taking into account? I can also add pictures if it would help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- edit: This is being tested with infinite fuel \u002B a single MK1 command pod.
