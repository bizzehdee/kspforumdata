They used the maneuvering thrusters to get \u003Cem\u003EHermes\u003C/em\u003E as close as they could to Watney whilst still leaving a (just)\u00A0acceptable reserve, \u00A0breached the hull as an emergency effort (escaping air created thrust) to slow down to a viable intercept velocity, then sent a crewmember over on a tethered MMU to collect Watney.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could have a reasonable debate about where to draw the line but to be called an auxiliary craft, I\u0027d say that any crew need to be able to work in a shirtsleeves environment inside.

If your spacecraft is large enough or capable enough that the mass of a \u0027just-in-case\u0027\u00A0auxiliary craft can be accommodated, then sure - why not take one. Otherwise it becomes a matter of tradeoffs. In \u003Cem\u003EThe Martian\u003C/em\u003E for example, I would argue that even if \u003Cem\u003EHermes\u003C/em\u003E had had the capacity to take an emergency shuttlecraft along just in case they needed to rescue a crew member under highly unforeseen circumstances, it would have been better to use that excess capacity to take along more life-support supplies or thruster fuel, as both are more generally useful for covering a range of emergency situations rather than one specific situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh - and on the topic of big bad cost-cutting corporations vs government agencies. Apart from being the biggest, laziest cliche in the book, I would point out that, thus far in history, the majority of spaceflight fatalities have been caused by poor and, in some cases entirely unforced, government agency decisions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-04T06:31:53Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2021 06:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-04T19:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223983791\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022202844\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221622753147\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022197504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spacescifi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Spacescifi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally unless you plan to stay or your delta va and thrust are just that good.....bettee to land on ocean then since high thrust/high delta v equals landing in lava.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntheres that. though there is the possibility of actively cooled landing pads which can handle some pretty nasty thrust.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere are a few situations that might warrant landing even with large ships. maintenance and scrapping for example or disgorging large amounts of cargo from a large freighter. i imagine all these would be done at low gravity depots (say the moon for example). delivery to a ring station or even to a freight yard orbit might also be options. would be very situational. say you are delivering freight to an outpost without a lot of infrastructure. say they dont have any orbital infrastructure at all. if you are just dropping off, orbital drop pods would probibly be adequate. but if you also had to bring freight up the well, then a lot of back and fourth flights with a few onboard shuttles would take an eternity and would end up using almost as much fuel if not more (you need to get your shuttles back up for the next load with exports in tow, multiple times). a destination with more infrastructure might just have a terminal in orbit for that kind of thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-04T20:30:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, if you dislike a thread\u0027s subject matter why not simply skip to the next one rather than waste your time writing out a complaint about it?
