Probably fairly easy to make something that would survive in a humid house - arid climates I\u0027m not sure.

A whole ecosystem of organisms work to break down anything that can be broken down and nutrients are efficiently and endlessly recycled. A meadow or a forrest floor are self cleaning, but the end point is leaf litter or soil, not polished parquet floor or carpet. Houses already have their own ecosystem of dust mites, spiders, ear wigs, silverfish, mould and bacteria that feed on the organic detritus that we bring in. And rather than welcoming them because they eat dirt, we count them as part of the problem. The business of cleaning essentially consists of removing organic matter as completely as possible to cut off the bottom of the food chain and shrink the ecosystem. What you are proposing is to leave the energy source in place and instead just add a new organism to eat it. But what about the organisms that eat this organism? At best, you will replace one domestic ecosystem with another, but you won\u0027t make your house any cleaner.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
