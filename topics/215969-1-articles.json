Honestly even after KSP1 updated to include the feature I usually kept the Kerbal Attachment System mod installed anyway. Mostly for the attachable fuel lines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am perhaps, very bad at correctly calculating (guessing) how much delta v I need to get to a place and return home, and would often run out of fuel in high orbits of the Mun or Kerbin. I ran a lot of Gas and Go missions where I flew out with a big tanker, attached a fuel port, then hooked up a fuel line and used that to refuel the stranded ship. Theoretically I could have done the same mission with docking ports but A: It wouldn\u0027t have been as much fun, and B: I rarely remembered to put docking ports on the original ship. If I knew I was going to need to refuel, I\u0027d have just built the ship better in the first place.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, being able to fix a craft mid mission when you realize you\u0027ve done something catastrophically stupid is one of the most kerbal things ever. I hope KSP 2 has an improved version of this feature.\u00A0 I wouldn\u0027t mind having to EVA a kerbal some of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike, if I\u0027m at an orbital shipyard I\u0027d expect to be able to just change to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E mode, which is what I\u0027ve heard they have planned for the base building feature. But if I\u0027m just lost in space, I like that feeling of vulnerability of having to get a kerbal out and do the repair myself.\u00A0 Since the kerbals can now stand on ships, they\u0027ve already fixed the most fiddly bit of that system where you have to juggle keeping your kerbal in place while trying to place the part, so they really just need a clean UI for storing and attaching parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPotentially give EVA kerbals a backpack that stores whatever resources are already planned to construct ship parts, or let them pick a tank on the ship to pull supplies from, plus require an impact driver or something to explain how the kerbal can assemble a part alone in space. Then allow building anything they have the resources for, within a small radius of the kerbal. So you have to walk the kerbal over to the target area, probably click some button to open build mode, then pick a part and attach it like you were in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E but from the perspective of the Kerbal.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-31T18:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope we keep it.
