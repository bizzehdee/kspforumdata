It does feel very weird to see that the exhaust plume is always the same... \n\nBut then, I understand it would look very weird at low throttles... Almost no exhaust plume, very short, yet it would expand a lot laterally..."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:29:20Z","Content":"Agree.

Normal rocket exhaust are those gigantic yellow funnels.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nMaybe for space, but as long as you are in yet thick enough atmosphere the exhaust should look a bit more solid.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nThe BAC-9 is the only rocket that i feel have the \u0022right\u0022 exhaust, thick, heavy and hot."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T13:19:34Z","Content":"Yes, please. Looks like they\u0027re moving in this direction by making the fire trenches on the pad functional and adding exhaust/surface interaction, hopefully they\u0027ll improve exhaust plume effects at some point, too. I\u0027d love to see something like this in the stock game:\n\n![300px-KSC-69PC-413-detail.jpg](http://www.ehartwell.com/afjwiki/images/thumb/4/49/KSC-69PC-413-detail.jpg/300px-KSC-69PC-413-detail.jpg)"}]}
