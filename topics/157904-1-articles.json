Kopernicus I (shut up, names are hard) lifted off of the dirt mound that barely passed for a launch pad. A column of smoke and flame pushed the 14-ton rocket through the air on its way to space. Valentina, the second pilot of the first ever astronaut class sat in her acceleration seat, pushed further back by the force of acceleration. The solid fuel in the side mounted boosters ran out, and the rocket continued on its way. By 10 kilometres, the rocket was tilted forty-five degrees towards the East, giving it the trajectory it needed to enter orbit with relative ease. As Kopernicus I accelerated yet more towards space, Valentina thought to the previous missions flown before the Kopernicus.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Not much of anything to marvel at, the Genesis program gave the space program the needed kick to get it going. Starting with Flea rockets, little more than SRBs with command pods attached, the program quickly gained fame and funding from the Kerbal public. Not long after, the Moses series of rockets was rolled out to the launch pad. Flying routine missions to survey spots on Kerbin, one mission- Genesis VI- gave Jebediah Kerman the taste of space he and Val had craved. When his capsule Returned from a suborbital trajectory, he couldn\u0027t help but rave to Val and a few other employees about the experience. Days later, two new kerbonauts joined the force, drawn in by Jebediah\u0027s description of space. Bill and Bob Kerman were added to the first kerbonaut class as an engineer and a scientist, respectively. With its first \u003Cs\u003Evictims\u003C/s\u003E kerbonauts, the program was off to a modest, yet great start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Flying through the air at a kilometre per second, the main tank of the Kopernicus rocket had drained itself of fuel earlier than predicted. The rocket was only at about twenty kilometres. Valentina decouple the tank and fired up the second stage rocket. Carefully watching the altimeter, speedometer, and fuel gauge. She was worried mainly about the fuel level. Given that she had to stage early, she wouldn\u0027t have much fuel to get into orbit, and by extension, out of orbit. She told mission control so, and after some talk, they responded.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u0022Okay, Val. Our math shows that you have plenty of fuel. You\u0027ll have about ten percent left by the time you reach orbit. Continue as planned.\u0022 Valentina followed orders and kept going. Minutes later, Kopernicus I and Valentina had breached the atmosphere. The little craft was finally in a suborbital trajectory. It didn\u0027t take long for the craft to reach its seventy-five kilometre apoapse. A quick burn put the craft into orbit. Valentina Kerman had become the first female Kerbal in space, and the first Kerbal ever to enter orbit. She rolled the craft so its window faced Kerbin and gazed down at the blue-green ball slowly whizzing past her. In her awe, Valentina almost forgot the secondary purpose of her mission. She remotely conducted a few experiments, and orbiting once again, initiated another burn at periapse to kick the highest point to over one million kilometres. Once there, Val ran a few more of the same experiments. Preparing for the third and final burn, Val rolled the ship to face Kerbin yet again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 This view was even better. The blue and green marble sat hundreds of thousands of kilometres below her window, more beautiful than any Kerbal had ever known it to be. Val gazed upon the planet yet again. Taken aback by its astounding beauty. From this point, Valentina knew. Space was her home. She will do whatever it takes to see views like this. Whether it be Kerbin, the Mun, Moho, Laythe, anywhere, Valentina would live for any view like this. These views are and will be hers. No matter what. After lifting her camera and snapping a picture, Valentina initiated the return burn and jettisoned the spent fuel tank. An hour or so later, the capsule entered the atmosphere yet again. The wall of air was pushed into the capsule at thousands of metres per second, igniting and engulfing the tin can in a column of fire. The command pod pushed itself through the atmosphere, the air slowing it enough for its drogue chute to deploy. With chutes out, the pod gently splashed into the water, marking the missions end and implanting the spirit of curiosity and adventure into Kerbals forever.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/weeKOuE.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022weeKOuE.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parallel reentry trails of the Kopernicus command pod and its spent fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphard","CreatedById":165179,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-20T14:44:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNice!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister_Spaceman","CreatedById":173500,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-20T21:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Eww, that last paragraph\u00A0was worded poorly.
