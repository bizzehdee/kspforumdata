So in a not very science-y or mathematical approach I figured I\u0027d just send up a ton of fuel and some super powered engines. So I sent up two payloads of fuel (section 2 \u0026amp; 3 each with one S3-14400 tank), and new engine section (with two KR-2Ls and 2 S3-3600 Tanks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my initial attempt to get out of the Kerbin system I had the engine section between section 3 \u0026amp; 4 pushing section 4 \u0026amp; 5 while pulling section 2 \u0026amp; 3, that way I could drop fuel loads as I finished them, but the thrust from the engines made the craft fold in half (to be fair I\u0027m not really surprised as those two engines create an insane amount of thrust). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured if I couldn\u0027t push my ship I should be able to pull it. so I took block 1 out from between blocks 3 \u0026amp; 4 docked the fuel section to block 4 and flipped block 1 around and put it in the configuration you see in the screen shot. Block 5 was meant to be the forward facing section and every other section was designed to be pulled behind it. My first thought was maybe I messed up on some fuel flow but I checked and fuel was flowing from 3 to 2 to the center tank in 1 and then out to the radial tanks for 1\u0027s engines exactly as planned. I looked through all the tanks but everything seems to be normal, no engines are enabled that shouldn\u0027t be. Then I figured maybe reaction wheels don\u0027t like moving in the wrong direction, so I disabled all reaction wheels that were not in block 1 but still the same thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought that pulling the ship would minimize any off center issues I had, not that there should be anything, all ships hanging off of section 4 are identical with 3 way symmetry and the rover and mini-ship for section 5 were weight matched and I launched them into orbit without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have any suggestions, or if there are any ingame issues that might complicate a ship like this I\u0027d like to know. Any other troubleshooting paths I should look into?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ship is 948 parts and 453 tons.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-19T07:35:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour masses docked to segment 5 do not appear to be symmetrical. If that rover-looking-assembly is on the side towards which the ship is deflecting, I think you\u0027ve found your problem. It may have worked when the segments were assembled in a different order and it was closer to the COM and therefore was getting less of a boost from leverage. Also, check the amount of fuel in the tanks on those side-assemblies, as they may not be draining the way you expect them to, creating an imbalance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInteresting ship design, by the way. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But in interplanetary travel, you\u0027ll find that fuel efficiency is much more important than thrust.
