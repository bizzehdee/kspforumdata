It was supposed to land on Minimus or the Mun in my science save, but each time I take it up to 3.4 - 3.6 kilometers, it flips out! I tried taking out anything that would make the problem worse with my limited tech. Still there. I cheated in the visuals for the aerodynamics in alt-f12. I saw nothing. I didn\u0027t see my speed, but I might have been around 120 m/s.

The craft file isn\u0027t really necessary. Just a picture of the craft and more information. What is your thrust to weight ratio? You want no more then 1.7 roughly. When do you start pitching? And how hard do you pitch? Start the turn early around 60m/s and pitch 5-10 degrees. The higher the TWR the earlier the turn and more you can initially pitch. Then don\u0027t go any more then a few degrees off prograde. Let gravity make your prograde vector fall and follow it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood rule of thumb I find is you want to be 25 degrees at 250m/s , 50 at 500, 75 at 750 and by time you hit 1000m/s you want to be almost horizontal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you can\u0027t force your craft to hit those marks. You have to perform your pitch maneuver right so that your prograde vector hits them naturally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo much input is a bad thing.

Not the stiff ones. At launch go straight up until about 10,000m. The atmosphere will begin to thin out enough where you can start turning your craft. Gentle taps on the keyboard at first. Don\u0027t stray too far from the prograde circle until clear of the thickest part.
