Something to do with the new temp guages you see with F10."},{"CreatedByName":"Blu_C","CreatedById":39941,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T16:35:54Z","Content":"It depends on if you are running stock or using a lot of mods.

There\u0027s the total RAM used while the program is running, which is in one Task Manager window. And then if you check the applications running, in another window, you see a much smaller figure for the particular program.\n\nSince there are limits for the address space of a 32-bit Windows program, which those high figures break, I\u0027m inclined to think they are the total RAM use while KSP is running. But they might not be from Windows users.\n\nAnd the limit for your system, whatever the OS, is going to differ from mine.\n\nThey don\u0027t strike me as horrible numbers. I\u0027m using a few Mods, and that could be why I have not seen anything like that with v1.0, but I\u0027d expect things to run at that level. For a clean install. I\u0027d think they were high."},{"CreatedByName":"THX1138","CreatedById":113955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T18:54:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s possible that the two sets of figures are different totals.\n\u003E I know that in Windows I can have one source showing something around either.
