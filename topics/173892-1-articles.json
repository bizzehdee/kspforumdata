Making an apollo lander in stock KSP, without any of that fancy DLC is naturally a pretty big challenge, but I\u0027m really proud of this one and felt like sharing \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt houses 2 brave kerbals, and although the video below was made very lazily\u00A0using cheats, I can guarantee its ability to land on the mun and then rendezvous with a CSM in any\u00A0mun orbit (Even at the edge of it\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) with a bunch of fuel to spare. One of the things I really dislike about this craft\u00A0is how easy it is to break the landing legs unless you\u0027re going \u0026lt;0.2m/s on a flat surface, but cutting the fuel down enough would change that problem (a better player than me could probably land and return with the ascent stage alone, which quite literally has surplus fuel to the moon and back). If anyone wants the .craft file, let me know. I haven\u0027t posted it here because A. I\u0027m not entirely sure how to do so and B. I\u0027ve heard some people are protective of these files and I can\u0027t quite figure out\u00A0why, or\u00A0if any of these reasons may apply to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DZDq4B7.mp4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECrappy \u0022Showcase\u0022 video made with OBS, Movie Maker, and a whole bunch of debug menu.
