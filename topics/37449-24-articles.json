I\u0027m almost certain ISS doesn\u0027t dump anything overboard so all the poo would have to return in one of the non-reusable vehicles like the Cygnus. In this case somewhere around 75% of the food becomes waste (assuming the kerbals don\u0027t gain or lose weight, the remainder is used as energy which eventually becomes heat, which might be a nice tie-in to KSP Interstellar), add the packaging and you\u0027re probably pushing 90%.

Because TaranisElsu recently chose to modifly TAC LS to use resource names which have been settled on in the community, this mod easily integrates with a few others to allow a lot of variation and functionality. There\u0027s always a need to balance the number of resources used - part of the reason I think Squad is rethinking resources is because the tree they posted a pic for has too many resources. (I think KSP Interstellar might be in danger of heading that route) I think that the basic resources of Food, Water, Oxygen, Waste, CO2, and Wastewater are good ones. I\u0027d like to see Heat and Nitrogen added, and I\u0027d like to see a heat mechanic and an outgassing mechanic - but those are minor complaints/suggestions for what I think is the best of the LS mods for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-27T21:51:10Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2013 09:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by panarchist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarified use of the term \u0026quot;ECLSS\u0026quot; to specify the RL system, not the KSP mod\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TomatoSoup","CreatedById":59394,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T19:58:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panarchist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panarchist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s feels clunky and redundant \u003Cem\u003Eto you\u003C/em\u003E.

You can convert between them, sure, but they all come from the space center on Kerbin. The supply chain is identical and the resources are redundant. But if there were different sources and different operations you could do on each resource, then there would be a point to having multiple resources. But you\u0027re right, it\u0027s a WIP (I mean, look at the textures!) and there are Greenhouses on the way. That will make a reason to have distinct resources. That\u0027s the kind of complexity that I ask for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mean, another way is how older versions of KSP just had LiquidFuel for rockets, no oxidizer.
