My only choice was to jettison the landing gear and fire the return-stage rocket to keep from crashing. Just for grins I thought I\u0027d try landing my tiny needle rocket on RCS and one engine. Success was a huge surprise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my first intact landing.

Although obviously not an ideal landing, the craft was resting stable and balanced (I watched for a minute to be sure). However, when I loaded up again to make the return trip, the rocket immediately began keeling over. I brought up the throttle, but not fast enough to escape a fiery death on the Munscape.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this kind of issue similar to that of switching time warp speeds? It seemed like the physics engine decided to recalculate the position and trajectory of the rocket and Mun and killed me with a rounding error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
