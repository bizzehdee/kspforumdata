With or without torque, having the motors active on the rear wheels has a tendency to push the opposite end of the rover right off the ground. Making sure only one set of wheels is actively steering might help as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-14T23:21:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CalculusWarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith 0.23 Minmus now has multiple biomes.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.

I\u0027ve not yet got around to updating it with the rugged wheels but I probably will sometime soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/4kvd3di6msmc60a/Rover%20Launch%206.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMk 6 craft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
