Nope, I wanted a bit more complexity to my team and their moves this time. So I did a bit of research onto competitive pokemon play and took some of their concepts to create an interesting well-rounded team of six. Here is the result of hours of research and balancing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFormat runs as follows:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPokemon:Move 1, Move 2, Move 3, Move 4\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeganium: Light Screen, Toxic, Aromatherapy, Giga Drain\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAmpharos: Rain Dance, Thunder, Thunder Wave, Focus Punch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeracross: Brick Break, Mega Horn, Rest, Sleeptalk\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUmbreon: Baton Pass, Substitute, Mean Look, Assurance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarmie: Psychic, Surf, Recovery, Rapid Spin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECloyster: Spikes, Ice Shard, Explosion, Clamp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took alot of time thinking on what roles each pokemon will do and moves that best fit its role. Pokemon like Heracross and Cloyster are designed to be more independent so they were easy to choose moves for. However, support pokemon like Umbreon and Meganium were harder to choose moves for because I wanted their moves to reflect the needs of other members, but still allow them to be somewhat independent so that they are not completely dependent on other members to K.O. opponents. Anyways, their are some iffy moves that I\u0027m not sure with. Ampharos\u0027s Focus Punch is a good example as i don\u0027t have a sure fire way of making it hit all the time. Other moves, like Starmie\u0027s Rapid Spin, I\u0027m more concerned with my actual usage of its move due to the fact I\u0027m not playing in the competitive field but in the story mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leads me to my final concern: Will other moves not designed to maim the enemy end up not being used at all? In essence, will the difficulty level of the game be too little for my team\u0027s set up and will I end up just reverting back to my all sweeper attack ways and all my effort will be for naught? I think yes. So I Want some self imposed rules and restrictions to up the difficulty level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I ask of the space simulator community for some suggestions: What can I do to ramp up difficulty to make this team useful, but not too difficult to make it not fun. I\u0027m thinking of keeping my pokemon under leveled would be the right path but I\u0027m not sure on how. Also, again I\u0027m iffy on some moves so if you can make a suggestion on a move change, that be great but please give me reasons why so I can better judge if its good or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts, suggestions, random nostalgic moments of your first pokemon game, all are welcome! as long as we stay loosely on the topics path.
