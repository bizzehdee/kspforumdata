I thought it was clean and very easy to get stuff done. A Game of Dwarves is casual fun with a nice entertaining story. The main thing that has turned me off about DF is not the graphics as some might think (I actually LIKE the ASCII; it allows me to superimpose my own imagination) It\u0027s just that so much of the gameplay is repetative. If there was an interface that allowed me to choose how much of a resource to keep stockpiled, or an autolabor of sorts, or even some mouse support I would like the game much better.
