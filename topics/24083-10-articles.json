Then build up vertical velocity to leave the atmosphere, and when you start to hear the engines whine, switch the RAPIERS to rocket mode. Afterwards, the jets will also give out, but by then you are almost in orbit. Don\u0027t let it flame out and play it safe, the fuel margin is big unless you want to bring a heavy payload directly to Munar orbit without refuelling. Leave the nukes for circularization, because the TWR with those is tiny, and you should have been controlling from the top docking port the whole time so the navball reads right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.

I hadn\u0027t added the Quakken here yet, so there you go, a tiny VSSTO to take its place. And in case you don\u0027t go for tiny, I also added the X-33 replica to the shuttle section in the OP too. Check them out if you missed them in the spacecraft exchange! Sadly, I also think the beetle got hit hard by the 0.25 update. I loaded it, and sadly it hasn\u0027t aged well. It kind or relied on the small adapter not being symmetrical, and looks all wrong now. Anyhow, the Quakken will serve its purpose, given that now 3-kerbal crews are a thing. No single stage to Mun unless you have a LKO fuel depot, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027ve been playing with rings again, and laughing in the face of aerodynamics.
