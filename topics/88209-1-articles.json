I\u0027m at a point where I can get it to be stable after the seperation, but I need to throttle down and then I don\u0027t have enough thrust to keep going.

There was no thrust on the big tank only on the SRB\u0027s and the Orbiter, this makes it very very unstable, that in combination with the wings makes it hard to fly. With the real space shuttle the main engines could gimbal like crazy, in stock KSP that isn\u0027t possible though so SAS wasn\u0027t powerful on it\u0027s own. The Vernor engines in the tank made it better though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T23:44:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI built a stock shuttle using the Mk3 fuselage parts, following the RL Space Shuttle platform with 3 LV-T45 main engines, 2 Rockomax 55 OMS engines and 2 BACC SRB boosters. The main external tank was made of the Rockomax Jumbo fuel tank with a Rockomax X200-32 and X200-16 on top. It was always a b*tch to fly, but it felt great to get it into orbit and especially gliding back in for a landing. I think I still have a craft file somewhere, but this was a few releases ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe trick was to angle the boosters so that the CoT would stay close to the shifting CoM as the tank drained, and watch the pitch needle to see how hard and which way the SAS was steering to keep the nose upward. Then if necessary I could redistribute the fuel or change where it was coming from to rebalance the craft during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember the real shuttle had almost no fuel in the main fuselage, except for small tanks in the OMS nacelles that were dedicated to the OMS engines only. All your fuel should be coming from that external tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, be careful about making your tank too big - there\u0027s a limit to how much your boosters will be able to lift, and even if they can lift it they\u0027ll struggle to build up enough speed for orbit. Best of luck, building an \u0022authentic\u0022 shuttle is one of the most rewarding things I\u0027ve done in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
