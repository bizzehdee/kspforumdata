I like the crafts look from the side but to me it looks a little bit like a squashed seal from above. It could do with having a smaller turbine but I need more powerful jets for that I think. Or maybe mount the engines outside of the blades. Yeah, that might be better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jakalth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jakalth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eok, that thing is definately cool! The most acrobatic rotorcraft I\u0027ve seen in kerbal so far. nearly outflies some of the Spitfire rotorcraft I\u0027ve seen. O_o\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks. Got a link for those?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Azimech\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Azimech\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI love it, I repped it. It\u0027s a nice evolution of the idea of rotorcraft and maybe there is a market in the future next to helicopters.\u003Cp\u003EJust once thing: now make a version without \u0022No Offset Limits\u0022 ;-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd ya gotta have to make a version with the new Panther jet engines when 1.0.5 has arrived.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m gonna place your video on the unofficial FB page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ahem. First response on FB: \u0022I need to know the name of the song\u0022.

Minimization would be my goal here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s unoffical FB page? Do you have a link?

It looks pretty cool, too.\u003Cp\u003EI just HAVE to maybe be the party-pooper, though. Is the fan actually beneficial other than via the rule of cool? I mean, compared to having those jet engines pointed straight down instead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually I think it\u0027s pretty catchy, what is it? [edit] Nevermind, listened closer and found it via the lyrics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat hearthstone sample tho\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeeell in this case the jets would have produced more lift if they were angled down but I find rotor craft easier to land as they seem to stabilise themselves during decent while I find pure VTOL\u0027s a bit twitchy. Of course, some people like it that way. I have come up with designs that produce more lift than the engines alone would have but they tend to be a bit big and their practicality is questionable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s sort of hard to explain, but just a few weeks ago there were no stock bearing craft that could get off the ground. Now we have several but bearing designs are getting lighter and stronger as well. Is anything in KSP really useful, only to the admirer, and some of us admire the work and imagination that goes into making something designed for one purpose do something else entirely.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere have been some good helicopters and bearing designs in the past but the nerfs to the jet engines sent everyone back to square one. I think that\u0027s good in a way because it\u0027s forced us to try and optimise things and getting new engines means we\u0027ll be back with better designs overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majorjim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majorjim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is not correct.
