After unlocking the Gravioli detector in my current career I noticed something . . . annoying. It took forever to transmit the data, no matter which antenna I used. They all transmitted the same percentage chunks\u00A0albeit at varying rates. Looking into this I discovered that the only real difference between any antennae (even the Remote Tech antennae I also have installed) is the rate at which packets are transmitted and how much EC it costs to transmit each packet. Aside from that all antenna transmit at 2mit/s; FREAKING ALL OF THEM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question is: Why? Is it some magical value that, if altered, will unravel the very fabric of spacetime? Will a packetSize of 3 somehow glitch the data being transmitted? Or, is it simply because 2 is everyone\u0027s favorite number/simpler\u00A0to balance? :/\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hirumaru","CreatedById":129998,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-10T14:58:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes anyone know?

Lorewise, you could say Kerbals just standardized packet size to 2Mit in their transmission protocols, kinda like we standardized on 8 bits per byte. A number had to be picked. I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s much more to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe gravioli detector does have a rather disproportionate amount of data to transmit compared to all the other science experiments, I agree on the annoyance. It is usually single-handedly at fault for having to add more electricity storage and generation to a science vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Phineas Freak","CreatedById":146521,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-11T08:12:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNobody has ever done any balancing for the stock antennae so do not expect the values to be of any importance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hirumaru","CreatedById":129998,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-14T18:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat does not at all answer my question.
