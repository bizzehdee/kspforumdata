Of course, I finished both missions with fuel to spare.\n\nIn detail, the mission objectives:\n\n1. Orbit ike or gilly\n2. Do science in orbit\n3. Deploy a science sat for future data collection contracts\n4. Land on the moon\n5. Do science on land\n6. Takeoff and get in orbit around the main planet (duna or eve)\n7. Do science in orbit\n8.
