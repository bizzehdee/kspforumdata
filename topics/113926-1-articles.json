Some mod modules aren\u0027t \u0022known\u0022 though and will still show in their old locations (general aero for aero, misc for utility, etc.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo so the solar panels from NFS and the reactors from NFE know they belong in electrics? And the ALCOR pod knows it belongs in pods?
