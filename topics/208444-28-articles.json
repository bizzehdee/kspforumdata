He expected the safety inspector to appear before dark, as the team thought that massive\u00A0boosters might counter the lack of struts on Kerbin. The mission would gradually devolve into reaction wheels, something literally revolutionary\u00A0to Kerbalkind.

The horror of it overcame him with great quantum superlinearecitation. A Massive vortex opened to reveal a terrifying cake-producing monster. The inspector immediately panicked and reached for his pogo-stick, deftly bouncing off the bed that he was floating on down the Nile and into the grasp of Curveball-Anders who spontaneously barfed. Rutabaga, meanwhile, emerged in the river of dreams. Snark saw Kerbiloid and thought, is that Adsii?

The cake-producing monster began slithering towards the first person to run a bakery in the best area of Dakota. Competition wasn\u0027t anything the monster felt like wasting time on. However, the mountain of cake was devoured by the kraken, leaving a steaming pile of useless debris. Boris (the monster) started a clearance war while Adsii cleaned his plate with an explosion of flavour that could\u0027ve potentially rivaled the\u00A0famed Tibetan chocolate croissant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile 18watt, Nazalassa and Starhawk were hatching a plan to take over Minmus with an icecream van.
