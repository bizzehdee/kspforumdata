Sure, there are a few interchangeable variants, but these don\u0027t actually change anything mechanically. Other than a couple upgrades within the first 3 hours of gameplay, you\u0027ll be using the same EVA suits to land on the Mun, Eve, and Eeloo. In the real world, this is very unrealistic. Space suit technologies evolve and change just like any other part of a rocket, and are suited (hehe) for the environments that they\u0027re used in. One example: An EVA suit you use to spacewalk in orbit does not have treads on the boots because it will never walk on a celestial body. It is also quite heavy because it is used in a weightless environment. A suit like this might be designed for a pressure differential of 0.4 atmospheres, and to work in a typical temperature range you\u0027d find in low earth/kerbin orbit.\u00A0 Contrast this with a suit a kerbal might walk on Eve with. This suit would have a different range of temperatures, and far greater pressure differential in a different direction, and would have to weigh far less. A typical EVA suit on earth is far heavier than a person can carry in 1G (300 lbs/ 1300 N), imagine trying to wear that on Eve. You might as well wear a business suit for all the good it would do you.\u00A0 All this is to say that in KSP2, suits should be a line of technology that receives upgrades just like any other. It doesn\u0027t make sense to be using the same suits you use to walk on the Mun for the first time and when you first step foot on an extrasolar body.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVaried suits would also provide interesting gameplay mechanic considerations. For instance: if you don\u0027t plan of EVA\u0027ing, then you don\u0027t need to bring suits along. You could just bring flight suits, but then you can\u0027t EVA in an emergency. Alternatively, if you want to EVA, but not land, you could bring EMUs without the gear for walking around. You could even bring multiple different types of suit for complex missions, or bring fewer suits than you have crew, if only one crew member needs to EVA at a time.\u00A0 I think that the KSP 2 devs should flesh out the way space suits work in order to create far more interesting gameplay dynamics and choices. It would add a layer of depth not present in KSP 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-03T08:42:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI forget parachutes on landers often enough, thank you. I don\u0027t need to remember to bring a specialized suit. Don\u0027t make EVA a chore. Just keep them all in those boxes in pods and it will be fine. I mean Kerbals don\u0027t even have airlocks in their ships, disembarking should be kept simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maria Sirona","CreatedById":210882,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-12T16:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fully agree with The Azis, it\u0027s supposed to be fun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-12T21:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with the fun bit, but why not have the suit upgradable?
