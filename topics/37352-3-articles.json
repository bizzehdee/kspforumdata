I was a fan of the way Katateochi clipped his VTOL engines into one of the tanks to hide them really well, yours sort of stick out a bit more obviously.\u003Cp\u003EIn my own testing I can suggest the LF-A30 engines from I believe KW Rocketry. Actually it might be from NovaPunch. In any case it has 285 thrust with a 375/380 ISP in air/vacuum, which is insanely good for the pile of power the engine provides. 4 of those, 2 on each end of a VTOL craft can lift almost anything. Lot better than the 120 thrust 290 ISP crappy radial stock engines you\u0027ve got there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI REALLY love the way you used tricouplers. I think I\u0027m gonna have to play with them a bit more in my designs. I know that Katateochi used NovaPunch adapter plates, which are the same thing, except much more compact. The stock couplers look really good though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor landing on Duna, those engines are enough as the TWR already is somewhere around 6. They only burn for something like 15s, but that\u0027s enough to slow you down enough to prevent the parachutes from getting ripped off. I actually only used half of the fuel available in those little newly added (0.21) tanks. Other than that, I\u0027m not a fan (I actually am, but it kinda annoys me) of such big mod packs that add ALOT of parts to the game as most parts just double over time (like there\u0027s multiple engines which all have similar ISP, thrust and weight) and mess up the known part layout you got used to. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E (I do have NovaPunch installed, but I\u0027m kinda unsure about B9 Aerospace and KW Rocketry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really gotta make a website at some point that allows you to customize your part packs using checkboxes and custom .zip generation.

My biggest problem with getting the whole package as tight and compact as possible was that you can\u0027t bend the hinges from DR in the editor. If I could, would\u0027ve gotten the rover into a much better position than it is now.

I see what you mean. I only usually see thrust to weight to ISP ratios when I look at an engine, just as I only see mass to fuel storage when looking at tanks.

I\u0027m still using Kethane, cause I love the logistics of it, and it saves time.

I\u0027m really on the fence about the b9 cockpit though - the one with the offset node and the cab with all the windows. I absolutely love using it - especially IVA docking with it, but it\u0027s part of the massive pack, and looks out of place on stock craft \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also a fan of how he packed his craft so tightly together.

I know you stated that the one landing you did took you a week to master (which was damn impressive by the way... Must have been painful at 10 FPS).

In the cargo lander I just used girders from a girder pack and they are attached straight down the middle, which actually caused me some issues fitting the modules round it, so I really like the way your girder runs above everything. In the hab lander I used the stock strut parts and small cube thing to make the L-shaped mount that the ascent modules sits on, I think tri or quad adapters might be the way forward for that next time!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs your rover\u0027s arm made of RTG\u0027s?! That\u0027s different! I also had to really weight my rover down, initially I just used a couple RCS tanks at the back, but then later I added the two command pods and then it was much more stable. Also I\u0027ve used the large RTG\u0027s which I think where once part of NovaPunch but don\u0027t seem to exist any more, but I\u0027m still using them as legacy parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the vid of your rover assembly process, very nice to see it being done differently and as effectively. With your way of mounting the modules on the lander, could you pick them up again and re-attach them to the lander for a totally movable system? That would be epic!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Immashift;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe engine that I used on both main landers and the little ascent lander was the little RMA-3 engine from NovaPunch. It has an ISP of 410 (in vac) and a thrust of 75 and its nice and compact. I think it\u0027s one of my most used the engines for landers, mounted on the stock radial attachment point thing. It\u0027s been changed in the new NovaPunch, same stats just different shape, not sure I like it as much as the previous style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, so you\u0027re taking the rover back with you, nice, but yeah your going to run foul of the docking doom. oh, wait...I\u0027ve got a rover, little folding thing (see my Apollo vid) that uses DR joints to fold up, and (in another craft) I\u0027ve been re-docking it to a lander and taking off again without issue. I think (not 100% sure) that the problem only happens when there are hinges in between the docking port and the core part of what ever your attaching. So if you had a docking port, or another KAS connector, attached directly the rovers root part or via parts that don\u0027t have hinges between them and the root part then I think it will be ok. My folding rover has a KAS connector a couple parts away from the root part, but without hinges in between and I can winch it up and put it in docked mode without horrific exploding. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like your GT ship. Would definitely like to see the pics of that in action, do PM me when you post them and let me know (I\u0027m crap at keeping track of what goes on on the forum!). I\u0027d really recommend just doing pics rather than trying to vid the whole thing. That turned into more of a mission than the mission itself and took up a ridiculous amount of HD space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really not sure how my stuff ends up being so tightly packed, it really isn\u0027t a concious design goal that I set out with, if just kinda happens. I don\u0027t have any footage of the actual building or testing, that would be a very long vid!! The whole thing took a very long time, I actually started building the hab lander in 0.19, I was doing other missions then too, but in 0.20 it became the main focus. Building the cargo lander took a lot less time, thou it took prob around a week of mucking about to workout the KAS and docking port setup to get round the DR issues. For a long time I was just using the KAS magnets to connect to the modules but that was not reliable and would often break things. I actually did the whole mission once before the vid that I eventually made and that was before I\u0027d got the KAS\u002Bdocking port setup. That was just so much better and I\u0027d made a few other changes so I scrapped that vid and started the whole mission a second time. And before that I did many many test runs on the Mun and a lot of testing just on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you both run with too many mods (I can relate) and want to cut the parts down eh?

I just got a fresh copy of 20.2 and un-packed it, then into it I put the Parts and Plugins folder from my zip and then I opened the GameData file and copied the contents of the GameData folder from the zip. The only thing I did not copy was the Squad folder from the zip, as that only has a couple resource files (it shouldn\u0027t really be in the zip). So everything from the zip except the Squad folder in GameData.

All the craft worked fine without the VAB freeze that you are getting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe odd thing is, the freeze that I got when trying them in 21.1 looks just like the one you have in that pic you posted from 20.2.

That exact same thing happens in 21.1 for all the craft.

I\u0027m not sure whether I want to reset the deposit maps or not.
