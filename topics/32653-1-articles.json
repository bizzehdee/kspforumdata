I\u0027m new here and just getting into the game, which is awesome btw. I read the dev blog update about planning for multiplayer and was wondering if they were talking about creating multiplayer servers like Minecraft. I imagine players could run a server with their own Kerbal Solar system and allow friends to play in it, doing joint missions or competing with each other. I think it would be cool if player could have their own launch facility on Kerban and their own flag and they could run around the system claiming asteroids and areas of planets, find \u0022surprises\u0022 before their friends for extra kudos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf this has been discussed somewhere else, please post a link.
