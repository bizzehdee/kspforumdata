Parts from the same mod are listed together, but why are they put into the order they are? And some mod parts end up between groups of stock parts, so for example, you have stock structural parts, mod structural parts, more stock, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ask because I\u0027d like to group everything nicely together by default, ex: having my mod RTGs next to the stock one. I know there\u0027s a mod that allows you to sort parts and I\u0027ve used it, but if there\u0027s something that can be edited in the part files to affect their default order, that would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-21T00:43:56Z\u0022 title=\u002205/21/2014 12:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Boomerang\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-20T21:59:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs far as I can tell they are added in alphabetical-order of the folders within KSP\\Gamedata; presumably with \u0027Squad\u0027 being given preference.
