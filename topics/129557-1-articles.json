Usually it gives a general location like \u0022Area C-L4\u0022 and then lists \u0022Area C-L4 Alpha\u0022, \u0022C-L4 Beta\u0022, etc, etc. If you open the contracts window while in control of a vessel or look at the contract in Mission Control it should list all the locations that you\u0027re supposed to go to.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nHope this helps, and if not, a screen shot of the contract parameters (with all the little \u0022\u002B\u0022 lines open)\u00A0from Mission Control could help to track the issue down.
