To wit: Spaceplanes have high temperature tolerance / low thermal mass. This means they heat up very rapidly but then begin to radiate very aggressively. Due to the low thermal mass, heat loss due to radiation has greater impact on temperature. However, so does convective heating so keep your reentries shallow. It will take you a full half / three quarters of an orbit to de-orbit so plan accordingly if you want to land at the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnown issues: Jool reentries are going to be harder than they should be.
