Priorities should level out, which means the things we consider important should also match what everyone considers important.

We know there are several bugs we haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fixed yet. This is the time to make those fixes and assure the game is working as well as possible.

Of course, that doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t mean we plan to do exactly 10 Beta patches to reach 1.0.

Something that I feel could added, and that would work extremely well with contracts, would be the inclusion of a system that unlocks tech nodes based on in-game accomplishments, meaning that a particular engine or part can only be unlocked once the player has done a specific experiment on a specific body. Like, for example, Nuclear Engines can only be researched after one has sent a probe to Eve. Or Mainsails can only be unlocked after one has recovered a surface sample from Duna. Or larger docking nodes can only be unlocked once the player has completed an orbital rendezvous. This is marginally more realistic than the current system, and would encourage players to progressively explore rather than grind for science on Minmus to get most of the parts that they want.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eddiew","CreatedById":127483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T11:27:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Merinsan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Merinsan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...one more beta release with all features that are going into 1.0, then 1.0 being just bug fixes from 0.91?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecisely this! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sarbian\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sarbian\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA lot of people stay clear of \u0022early access\u0022 games and Squad clearly want to get rid of that tag quickly.
