But since many of us have just been chastised for finding a way to enjoy this mod in the meantime until an official update can come from the creator I will just clarify my post a few up from here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mod does not give any warning messages when loading KSP. But when in the game the only issue I had personally was the inability to change the size of the fairing base. All other aspects of this wonderful mod kinda, sorta, maybe appeared to function in some capacity that was kinda, sorta, maybe like it was before. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI simply downloaded and replaced the KSPAPIextensions.dll in the procedural fairings folder in my personal game data folder connected to my personal installation of this game on my own personal PC. This simple change and work around offered by a few other posters seemed to kinda, sorta, maybe in a way appear to make the size adjusting button kinda, sorta, maybe in a way appear to show up again. And I am now kinda, sorta, maybe in a way able to click on these buttons to kinda, sorta, maybe in a way change the fairing base size. This has allowed me personally to kinda, sorta, maybe in a way utilize this great mod in a manner that may or may not be kinda, sorta, maybe in a way similar to how it kinda, sorta, maybe in a way worked before the KSP 0.25 update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am in no way kinda, sorta, or in any way at all affiliated with the creation or upkeep of this mod. But I am very appreciative of all the fine helpful people who have clearly stated and posted clever work arounds for this and many other mods that have been affected by the most recent update. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust because use this and I am interested in and using a clever work around for a mod that has been affected by the update in no way means I am impatient nor am I claiming in any way that this mod \u0022works in KSP 0.25.\u0022 It does not work and I can\u0027t wait (not literally of course, I can wait and am still waiting)for an actual official update to be released.

Seriously doubt there\u0027s malware in there. For one, I\u0027m on Linux, and second, I compiled it all myself except KAE. Not impossible, but seems highly unlikely. Chrome isn\u0027t complaining for me either. Very likely a false positive. That\u0027s sort of upsetting. Looking into it now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Got it, it was the Windows .bat files triggering it. False positive. I\u0027m putting together another one by copying the new DLLs into the released .zip e-dog made. Will be up shortly.

But norton generally removed every DLL. File that comes with Newly updated mods. But the reason norton does this is because it is not known to be any virus, but the file is unknown and new. It happens with all the mods Roverdude creates every time he updates them, and I\u0027ve come to trust his mods. Norton uses a crowd sourcing function to determine if it\u0027s bad and since it\u0027s a new file it doesn\u0027t know if it can trust it. I\u0027ve never had one show up as malicious, or anything.
