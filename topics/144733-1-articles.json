I had captured an astroid and took me a long time to get it to orbit kerbin. Well I decided to make a mining station to refuel ships at but for some reason unless I\u0027m actually using the ship it doesn\u0027t mine anything at all. It just stays where it was left off at. I was wondering if there was a fix or mod for this problem?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-28T11:54:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease fill me in on a detail. Do you visit this mining ship every few hours? Or do you leave it alone for long periods of time and expect that the ore tanks will be full when you come back? That\u0027s how it used to work, but it doesn\u0027t anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have to visit drill ships regularly to keep them going when they aren\u0027t focused. So are you doing that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-28T18:08:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it shutting down due to lack of power? Overheating? Watch for \u00A0messages that comes up as you are loading the ship.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"subzero22","CreatedById":164064,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T00:30:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo it\u0027s got more than enough power. I have the drills going and the isru and I did check back after I did each node on another ship/mission I had to go build a 6 kerbal base on the mun. but everytime I went back there was no ore and the fuel tanks were still the same as if nothing happened. I even waited one min without using warp to see if it still did that and it did.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T06:09:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen we need pix of the context menus while the thing is running. Maybe shut down the converter\u00A0when you take the drill pix -- having converters running at the same time makes it all a lot more confusing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Coga19000","CreatedById":125394,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-29T12:42:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI haven\u0027t played KSP for quite a while now, but I do remember that back when I played, you had to keep the ship in question loaded all the time for it to correctly keep mining - or doing anything, for that matter. I also vaguely remember a mod that mitigated that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
