A true music player in game - Pause/Play, fastforward/backward, load up playlists, allow players to create playlist (doesn\u0027t have to be in game and require UI for this), etc. This alone, if possible, is amazing enough already, but it could be even more amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Contextual dynamic music - Allow players to choose which track to automatically play based on situations, such as inflight, in orbit, landing, on EVA, reentry, etc, and biomes. Players can just click \u0022Epic sound track\u0022 mode and it will play music based on conditions that has been predefined by the players themselves. Fade-in/out effect for transition is good enough. Failing this,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2b. A set of hot keys linking to specific track for user defined situation. Hitting that \u0022atmospheric entry\u0022 key as your craft slowly descend for epic feels!
