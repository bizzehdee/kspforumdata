Say, while docking I need to face certain angle and if the prograde/retrograde markers vanish behind the edges, I have no clue which direction they are. Even normally, I can guess the general distance they are if I see any other marker, but not the direction.\n\nIs there any method (mod?) that would give a better view of the markers? Say, something like the arrows like the blue arrow pointing the \u0022maneuver\u0022 marker for the rest of the markers (or at least the prograde/retrograde ones)? Or some other way to display that information? (KER gives \u0022horizontal\u0022 and \u0022vertical\u0022 speeds, and that\u0027s better than nothing but still not quite enough.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T15:15:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 03:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sharpy**"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T09:27:55Z","Content":"Not precisely what you\u0027re looking for, but try NavHUD: [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543-1-0-NavHud-a-NavBall-inspired-Heads-Up-Display-1-2-1](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81543-1-0-NavHud-a-NavBall-inspired-Heads-Up-Display-1-2-1)\n\nIt\u0027s a really excellent mod, but I found it was breaking my sense of immersion."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T10:58:49Z","Content":"[Enhanced Navball](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50524) has ghosting of the prograde/retrograde markers, among many other useful features (I love the resize and reposition functions).
