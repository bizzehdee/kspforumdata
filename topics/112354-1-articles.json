Say, while docking I need to face certain angle and if the prograde/retrograde markers vanish behind the edges, I have no clue which direction they are. Even normally, I can guess the general distance they are if I see any other marker, but not the direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any method (mod?) that would give a better view of the markers? Say, something like the arrows like the blue arrow pointing the \u0022maneuver\u0022 marker for the rest of the markers (or at least the prograde/retrograde ones)? Or some other way to display that information?
