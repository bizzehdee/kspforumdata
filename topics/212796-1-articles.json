Upon running out of fuel, I attempted to detach it, but it did not detach. It seemed like it was internally another craft, since I could select and focus the spent stage separately from the lander, but it wasn\u0027t physically budging from the lander. Strangely, the landing engine was able to fire through the spent stage, and had enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E and fuel to soft land (but it toppled and the mission failed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe decoupler was between a Poodle engine and a jumbo 2.5m tank, if that helps any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"schlosrat","CreatedById":141963,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T23:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen this happen a number of times. The workaround I\u0027ve found is to NOT have the decoupler and the next engine in the same stage. It\u0027s annoying, but if you give the decoupler a little time then the spent stage clears the next stage and you can fire your engine. I\u0027ve not seen this kludgy method fail yet, but I\u0027ve seen several instances where, if the engine and decoupler are in the same stage group, then I end up towing a spent stage behind me with the engine firing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
