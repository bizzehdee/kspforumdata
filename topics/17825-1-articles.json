I looked again last night and finally found someone who actually explains stuff on youtube, and decided to take another crack at it. Here\u0027s her channel since I\u0027ve looked through a few tutorials of hers and I feel she does a great job of putting things into perspective for beginners, and not just going through steps so you can\u0027t intuitively deduce what you\u0027re exactly doing when you do it and how to apply the new knowledge like so many other \u0022guides\u0022: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/vscorpianc?feature=g-user-u\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/vscorpianc?feature=g-user-u\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, onto my questions. I\u0027m not worried about collision meshes, adding nodes, and textures yet. I\u0027ve done a bunch of .cfg editing and know how nodes work, I figure collision meshes will be easier if I know modeling since they\u0027re basic geometric shapes, and I\u0027ve enough past experience with photoshop to do the texturing part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, some images:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/RXvrO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022RXvrO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Jeusv.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Jeusv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rZrqq.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rZrqq.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the first part I did, decided to go with an engine since it\u0027s more than a basic cylinder. How is that for size? I took a default cylinder, which I\u0027m assuming is 1x1m (and the scale in blender is proportional to KSP to my understanding) and just edited it from there. So from the top of the \u0022plate\u0022 to the bottom of the engine bell is 1 in height and 1 in diameter. Secondly, how am I for face/vertex count? I looked at the stickied guide and it said for 1m parts to use 24 faces, so I used that and worked off of it. I know there\u0027s much more complex parts in terms of geometry that don\u0027t seem to lag particularly, so I think I\u0027m good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, some technical questions. Do you guys smooth surfaces in the program or use a rough model like I have? Add more faces and vertices to make it smoother or is something like that fine? How can I attach the small fuel line looking part that\u0027s separate in the first two images? In the third image, I selected all the points and moved it so both edges on it were touching the main part and then just went to object mode to take the snapshot. When I get to rendering, is Blender going to keep them together like that? I saw in a tutorial for an older version where you would attach the objects like so and use ctrl\u002Bj to join them, but that doesn\u0027t work in the newest version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess that\u0027s it for now. I\u0027m just looking for a bit of help on a few things. I understand most of the commands and want to get some models down before I move on to giving them collision meshes and the like since I figure it\u0027ll be much easier. What do ya think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers and thanks in advance \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Alright, I\u0027ve done a bit more playing around and watched some vids on youtube and figured out how UV Mapping pretty much works. I\u0027ll try to upload images of some questions regarding seams later or in another post or something since some of the layouts were stretched and I was having issues. Regardless, is there a way to make the UV export higher res? It came out extremely low res and some of the areas were basically just a jumble of pixels where I\u0027d like them to be more defined.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I also realized that the size was being measured from the radius and that I was basically building 2m parts to start with, so that\u0027s sorted and understood now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, where do you guys get your textures for the rockets from? The tanks seem easy enough to do, but I\u0027ve seen some really good stuff for the engines and it just seems unlikely that everyone would be good at modeling and textures. I know some guys have teams who work on stuff, but I still feel like there\u0027s some repository where I can get some CC textures or fair use ones or something I could alter to get me started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-26T12:25:11Z\u0022 title=\u002208/26/2012 12:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 26, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by wildkittyv1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Liarean","CreatedById":33431,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T20:19:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow since I myself never use blender ain\u0027t have to much information on the program itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst off I instantly noticed something about your viewport.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems you\u0027re in orthographic view and if there\u0027s one thing that was learned to me from the beginning that was not to use orthographic view becuase it does some strange things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStick to perspective and you won\u0027t encounter certain problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond the standard for cylindric parts in KSP is 18 sides if I remember correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can change that in the quantity you want but remember:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore poly\u0027s = Slower performance\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example with 18 sides you will be fine mostly.

They make them themselves or a teammate makes them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is possible to use photo\u0027s and such but that doesn\u0027t fit the game and still requires a large amount of editing to make it fit nice on the model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people make them from scratch but there are also people like me that use photos as a reference or base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there isn\u0027t a repository or something like that because every texture has a unique fit on a model. A texture from an uv map from another model doesn\u0027t fit correctly without editing on a different model because of the difference in the uv map.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd indeed some people work in teams and have someone to make textures for them but it can also be done alone.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI work alone so I can practice on the most things in a single project.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do my own models, textures, scripts and uv mapping is just part of the modelling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope it helps a bit and sorry for my english since its not my native language.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust ask me if you have a question with modelling or texturing.

I\u0027m going to leave the simple engines I have now at 24 faces since there\u0027s not a lot of other geometry going on in comparison to some models I\u0027ve seen, so they should be fine. I\u0027ll start making them smaller when I get into adding more surfaces and such to keep the poly count down. The reason I went with ortho view is because the tutorials I watched all seemed to suggest it over perspective, so I\u0027ve been using it.

It\u0027s tough to find an easy to navigate site with a good selection with so many out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour welcome .. great looking results on your engine \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E , ofc you can get higher res images by becoming a paid member but the free subscription gives access to some at least , and tbh the samples are good enough for most cases when making gaming textures , even if its just to use them as reference ....if you use GIMP or PS this site is also a good source for custom brushes and stuff \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.deviantart.com/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.deviantart.com/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrPwner","CreatedById":23671,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T13:43:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo make it smooth:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESelect the object and in the left menu under shading click smooth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt won\u0027t look right, yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the right menu click the wrench icon (with object still selected) and click add modifier.

Nothing\u0027s set in stone since I\u0027m still trying to figure out exactly what I want to do, but if you had a reference image or something you\u0027d like to see emulated then I\u0027ll consider going with it. I just don\u0027t want my parts to look like everyone else\u0027s, I plan on doing a bit of work over the next week or so to throw something together. I was also considering a dark/gunmetal grey color for a base coat and a lighter grey or white for the accents, but that\u0027ll be easier to do so I went with this to get reacquainted with layering/texturing. I\u0027m all ears, though!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eorson: Yeah, most of the smallest sizes for the textures it seems are 1024x1024 so free works just fine for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having issues making my own brushes with GIMP, some kind of permissions error that shouldn\u0027t be happening, but whatever, I\u0027ve got a workaround for the couple of brushes I was trying to make. I\u0027ve never really looked at dA for brushes, so I\u0027ll take a gander in a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
