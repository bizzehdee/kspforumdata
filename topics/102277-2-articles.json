Yeah, because it persists rotation when physics isn\u0027t loaded, which is a larger subset of situations than just \u0022during timewarp.\u0022\n\nHmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\nPersistent Rotation? Rotation Persistence?\n\n\u0022Persistent\u0022 though has a meaning in the game, people could think this will allow you to quickly rotate through save games ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nNo More Cheaty Stop Rotation By Hitting .

Well, since the first time around. Its great. Only slight worry is that it somehow seems to interact with the GUI of throttle controlled avionics, in that when I have both installed two things happen:\n\n1) TCA has no GUI at all (so I can\u0027t use it)\n\n2) Your GUI gets affected when I try to toggle TCA on/off in that the buttons remain but all text disappear. \n\nSorry I can\u0027t give more details than that.. Both mods are in their latest versions and everything else is working (I do also have a large number of other mods). If I have time I\u0027ll test properly in a clean environment tonight."},{"CreatedByName":"pjf","CreatedById":112483,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T09:47:04Z","Content":"Downloading now. In terms of anticipated requests:\n\n- Mentioning the license and link to source in top-post (both are in the download).\n\n- Releases on github and/or kerbalstuff for easier CKAN indexing.\n\n- Display rotational period if not already present (so I can have craft with matched orbital and rotational periods, so they\u0027re always facing the body they\u0027re orbiting).\n\n- Ability to set desired rotation (defaulting to orbital period), and to gently \u0022snap\u0022 rotation to this if the current rotation is \u0022close enough\u0022 when warp is activated. (This means I won\u0027t have satellites slowly accumulate errors because I\u0027m a second or two off with my period).\n\nMany, many thanks!\n\n~ pjf"},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T23:15:40Z","Content":"You made it to modding monday!
