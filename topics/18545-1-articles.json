It seems like the closest planet to Kerbin, and it has a thicker atmosphere which is great for the parachute slowing down the spacecraft. I may be wrong, but, that\u0027s the first planet I would go to. I think the funnest planet to check out would be \u0027Jool\u0027, which is a gaseous planet. Gas planets are found on the outer portions of solar systems. Or they can be pulled in by gravity. \u0027Jool\u0027 has four moons, \u0027Laythe\u0027 (Oceanic moon), \u0027Vail\u0027 (Ice moon), \u0027Tylo\u0027 (a bit bigger, rocky moon), and then \u0027Bop\u0027 (which has a funny name \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Its also a rocky moon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I think the Squad team did very well on naming the planets, or anybody else that helped name them.

This is because when you journey into the inner solar system you delve deeper into the star\u0027s immense gravity well. This has the effect of making any orbital changes much more expensive. So my guess would be that Duna would be easier to reach than Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said ease of mission depends on what you\u0027re trying to achieve. Nova said in one of the unofficial 0.17 discussion forums that Eve\u0027s gravity would be about 1.7x Kerbin\u0027s, whilst having an atmosphere 5x as dense. The thick atmosphere would make landing very easy.

In all seriousness though I would probably try to experiment with the new indicators in the VAB to build a better SSTO Space Plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the planets go, I think the difficulties (and therefore order) of the planets I will be visiting will be: Duna, Jool, Eve, and then Moho. For Duna I think will be kinda like landing on the Mun with a bit more gravity but an atmosphere, so it might actually be easier to land. Eve will require a space plane by the looks of it. I am undecided whether Jool will probably not be much more difficult than Duna to reach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd Moho = Lol\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheProdigy","CreatedById":15985,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-10T23:56:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emechjeb autopilot landings/takeoff \u002B IVA\u0027s = AWESOMMMEEEE\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wont even attempt manual stuff in IVAs when doing a serious attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
