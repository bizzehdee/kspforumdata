Unfortunately it was not a very Kerbal success as it can be attributed to ignoring Jeb\\\u0027s advice on redundancy, that is having none. Luckily the designer doubled up on lander legs as one fell off during the landing. Landing celebrations ensued however Bill split orange juice all over the command console crashing the on board staging system leaving the three kerbals in the dark about how much fuel was left. In addition to this the orange juice caused a short circuit in the flight controls resulting in an unexpected firing of the engines.
