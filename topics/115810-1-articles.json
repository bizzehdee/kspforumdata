But I\u0027d be very curious to see the SDK, and I suspect rolling your own control code (integrating with KSPSerialIO, say) would be required to get any use out of the display modules.\n\nThose modules look really nice. You\u0027d be able to buy components for cheaper, but the finish and the modularity would be much harder to replicate."},{"CreatedByName":"lawnmowerlatte","CreatedById":112768,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T04:06:18Z","Content":"Looks nice, but really expensive for what it is."}]}
