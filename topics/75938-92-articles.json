Wheels sinking and turning but not moving the vessel is due to them being upside down. A good portion of the wheels that don\u0027t have obvious orientations will look like they\u0027re upside down when you attach them to your craft because the suspension defaults to the fully retracted position. For instance, the tiny double-wheels that attach in the center between them are supposed to look like their attachment bars are angled upwards, and the other smaller (but not too small) wheels will look like their attachment plate is all the way on the bottom of the wheel itself. You would think they should be attached the other way around but in fact they should be attached in the exact opposite orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat this all boils down to is this: if the wheel is misbehaving, go back to the editor and try attaching them in a different orientation. I\u0027ll bet that you\u0027ll figure out how they\u0027re meant to be attached very quickly that way. For symmetry to really work the way you would expect for a rover or other horizontal craft, you\u0027ll either need to use the SPH or (I\u0027m unsure if this is possible right now) use an SPH-style symmetry mode. In the VAB it will simply use a radial symmetry mode which will have rather unintuitive controls for symmetrical wheel placement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr just refer to lo-fi\u0027s post that he made just before I submitted mine.

Those things might be cool to convert as well, especially if the engine portion could be maintained so you could still take off afterwards. Unfortunately, due to the way that colliders are used with the repulsors, we couldn\u0027t simply bash the configs together. Likely we would need to weld a surface repulsor part into the original part, and then find a way of making the physical representation of the repulsor invisible.

Make us a video. I wonder how they manage to deal with these issues when you attach things to each other using KAS. I also remember a mod that attempted to introduce formation flying of separate crafts and implemented a lock for the separation between the two crafts even under time warp... though I am unsure if it was standard warp or physical warp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to try and figure out how it might be done, I would say that you might be able to detect the time warp mode, then detect the offset position/rotation of the hitched craft(s) in relation to the one in focus at the beginning of the time warp and continually reset those various crafts to those offsets in relation to the focus craft and it\u0027s own rate of change while the warp is being done, with a final reset when you break out to be extra sure they\u0027re all in the same relative spot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a high number of crafts hitched together, this would probably cause a bit of a freeze in the simulation for a second, but that may just have to be the price you pay for making a space train long enough to touch the ground from orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow to go about this is beyond my ability at the time though.

I have the same issue with the rollcage ones myself, and quickly figured out they were upside down. Hey-ho!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAS does some clever fixing stuff, but I gather it has kraken issues. Like you say, having lots of things hitched together could be a disaster! I\u0027ve got several ideas: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Try and keep everything in place during time warp. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Force docking when entering warp, undock on exit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) See if I can remove the flight integrator stuff from the trailers and parent it to the hitch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve no idea whether any of these are practical. For the hitch it\u0027s not the biggest deal, but I\u0027d like to make the tie downs that attach rovers to a carrier or launcher without being docked. Maybe it\u0027s worth messing with the docking module and letting KSP do the work, then over-riding some stuff. In any case, I\u0027m full of man flu and sort of idly tinkering/musing. Would be a great problem to crack, though\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
