With the rate we\u0027re chewing through the current roadmap, we\u0027re looking at another 4 years of development just on that, and that\u0027s assuming nothing else gets brought in that shifts the schedule or expands things - Its very likely we see a prolonged performance enhancer patch before multiplayer judging by all the systems they\u0027ve identified they want to replace already. Then there\u0027s whatever ends up being done after Multiplayer on the roadmap, before things finally lock down at 1.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt that point, the current console generation is likely to be on its last couple years, pushing the hardware to the limits. Meanwhile, KSP2 will be a game that is significantly bigger than what we already have, which already struggles on hardware that outclasses the current generation consoles by a comfortable margin. The innate performance optimization opportunities of Consoles will help, but its entirely plausible that the game simply can\u0027t run acceptably on a PS5 by that point. At the same time, the successor generation of consoles would be on the horizon - or even out if a major hardware shift brought them into play early, never know with tech. Regardless of what the nature of the innovation is, they\u0027ll be years stronger than the existing machines, and would probably handle it fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess where I\u0027m going with all this is don\u0027t hold your hopes on the idea that the next gen console will get you the KSP2 experience you want, nor will the opportunity to test that theory appear anytime soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:rgb(231,76,60);\u0022\u003E*\u003C/span\u003E\u003Csup\u003EModern mid cycle refreshes might confuse this, the console space is slowly becoming more PC-Like in many regards which has been fascinating to watch.
