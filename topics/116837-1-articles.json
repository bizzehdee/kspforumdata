The heat effects in your screenshot will happen to spaceplanes, as they need to get as much speed as possible from their airbreathing engines. A rocket has no such need. Check the web for \u0022gravity turn\u0022. Understanding the ascent physics helps a lot to get your constructions more efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tech2000","CreatedById":148781,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T00:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Egotcha. thanks. so less rockets, more fuel?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T12:37:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tech2000\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tech2000\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Egotcha. thanks. so less rockets, more fuel?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enot even. Less rockets, more efficiency. If you\u0027ve been powering through the lower atmosphere, then you should have plenty of fuel as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason that you don\u0027t want to go too fast, too low is because of your terminal velocity. You will start to spend more and more fuel on going at the same speed, instead of saving it for when there is less drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo recap- go as fast as you can, but not too fast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso- orbit is all about horizontal velocity, so learn what a gravity turn is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Seaview123","CreatedById":130421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T17:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EVery cool looking craft you\u0027ve got there.

Congratz on starting out and have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for your Quadrojet, here\u0027s some suggestions... put an SAS module next to your cockpit near the center of gravity. That will help with balancing it out. Also, try putting a docking port Jr on top of the fuselage over the CoG, too. Then on the runway, shift control to there (right click menu) and you\u0027ll have a top-down view of the nav ball to help keep your craft level.
