Phase 2 will be to do this without using cheat codes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat submarine is good for exploring the ocean floor, but it works best when you start just off the beach and hug the ocean floor all the way down. It\u0027s a wheeled vehicle with a big rear rocket engine and 12 smaller ones pointing downwards. If you ever find yourself off the seabed, it\u0027s difficult to control, tends to do underwater loop-the-loops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah, I actually drove the thing into the ocean by the Kerbal Space Center at the equator and then drove it underwater nearly 29 degrees south, 1/12th of the way around the world (I did this at 4x warp). That sounds like a long way, and it is, but it\u0027s only about 314 kilometers, or the Kerbal Jules Verne novel 57 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you get down the sloping continental shelf (I recommend going west off the runway and aiming for the beach which is just where the sloping mountain meets the ocean --- if you go east off the runway the continental shelf seems to be a lot steeper), just aim 185 degrees or so and get ready for a long ride underwater.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore too long, you end up going between about 975 meters depth and 1200 meters depth. Up to 999 meters you can get a fairly normal view out your cockpit, at 1000 meters the view gets a little funky, the sun seems to be shining through the planet (or at night, you can see stars through the planet). So it\u0027s better to switch your view to about midrange from above where you can still see the sea floor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe changes in depth are pretty mild when you\u0027re hugging the ocean floor --- there\u0027s no point where you have to worry about slamming into an underwater cliff or tumbling into a chasm or anything like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt about 85 kilometers from the dive point was the first time it really went under 1200 meters depth. But at about 77 kilometers from the dive point the depth unexpected rises above 1000 meters again. Putting the Kerbals on the surface treading water at the dive point paid off at this point, because when you switch to cockpit view you can see \u0027em (I mean, you can see their location on the Heads Up Display), and it\u0027s easier to navigate towards them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt 4.4 kilometers from the dive point, the depth was finally below 1300 meters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the deepest spot I could really find was 1386 meters (and that was in the submarine, which adds 2 meters from a Kerbal on the ground, so it was really 1388 meters deep).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was at 28 54 3 South 276 52 41 East. So close, but not exact, to the kerbalmaps.com (Or maybe that point is a similar depth; I couldn\u0027t get to that exact point...it\u0027s a bit hard to manuever down there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds about right, it\u0027s 3 meters higher than kerbalmaps.com suggests (1388 versus 1391), but that works out, kerbalmaps has the highest point on Kerbal being 6761 meters, the Mount Everest of Kerbin as it were, but if you actually go there on 0.23.5 it\u0027s 6764 meters when you\u0027re a Kerbal on foot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the next step, Phase 2, would be to manage this without using the unlimited fuel cheat, or at least to use it as little as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA differently designed submarine, one made to just plop in the ocean and go straight down, and be stable on the descent (So more of a bathyscape) would seem to the solution. The secret seems to be using the big orange fuel tanks (least bouyant thing in Kerbal engineering) and then put a lot of downward-facing rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, how the heck to get it 28 degrees south, I\u0027m not sure. Maybe some sort of large barge-boat, you\u0027d get the bathyscape on it with the brakes on, then drive the barge-boat to 28 degrees south (whether this can be done without unlimited fuel would be the trick), and then, roll the bathyscape over the side, fire the engines, have Voyage to the Bottom of the Kerbin Sea.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the goal would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Get the barge-boat with bathyscape to 28 S latitude, maybe with the fuel cheat, maybe not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) now with fuel cheat turned off, roll the bathyscape over the side and blast to the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny better ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-09T10:29:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2014 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Algomeysa\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T11:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice effort!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d probably get it in place using a rocket.
