This is wildly unrealistic, normally these types of things are built like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cache.wists.com/thumbnails/2/ee/2ee4c3904c14f07d03f51cb37bf49ea3-orig\u0022 alt=\u00222ee4c3904c14f07d03f51cb37bf49ea3-orig\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that even the kerbals, reckless as they are in flight, at least use basic safety precautions when building their shiny space toys. The solution i have devised is such:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe payload construction building, with both the VAB and SPH symmetries, plus others to aid in rover construction (think if you could space the wheels with left/right and front/back symmetry at the same time). Here you could build whatever package you were delivering, (probably with only monopropellant engines and small bipropellant ones for safety) put a fairing on it (for spaceplanes maybe make it a cargo bay?), probably like procedural fairings, and hit a counterbalance button, which would add weight to the fairing to even out whatever lopsided contraption you have inside. Or potentially, it could make the whole thing one (slightly heavier) part until the fairings were decoupled, to simulate padding and counterweight and reduce lag and wobble. You could then save this like a subassembly, visible in the VAB and SPH payloads tab.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S4qFBxkFFg","CreatedById":83727,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T11:12:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI never thought about this until now, but I want it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably not \u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E difficult to add, given that much of the VAB/SPH code would be used - also, a \u0022clean room\u0022 interior would be one of the easier ones to create - plain white walls/floor!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I think quite a lot of people would want to see Kerbal technicians, dressed as per OP\u0027s picture, walking around in this building.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
