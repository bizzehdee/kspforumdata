I am envisioning this as a new \u0022section\u0022 that works similar to how the Launchpad and Runway work now where the player can click on them in the Space Center scene, choose a craft, and start the launch there.\n\nIf we had something like what NASA is using for the Morpheus Lander project, this would be a good start!\n\n![674439main_Apollo15-2.jpg](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/images/content/674439main_Apollo15-2.jpg)\n\n-AND-\n\n![xq1euutkaaf3dowfmnp3.gif](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--RuXbma4---/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/xq1euutkaaf3dowfmnp3.gif)\n\nHere\u0027s the thread on Reddit that captures many ideas:\n\n[http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34zuov/rover_skate_park_is_a_thing_that_needs_to_happen/](http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34zuov/rover_skate_park_is_a_thing_that_needs_to_happen/)"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T13:22:48Z","Content":"This idea has been brought up a ton- but yes.
