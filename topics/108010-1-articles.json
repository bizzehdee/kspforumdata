It is less viable on higher gravity locations with atmosphere if you don\u0027t have KAS, but still possible. Just keep in mind that everything you are lugging up and down every trip is more fuel you are burning instead of putting on your refueling station and keep the excess mass to a minimum. The lower gravity the body the more efficiently you can get the fuel up."},{"CreatedByName":"Apollyon","CreatedById":94664,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T03:56:52Z","Content":"You need to download the Kerbal Attachment System mod."},{"CreatedByName":"Aerindel","CreatedById":109952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T04:07:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The best I can come up with is a rover that has a claw which drives back and forth between the two,\n\nThat is the best way.

I measure efficiency as net amount (as in, fuel shuttle capacity minus fuel shuttle consumption) of product made available in orbit per ton of raw material acquired on the surface. Because surface ore doesn\u0027t deplete (yay!), you don\u0027t have to worry about wasting any (yay!) so efficiency is really a measure of the number of trips you need to make to deliver the needed amount of product to orbit. If your fuel infrastructure is only for a short-term, low-volume use (like making sure your exploration ship can get back home), then you can tolerate a lot less efficiency. OTOH, if you\u0027re planning long-term, high-volume (like a large, permanent colony), you\u0027ll be making a lot of trips so you want to be as efficient as possible to minimize this tedium.\n\nThe 1st place to find efficiency is in the location of the mine. If your objective is to have an orbital fuel station, then you supply it from an airless, low-gravity moon. Usually there\u0027s only 1 but at Jool you have a choice. If your fuel depot is going to be at Laythe, then it\u0027s better to mine Vall than Pol because the shorter trip burns less fuel than you save due to landing in Pol\u0027s lower gravity. Also, Pol is bugged---try to avoid landing there at all. Anyway, on the moon selected for the mine, you want the mine as close as possible to the equator, to minimize fuel consumption for inclination changes.\n\nThe 2nd place where efficiency is made or lost is in the shuttle that flies between the surface mine and the orbital depot. The heavier this is, the more fuel it will consume making the trip, so the less net product it delivers per trip. Therefore, it\u0027s more efficient to have the fuel shuttle be nothing but tanks and engines and have the ISRU and drills on other vehicles. However, this adds complexity. Now you need multiple vehicles, all of which have to be launched out there. But if you\u0027re building a large permanent colony, you\u0027re doing that anyway so might as well splurge here. You\u0027ll thank yourself later.\n\nThe 3rd place where efficiency comes into play is whether you refine on the surface or in orbit, again looking at the weights involved for the fuel shuttle. Ore conserves mass (1 ton of ore becomes 1 ton of product) so that doesn\u0027t make any difference. However, we have no engines that burn straight ore so if you refine in orbit, the fuel shuttle will need ore tanks as well as the LFO tanks and engines it needs anyway. And the ore tanks have been tweaked so their empty weights make it decidedly better to refine on the surface and move finished product than to refine in orbit and move raw material. This is especially the case if you need industrial quantities as the fuel shuttle will be rather big and heavy anyway.\n\nSo, the choice basically comes down to a simple, possibly only 1-use all-in-1 miner/ISRU/shuttle ship with limited efficiency, or a complex but more efficient, long-term system of a fuel shuttle separate from the drilling and refining vehicle(s).\n\nI\u0027d have to check the relative production rates of drilling and refining to make sure this works with ore, but here\u0027s a trick that worked with Kethane. If it happens that you can drill and refine at the fuel shuttle\u0027s landing pad, then the drill/ISRU station can use the smallest tank sizes. You just need a small ore tank for the ISRU to get started on, and small tanks for its products to go into. So you start the drills to get a tiny bit of ore in the system, then you run the drills and the ISRU simultaneously while pumping product out from the small tanks on the ground station into the big tanks on the shuttle (or the rover that will fill the shuttle) that is already docked to the ground station. You only need big tanks on the ground if A) you want a surface fuel depot (say for planes on Laythe), or ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) your drills are on a rover that brings ore back to a fixed ISRU station.\n\nAll of that depends on how the ore is distributed. So it\u0027s very important to recon the moon thoroughly, then design a system that works best for the situation, rather than build a system and send it out there only to find it\u0027s not ideal for how the ore lies."},{"CreatedByName":"Vulcano53","CreatedById":230784,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-05T23:39:43Z","Content":"I solve the problema by setting a processing unit on a station on kerbal orbit and a mining station on Mimnus surface.
