I built a \u0022floor\u0022 of wings, with a tower in the middle, with tanks and engines attached, facing the \u0022floor\u0022 and fine-tuned the engine height for when the thing would take off, or refuse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout all engines I tested (from Swivel to Mammoth - only Twin Boar defied the rule, for obvious reasons) act at a distance of \u003Cstrong\u003Eabout 4.5 lengths of the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Modular_Girder_Segment_XL\u0022 title=\u0022Modular Girder Segment XL\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EModular Girder Segment XL\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E with very little variance - only Twin Boar required 7 segments from attachment node height, all the rest fit well within 5 from the engine attachment node (and most - except Mammoth - within the lower half of the 5) to the object they interact with.
