If so, you either need to target the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E of the asteroid better, or reduce your thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have some other probe core klawed to this asteroid? If so, you may have a \u0022control point\u0022 problem. Try selecting the correct control point for your craft, and then using the \u0022control from here\u0022 button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-21T14:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, you cannot burn normal or antinornal whenever you want, or at least, you shouldn\u0027t. To change the inclination, you want to burn at the ascending or descending node of the orbit. Otherwise, you are going to flip the orbit around in any direction but not the one you want.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you don\u0027t know it yet: the ascending and descending node is the point where your orbit crosses the equatorial plane of the planet/moon you are orbiting. This happens exactly two times. If your vessel is going to move up/in normal direction relative to the equatorial plane after crossing this point, it is the ascending nide, otherwise the descending node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBurn anti-normal at the ascending node to decrease the inclination and normal if you want to increase it and vice versa on the descending node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ExpandDong","CreatedById":194346,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-02-06T03:22:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you guys for help.
