I got a contract about going to the mun. Seemed pretty easy, from what\u00A0 I did in tutorial, I tried pretty hard, until thought about finishing the tutorial! But every time I can\u0027t complete it, because of this phrase: \u0022I suggest you start ASAP!\u0022 I don\u0027t understand what he means by that, but what do i do, when he says that? Do I wait for the manuever or do something else?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-15T12:18:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nASAP as in \u0022As Soon As Possible\u0022 so don\u0027t delay and start doing \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-15T12:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are quite a few tutorials, and you\u0027re going to have to specify which one, and exactly which step you get to before Gene starts telling you unhelpful things. Then maybe we can explain what he means with his kibitzing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut if the tutorial\u00A0seemed easy, then you may just want to skip it and try the real contract. If you have trouble at some point with the real flight, you can always come back and restart the tutorial to try to see what it says to do next. Make sure to make a quicksave when your ship is on the launchpad! If you end up on the Mun without enough fuel to get back, you may just want to undo everything back to the quicksave. Landing on the Mun takes quite a bit of fuel, and running out is very common for people new to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
