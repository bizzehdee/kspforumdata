What are the contracts that you have accepted.\n\nThe bug (stock KSP bug) is that updates to the contracts window get queued up until you open it. I\u0027ve done a \\*lot\\* of changes in Contract Configurator over time to work around this, but it\u0027s certainly possible to see it in a stock game.\n\nThe bright side is that I\u0027d imagine that with the Unity 5 rewrite this bug will go away in KSP 1.1. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"rollo1002","CreatedById":145192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T05:40:31Z","Content":"I\u0027m all stock for contract stuff. It seems to have not occurred as drastically recently. A few contracts that I\u0027ve recently cleared were one of the building a station on the moon with 2,000 units of fuel and the taking seismic measurements on the surface of minus. It also could be related to the number of contracts but I can\u0027t confirm this as I\u0027m still getting a little delay but have not experienced it where the system message presents itself."}]}
