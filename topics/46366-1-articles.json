The Squad folder seems to be really bloated as far as file sizes go. If you never use the IVA views, you can delete the Props and Spaces folders, and trim your Gamedata folder by around 270MB right there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr, if you want an easier way to trim parts mods, you could give KSP Mod Admin a try.
