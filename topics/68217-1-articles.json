My intention is to be able to fully replace the Squad pack with same-size (but updated shape and style) B9-style parts. The pack will recycle B9 textures in a much smarter way and include a few of FStexture switch options. There will also be some tweaks with B9 parts to make them function like Squad parts (nosecones will be cut in half, so you have a 1.25m cone adapter and a .625m cap, for example). This will reduce RAM load by about 700mb and give lots of new toys to play with, while cleaning up the parts catalog a bit.
