The result ended up looking pretty decent in my opinion, and the video I recorded with them was an improvement over my previous content, so I thought I would share it:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YcnfkaBIm7k?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a couple of differences between the plane in the video and the latest version though. The wings no longer clip through the fuselage, for one (somehow I missed that before recording) and I also added a pair of struts to fix the floppiness. Currently looking to squeeze a bit more maneuverability into their frames.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways...I would link to KerbalX at this point, but for some reason it crashes every time I try to save the draft...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note, if anyone wants to offer feedback on the video, that would be welcomed. I unfortunately can\u0027t do much about the lag. There were approximately 575 parts involved in the battle, which my laptop can normally run at a playable level, but with the recording software open at the same time it made things pretty choppy. I sped the footage up by 300% and tried to edit out all the lag I noticed, but the editing program I use isn\u0027t exactly laptop-friendly either and the playback is anything but fluid. So I don\u0027t actually see the stutters before the final render, unless I go through every clip frame by frame and count how many frames there are between each frame. It\u0027s a hassle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Catto","CreatedById":137773,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-06T14:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last thing i WOULDN\u0027T wanna hear is the humming of a giant dragonfly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith guns, of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Entropian","CreatedById":205453,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-06T17:42:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224127786\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022208073\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221651830758\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022166940\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Earthlinger\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Earthlinger said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSide note, if anyone wants to offer feedback on the video, that would be welcomed.
