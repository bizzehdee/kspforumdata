My problem is that whenever I try to do an EVA report, whether in orbit or even safely on the ground, my Kerbonaut simply slides off the spacecraft and falls to the ground or into space as the case may be. I am using basic rocket parts, but from tutorials I have seen it didn\u0027t appear you needed a ladder or any additional component on the basic crew capsule in order to perform a save EVA. What am I missing?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Smidge204","CreatedById":89677,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T20:15:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe default command modules and crew containers all have ladders on them, and your Kerbal *should* be holding it upon exit. You might be inadvertently hitting the spacebar and letting go, or you might be experiencing some acceleration (Kerbals don\u0027t have very good grip, it seems...). Physical time acceleration can only make things worse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you\u0027re doing everything right, though, so try hitting \u0022F\u0022 to grab the ladder immediately upon exiting.

You might just be an unfortunate victim of the game\u0027s buggy nature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr if you\u0027re not on the ground, you could get a lot of practice using the EVA backpack!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=Smidge=\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-12T04:22:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESometimes they slide around on the ladders. I don\u0027t know why. Just some kind of minor software glitch. I don\u0027t know why it might be happening to you regularly, Aramis1781, because generally it\u0027s just an occasional problem.
