At this point TOTALLY stoked about using my high end simming gear in KSP finally, especially with TrackIR\n\nLoad into game... All my graphics setting have been dumped... ...? I return to the menu and correct. I ensure ALL my settings are saved. \n\nLoad into game again, fly for a bit, crash into ground. That was fun! Revert to launch and.... Crash to desktop... ...?\n\nRELOAD game. All graphics and inputs dumped. . . ...\n\nFix...\n\nReload into game. All Joystick and throttle inputs unresponsive despite being bound. Again, .... I navigate to the game menu from in the sim and check inputs, but of course I cannot access them. When I click on Settings the graphics resolution flips its $%# and goes to a weird windowed version with a jacked up resolution that doesn\u0027t let me even reach the menu to exit. \n\nReboot PC, restart game, rebind EVERYTHING. Go fly again and crash... \n\nRevert to launch. Everything works! Land and revert to launch again, crash to F$@#%$# desktop. \n\nReload sim and EVERYTHING IS FORGOTTEN AGAIN. \n\nBASH HEAD ONTO DESK \n\nThis is disappointing and EXTREMELY frustrating.\n\n\\*UPDATE-\n\nNow the game randomly freezing when I click to put input into the \u0022Yaw\u0022 command, and not I cannot click ANY binding on any menu. What a hot mess this game is. . .\n\n\\*UPDATE 2\\* The game fails to remember ANYTHING I have configured (yes I am hitting apply AND accept) and is dumping all my settings each time I restart it and even reboot PC. IT STILL will not let me bind the \u0022Yaw\u0022 axis even after a reboot and fresh start. We are very quickly approaching the point of uninstalling here, I am pissed.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-13T02:14:22Z\u0022 title=\u002208/13/2015 02:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JG\\_Wentworth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-13T02:22:15Z","Content":"That is not typical, most people run the stock game with very few issues.
