Far from being what I looked for.\n\u003E However, a bunch of humans on Mars in a ISS-sized landed laboratory would open experiments possibilities that you would not even dream of ( bio/botanical experiments, life development under Mars gravity, Terraformation experiments, long range explorations, advanced chemical analysis.... ).\n\nA agree that there are many possibilities. But half of them can be studied on earth equally well, and the other half sounds like things we might simply be able to put of for later. I am really not against space exploration in general as long as the results are worth the cost. If the total of the mission you mentioned is ~1 billion dollars then I am all for it. But the current estimates sound so much higher that I would prefer that money to go into other research (including space ones).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think I\u0027m pretty well informed on what Robots can do and can not. Simply because it\u0027s part of my job.\n\nSorry, I didn\u0027t want to offend you, either.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E As cool as Robots are and as performant as they tend to be, they are not magic and they are still far from human flexibility. They are good to do simple, repetitive task, in well defined environments, in space like every-where else.\n\nFull agreement there. But we are slowly getting better there, which is especially relevant as manned mars missions would also only start ten or probably more years from now.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Or you should ask yourself, why we have the ISS today and why we do not have replaced everything by Robots on Earth\n\nSending people to the ISS, feeding them, giving them breathable air, ... are cheap in comparision to the same on mars or on the way there. The ISS is doing a lot of microgravity experiments that obviously are impossible to do on earth; we use humans, not (ro)bots because it is cheaper: we only need to send a few parts up there, the humans will then assemble them and do experiments. This is viable because sending things is relatively easy and the humans are there. If we would try the same with mars, then the traveling distance/time is enormous and the humans would need to be there for at least a decade, maybe more, for this to be viable. Which does not sound like what people are currently planning to do; it would also cost literally trillions (money again spent better otherwise, in my oppinion).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E What we name today robots, are not robots, but mainly remote controlled un-brained \u0022bot\u0022 trying to do pre-programmed defined job. \n\u003E This has a lot of limitations. Speed of light being what it is, you will and will always have ultra-high latency in remote space operations which limit a lot what you can do and what you cannot. This is not KSP, in real world latency matter.\n\u003E \n\u003E A Mars round-trip-time is around 20min, this is awfully long. If Curiosity has between 2012 and 2014 done **only** 8.4km (which is already amazing), it is mainly due to the complexity to operate with precision any unmanned probe over such high latency. Each little movement need to be verified carefully after a 20 min delay....\n\nAgain agreed. Robots still being not the best thing ever was the reason why I mentioned that we could send hundreds of them instead of several humans. They may all be specialized, but 100 specialists can do a lot of research.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Without even mentioning that if space radioactivity impacts living creature already badly, it is even worst with Electronic. Any Electronic designed for space need to be specially designed, tend to be unreliable, and is millions time less powerful than common available Earth-Chinese-electronic nowadays.\n\nSending humans outside of LEO has similiar problems. They would not only need lots of space, food, water and energy (while bots only need the latter), but a similiar protection from radiation. Or we do \u0022suicide missions\u0022 (then probably also skipping the return to earth), which seem off the table for most. But if a sane person agrees to do that, then I am totally fine with it; it at least lowers costs a lot, and as I said cost efficiency of the missions is essentially what I am concerned about.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But what about the profits they generate?\n\u003E A huge technologic advancement, how many products was possible due technology develope over the apollo program?\n\nPlease name some and explain why we would not have been invented otherwise.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E How many scientist choose to live in USA just due that evidence of \u0022the science edge is here\u0022.\n\nI don\u0027t see why this is an advantage.

My point is that you can\u0027t extrapolate that out to argue that a manned mission to Mars would pay similar dividends. We\u0027ve already picked the proverbial \u0022low hanging fruit\u0022. There may well be some economic benefit to a Mars program (after all, the money we\u0027d spend on it wouldn\u0027t be loaded into a spacecraft and shipped to Mars, we\u0027d spend it here on Earth), it likely won\u0027t be as great an economic benefit as the first time we did it.\n\nAnd please don\u0027t put words into my mouth. I did not say that we shouldn\u0027t be exploring space. I just fail to see why we should send people to do it. As many here have already argued, we can do very high value science using robotic probes for a fraction of the cost of a manned mission. We could reasonably expect to fund robotic missions to Venus\u0027 clouds, a lander to Jupiter\u0027s moons, orbiters to Uranus and Neptune, and even another Titan lander for much less than the cost of a manned mission to Mars. We may not learn as much about Mars by doing those things, but we\u0027d learn a lot about those other places. As sad as it is, the funding doesn\u0027t exist to do everything.
