This is viable because sending things is relatively easy and the humans are there. If we would try the same with mars, then the traveling distance/time is enormous and the humans would need to be there for at least a decade, maybe more, for this to be viable.

My point is that you can\u0027t extrapolate that out to argue that a manned mission to Mars would pay similar dividends. We\u0027ve already picked the proverbial \u0022low hanging fruit\u0022. There may well be some economic benefit to a Mars program (after all, the money we\u0027d spend on it wouldn\u0027t be loaded into a spacecraft and shipped to Mars, we\u0027d spend it here on Earth), it likely won\u0027t be as great an economic benefit as the first time we did it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd please don\u0027t put words into my mouth. I did not say that we shouldn\u0027t be exploring space. I just fail to see why we should send people to do it. As many here have already argued, we can do very high value science using robotic probes for a fraction of the cost of a manned mission. We could reasonably expect to fund robotic missions to Venus\u0027 clouds, a lander to Jupiter\u0027s moons, orbiters to Uranus and Neptune, and even another Titan lander for much less than the cost of a manned mission to Mars. We may not learn as much about Mars by doing those things, but we\u0027d learn a lot about those other places. As sad as it is, the funding doesn\u0027t exist to do everything.
