The reactor was not to have radiation shielding for the fission products of neutrons and gamma rays. As a result, the neutron flux was calculated to vary from 9 x 1017 N/CM2 in the aft section to 7 x 1014 N/CM2 in the nose. Gamma ray energy was expected to be 4 x 1011 MEV in the aft section and 1.2 x 108MEV in the electronics compartment. This required careful selection of materials which could survive not only the high temperatures but also the high radiation levels. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELRL\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s working with Chance Vought for missile propulsion requirements resulted in the following nuclear reactor characteristics for the SLAM weapon system: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiameter----------------------57.25 in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFissionable Core-------------47.24 in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELength-------------------------64.24 in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECore Length------------------50.70 in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECritical Mass of Uranium--59.90 kg.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAvg.
