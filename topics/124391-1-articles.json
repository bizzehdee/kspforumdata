I resolved mine just yesterday by changing the contracts number just like it shows in FancyMouse\u0027s link. I did only change mine to 20, it was on 10 by default I think. The way I play it was killing what I could do since some contracts are long term and I dont advance large amounts of time but rather play through as the days come only advancing short term.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"THobson","CreatedById":97709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T09:15:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou don\u0027t real need a mod. Just go into Game/Data Squad/Contracts and open Contracts.cfg then change the value of AverageAvailableContracts. I have mine set to 50 which is probably a bit too high.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
