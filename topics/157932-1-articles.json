Ive recently been refining my spaceplane building and flying (particularly cargo lifters), and come to a question regarding ascent profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI normally keep a quite shallow ascent to keep the speed up for the rapiers to keep their 200\u002B Kn of thrust. When nearing the 10 Km mark, i try to gain as much speed as possible with a shallow climb. Now at\u00A0what point do you switch the rapiers to close cycle mode? I\u0027ve\u00A0found that I can get up to 1520m/s depending on the heat tolerance of the parts used, but the last ~40m/s are gained very slowly.
