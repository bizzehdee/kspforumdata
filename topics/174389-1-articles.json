I ignored it at the time, and kept on installing mods, cause hey, mod it until it breaks, then fix it and keep going until memory becomes an issue, right?\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EWell, this evening I thought: \u0022Hey, why not go grab the thruster mod I saw earlier?\u0022 And heres where the hair pulling starts. After digging through my browser history I have found myself unable to locate the mod either here or on Spacedock, and I was wondering if anyone here could direct me to it if they can figure out what I\u0027m talking about from the following clues:\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003E1: It had an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ion thruster of some kind, at least 2 nozzles, and looked like a hall-effect thruster (annular)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2: The thruster styling was similar to Near Future Propulsion\u0027s engines in terms of coloring and shape\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003E3: the screenshot of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E ion thruster block was in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, and was fairly close up\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003E4: One of the thrusters shown in the mod had a square-looking nozzle Edit: Not sure on this one.\u003C/s\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure its part of a pack, and if someone could direct me to that pack I would be enormously grateful.
