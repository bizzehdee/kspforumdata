It\u2019s super easy to use, try it out!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-10T09:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry doing the opposite of what real subs did- use an electric propeller while on the surface (the props must be fully in the air so put them on the top of your sub) and then use a jet engine to propel yourself underwater. Solar panels, RTGs\u00A0and the jet\u2019s alternator will recharge the batteries while submerged and ore tanks are great for ballast as you can fill the, up by mining and drain them using an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, a fuel drain valve or by just dumping the entire contents if you want to surface RIGHT NOW. If you\u2019re worried about range, just build a really really big sub with a huge reserve of fuel or bring some drills and an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E along to make more as you go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
