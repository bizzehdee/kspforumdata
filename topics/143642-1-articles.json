When I did, everything was still the same, so I decided to delete the RVSS mod altogether. When I booted up KSP again, I could not load up any of my saves or missions/tutorials, and when I started a new one, my game crashed and I was not able to access the save. The odd part about it is that when I restore RVSS I can load everything back up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anybody help to try and save my KSP?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEDIT: Everything fixed, I deleted a rogue file and everything is back.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-07-12T18:50:17Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2016 06:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vysionone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
