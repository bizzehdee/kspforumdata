She had a loyal (near-rabid) following. I didn\u0027t really like her artworks and the drama she brought to the forum bothered me more than once, but checking the thread was a regular routine. Still, she seemed reasonably popular and had some talent, and I\u0027m sure was a draw for several people to check the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust for the sake of satisfying my curiosity, and this thread will be locked immediately afterwards, \u003Cstrong\u003Ewhat\u0027s the story behind Chobit\u0027s most recent and permanent banning?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I don\u0027t want to stir up trouble.
