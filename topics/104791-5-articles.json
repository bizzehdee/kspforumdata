There is a media team, who is doing all this on Twitch, and there\u0027s an experimentals team, that is doing the testing. I do not know, but I don\u0027t think that everybody in the media team is also on the experimentals team. You need a pretty different skill set for each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScott Manley is a good example of someone who is on both teams, but he\u0027s been busy with extra-ksp activities so I don\u0027t know how prepared he\u0027ll be, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t touched 1.0 but I feel like I\u0027d do a better job than most of these people of showcasing the new features.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
