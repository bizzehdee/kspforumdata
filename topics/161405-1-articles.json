The ASA on the other hand, wants to pioneer, and explore. The ASA thinks that we should not colonize space yet since it is unnecessary for now, and the solar system has not been explored completely yet. But the NSEP thinks that we should colonize space, to keep humanity safe. The NSEP wants to allow people to grow industries in space, trade, work, and live there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ASA and\u00A0the NSEP have their allies too. The ASA are allies with the Middle Eastern Space Agency, the MESA provides resources for the ASA, and have a back up hangar, just in case it goes all wrong. The ASA are also allies with NASA, NASA allows the ASA to pick launch sites in the USA. NASA had similar goals of the ASA.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe NSEP is allied with Rembrandt Aeronautics, a group of genuis engineers who design ridicilous, creative yet still plausible designs for spacecraft and aircraft. The NSEP is also alies with the Australian Space Program. Because the North Sea is no a great place to launch and build rockets, the population density is way too high. So Australia is their best choice,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NSEP","CreatedById":165635,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-05T10:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:36px;\u0022\u003EThe ASA - The Workers\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EThe ASA has a large, but at the same time a small\u00A0crew of workers of\u00A0about 800 people.
