Because I\u0027m still working my way up the tech tree in this career game, I only have HG-5 to use as relays, but each of my satellites have 16 of them. (They form a lovely flower when extended...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, I have a ship at Mun, and this is what the path through the network looks like the picture below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022commnet_path.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022661\u0022 src=\u0022https://jtpool.tan-ce.com/p/ksp/commnet_path.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see that the ship has a weak link to the first satellite with a direct path to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, giving me only 13% signal strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought that the path with the overall best signal would be the path I drew in orange. Did I misunderstand how multi-hop signal strength is calculated, or does CommNet pathfinding not take signal strength into account?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Hmm. After a while it\u0027s using the path I expected it to take. Perhaps it takes a while to recalculate...
