Everything is moving relative to something else. You can be stationary relative to a planet or a star or a galaxy but you will be moving relative to other planets, stars and galaxies and there is no way to say that one frame of reference is more correct than another. Space itself is expanding, like a balloon being inflated. If you draw dots on the surface of the balloon to represent stars, they will move away from each other as the balloon expands. There is no point on the balloon that is stationary, because the whole thing is expanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, it is perfectly possible to reduce your speed to zero \u003Cem\u003Ein your current frame of reference\u003C/em\u003E. So you can have a surface velocity of zero, or an orbital velocity of zero. But if you switch the display to show another frame of reference, your velocity won\u0027t be zero any more. You haven\u0027t actually accelerated or decelerated; you\u0027ve just changed the reference point.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RoboRay","CreatedById":46556,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T12:36:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAll this KSP got me wondering, is it possible to stop in space?

You can pick an arbitrary object and stop in respect to it by coming in contact with it, but that\u0027s the best you can do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven out in deep space, you\u0027re orbiting something. If you match velocities with a nearby craft, they won\u0027t stay matched. They\u0027ll gradually drift apart due to their slightly different orbits, unless they dock together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESecondly, when you are doing a transfer orbit, should you enter the SOI from the outside, or the inside of the orbit?

I do realize we can be not moving in relation to something else, I\u0027m just wondering if that\u0027s the best that can be done. I take it, what you are saying is because there is no specific reference in the galaxy the idea of \u0027standstill\u0027 is completely arbitrary WITHOUT comparing it to something else as essentially, speed is just that. Movement of one object relative to another.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe follow up of course, being that KSP is not an accurately modeled system, is it possible to \u0027stop\u0027 somewhere in the Kerbol system?
