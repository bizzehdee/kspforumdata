KJR helps. But you really do need to think about how things are attached and strut as necessary. Sometimes flying without SAS helps. I have a spaceplane with some severe clipping going on that flies at 1.6c like a rock... but it took several tries to get it strutted properly so it didn\u0027t shake and blow itself apart. Also make sure you\u0027re not making exotic matter at the same time as running the drive.
