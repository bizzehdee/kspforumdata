Using my smartphone, I looked up the key bindings for KSP to learn that now I can select radial or mirror symmetry in either the VAB or SPH by using the \u0022X\u0022 key. So I pressed \u0022X\u0022 and as soon as I moved the wheel back into position, it again switched back to radial mode. I actually had to manually place the wheel on the other wing in the desired position. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the second image, the aircraft in flight, I noticed a blinking aviation light where there should none be - under the aircraft and not attached to anything. Although I had selected \u0022mirror symmetry\u0022 (I used a stock canard for the tail for this aircraft), there it was... where it should not have been because the game defaulted back to radial mode as I was placing the piece. This had also happened with the air intakes, so I had to manually place those on the craft as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow can I solve this problem or is this merely another bug within the system?
