I think the only reason to put a .dll into the GameData folder is if the game itself is going to load it as a KSP plugin. You probably only want it to be available to call from your KSP plugin, right? So try leaving it where it\u0027s installed, note the path to it, and use it in situ in your plugin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
