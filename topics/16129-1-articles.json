Most of the geographical features are indistinguishable from each other, and people are going to be clamoring to name a place after themselves or whatever, and it\u0027ll end up being BlackStorm Sea or something equally cheesy that sounds like a 13 year old came up with it. Besides, if you start naming places and try to explain to someone where something is and reference the map that not everyone is going to (or want to) use because there\u0027s nothing official about it, people are going to be asking, \u0022What do you mean it\u0027s east of Maro\u0027s Delta?
