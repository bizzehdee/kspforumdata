A full moving canard design with a swept aft mounted main wing - especially for super/hypersonic designs typically offers superior controllability, with the canards being ahead of the main shock, they tend to have better control authority, and as stated before, the swept wing reduces drag significantly at higher speeds when your aircraft is flying near straight rather than at the 2-5 degrees positive AoA of lower speed flight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever FAR seems to have issues with the shock front calculations over the wing surface, where a delta wing with a longer root cord should improve control authority over a purely swept wing design at mach 1\u002B (the SR-71, STS, Concord, and Tu-144 all have deltas for this reason).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompound the effects of Mach Tuck with a center of gravity that may not be shifting the way you\u0027d like it to, and you\u0027re likely to end up with an aircraft that hits about mach .85 or so, decides space is scary and it wants to get back down to safe altitudes, and refuses to pull up no matter how hard to press the S key or pull back on your joystick. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo maintain manouverability at trans/supersonic speeds, many modern fighter aircraft are built with the Center of Pressure forward of the average center of mass, as well as other features that reduce the inherent stability of a design.
