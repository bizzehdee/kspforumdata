This little planet is known as Dres. As far as we know, the most interesting place on the planet is a steep cliff near the north pole. Because of this, many space programs make a short trip to the planet, take a look at the canyon, leave and never return again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yet so much of the planet remains unexplored.

It thinks that the \u0027neglected\u0027 worlds, like Moho and Ike and Pol and Eeloo and, yes, even Dres, are worthy of study, for the very fact that they exist. Therefore, the JSP is the best program for the job I am about to give them.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow came the part that was in every one of John\u0027s speeches.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I believe that the Jedi Space Program should commit itself to the goal, before the week is out, of landing a kerbal on Dres and returning him safely to Kerbin.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crowd roared.

Couldn\u0027t have done better myself.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thanks.

Bill was mysteriously teleported back to KSC, but Roning was not so lucky. He, along with his flag, were thrown into the sun. His last transmission contained only two words:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Thanks, Bill.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OWsVvy5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OWsVvy5.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second time in his life, Bill was crying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first time had been after Danke.

One of his close friends.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe vowed never to touch space again...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h0bUbPJ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022h0bUbPJ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAnd that\u0027s it! I hope you enjoyed this short story. As a note, I have noticed that my new writing style isn\u0027t quite doing it for me. To make my stories better and longer, I\u0027m going back to my old script style in my next story. That story won\u0027t be until January, though. Stay tuned...\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
