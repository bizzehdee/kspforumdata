The reasons are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. UY Scuti and VY Canis Majoris are both thousands of times bigger than the Sun, and that just astounds me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Eta Carinae is a GIGANTIC binary star system with a luminosity of over 5,000,000 times that of the sun. It is also in a nebula and is surrounded by gas and dust that constantly fluctuates in interesting ways. Holy crap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. I am completely obsessed with deep space exploration. And, by \u0022deep\u0022, I mean \u0022thousands of light years.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf those stars are too far, at least add Proxima Centauri, which is just 8 light years away and is the closest star to our Sun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T02:17:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love the idea of this!

I don\u0027t know if this kind of expansion is planned at some point by the RSS devs but I think that anyway, they\u0027ll first focus on polishing our system before trying to go beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI see two big issues with a RSS interstellar mod:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- The size of the rockets and the distances. See the Voyager probes, they are on escape trajecories of the solar system, but they used several gravity assists and are not going to reach the next stars in several thousands of years (if not more). Now imagine a manned mission: you\u0027ll need a \u003Cstrong\u003Ehuge \u003C/strong\u003Erocket, and by huge, I mean Saturn-V-looking-like-a-firecracker huge. I honestly think that it will not be possible with conventional propulsion, and it will definitely be impossible with current technologies (thinking about RO here).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- We don\u0027t know what there is up there... Look at Pluto: we got the first decent images of this planet 50 AU from the Sun last month when a probe sent 10 years ago reached it, now think about something several ly away. The point of RSS is being real, making up planets looks is kinda out of topic...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EladDv","CreatedById":118368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T13:34:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe main problem is the 32 bit float single precision nature of KSP coordinate system- which means that you cant get farther than 10^15 from the center of the universe in unity and while there are solutions they are really hacky and not very reliable. if unity ever expands it\u0027s system to 64 bit double precision and we could get 10^308 meters from the center.(dont quote me on the numbers- i know that a light year is ~10^16 and max float is 10^38 but it seems to not work that well at those distances i also might be wrong on all the numbers)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
