One is that the only thing happening within these HypeTrains is people expressing their excitement, mostly with either very large images or with spam-like posts. Most of the reason the KSP forums are so great is \u003Cem\u003Eprecisely because so few people \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Enormally\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E leave spam-like posts, gratuitous large images, or other wastes of bandwidth\u003C/em\u003E. Thus, the HypeTrain is both worrisome and a bit unwholesome for the Forum as a whole. (Not even to mention the many, many times that the Forums have crashed as a result of this behavior.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second reason is that I\u0027m not very happy about this next release being called \u00271.0.\u0027 I personally am of the opinion that another beta version would have been extremely nice, and that 1.0 will be unpleasantly buggy. This will not only be negative for long-time KSP players, but it will also be downright painful for new players who are unaccustomed to the bugs and who want a better game. I kinda wanted this update to be a sort of 0.99 update that allowed the community to iron out bugs, but alas, it was not to be. So that takes a lot of the excitement (and adds a lot of worry) to the coming update. I really can\u0027t get hyped about 1.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo this HypeTrain isn\u0027t for me.
