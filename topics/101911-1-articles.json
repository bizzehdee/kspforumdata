When I add these parts to a spacecraft, they appear normal in the VAB or SPH but once on the launch pad they revert to the grayed out model and don\u0027t function. No thrust from engines and no utility from other kinds of parts affected. If I revert the flight to VAB/SPH the parts appear in the grayed out form there as well, and any attempts to reload the saved ship will feature the broken parts as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis glitch is so bad that it basically ruins the entire ship, as the parts become so broken that they cannot be selected with the cursor in the VAB/SPH to remove them from the ship, essentially forcing one to recreate the whole ship from scratch. The parts also appear to be \u0022physicsless\u0022 (if thats the right term) when on the launch pad as they will fall beneath the surface if the ship is on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe parts that are affected in my game are:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-909 Liquid Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T30 Liquid Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELV-T45 Liquid Engine\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETT-38K Radial Decoupler\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELT-1 Landing Strut\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t noticed any other parts affected. I\u0027ve still been able to enjoy the game using the vast amount of other engines and parts available, and have designed some nice manned missions to Mun and Minmus and some probe missions to other planets using both vertical rocket launches and SSTO Spaceplane launches but I want the ability to use these parts too, like everyone else who has the game. Also not having access to the LV-T30 really hampers my ability to anything in career mode, leaving me to only use the sandbox mode. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have searched far and wide on the interwebs and on this site to find someone else with this problem and a possible solution, but came up empty. Perhaps I just don\u0027t know the name of this particular glitch and have been searching for the wrong thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried to fix it myself. I downloaded the game in .25, and thought that maybe upgrading to .90 would solve the problem, but it didn\u0027t. So tonight I backed up my save file and deleted the \u0022Squad\u0022 and \u0022NASA Mission\u0022 folders, then used the patcher to reinstall those files, to no avail. The same problem persists, so hopefully someone here has experienced a similar problem and can advise. Like I said earlier, the problem has been present since day 1, so I posted here under the \u0022unmodded\u0022 forum because the only mod I have is Mechjeb and the problem started long before I installed that and was unaffected by it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are some screenshots demonstrating the problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uYVDlhA.png\u0022 alt=\u0022uYVDlhA.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere you can see gray or brown and featureless engines, right next to the correctly featured parts in the menu. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ec5fcAz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Ec5fcAz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling the parts on your rocket will appear normal at first, as is shown here, but once on the launchpad...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/I50Zo09.png\u0022 alt=\u0022I50Zo09.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is featureless and non-functioning.
