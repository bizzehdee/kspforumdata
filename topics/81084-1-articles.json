I\u0027d like to address that, but the only way I can think of a way to do so without accessing/calculating the previously mentioned values is to up every part on the vessel\u0027s resource capacity by multiplying it with the current timewarp rate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EY\u0027all have any ideas or experience in this area?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-07T21:47:29Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2014 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by okbillybunnyface\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"erendrake","CreatedById":57164,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T21:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know Greys has been working on similar problems. check this out\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79175-Virgin-Kalactic-AdvGenerator-TrackResource-and-now-NodeToggle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79175-Virgin-Kalactic-AdvGenerator-TrackResource-and-now-NodeToggle\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"okbillybunnyface","CreatedById":19009,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-07T22:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWooow.
