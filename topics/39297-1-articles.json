All his life, all he had ever known was failure and treachery. He had, in fact, watched his own father be double crossed and shamed into exile, all the actions of the Visari Corporation\u0027s political clout. While rebuilding his company\u0027s reputation, Stahl had even been forced to be friends with the man who had thrown his father into exile: Kelghast Visary. Secretly plotting to take Kelghan for himself, he soon realized that he could let the KSA do the job for him, inciting a nuclear strike, making much of Kelghat\u0027s own Kethane irradiated, and the Kelghast Visari\u0027s own assassination at the hands of two, mysterious Kerbals. With his last, pathetic obstacle, Admiral Orlock of Kelghan\u0027s high council unable to see into Kelghast Stahl\u0027s very own company, he had secretly amassed the largest private military in the known universe, complete with it\u0027s own, super large, and carrier capable, battleship, the Khage. Nothing, not even the puny KSA or even the impressively advanced UKA could last more than a day when facing his new irradiated Kethane weapons. Falling like dominoes until the colonies bowed to his greatness, Stahl would laugh, wondering what to do after the completion of his conquest. Watching the orbital strike fighters being designed and tested in Kelghan, he could already see the bustling planets that would soon become mass graves and massive cratered wastelands, and nothing could, or would stop him. Or so he thought... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPresenting two excellent stock ships! One is currently in full service, while the cruiser, the first ever space cruiser designed by me, is a gigantic and unique replica and still requires no gravity and hyperedit to get into orbit, making it a quasi-prototype. Surprisingly, the cruiser only has about 300 parts. Both were made and tested in 0.21.1! Enjoy it guys! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EX-47b (with shielded exhaust pipe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qgvQqd0.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qgvQqd0.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/f08w0wq3vu0k5cv/X-47B.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/f08w0wq3vu0k5cv/X-47B.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESthal\u0027s (should be Stahl, which is German for steel) Cruiser (The KSA fears it) (The photo is slightly outdated, and it also still needs to be HIGHLY STRUTTED to be usable in any capacity at all for now.
