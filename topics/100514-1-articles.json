Or I think it is a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen accepting contracts it is a good thing that the parts list (this one is stock) highlights a part so I can pick it without have to extensive search for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut sometimes it is not make it highlighted even with stock parts like the hichhikers bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I don\u0027t know if it is some programmable logic (like if you don\u0027t already researched the part) or is it related to a mod or maybe missconfig on my end. But it is just a minor thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think I\u0027we got all the mods so I don\u0027t bother to list them up. If you heard of a mod I surely have it.
