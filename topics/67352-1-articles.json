Your rear wheels are far behind your center of mass. Think of a lever or a see-saw. Your CoM is your fulcrum, the tipping point. Your rear wheels are positioned where a child\u0027s feet would be on a see-saw blocking your rotation. Your craft can\u0027t tip upward because the wheels are acting like a FULL-STOP to your see-saw / lever. Moving them forward (if possible) reduces their impact, thus making your plane rotate easier, thus making it easier to lift off. Obviously, you can\u0027t stick your rear landing gear so far foward that your plane falls over backward and crashes its arse into the runway, but if you can cheat them forward a bit it could help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond tip: Put the rear wheels in a position higher than the front wheel so that the whole craft on the runway is angled up for lift-off. This means that you won\u0027t have to actually rotate the craft upward, it is already there from the beginning. This can be acomplished by putting your rear landing gear on the SIDE of the fuel tanks and then angle them back straight up and down. Or put them on the wings instead of the fuel tanks. This gives you an angle of attack while on the runway. You might even find the plane will take off without you even having to touch the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laughing Man","CreatedById":67907,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T22:02:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips I\u0027ll try that out.

Watch out for tail strikes...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) For most designs, the CoL should be a little behind the CoM (as you discovered) and slightly above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If it\u0027s ahead, your plane will be negatively stable. Which means if it gets off the prograde marker too far (pitch or yaw), it will go out of control. (As you discovered.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- If the CoL is too far behind your CoM, your plane will be overly stable. Which means it can be difficult to control and will exhibit lawn-dart behavior (constantly wants to pitch down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(If you want to know why it should be slightly above, let me know and I\u0027ll get into that also.

You can see how much the SAS is working by looking at the trim indicators on the bottom left of the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther things to think about:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- You have a lot of aileron area. I would guess that you don\u0027t know about tweakables yet, so they probably also respond in pitch. (I.e. when you pull up or push down, they deflect.) This is okay if you want your ailerons to act as elevons, but if not it hurts your lift. If you do want to use elevons (they control roll and pitch), then you\u0027ll want to move them back some. Otherwise you can disable the pitch response by right clicking on the aileron and turning off pitch/yaw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding Gear!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The SPH lies about CoM with the landing gear on. Landing gear are labeled with mass in the SPH, but in flight they are considered massless by the physics engine. So, as such, if you\u0027re making fine tune adjustments of your CoL/CoM, remove your landing gear first. Otherwise you will almost certainly end up with a CoM that is more aft in flight than what the SPH indicates (sometimes putting it behind the CoL).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Avoid tilting landing gear like you did. As your plane designs get a bit heavier, tilted landing gear will cause you problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can transfer fuel between tanks in flight. You do this by right clicking on one tank. Then hold ALT while right clicking on the second tank. You can then select Transfer \u0022IN\u0022 or \u0022OUT\u0022 as appropriate. This only works if there\u0027s empty space available in your destination tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laughing Man\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laughing Man\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow, this helped soooo much!

Unless you mean the CoM moves aft (which has the same effect). If your plane wants to pitch down, then it\u0027s probably one of two things: 1) your CoM is probably starting too far forward or 2) you don\u0027t have enough pitch authority. Move your wings slightly forward or swap out your horizontal stab/canard for one of the canard style flight controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you design your CoL to be just ever so slightly aft of the CoM with your most aft fuel setting (probably with the front and middle tanks empty), that will likely be the best starting spot for your wings. Hopefully it keeps the CoL close enough to the CoM when the tanks are full. If not, then you\u0027ll have to mess with fuel lines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a ton of other rules of thumb, but if you\u0027re wondering about wings, you can usually get away with something around 0.5 to 1.0 lift rating per ton of aircraft. You can feel free to go well outside of that, but it\u0027s an okay place to start. So to me it looks like the plane in the pictures has enough wing/mass as it is. Just needs a few tweaks to help with takeoff/CoM control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-31T23:56:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Laughing Man\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Laughing Man\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThanks for the tips I\u0027ll try that out.

If you\u0027re doing space plane design and you have that at reentry, it\u0027ll be a problem. But if you have a regular plane with enough pitch control, and you aren\u0027t being crazy with it, it\u0027s usually fine.
