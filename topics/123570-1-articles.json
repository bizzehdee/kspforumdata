Start with a probodobodyne okto in the VBA, then put a claw on top, launch. Go into map view while on the launchpad, and watch the AP symbol fly off into space over and over, also the ship icon is not to be seen. Does this happen for anyone else?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit- it would seem to go deeper- anything I launch is whacked out (first time using the claw so I suspected it, also there are claw kraken posts). I do have a ship heading for solar orbit with a maneuver node along the path, could this cause issues?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-22T21:47:36Z\u0022 title=\u002210/22/2015 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Waxing_Kibbous\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
