This was all going fine until the left wing of my craft suddenly decided it liked the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn better and subsequently abandoned ship. This triggered a mutiny aboard the ship, and even though the remaining loyal officers did their best to keep the vessel afloat we ended the mission as just another crater on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn.

It would be flown by the only two Kerbonauts I actually had left on the ground, Lenbrett and the legendary Buzz Kerman, first Kerbal in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YA1Ka9B.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022YA1Ka9B.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys back at the lab had pulled an all-nighter to put together a lightweight monopropellant-driven probe with two lawn chairs welded on top. It would be an exciting ride to orbit, but with KER reporting 2400 d/v and the ability to refuel it after landing with extra monoprop from the lander can and the Care Package it would absolutely get the job done. It was nicknamed ScootyPuff Jr. because it was 5AM and they\u0027d used up all their original ideas building it. It was also slightly too big to fit in the cargo bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remedied this by adding some KAS boxen in the cargo bay as well and slapping a \u0027some assembly required\u0027 label on, but this left even less room for the lander so I had to strip even more bits off to put in even more boxes, until eventually Lenbrett had to basically build almost the entire thing in orbit, in a hurry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xQJIpVI.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022xQJIpVI.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd he did, because he\u0027s a trooper, troubleshooting a Communotron that wouldn\u0027t unfurl by pulling it off, sticking it on the hull of the Airhog, having Buzz extend it, then reattaching it to the lander, and scavenging some solar panels off the Airhog when it became clear that the mini-RTG wasn\u0027t enough to keep the batteries topped off on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust before Munrise, the rescue scooter\u0027s engines were fired for a shot to the Mun. The 2.4km/s dV that Kerbal Engineer reported evaporated after only 800m/s of acceleration: not even enough to reach the Mun\u0027s SOI, let alone land on it. I\u0027m not sure why - I switched to my screwing-around save, built exactly the same lander in the VAB and tested it, and got 2400m/s out of it. My theory is that KAS has to faff with the physical-insignificance setting on tiny parts to prevent the Scott Manley Magic Exploding Lander bug, and that was contributing a bunch of nickel-and-dime mass additions that KER wasn\u0027t accounting for because those parts were supposed to be massless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SgDyO9G.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SgDyO9G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe boys in the lab have another night of work cut out for them (so does the KSP PR department), but it looks like Buzz gets to fly the Airhog One again tomorrow morning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starman4308","CreatedById":122674,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-24T03:38:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally completed that Apollo-style mission to the 6.4x Mun, from launch to reentry.
