If you have ships that will never touch the ground, then you need to refuel them in space, and the best way is to make the fuel on a conveniently located low-gravity moon. If you need to refuel landers for subsequent takeoff, or will be consuming fuel on the planet for exploration and whatnot, then you need refueling on the main planet as well. And sometimes (Moho, Dres, Eeloo) that\u0027s the only thing there is anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile fuel and the ore it\u0027s made from weigh the same, the ore tanks are heavier than fuel tanks so it\u0027s more fuel-efficient to move finished product than ore. But OTOH, because the fuel is free and you can make all you need, this really isn\u0027t an issue and the ore tanks are more compact. Same goes for moving the ISRU unit and drills. It\u0027s most efficient to leave them on the ground but they don\u0027t weigh THAT much so lifting them, especially from a low-gravity moon, isn\u0027t that big a deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll mining/refining bases need to be located in or fairly close to a reasonably large area of relatively flat ground. This is so ships can land there. Minmus has perfectly flat flats but nothing else does, and ore tends to concentrate in the least level spots. If you\u0027re lucky, then ore that\u0027s good enough (not necessarily the highest concentration but still a lot) will be in a suitable LZ, which simplifies matters. If not, then you\u0027ll have to have some way to truck the fuel from the mine to the LZ.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re doing all your refueling in space and don\u0027t care about efficiency, the simplest way is to have a lander with drills and ore tanks that goes back and forth to an orbital ship or station with the ISRU. OTOH, if you\u0027re doing any refueling on the ground, or are striving for efficiency so are leaving the drills and ISRUs on the ground, then you need 2 other things: being reasonably good at landing at specific locations and some means of connecting ships together on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELanding precision can be defined as you can routinely land within easy KAS pipe distance (50m or less) of your mining base. If you can\u0027t do that, then you need wheels to bring the fuel to the ship. If the ore is in a flat place, then the drilling/refining \u0022base\u0022 can be a rover. Land the ship that needs fuel, drive the rover to it, hook up, and drill right there. Otherwise, you need a fuel truck running between a distant mine in rough terrain and the LZ in flat terrain. As far as connecting stuff on the ground, docking ports work fine on Minmus\u0027 flats but everywhere else, the uneven ground can cause severe problems. This leaves the Klaw and KAS/KIS pipes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut regardless of these details, the whole thing starts with finding the \u0022best\u0022 ore. Not necessarily the absolutely highest concentration on the planet, but a relatively high level in or near and good LZ, and also on or near the equator (at least if gravity is an issue). I wrote a simple tutorial on prospecting for the \u0022best\u0022 ore.
