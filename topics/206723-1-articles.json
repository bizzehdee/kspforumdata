This doesn\u2019t mean the progression has to be short, as I\u2019ve seen some long progression systems that mostly keep out the grind. My personal definition of a Grundy game is one that, in order to get gratification/ progression, you are forced to do an activity that you would rather not do for a meaningful amount of time. A non-grindy game should always allow you to make meaningful progress even while performing less time-intensive things. Of course, there is a limit to that, as you can\u2019t fit every imaginable type of gameplay in a game, and some games will be about specific things that will be grindy to some people. KSP 1 science mode does this pretty well, as you don\u2019t need to fly a specific type of mission to get more science- both tiny probes and massive motherships can collect some amount of science to advance. In contrast, to progress in Career, you need funds (which is not inherently bad) but the ways to get those funds are limited and oftentimes repetitive. Some contract packs have helped with that by increasing the frequency of cool missions, but the system is still flawed. The proposal to discover planets does not add grind, as long as you can discover new planets in a reasonable way. If the only way to discover a planet is to have a dedicated planet-finding mission, then that is pretty grindy, but if bringing telescopes along for another mission (to take pictures of moons and planets up close) results in the discovery of nearby planets, that would be much better because you could progress while flying a completely different mission type.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd to answer the question of why discover planets at all, it is for the same reason as unlocking parts. When I played science mode for the first time, I got an idea of what all the parts do and stopped using NERVs for my first stage. Planets could do the same thing, teaching players slowly by revealing more content and more challenges to go along with it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-03T22:09:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224086055\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206723\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221643908393\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022180308\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Ahres\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Ahres said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to laugh because I\u0027m frequently reminded on these forums that \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113880-shdwlrd/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022113880\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/113880-shdwlrd/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@shdwlrd\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0and I are almost polar opposites.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s nothing wrong with disagreeing with opinions, as long as it remains civil.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can see both sides of this, but the problem is we have no idea how Intercept intends on implementing their Adventure mode.
