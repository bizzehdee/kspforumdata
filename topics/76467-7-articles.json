The problem, IMHO, with doing it that way is that you end up with engines too big for a tank. If you have a 3.9m engine defined as a Node 3 size, and put it on a 3m tank, its going to stick out and look silly.

Outside the MODEL node, rescaleFactor works as above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, there is a bug in scaling. For parts with MODEL nodes, rescaleFactor is applied twice to the mu, *unless* (a) the part is the root part of the vessel and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E you\u0027ve reverted to launch (or perhaps switched in flight? Don\u0027t recall). All other times, it is applied twice. What this means is that if you have scale = 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 in the MODEL node (or no scale at all), and rescaleFactor = 1.25, then your mesh will actually be 1.5625 as big, but your nodes will be scaled outwards 1.25.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor this reason, when scaling parts using MODEL nodes, it is suggested to leave scale (outside the MODEL node) and rescaleFactor both at 1.0, and instead both change the scale = x, y, z inside the MODEL node and manually scale the positions of the attach nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On diameters. Engine diameter is kinda meaningless except for those engines that have a tank butt attached to them. (Those big flat or dome-like things at the top of engines? Ain\u0027t engines. They\u0027re the bottoms of the tanks. Stupid modders following a stupid KSP convention of adding tank butts to engines.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode size, however, is important. The 7th number in a node_foo = x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, SIZE define (add it if not there) is the node size. In RO, 0 means 0.5m, 1 = 1m, and up from there. Set it to the approximate diameter of the part, so if the engine is approximately 3m in diameter, use 3.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERounding normally should be fine. I wouldn\u0027t round \u0026gt;4.5 down to 4 though (and the like, i.e. flooring), since that will make connections weaker than they should be, and make FAR not handle open nodes correctly. Although as RedAV8R\u0027s contrary position points out ( \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) it\u0027s kind of arbitrary where you do the rounding, since FAR\u0027s gonna be wrong some of the time no matter how you slice it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENode size, however, has absolutely nothing to do with where a part is positioned or the part\u0027s size; it\u0027s merely a number KSP uses to (a) draw the green node bubble and (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E determine joint strength.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathorn","CreatedById":99662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-04T18:19:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUm.. nearly every single engine in the configs I Was doing this morning (KW and AIES) all have scaling in both the MODEL{} node and in rescaleFactor.
