The EC to XM conversion feels a bit like a cheat. so i was considering the following : split functionality for drive and xm conversion between the 2 rings. i think this was already so at some point in the mod\u0027s history. Then: use the Tocamac/Arc reactor (housed in the main hull) principle to essentially make more EC out of EC from the solar panels \u002B some resource to keep the reaction going. that boosted EC is then used to power a miniature Large Hadron Collider in the secondary ring to bombard electrons into or out of a second resource in order to form the XM needed by the warp drive. so the chain would be: ec \u002B resource1 (ex: argon) = boosted ec (thinking 1.21gigawatt ;)) \u002B resource2 (xenon? uranium? Ore?...) = xm. Then the pods sitting in front of the lab and crew quarter could like be able to extract trace ammounts of 1 or 2 of the resources from space, or maybe outer atmosphere layers of planets (like what Sophia did with the jool gas). or 1 of the resources needs to be mined from a planet or asteroid, which is where one of those pods on top and at the bottom of the ship (which never got modelled) \u00A0would play a role.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have plans for the functional part of your revamped version? maybe we can sync the 2 designs in that regard?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ngrtz,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDenko\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Denko666","CreatedById":135673,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-25T18:26:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMod is posted to Spacedock, CKAN option enabled.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis takes version 0.3.3 public, it is by no means finished... but it should be functional enough to enjoy in KSP 1.1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShould any hiccups occur, please submit a ticket on the github page, and i\u0027ll look into it asap.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Denko666","CreatedById":135673,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-28T14:27:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find things suspiciously quiet in here,...
