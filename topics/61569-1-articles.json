This is the first attempt/proof of concept model, lol, which is why it\u0027s a bit under polished, I also haven\u0027t decided on how to get it\u0027s battroid mode to work. Kinda wonky to fiddle with, but I think GERWALK looks pretty good. My arms are too short and too small, but that\u0027ll be addressed in further fixes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny other mecha lovers?
