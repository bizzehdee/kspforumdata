That\u0027s probably the most responsible for it missing the testing deadline. The cargo bays had to be made from scratch and animations do take more time to make and later test than a regular fuel tank. This explains the Mk3 situation. I think in both cases it was 90% certain they would make it in, but they were just covering themselves from broken promises if these more time-consuming parts took even more time than expected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T22:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe low resolution on the new adapters is simply a mistake, original textures have texel density similar to Mk2 parts and will be replaced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Sorry for late reply, only just stumbled on this and thought I should reply anyway)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-19T23:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the update, Porkjet!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
