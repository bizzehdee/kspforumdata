I thought that KSC should need some kind of Rover testing park (Like nasa does). I would find that really handy and I suppose that others will too. What do you think?

They are 16.8 times lighter than a conventional Mk1 cockpit, meaning that you need a 16.8 times smaller rocket, and 16.8 times less cash. I use them in career as often as I can. Not being able to start them manned is a kind of nerf, but that won\u0027t stop me from putting the kerbal in from a later decoupled and recovered cockpit. Starting seats manned could be even more overpowered for rockets. But if the rover tester was an enclosed area, and you couldn\u0027t launch planes and rockets from there, that would be excellent an place for testing rovers, and starting with manned seats.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nikokespprfan","CreatedById":136115,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T18:53:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is Sooo handy if you want to test your rover in highly reliefed enviroments while building it, without having to drive it of to the nearest hilly terrain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(You could have it the testing grounds be an inside facility, then you will not be able to launch anything out of it.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-27T13:13:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you had a separate building for rovers where you could put a guy in a seat from the editor that would be AWESOME.
