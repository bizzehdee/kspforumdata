If the design has the horizontal tail set up to add some additional deflection when the flaps are deployed automatically, that would hide the effect of the pitch-down moment. In any case, that\u0027s proper behavior and it\u0027s a problem to be solved through designing the plane properly.\u003Cp\u003EIn general though, delta wing vehicles don\u0027t have flaps on them. Or they\u0027re the Tu-144 and they deploy canards when the flaps are deployed in order to try and counter the pitch-down moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeading edge slats are also correctly modeled, but given that you don\u0027t often run into stall during launch due to the incredibly short landing gear that you have to work with, there\u0027s not much use for it\u0027s max-AoA-increasing abilities. But if you want them, go ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main benefit of a forward-swept wing would be that they shouldn\u0027t have as much of a rearward shift of the AC when the wings are swept, since more of the wing would be forward, which would help counter the rearward AC shift due to the flow changing for supersonic flight. On the other hand, it would be more prone to be ripped off. Either way, it\u0027ll look cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk learned something new about delta wing aircraft, and that is a good thing.

It does make it harder but far more rewarding to build and fly air planes and rockets with your mod, mainly air planes. Also I saw you wrote not to use flaps on delta wing craft unless you have forward canards. I found a different solution as I don\u0027t usually make craft with forward canards. I set the control surface for the flaps also as elevators so if it pitches down too much I\u0027ll pull up and it will decrease the angle of deflection as the flaps are set as elevators as well. Seems to work for me. No KSp game is complete without random aerodynamic failure! I\u0027m still trying to build a good jet powered stunt plane. I find if I build one with lighter fuel loads it tends to work better. Though that transitional speed of mach 0.7 to 0.9 is usually where the aero frame fails, as to be expected. That is the most dangerous point. I have found with your mod the only kind of air planes, no matter how hard I try, to get them to fail aero dynamically are the small fire spitter powered acrobatic propeller driven planes I\u0027ve made. Cause you know, there\u0027s nothing like celebrating a hard fought mission to Minmus and back by buzzing the tower in my Extra 300 clone.
