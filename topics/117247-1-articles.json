When doing it manually, I tend to forget the deploy solar panels, you might run out of power before you remember to deploy."},{"CreatedByName":"Xyphos","CreatedById":139010,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T09:49:13Z","Content":"That doesn\u0027t help. please read the bold print in the OP."},{"CreatedByName":"obsidian_x","CreatedById":145147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T10:09:51Z","Content":"Gah, reading comprehension fail, sorry.

There is no such part as a ICRU unit. What exists is a ISRU unit, but I just fired up KSP to check and there are no toggle / deploy / retract actions.\n\nDear OP, are you perchance talking about the drill? If you really mean the resource converter, I suspect you have a mod that added these actions to your part."},{"CreatedByName":"X-SR71","CreatedById":108775,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T11:08:28Z","Content":"Long answer short, I don\u0027t think that deploy does anything.
