I gave up and thought that maybe the engine resource handling broke in 0.23 or something. But today I fitted the LF-engine on the Scarab by LLL, and it worked! So I tried to troubleshoot the problem again. I hadn\u0027t installed the sample crafts from TT originally, so now I added them and had a look at how they\u0027re built - which is where i noticed that there are (superfluous) fuel lines running from the fuel tanks to the engines.
