\u00A0I\u0027ve been playing with the Lackluster Mod that has a bunch of antennas included in it, and so I had to go and write a MM cfg to include all the additional antennas. \u00A0It was kind of painful, and I was left trying to come up with nominal ranges for a bunch of antennas using the stock values that are hard-coded as a baseline. \u00A0In order to come up with something reasonable that

packet size to figure out how many packets per second could be transmitted, and then looked at the power requirements per packet to figure out the power/second being transmitted, which I decided was the signal strength of the transmitter. \u00A0I then ranked the antenna according to signal strength, graphed the stock ones and then figured out where on the graph the others fit in. \u00A0Then I just overlaid that graph on another chart of ranges and used that to determine the nominal range for each antenna. \u00A0I\u0027m sure someone better than me at math could do that part, but the signal

while they both have the same signal strength, and thus the same range, the Omni transmits data at twice the rate, so it\u0027s a higher speed connection over the same

data over the same range.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBringing this full circle, I guess my suggestion/request would be to code this method into the antenna range mod, so that instead of needing a

missing in your assessment here is how the Comm 16 transmits data twice as fast as the Omni. \u00A0If they\u0027re both moving 6.6 MiT/sec, they have the same throughput. \u00A0As far as I can see the only mechanical difference the Omni has is that it will use less power more often to achieve exactly the same result, except that in an \u0022out of power\u0022 situation the Omni might wind up 1 MiT ahead of the Comm 16.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be neat to programmatically determine the range of an antenna given the power use and the specified throughput, but to do that \u0022right\u0022 I need to add a bunch of other inputs, like frequency and singal bandwidth (which is not what you\u0027re calling bandwidth), or else I just need to do it abstractly. \u00A0In either case, I have intentionally chosen not to do things that way for now because in general I think it is less intuitive both for part designers and for part users if they can\u0027t just look and see what their antenna can do. \u00A0I\u0027m already borderline failing to adequately communicate the ranges to players, so that\u0027s a hurdle that needs to be overcome before something like this is tackled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last thing: the \u0022stock\u0022 antenna ranges (my configs) are not hard-coded, they\u0027re all configurable in my .cfg. \u00A0If you want to change them in your patch, just use an :AFTER[AntennaRange] pass declaration and go right ahead. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022

something as an antenna, read the bandwidth, packet size, and packet power, and use those to calculate the signal strength.\u00A0 You could then apply a set formula to translate signal strength into a nominal range.\u00A0 I don\u0027t enjoy calculus, but when I graphed it, it came out somewhat curve-ish, so someone better at math should be able to come up with a formula to figure it, or just make a linear formula that you like and re-assign the stock antenna according to it.\u00A0 Either way, nominal range would be a function of signal strength.\u00A0 I don\u0027t do c#, so unfortunately I
