You are going to get some tiny increase due to hysteresis in the rubber of the tyres and viscous friction from the lubricant in the wheel bearings, but mechanical stresses will tear the entire system apart before you see an appreciable increase in resistive force with increased velocity.

Obviously that\u0027s not true. We know that air must flow over and under the wings and impact the wings at certain angles to generate lift. If the plane is not changing position, there can be no lift. All this video does is demonstrate that a conveyor belt can\u0027t actually keep a plane from moving. This would be the equivalent to a person running faster than a treadmill, and running right off the front of it. Or more accurately, a person attaching a rocket to their back and pushing themselves forward (since in the first analogy the legs are actually generating the movement while in an airplane it\u0027s the propeller)."},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T15:14:20Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \u0022can a helicopter take off from a conveyor moving at any speed\u0022 the answer is also \u0022yes\u0022.\n\nNo...

The question is slightly ambiguous as to how the conveyor moves in response to the plane. \n\nSome assume that the conveyor accelerates backwards as the plane accelerates forwards, and since the wheels mostly decouple the conveyor from the aircraft, the plane takes off more or less as normal - unless the wheels spin quickly enough to fail, in which case bad things are going to happen.\n\nOthers assume that the conveyor accelerates backwards until the force it exerts through the wheels is enough to cancel the thrust from the engines.
