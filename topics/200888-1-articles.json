I was thinking starting off small like science experiments for different deepness but if you really wanna go crazy, add submarine parts to the game and make water pressure a thing. I know this is a huge thing and if its included it would have to be in ksp 2. anyways this is a stretch since its kerbal space program not kerbal space and ocean exploration program (although one could say they are an important part to know of other celestial bodies)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cavscout74","CreatedById":181783,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-10T01:39:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s actually not an uncommon request.\u00A0 There already is\u00A0 optional water pressure, but every stock part has the same pressure tolerance\u00A0 (~400m underwater) so all it does it keep you from reaching the bottom if its turned on.\u00A0\u00A0 It is possible to make functional stock submarines \u0026amp; submerged bases, but it usually takes a LOT of full ore tanks to sink.\u00A0\u00A0 I can\u0027t think of any specific ones off the top of my head, but check on KerbalX for ideas\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a couple mods that add submarine parts, which is probably the best you can hope for in KSP.\u00A0\u00A0 \u0022Moist\u0022 is one, but I haven\u0027t used it.\u00A0 Buffalo (by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022106975\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/106975-angel-125/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Angel-125\u003C/a\u003E ) adds submersible parts and IIRC adds a mechanic to increase pressure tolerance.\u00A0\u00A0 I haven\u0027t messed with it in 1.11, but when I was more active in KSP (up to ver 1.9) it was one of my favorite mods.\u00A0 I think there might be one or two more as well - maybe one of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a Laythe drone sub I sent to gather ocean science a while back, using some Buffalo parts (the prop \u0026amp; ballast tanks specifically)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00221IasWf6h.png?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002254.39\u0022 height=\u0022557\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/1IasWf6h.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JIMMY_the_DOG","CreatedById":207019,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-10T14:13:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223938203\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022200888\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221615336669\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210558\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lordmemion360\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, lordmemion360 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nkerbal space and ocean\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis ain\u0027t SubNautica, but yeah that would be cool\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-10T14:14:50Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2021 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by JIMMY_the_DOG\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emade it a lil more forgiving\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-11T11:22:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExploring the oceans is pretty cool and quite \u2018relaxing\u2019 I find.
