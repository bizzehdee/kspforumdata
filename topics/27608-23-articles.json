I can\u0027t be sure what is correct when mixing wings from stock and procedural dynamics. That is not much of a problem I can fine tune the CoL after a couple of short takeoffs. The real problem is asymmetric torque/lift/whatever. Using RCS Build Aid you can clearly see that placing symmetrical wings and control surfaces will very likely generate side to side torque. Also I\u0027ve noticed inexplicable behavior when simply \u0022pulling up\u0022. The aircraft in this case wanted to roll to the right. I don\u0027t have this problem with stock wings. Alas, wonderful mod but I had to uninstall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, having FAR installed the way I have solved this so far, and I believe someone else earlier in the thread mentioned it, is by re-attaching the control surfaces after re-sizing them in addition to a few other things I will talk about later on. You will still have to even out the tips and roots to eliminate torque. You will notice that there are certain points where your vehicle mass changes when re-sizing the parts. You can use this fact to fine tune things. Install \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/rcs-build-aid-v0-2/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERCS Build Aid\u003C/a\u003E so you can see the torque forces. Disable snap mode and you can fine tune your wings/control surfaces to completely eliminate all torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy process is as follows with RCS Build Aid set to show engine torque: Attach wings and size them. Attach control surfaces and size them, make them close to a rectangle or you are going to run into problems. Now detach them and reattach them, also outside of snap mode. Notice that your placement changes the torque. If you have lateral torque, that is your red \u0022axis\u0022 arrow from RCS Build Aid is not pointing to the side you will now need to size the tip/root to eliminate it (You can watch the actual torque number change as you hit the mass changing points of each part). Detach and reattach to be sure you are spot on. Once the red arrow showing the torque axis is pointing out the side you can maneuver the wings/control surfaces and other parts of your aircraft to achieve less than .10 kN of torque, I usually mess with it until I\u0027m under 0.05 or preferably 0. Do attaching and sizing first, then fine tune placement. Something similar would likely work even without FAR installed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can confirm the above poster is correct, that the roots and wing tips do not appear to be properly mirrored when adjusting thickness. I also thing that this is causing the problems people are having as root and tip mass seem to be independent. The graphic appears symmetrical, but my guess is that the actual values are not mirrored correctly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo reproduce this install RCS Build Aid, and your engineer type mod of choice, as well as Procedural Wings. Start a sandbox mode, enable CoG and select a solid rocket booster, add various things from the procedural wings mod and resize the tips and roots while making note of mass changes and torque changes. Try detaching and attaching various surfaces to watch the torque reset itself to the proper value except in the case of non-rectangular control surfaces. Also note that in an install without FAR the CoL seems to jump around especially when coupled with stock wings/control surfaces. I\u0027m still not sure which CoL marker to believe if any but you can get by.

How are you getting all of them on one craft? I\u0027m not done with my own textures though. Usually i can come up with something good \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy code uses 4 bones in total, 2 bones for leading and trailing edge respectively. This way i can move the edges instead of scaling the whole thing. That is why i said the models need to be redone. Basically it\u0027s the weightings which need to be adjusted and then everything needs to be exported as .mu again. I will do this for the B9 wing. And i\u0027m going to as DYJ if i\u0027m allowed to make a fork on Bitbucket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Doing the B9 wing.
