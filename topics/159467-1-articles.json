There\u0027s 90 percent ore at the poles and one equatorial lake, and no 100 percent. Ore seems to be quite consistently the same.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wiki does mention that ore is randomly placed, but so far it seems like it isn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this simply a coincidence?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-20T02:05:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are broad tendencies that are similar - for instance poles usually have more ore than equatorial. \u00A0But on Easy or Normal game settings, it hardly matters because there is generally ore more or less everywhere. \u00A0Start a new sandbox game on the default Hard settings (where almost all surface area will be 0%), cheat a scanner to Minmus orbit. \u00A0Then start another one and do the same - you\u0027ll see differences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-04-20T03:04:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m pretty sure the concentrations are randomly generated with each new game.

After a bit of searching I found information like that online as well. However, what I haven\u0027t been able to find anything on (yet) is what a good ore percentage is. Because I have my ore abundance set up pretty high, I found a 16 percent ore spot on Minmus.
