Its a fairly large recreation of the Saturn V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft file can be downloaded at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/v46mtenr5sroez6/Saturn%20V.craft?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/v46mtenr5sroez6/Saturn%20V.craft?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E. I am at my wits ends trying to get this thing to launch and I think the issue relates to KJR since the breakup happens right after the KJR message shows. The rocket always separates at engines with both the 1st and 2nd Stage engines falling off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA picture of my GameData folder can be found at this link. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/jdvoieyckftr06i/KSP.JPG?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/jdvoieyckftr06i/KSP.JPG?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[EDIT] Just out of curiosity, I downgraded from 3.0.1 to 2.4.5 and it eliminated the problem.

What does happen sometimes on my install is parts burning up due to overheating (thats an Hyperedit/DRE/maybe RSS interaction i guess), but that can be fixed by going into an orbit that is a few magnitutes higher initially. Have you made sure that its structural failures and not just parts burning up? What does the mission log (F3) say?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
