That combination was enough to push a three kerbal capsule (in my mind, a primitive version of the original 3-kerbal Mk1 capsule now found as an in-game museum piece at KSC) to 35 km. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s probably about right for the in-game version, although I\u0027ll probably need to rescale it in-story at some point. The in-story Kerbin system is scaled to our Earth-Moon system - mainly for ease of research - most of the spaceflight facts and figures are borrowed from NASA. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E The trajectory details for Rockomax\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EEndurance\u003C/em\u003E launch, for example, are based on the real values for the Saturn V. Incidentally, Minmus would almost work in that context, using scaled up distances it\u0027s just about within Earth\u0027s Hill Sphere, although I took some liberties with its in-game appearance and made it a slightly more plausible captured \u0027dirty snowball\u0027 comet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbin 1 (Kerbalkind\u0027s first artificial satellite) was launched on a two stage booster consisting of an LV15 powered 1st stage and an LV-902 powered second stage. The LV-902 was basically a smaller derivative of the \u002715 and still used turbo pumps (a re-engineered version of the less than satisfactory LV-9 pumps.). I think for this to work in-game you would need to assume a very light satellite compared to a very heavy capsule for the Kerbal 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Kerbin 2 (heavier advanced satellite and re-entry test vehicle) was launched to orbit using a slightly updated version of the Kerbin 1 booster. Basically the same \u0027902 powered upper stage but with the improved turbo pump technology that enabled the 902 applied to the LV-15. I don\u0027t think I said as much in story but you could call that the LV-20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Moho series of single crewed capsules (in-game Mk-1 capsule would be fine) were launched on a massively upgraded version of the Kerbal 1 booster. LV-T20 powered main stage, augmented by four pressure fed LV-905 powered strap-on boosters and a 905 powered upper stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Eve series 3-kerbal capsule and accompanying service module (think Apollo CSM, in-game the Mk1-3 capsule plus a suitable command module would work) was launched on a vastly more powerful booster. Based on a core stage powered by three LV-T30 engines, with an LV-T20 powered upper stage and three LV-T20 powered strap-on boosters. The Eve service module main engine is an LV-909, basically the vacuum version of the 905. In practice, there\u0027s not a great deal of difference between the LV-905 and the LV-909 - think Space-X\u0027s Merlin C vs Merlin-Vac.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"minepagan","CreatedById":132643,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T02:19:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk.

The spaceflight sections are fun to write but at the same time they\u0027re quite difficult to write - I think most KSP players will have a rough idea of where they\u0027re going although hopefully I can keep folks guessing about the fine details. There\u0027s much more leeway for storytelling with the Kermol.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of which, first draft of the next chapter is about done.

The 903 was the original pressure fed version of the 902 (with upgraded combustion chamber) but it suffered from pogo problems. Wernher had to redesign the fuel lines to get rid of an unwanted resonance mode and after a couple of iterations that redesign was given the 905 version number.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPressure fed engines are a thing incidentally. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E They\u0027re great for reliability because they have very few moving parts. Open a couple of valves and whoosh - hypergolics mix and engine fires. I think all the on-orbit engines for Apollo were pressure fed for that reason. The downside is that they - unsurprisingly - need quite a bit of pressurised gas to force the propellants out of their tanks, and that pressurised gas needs to be stored in a relatively heavy tank of its own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit - they\u0027re also limited by mass flow - turbopumps tend to be better at shifting large amounts of propellant than pressurised gas.
