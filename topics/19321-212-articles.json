I\u0027ve quickloaded and redone the reentry half a dozen times over by now trying different ways of getting the control surfaces to work right.

KSP has a giant honking known issue with unaligned wheels causing planes to skitter all over the runway and go boom.\u003Cp\u003EBut the other serious issue is that your takeoff speed is going to be insanely high because your main wheels are so far back from your COM, and even with perfectly aligned wheels, KSP *does not like* high speed on the wheels. Of course, you also have the wing loading of an F-104, so that doesn\u0027t help either, but the main fix will be to place your main wheels *right* below your AC, slightly back from the CoM. That will let you takeoff at maybe 100-120m/s?

The landing gear on that design is all wrong. It shouldn\u0027t have them soo far back and then yet another pair on the wings ahead of COM. I\u0027d do exactly that, place the wheels a few meters behind the COM and that should work. Also I\u0027d ditch the tailfins for real elevators and replace them with canards of some sort. I\u0027d also add controls surfaces for flaps and ailerons on the wings. I got to say this new version of FAR is better than the prior ones. My airplane designs are more stable and tend to be over stressed less. I did want to ask a question to the mod creator. Did you make it so that way the in game flight computer will stop pulling or turning when it senses fractl density becoming too high? In 23.5 I\u0027d easily be able to tell my plane to pull so hard past fractl density but now in 24.2 the planes I\u0027m flying with FAR seem to back off automatically under stressful aero dynamic maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-03T00:32:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eferram4\u003C/strong\u003E: While I approve of the move, I suspect you\u0027ll get a flood of complaints about FAR breaking the CoL indicator :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a separate note: I used a rather tall tail-fin on my delta-wing plane last night and had some issues with roll/yaw stability.
