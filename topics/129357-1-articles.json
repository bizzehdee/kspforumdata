I\u0027ve got a contract to take a crew report at 19.6 km over a point, so I built a spaceplane to do it (since my ability to hit a point not on the equator at a particular altitude is shaky, with a rocket). I\u0027ve unlocked the Wheesley jet, and decided to strap a couple of those on and take them for a spin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMk-1 cockpit, 2x FL-T800 tanks, \u0022Swivel\u0022 rocket engine constitutes the fuselage. I put small retractable landing gear on the cockpit, put two \u0022B\u0022 wing connectors on the sides with two Elevon 1 on each. Stuck engine nacelles on the ends of the wings, with a Wheesley on the back of each one and a small retractable landing gear on the bottom of each nacelle. Set up actions so that I can switch off the jets and on the rocket and vice-versa while in flight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight plan goes, start out on jets and cruise to the destination zone, at about 6km altitude. Switch over to rocket and go up to 19.6 km and take the reading. Switch back to jets and come back down. However, on the descent, the jets never ignite! I\u0027ve done this before with the Juno and had no problem. Is there something special about the Wheesley that means it can\u0027t recover from flameout?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T01:25:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Rocket engine may have used up all the available liquid fuel in the tanks?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI usually spam the button as I come down when running similar missions, but as far as I know it should ignite automatically when it get\u0027s enough air as long as it\u0027s engaged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBest of luck!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pirateguillermo","CreatedById":154756,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-06T01:54:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a good thought, and I should have included the fuel levels in my description.
