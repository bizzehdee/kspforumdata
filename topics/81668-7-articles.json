If I release the clamp on the tower, the rocket tilts over a bit (MechJeb reports it at 45.6m ASL) and it\u0027s no longer in connection. Also, if I test with a shorter rocket (the 3.3m third stage from my test rocket), that 60.824 setting isn\u0027t enough to let my be in connection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up having to go with Height = 102.00 before a soudning core on it\u0027s own could be in connection.

I deleted the RealSolarSystem folder completely, then unzipped the freshly downloaded Eve-7.4-Default.zip. I went into the game and selected the space center. I\u0027ve obviously messed something up. THe land masses are the Kerbin that I\u0027m familiar with but they are all superimposed on what appears to be the heightmap for earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Ended up having to go back to an older copy of Eve-7.4-Default to get the correct heightmap. Because of that, not sure if I should report any of this as it may all be fixed in the new release but here goes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom KSC, it looks like we\u0027re kind of centered on a largish peninsula. When I look at an orbit view, the appearance looks correct. However the Red dot showing the RemoteTech tower is right by the coast line, apparently a couple miles east of KSC. MechJeb reports that my test flight (simply a Command Pod Mk1) sitting on the launchpad is at 0d06\u002709\u0022S x 74d44\u002744\u0022W, at a height of 150m (level 2 launchpad). According to RemoteTech_Settings.cfg, KSC is located at -0.1054x-74.5003.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom Inland Space Center, it appears that I\u0027m on a small island with hills mostly surrounding the center but from orbit I\u0027m in the middle of a continent. RemoteTech tower appears to be in the right location, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELighthouse Space Center looks mostly ok (assuming it is an island) though the level 1 runway appears to go off the island just a little. It really looks like the entire space center should be rotated 180 so that the landing strip is on the south side of the island. From orbit, though, it looks like the island is supposed to be much larger then what I see from the pad. Also, it\u0027s RemoteTech tower appears to be a few miles NE of the actual space center. Mechjeb says I\u0027m at 4d14\u002759\u0022N x 108d03\u002720\u0022E at 32m, while the cfg file had the antenna at 4.7527 x 108.2603. This might be why I had to increase the height for this antenna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrecipice Space Center is definitely on a cliff but the cliff is only around the size of the center. Plus, both ends of the runway are off the cliff. This also looks like the space center should be rotated 180 so that the runway is on the \u0022south\u0022 side (think it\u0027s actually west due to how the center is rotated). Lastly, the RemoteTech Tower for this center appears to be well south of the pad. My test flight is at 31d42\u002720\u0022N x 7d00\u002704\u0022E at 3880m, while the cfg puts the antenna at 31.5602 x 6.9967.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve included screenshots of what I\u0027m seeing zoomed out from the launch pads of each of the four space centers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/530634121544202526/CD7A056B0473DFEFD818BE85A9DFB2A73BF8E6E6/\u0022 alt=\u0022CD7A056B0473DFEFD818BE85A9DFB2A73BF8E6E6\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steamusercontent.com/ugc/530634121544201944/480154EFDFA763B17317207EAF26A7F49AF0CFE6/\u0022 alt=\u0022480154EFDFA763B17317207EAF26A7F49AF0CFE6\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/530634121544202450/D663C1C987064C5A92D32EC5B60663E657ADEB47/\u0022 alt=\u0022D663C1C987064C5A92D32EC5B60663E657ADEB47\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/530634121544202351/1CA9973252D184F0DD88406F9538D97F33195DB3/\u0022 alt=\u00221CA9973252D184F0DD88406F9538D97F33195DB3\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T19:44:21Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 07:44  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by chrisl\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chrisl","CreatedById":114320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T00:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just completed my first SCANsat run and when I pulled up the map (large and small) what I see is a grainy, black\u0026amp;white map of earth.
