So I set my burn to start at 11:20 before the maneuver point (you always burn shorter than the estimate as you lose weight). I aimed at the blue target and fired all engines and was watching but it hasn\u0027t worked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis time however I have now burned to \u002B16 minutes (5 minutes passed my expectation) and I still haven\u0027t finished off the DV countdown nor the timer yet.

Both the \u0022prograde\u0022 and \u0022at that exact spot instantly\u0022 are important. The orbital projection after the burn assumes your burn is impulsive, meaning the delta-V is added nearly instantaneously. For a interplanetary transfer a burn of maybe a few minutes is close enough to be called \u0022instantaneously\u0022, but as you already know if your craft has low TWR and it takes 30 minutes to perform the burn then we must modify the process, meaning burning earlier as you already know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut once we\u0027ve modified how we perform our burn the blue marker for prograde direction is no longer useful for steering. Remember the velocity change you need to do your interplanetary transfer is calculated \u0022prograde\u0022 and not just \u0022in that direction\u0022. The blue marker just shows what that direction is if you are able to complete your burn instantly. If your burn is stretched out in an arc on your orbit then you need to burn \u003Cstrong\u003Eprograde\u003C/strong\u003E and not just follow the blue marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you perform a burn for hohmann transfer you really only care about the velocity added to either prograde or retrograde direction. Because over a period of 30 minutes your blue marker will drift significantly as your orbit curves a lot of your thrust at the start and end of your burn goes into changing your radial velocity (negative radial at first, then positive radial, so they cancel out and is a waste of delta-V). That\u0027s why dv counter down is moving so slowly despite your absolute velocity increasing at normal rate - your thrust is not in the correct direction to add 100% of the vector in prograde direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine in the extreme case your perform your burn on the wrong side of the planet so that the blue marker is exactly on the retrograde marker. You do a 2300m/s burn in the blue marker\u0027s direction and instead of heading for Jool you find yourself falling back down to Kerbin and now your delta-V required to reach Jool is 4600m/s. Even though you\u0027ve spent 2300m/s you\u0027ve actually increased your delta-V required to reach Jool because you\u0027ve pointed your engines in exactly the opposite direction of where you need to add velocity, despite following the blue marker.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-11T04:01:39Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2013 04:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Diazo","CreatedById":81549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-11T03:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Vanamode said, maneuver nodes assume instantaneous acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe longer a burn gets, the less precise the maneuver node gets due to this effect.
