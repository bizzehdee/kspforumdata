It\u0027s a SSTO plane to Laythe and back. Rear landing gears can be toggled to allow the rover wheels to touch the ground and drive the plane on electrical power, very handy when taxiing, especially on an alien world! The mission itself was pretty straightforward, get off Kerbin on jet power, switch to nuclear when out of atmosphere, circularize and shoot for Jool encounter. When in Jool SOI i lucked out and got a Laythe encounter straight away, so i took it, aerobraked and landed the plane.\n\u003E When landed I EVA\u0027d and planted a flag (of course) and then drove up the hill. When I found a nice spot for takeoff I turned the plane downhill and took off. Once out of atmosphere I played a bit with manouver nodes, and eventually I got a nice slingshot from Vall. The slingshot took me far away but that was ok, from the new apoapsis it was pretty easy to burn for Kerbin encounter. I aerobraked again at Kerbin, circularized, and burned for de-orbit for pinpoint landing at which point I was out of fuel but luckily the plane glides very well even when out of fuel so I did make it back to KSC safely.\n\u003E \n\u003E Jeb about to embark on a great journey!\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/Bkjbhob.jpg\u0022\\]!\\[Bkjbhob.jpg\\](http://i.imgur.com/Bkjbhob.jpg)](%5Bimg)\n\u003E \n\u003E On the beach.\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/9IaJ6cp.jpg\u0022\\]!\\[9IaJ6cp.jpg\\](http://i.imgur.com/9IaJ6cp.jpg)](%5Bimg)\n\u003E \n\u003E Honey I\u0027m home!\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/LSsgPGu.jpg\u0022\\]!\\[LSsgPGu.jpg\\](http://i.imgur.com/LSsgPGu.jpg)](%5Bimg)\n\u003E \n\u003E [more images can be found in the imgur album here.](http://imgur.com/a/ApyFQ#0) I know it is against the rules to lose any parts during the flight, but I thought I\u0027d submit this anyway since the parts were lost to a bug of some sort, they just went poof one by one when i was gliding towards the KSC on the final part of my flight. I did not hit ground or anything else, they just poofed. The plane went on flying so I finished the mission as planned. The landing itself was a smooth one.\n\nThe poofing happens to me to. Both a few hundred km from kerbin but most of the time when trying to land at ksc. Landed ONCE at KSC with out damadge sens 0.19 when returning from duna or laythe. I almost always hit a water pipe hitbox in the runway that seems to drift over time.\n\nSome times I hit stuff reentering to.\n\nSomthing fubar ever sens 0.19. 0.18.2 was the best version.

KAS right now won\u0027t let you attach things to a winch via radial connector port in the VAB/SPH, only with the inline one, so to work around it I had the DEMV attached to the back of the Port outboard fuel tank (not visible), decoupled it on the runway, drove it over to the winch and attached it...and then blew the decouplers the DEMV had been attached with off the back of the tank(before even lighting the engines off) because why carry the weight when it\u0027s just to workaround KAS\u0027s limitations?\n\nI can post a round-trip K-Prize flightlog tomorrow (it\u0027s so late it\u0027s early right now) for either or both of them, but given my Druthers I\u0027d do with the -F because the -G is so heavy it\u0027s a beast to fly (Mechjeb\u0027s spaceplane guidance is less than ideal even on the -F but it invariably ends up spinning the -G. It takes about 10 minutes to get either of them up to full altitude and airspeed before lighting the rockets off, so I tend to use it just so I can pay less attention for most of those 10 minutes. Neener.)\n\nEdit: I \\*have\\* landed The -F on the runway (yes, ON the runway, I will get a screenshot tomorrow), not the -G, which has only ever Landed on Duna (due to unsuccess in getting it and the kethane drilling/refining rig in the same place...before 0.20.0 wiped it out of my save when several of the KAS Parts no longer worked).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-16T08:40:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2013 08:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron**"},{"CreatedByName":"tavert","CreatedById":57383,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-16T10:08:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Name: The Bumblebee\n\u003E Weight: 1.58 tons\n\u003E \n\u003E Parts: 46\n\u003E \n\u003E Pics: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/psswi).\n\nI stand corrected.

That was trickier than it\u0027s supposed to be.\n\n![D88542E5593EB0FAA7CFF93B5721D0D5471E0EA3](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/594754812314678765/D88542E5593EB0FAA7CFF93B5721D0D5471E0EA3/)\n\nOkay, on orbit. Took some adjustment because the initial periapsis was only 69,500m or so (still out of the atmosphere, just not above 70000). Lots of Delta-V left (which is what prompted the creation of the SSTD -G version).\n\n![2B6883B9BAAF3A452412A2BA850F731D8463C22A](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/594754812314832110/2B6883B9BAAF3A452412A2BA850F731D8463C22A/)\n\nAfter reserving some liquidfuel for landing, here I am dumping some oxidizer (Funfact: Engines will still \u0027burn\u0027 one fuel type if the second type they need isn\u0027t available, giving a stock way to dump fuel) and trying to plot how much I can raise the orbit and still have enough fuel to land.\n\n![BF9E068B42F995D3636145D3DE3E524BBACE158A](http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/594754812314975306/BF9E068B42F995D3636145D3DE3E524BBACE158A/)\n\nI eventually settled on 500km. Maybe a bit conservative, but I didn\u0027t want to miss the landing! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\n![19578ABC81EC6523A1B021D29F0B79D66D894F9A](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/594754812315200480/19578ABC81EC6523A1B021D29F0B79D66D894F9A/)\n\n...Aaaand it turned out to be completely unconservative, there wasn\u0027t enough fuel left to get it to land at KSC...and trying to load the last save...sigh...put it back on the runway, so I\u0027ll be relaunching and trying this again...which I\u0027ll post about in a bit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-16T17:04:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2013 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron**"}]}
