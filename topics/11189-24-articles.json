It\u0027s a SSTO plane to Laythe and back. Rear landing gears can be toggled to allow the rover wheels to touch the ground and drive the plane on electrical power, very handy when taxiing, especially on an alien world! The mission itself was pretty straightforward, get off Kerbin on jet power, switch to nuclear when out of atmosphere, circularize and shoot for Jool encounter. When in Jool SOI i lucked out and got a Laythe encounter straight away, so i took it, aerobraked and landed the plane.\u003Cp\u003EWhen landed I EVA\u0027d and planted a flag (of course) and then drove up the hill. When I found a nice spot for takeoff I turned the plane downhill and took off. Once out of atmosphere I played a bit with manouver nodes, and eventually I got a nice slingshot from Vall. The slingshot took me far away but that was ok, from the new apoapsis it was pretty easy to burn for Kerbin encounter. I aerobraked again at Kerbin, circularized, and burned for de-orbit for pinpoint landing at which point I was out of fuel but luckily the plane glides very well even when out of fuel so I did make it back to KSC safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb about to embark on a great journey!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%5Bimg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/Bkjbhob.jpg\u0022]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Bkjbhob.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Bkjbhob.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the beach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%5Bimg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/9IaJ6cp.jpg\u0022]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/9IaJ6cp.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00229IaJ6cp.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHoney I\u0027m home!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022%5Bimg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/LSsgPGu.jpg\u0022]\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/LSsgPGu.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LSsgPGu.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/ApyFQ#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emore images can be found in the imgur album here.\u003C/a\u003E I know it is against the rules to lose any parts during the flight, but I thought I\u0027d submit this anyway since the parts were lost to a bug of some sort, they just went poof one by one when i was gliding towards the KSC on the final part of my flight.
