Good work!\n\u003E \n\nThe difference between sea level engine performance and vac engine performance is more easily notice-able in 2.5x scaled systems and upward, moreso with crafts that are built to operate only in vacuum, with high fuel fractions, and less dead mass (dead mass being plane parts, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E gear, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E...). Cryo engines as a mod aren\u0027t all about the Isp. They\u0027re also about the idea of escaping using the abstract, heavy stock resource \u0022LiquidFuel\u0022 and using a propellant with the proper density (which is very important to other mods and play styles).\n\nFinally, look out for whether your craft\u0027s overall mass drops while you don\u0027t gain much in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. That\u0027s still a win scenario, I think. It\u0027s hard to feel the Isp gain largely because parts are heavy to counter-balance stock size planets being so small and that usually everything uses the heavy **LiquidFuel**."},{"CreatedByName":"Zorg","CreatedById":188015,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-12T16:30:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, Shoujo Q said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I still haven\u0027t quite figured out how to use these to get more deltaV than with normal liquid-fuel engines, but they look very cool at least. Good work!\n\u003E \n\nHere are two simplified ways to look at it.  \n\n1) Same delta V as a liquid fuel tank stage   \n\nRemember liquid hydrogen is less dense. So a fuel tank of the same size as an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E one will give you LESS delta V. To get the same Delta V you need a bigger tank (or more tanks). When you achieve this what you will discover is that the MASS of the propellant will actually be less. And assuming you are comparing similar sized engines  what you get is an LH2 stage that is bigger than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E stage, with the same delta V but much lighter. Whats the advantage? Any  stages you have below it will now have more performance since its lifting a lighter load. \n\n2) Same mass as a liquid fuel stage\n\nFor example if you have a 10 tons of liquid fuel in a stage, try to build a liquid hydrogen stage that also has 10 tons of fuel. You will find you need much bigger tanks (or more) than even case 1) above. Now you have a stage that is much bigger than the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E stage, same mass and significantly more delta V.\n\nAs a general rule you get the benefit of LH2 stages when they are boosted by something else. If you have an LH2 core stage, use solid rockets to start with (think shuttle, SLS, Ariane 5). Lh2 upper stages give a lot of performance if they come after an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E stage (think Saturn V which had a kerolox 1st stage followed by 2 hydrogen ones).\n\nIf the rocket is all Hydrogen its difficult to get a performance benefit. The only real world rocket that does this is the Delta IV heavy and thats for industrial reasons than performance per se. it was in theory convenient to lash together 3 of the same cores.\n\nAs Jade mentioned these benefits become more apparent when trying to build bigger rockets as the tank masses in KSP are quite heavy compared to the real world.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-08-12T16:38:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/12/2020 04:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 12, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Zorg**"},{"CreatedByName":"Friznit","CreatedById":191545,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-08-12T17:51:06Z","Content":"Not being a particularly sophisticated player, my trial and error approach pretty much seems to boil down (or boil off!) to: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E to go up, LH2 to go out, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E or CH4 to get in.

If you have RealPlume, I\u0027ve added methalox plumes support on this particular engine (but I have only rescaled an existing config).  Guessing PlumeParty (or Waterfall) is the RealPlume alternative if you don\u0027t use RealPlume.  You can also presumably allow the engine to switch between hydrolox and methalox by adding a \u0022switchInFlight = True\u0022 option after affectFARVoxels = False.  I haven\u0027t tried that option as I thought that makes the engine a bit cheaty, but is functionally similar to multimode engines.\n\nSpoiler\n\n// Skipper - Sticks to the basics of the CryoEngines

If no ModuleCryoTank is found, it would create a module of that name, but since we used the HAS to select only parts that already had a ModuleCryoTank, that shouldn\u0027t happen.\n\n@Albedo = 0.5 This line will attempt to modify a key named Albedo within ModuleCryoTank to be equal to 0.5. If no such key exists, it will create one. The following lines preform the same function on the other keys that define boiloff from flux.\n\nNote that the way this patch is structured will overwrite any existing flux boiloff keys in cryo tanks, and give every tank the exact same characteristics. I don\u0027t know if any of the tanks already define keys like albedo, a more elegant patch would check to see if any of these keys exist before modifying them, and apply different values that are more appropriate for different types of tanks. However this quick and dirty approach should provide basic functionality and give you a better idea of how patching parts works.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-16T16:20:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2020 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by TBenz**"},{"CreatedByName":"EimajOzear","CreatedById":205916,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-16T16:24:55Z","Content":"[@TBenz](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/190349-tbenz/)  \n\nThank you very much for that crash course, you\u0027ve been very helpful!"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-16T16:43:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 21 minutes ago, TBenz said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Try this patch.
