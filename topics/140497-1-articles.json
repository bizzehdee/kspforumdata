They\u0027re free to open and all that-you get one at the end of a match depending on your performance; higher-ranking crates give better stuff, crates in higher-level battles give better stuff, crates from longer games give more stuff. There\u0027s no real pay2win or anything-it\u0027s actually a very fair business model. You buy premium (which basically doubles your earnings) and you can buy lots of crates (IIRC it\u0027s $4 for 25 max-level crates.) Used to be you only paid premium currency\u00A0for cosmetics, but now you get cosmetics free in crates and there\u0027s no premium currency.
