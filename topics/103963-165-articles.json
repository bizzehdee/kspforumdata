So is it the Lens Flare Shader and OpenGL? Or just OpenGL. Turning off the lens flare shader did the trick the pink box is gone. One other thing I am noticing though is graphics glitch when staging. Whenever I stage the screen kinda glitches. I don\u0027t know how to describe it. Its kinda blink and you will miss it thing and too fast to get a screen shot of. The screen doesn\u0027t exactly go black but I suppose I could describe it as large  transparent artifacts showing up on the left side and top right of the screen whenever I stage. Again its really fast and they don\u0027t stay. Staging in space its all normal really it only happens during takeoff. I am not too concerned about it because again it really fast and it only happens during takeoff. But I just feel I should report it and maybe other people are experiencing this too.\n\u003E \n\nSeems to be the lens flare IN OpenGL."},{"CreatedByName":"ebigunso","CreatedById":113229,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T08:38:56Z","Content":"thanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"pizzaoverhead","CreatedById":26349,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-14T08:57:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 48 minutes ago, Veevee said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Did you change the UI scale in KSP\u0027s settings?
