This means, for example, that I see very blurry textures on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn and no rocks or obstacles of any kind. Yet from the youtube videos I know they are there, although I always thought they could be safely ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently, I landed a tiny rover on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn. After driving around for a bit, I seem to have gotten to an area riddled with invisible rocks that, when I run into them, almost launch and generally topple my little rover. This is at speeds of a mere ~2-4 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould someone confirm that this is indeed caused by rocks that I could see if my computer were capable of displaying them? Alternatively, could they be random terrain features like fractures or ridges?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T19:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEven if you do turn the rocks option on, they are only a visual effect and you pass through them instead of hitting them. Whatever your problem may be, it isn\u0027t from hitting rocks, invisible or otherwise.
