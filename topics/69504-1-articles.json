Spent the last 2 days trying to send ships to the Mun to collect science with enough fuel to get back but sadly they ran out of fuel, but I was able to after 2 more days send a ship there with a Hitch Hiker attachment there to rescue Jeb and collect all the missing science! I was so happy when it remade Kerbin orbit! No I am working on my docking but am having some troubles, but that is where I find the fun to be. Anyway I am going to go and try my attempt at more docking. Have fun and fly safe!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-16T07:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHello MrArsenic.
