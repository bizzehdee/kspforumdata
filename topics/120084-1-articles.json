Mods please feel free to move if you choose).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been modelling and texturing for ages. I\u0027ve also been severely underwhelmed by existing nosecones for ages (Both stock and the mod ones I\u0027ve encountered.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea with my nosecone: Why cant it also double as a structural converter part? All I need is correctly placed attach nodes for each of the other sides, at the exact height in the cone where the radius perfectly matches that size standard. Placing one of these would then offer you an attachment point at each of the levels where a smaller part would perfectly fit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have successfully not only created a nosecone that achieves this, but also did it with a perfectly bullet-shaped form that actually resembles what a real nosecone often is. There is some standoffto make sure the last rim of polygons is purely vertical so that the cone merges perfectly with a cylinder of the right size below it, and some extra polygon investment at the point to create that small roundoff a nosecone should have. The model is efficient, and only takes up around 400 polys. (And yes, I can see that most stock nosecones probably only take up around 120.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to hear what you guys have to say about this idea. If I go fully through with this concept, there will be four other versions with base sizes representing the rest of the sizes, including the mod-only 1.875m \u0022standard\u0022 which seems too easy not to include, since its only one more model to cover it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe blue blocks are just being used like tags so I dont lose track of which edges are the connector sized edges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/8UYRtnO.png\u0022 alt=\u00228UYRtnO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here\u0027s how it looks without the lines and dots and reference blocks. (Not textured, but it will probably just be an off-white gentle noise. maybe not even noise. it\u0027s smooth, painted metal, after all. That\u0027s about as easy as texturing can be. If the general people want it perfectly KSP matched, it wont even be reflective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/6mzdFjs.png\u0022 alt=\u00226mzdFjs.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.......Not to mention stock currently lacks 3.75m nosecones entirely...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-08T08:05:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/08/2015 08:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Camaron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mipe","CreatedById":109421,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T09:00:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E.......Not to mention stock currently lacks 3.75m nosecones entirely...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause there are adapters and fairings available.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour nosecone looks nice, though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"passinglurker","CreatedById":103157,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T17:07:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to double check but I think the reason they are not size converters is because of how stock aerodynamics treats unoccupied nodes and might arbitrarily give more drag regardless of shape.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camaron","CreatedById":100218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-06T03:24:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022passinglurker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022passinglurker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027ll have to double check but I think the reason they are not size converters is because of how stock aerodynamics treats unoccupied nodes and might arbitrarily give more drag regardless of shape.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat actually might be a good thing.
