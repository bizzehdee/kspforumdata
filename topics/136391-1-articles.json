For some fuel types, there was a consistent progression across tank sizes, for others, there was not; and across fuel types, there was no consistency at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP v1.0, Squad made the decision to standardize all the fuel tanks in KSP to a mass ratio of 9:1 - meaning one ton worth of tankage holds 8 tons worth of propellant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the fuel tanks...? No! A small holdout yet remains \u003Cs\u003Ein the northern reaches of Gaul\u003C/s\u003E in the form of the xenon tanks. Their mass ratio still sits at 2.2727:1 - meaning one ton of tankage holds just 1.2727 tons of propellant. It\u0027s almost a fifty-fifty split between dry mass and xenon!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy It Matters:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket equation consists of two parts that are multiplied with each other. One is the effective exhaust velocity, which we know in the derivative form of specific impulse (Isp). The other is the vessel\u0027s mass ratio. Therefore, the mass ratio is \u003Cem\u003Eat least\u003C/em\u003E as important as Isp for the performance of a rocket. You can argue that it is even more important, because while Isp only defines the rocket\u0027s dV, the mass ratio defines the rocket\u0027s dV in the same way as Isp does, and in addition to that, also defines the rocket\u0027s TWR. A better mass ratio gives you both more dV \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E shorter burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother consequence of the mass ratio going into the rocket equation lies in the maximum dV any given rocket stage can achieve with a specific engine (more precisely, with that engine\u0027s Isp). Because even if you add the entire observable universe\u0027s mass in terms of fuel to a rocket that somehow weighs zero kg despite having an engine and other stuff, you could still not exceed the mass ratio of the tanks you are using. Therefore there\u0027s a hard limit of dV you can never exceed with any given engine, and it depends entirely on the tank\u0027s mass ratio - and the way it curves towards that limit with increasingly diminishing returns depends on it, too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy It Should Be Addressed:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn real life, the mass ratio of a fuel tank depends on a great many factors, including the physical properties of the propellant itself. So you could argument that it is realistic that different fuels have tanks with different mass ratios. However, for xenon specifically, real life tanks are not anywhere near that low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition to that, as mentioned above, Squad made the conscious decision to remove all tankage mass ratio differences from the game (except xenon, which as it would appear was forgotten). And there\u0027s good reasons for doing this, reasons I\u0027ve experienced myself multiple times while helping out with the mod Near Future Technologies. One pack in this suite of mods introduces new engines, which run on several different new fuels. I\u0027m doing the balancing of those engines, and over time, I\u0027ve tried various different approaches. Among them were approaches that had all the fuels at different tankage mass ratios. Although this offered increased freedom in assigning stats and part niches, it also made everything a whole lot more complicated to manage and balance properly. But that\u0027s not the main reason it was a bad idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, the main reason is that none of the players noticed it. None whatsoever. Not a single person who hadn\u0027t followed the dev thread discussion ever admitted to being aware of these differences. And, I mean, why would they? Fuel tanks are just fuel tanks. When you build literally any other spacecraft in KSP, you plop down the payload, you plop down a number of fuel tanks, and \u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E you sit down and start comparing engines for thrust and Isp. Engines, not tanks. So the only thing those players noticed was: some engines just had better stats than others, no matter how you turned it. And these players then came to the mod thread and complained that their favorite engine was underpowered, or that another one was really broken, and that our balancing was super bad. All in all, mucking with tank mass ratios turned out to be unnecessary complexity that didn\u0027t add any depth, only confusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad, I wager, knows this full well, for they have a forum full of active users who love to discuss engine balance while equipped with many different variants of half the data. And with the introduction of such things as the monoprop engine, and the move of the LV-N to be liquid fuel only, KSP moved rapidly towards a situation where engines could not be directly compared to each other anymore. So they made LF/Ox, LF-solo and Monoprop tanks all have the same mass ratios. Voila, engines could now be compared again!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExcept, you know, the often-forgotten Dawn ion engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat The Actual Effects Are:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Dawn has so wildly different stats from all other engines, both in thrust and Isp, that comparing it to other engines is fairly straightforward on the surface: the dV you get is simply just \u0022higher\u0022, and the thrust you get is simply just \u0022lower\u0022. It clearly gives the Dawn its niche. However, if you sat down and compared the actual stats, you\u0027d quickly discover that this engine doesn\u0027t perform the way you think it does. Namely, it always \u003Cem\u003Esignificantly\u003C/em\u003E underperforms compared to what your on-paper math says it should do. And the more fuel you add, the worse it gets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo illustrate, I\u0027ve done some math on a vessel that is comprised of 10 tons of dry mass, including a Dawn engine. I\u0027ve added enough fuel to hit several different propellant fraction targets (percentage of vessel mass that is fuel). At each of those targets, I determined how much more dV and TWR the vessel would get if its tank mass ratio was 9:1 instead of 2.2727:1... and then converted that into how much less \u0022effective Isp\u0022 and \u0022effective thrust\u0022 the Dawn gets compared to a hypothetical LF/Ox engine with the same stats. I also calculated the difference in total mass between the vessel with the LF/Ox tanks and the vessel with the xenon tanks. Spacecraft mass is important when designing your lifter, after all... and that difference is the extra mass you have to lift just because you\u0027re using xenon (in addition to being responsible for the drop in effective thrust).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ctable border=\u00221\u0022 cellpadding=\u00221\u0022 cellspacing=\u00221\u0022 style=\u0022width:600px;\u0022\u003E\u003Ctbody\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\nBase Stats\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n4200 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n2.00 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\nn/a\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPropellant Fraction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEffective Isp\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEffective Thrust\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVessel Mass Difference\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n15%\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n3739 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.80 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.38 tons\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n20%\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n3564 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.73 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n2.09 tons\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n25%\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n3378 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.66 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n3.04 tons\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n30%\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n3175 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.59 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n4.36 tons\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n35%\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n2952 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.53 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n6.29 tons\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n40%\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n2703 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.46 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n9.44 tons\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n45%\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n2417 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.39 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n15.45 tons\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd\u003E\n50%\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n2072 s\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n1.33 kN\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003Ctd\u003E\n31.50 tons\n\u003C/td\u003E\n\u003C/tr\u003E\u003C/tbody\u003E\u003C/table\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, the Dawn effectively drops to barely half the performance a player would infer from looking at its stats alone by the time the propellant fraction hits 50%. This is not the Dawn engine\u0027s fault. It\u0027s the xenon tank\u0027s fault.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat I Propose:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimply put, adjust the dry masses of the xenon tanks to fall in line with all the other fuel tanks in KSP. I\u0027ve even gone ahead and calculated the numbers - you just need to put them into the configs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- PB-X50R: 0.03143 becomes 0.005\u003Cbr\u003E\n- PB-X150: 0.055 becomes 0.00875\u003Cbr\u003E\n- PB-X750: 0.4125 becomes 0.065625\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, doing this obviously results in a massive buff to the Dawn engine. But consider the following: because of the poor xenon tanks currently in the game, the Dawn engine needs to have artificially inflated stats (in both thrust and Isp) in order to deliver the performance that it is designed to have in typical usage scenarios. As such, there should be no problem with adjusting those stats down once the tanks are no longer killing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince the Dawn engine is a direct nod to the NSTAR ion thrusters on NASA\u0027s Dawn spacecraft, currently in orbit of Ceres, why not take the Isp directly from that? Instead of 4200s, it would now have 3120s. Looking at the table above, that falls pretty much straight in the middle of what you effectively get right now anyway, on average... a perfect fit. The thrust could be set at 1.5 kN, a nice round number that\u0027s also reasonably near the average effective performance today. 1.6 kN would also be valid, but from my gut, I\u0027d choose the lower value. Xenon-fueled spacecraft are already getting another stealth buff in requiring less lifting power to put them into orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIn Closing:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom my amateur viewpoint, I consider this change to be simple, straightforward and requiring only little testing - it doesn\u0027t affect many game systems, and the required changes are so few and simple, a ModuleManager script could do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love to hear everyone\u0027s thoughts and comments on it! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-08T11:02:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2016 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ETypos, typos everywhere!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T19:03:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do wonder if 9:1 is too high as if someone was to make an ion ship that is 80% zenon the dv might be too disproportionate\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmognome","CreatedById":153969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-08T20:05:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm, if I don\u0027t read the technical manuals from orbital ATK wrong, their fuel tanks have ratios of ~4.4:1 (fuel to dry mass).

And here it practically boils down to gameplay versus realism. As I already described in my opening post, yes, it is entirely realistic for some fuels to have different tank mass ratios than other fuels. It\u0027s just, as my personal experience with modmaking has repeatedly shown, an incredibly unintuitive concept to the average KSP player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat personal experience has led me to believe that it would make KSP a better game if it abandoned this disparity for the same of consistent gameplay. From your response, on the other hand, it would appear that you value the perceived depth of gameplay provided by this disparity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem with depth and complexity however is that they\u0027re by no means the same thing, yet can easily be confused for one another... \u003Cem\u003Eespecially\u003C/em\u003E by game designers. Extra Credits has a great double-episode feature on the topic, if you\u0027re interested. The TL;DR of it all is that it\u0027s easy to make games complex, but hard to extract depth from complexity. The best games are those that strive to minimize complexity while maximizing depth. If a game designer makes the decision to implement a layer of complexity, he or she should do it only because said complexity allows the game to extract a large amount of depth from it. In other words, if there\u0027s wide-reaching advantages that allow the game to better engage the player at every turn. A good example would be having orbital mechanics in KSP. As you may know, Harvester originally was doubtful whether he should do it at all, because it is an incredibly complex topic that players generally know nothing about beforehand, and which games consistently avoid like the plague. But KSP manages to take this layer of complexity and turn it into a depth of gameplay that has already lifted it into the annals of gaming. You could easily make the argument that orbital mechanics is the very thing that makes KSP what it is, and people would find it difficult to argue against it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, having this mass ratio disparity for xenon tanks in KSP does not fall under that header. For starters, the vast majority of the playerbase is completely oblivious to it, which is a clear sign that it doesn\u0027t serve any tangible purpose. Then, the secondary effects - the requirement to fudge the Dawn\u0027s stats to make it perform the way it should compared to other engines. The elemination of a clear advantage of IRL electric propulsion (mass savings in payloads). The difficulty in implementing other uses of xenon through modding in a balanced, attractice fashion. I could go on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrue, it\u0027s ultimately a minor issue, as I\u0027ve acknowledged further up in this post. But it\u0027s also a very minor fix. If implementing this would require actual coding work, I wouldn\u0027t even dream of bringing it up, \u0027cause there are many other things which can use that development time way more. But this just... feels like such a low-hanging fruit, you know? A tiny tweak that, in my opinion, makes KSP a more consistent, more polished experience that functions more the way that players expect it to function. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-09T16:19:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2016 04:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-09T16:54:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222504568\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022136391\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221460214149\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the way to fix that problem is to make physics warp more robust.\u00A0 It currently tops out at 4\u00D7.\u00A0 Here\u0027s my suggestion:\u00A0 Add 8\u00D7, 16\u00D7, and 32\u00D7 modes on top of that, then do some game tweaking to prevent ships from destroying themselves under those conditions.\u00A0 If I were coding it, here\u0027s what I would do.\u00A0 First, you can\u0027t engage a physics warp \u0026gt;4 unless your TWR is below a certain limit.\u00A0 If you\u0027re over the limit, the warp arrow is grayed out, and trying to engage it will just get you a little message \u0022Cannot exceed X physics warp with current engines\u0022 or some such.\u00A0 Second, I would cause all reaction wheels to scale down their torque whenever the physics warp is \u0026gt;4\u00D7.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s a good idea, although with current hardware (but why no build for the future?) of limited benefit, as it\u0027d be likely that at higher physics warp the Physics Delta Time/Frame is hit.

My guess is that the 9:1 mass ratio of the Dawn Xenon storage can only be achieved if the Xenon is in a liquid state, which would mean storage would require continous cooling. If not, do you know any document proving the 9:1 mass ratio was for compressed Xenon Tank?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-01T14:51:26Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2016 02:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-01T15:05:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...Did you read \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E part of the opening post at all, beyond the title? :s This is not, and never was at any point, about improving realism.

So you could argument that it is realistic that different fuels have tanks with different mass ratios. However, for xenon specifically, real life tanks are not anywhere near that low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalright , your main goal is not realism, but simplicity. But I think this is flauwed Idea because hidden facts like lower mass fraction for different fuels/propellants are what makes KSP intresting and educational. I say let players come to the realisation their vessel isn\u0027t as effective as they though it was (which I did btw), that will teach them that High Isp isn\u0027t everything, just like the countless times they failed launching their rocket.
