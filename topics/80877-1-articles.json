Does this mean we may eventually see more official planets from Squad? I know there was talk of at least one more gas giant a long long time ago (Eeloo was supposed to be one of the moons) however my theory is that Squad never really went down that path yet because maybe the memory footprint was getting too big to comfortably fit in 32-bit address space (I say this because the extra planets mods take up a ton of extra memory, causing compatibility problems with other mods because there is not enough memory to fit both).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the memory issue removed due to 64-bit, will Squad eventually add in a set of outer kerbol system planets for us to visit and not crash everyone\u0027s install? Personally I would really love to see 2-4 new planets well beyond the orbit of Jool, maybe a couple of eccentrics like comets with highly inclined/elliptical orbits as well. Something about twice as far and 4x as far away, maybe even more. The outer planets of our solar system are a LONG ways out, each one way further than the one before it. Saturn (~10AU) is twice as far from the sun as Jupiter (~5AU), Uranus is twice again as far as Saturn (~20AU) and Neptune is almost twice again Uranus\u0027 distance (~30AU).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wish there were some further targets to reach for. Using gravity assists, really even reaching targets well beyond Jool\u0027s orbit would not be that difficult since if you can get to Jool, you can basically get to kerbol escape velocity using Jool as a boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERuahrc\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-06T01:41:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/06/2014 01:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Ruahrc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mesons","CreatedById":76697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T01:44:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36863-What-not-to-suggest\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENew celestial bodies appears in the what-not-to-suggest list, and as Red Iron Crown so kindly transcribed from the Maxmaps AMA on Reddit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EImproving current planets more important than new planets:\u003Cp\u003E\u0022More planets are a big maybe right now.
