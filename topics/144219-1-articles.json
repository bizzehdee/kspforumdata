The station side will have a docking port, but because of the windows, there\u0027s no place to put a docking port on the opposite end. Up until now I\u0027ve always included a docking port on my modules and have a tug that can docks with it, pushes it into place and then undocks but in this case it won\u0027t work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m looking for other ways to move my module around and get it docked accurately and open for ideas.
