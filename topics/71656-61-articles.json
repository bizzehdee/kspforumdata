DMP constantly compensates this by physwarping in the 0.3x to 1.5x range, along with slowing down what \u00221x\u0022 warp is when there are laggy players in your subspace. The next is that vessels are fast forwarded onto your timeline, so if you are slighly in the future (lets say 2 seconds), you will see where they will be in 2 seconds time - this is just your normal lag compensation, although you can get into situations where you will see what they would see before it has happened if you are significantly in the future.

Only if everybody stops doing anything while you fly, you can do a normal reentry and get to fire your parachutes at approx. 2000 meters height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSame problems if you try to dock anything or try to land on the Mun for example. If another player clicks on anything or starts another vehicle while you try to control your stuff, you have no chance to survive. The lander / rocket begins to spin like crazy, as if SAS had lost it\u0027s effect. I believe this is caused by lag created by too many server messages. Seems like the server can\u0027t handle more than the updates of a single player at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally sad, I hoped this would be a solution, as Squad seems to have given up their multiplayer plans, but I guess it\u0027s time to put KSP to the shelf \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
