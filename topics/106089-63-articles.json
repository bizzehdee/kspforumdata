Liquid hydrogen engines provide relatively lower thrust compared to denser fuels like kerolox/hypergolics and much better efficiency. You must learn to make use of their characteristics. For boosters the best choice is to use cryogenic engines on a core first stage large enough it is **not** able to lift itself and then use Solid or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E liquid boosters to add lift off thrust to get it to a point where it can carry the rest of itself to orbit. This is how most liquid hydrogen first stages work IRL as well. They are very effective when used this way.\n\nIMO they are very well balanced for 2.5x. Most mods correctly balanced for stock scale are overpowered for stock (because stock balance is an overpowered balance to make the game easier), and correct at 2.5x and this is the case for CryoEngines.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-06-01T16:10:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2021 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Zorg**"},{"CreatedByName":"rocketman525","CreatedById":211801,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-02T20:54:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/30/2021 at 7:11 PM, rocketman525 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I did, and it still does not work.\n\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceman.Spiff","CreatedById":209133,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-02T21:08:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 12 minutes ago, rocketman525 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nMaybe reinstall?"},{"CreatedByName":"rocketman525","CreatedById":211801,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-06-02T21:38:31Z","Content":"I think I alredey terid that."}]}
