Actually, thrust becomes abysmal long before that. That forces you to fly a relatively steep suborbital trajectory, where you have a lot of either gravity drag or actual aerodynamic drag. The true top speed, where thrust equals drag, is probably no more than 800m/s even for the tiniest vessel. That would require considerable use of massless parts and intake spam. I don\u0027t say it\u0027s impossible to leave the atmosphere on basic jets, but I expect that it would take a lot of fine-tuning of your parts and flight profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Redshift OTF\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Redshift OTF\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGetting a Kerbin escape with any kind of jets would be hard I think.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting to (say) 90x68km isn\u0027t very difficult (on turbojets, that is).
