The only place this was even remotely possible to achieve was Gilly, as orbital speed is low enough that a prograde/retrograde flyby is slow enough to be able to record it (as opposed to just one or two frames anyplace else).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTook a whole bunch of attempts (getting something in that exact a retrograde orbit is... exasperating), but finally managed to make one actually pass through the cargo bays, which was plain to see as the lights on the probe illuminated the inside of the bays in passing.
