The parts change their orientation just by clicking any of the arrows to try to move the engine stack. This stops any way to place them as you can\u0027t get them back to where the middle engine was originally placed. The other side did not have this problem. It also possibly causes problems with fuel flow if not reversed. How do you get past this? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe mammoth on the other side is the same as the offset one except they are offset on top of each other. It is 5 engines not 1 and it worked. Also the fuel flow is still symmetrical in this setup. I\u0027ve been having problems with it changing but still can\u0027t figure out what causes it. It will start taking from a different tank or only one side or some other odd configuration. I\u0027m trying to get it not to do this and take from the tanks symmetrically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m activating the offset on the middle hub that the middle mammoth is attached too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-10-13%2009-44-14_zpspvozhmls.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-10-13%2009-44-14_zpspvozhmls.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-10-13%2009-44-23_zpsbcaqpbon.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-10-13%2009-44-23_zpsbcaqpbon.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-10-13%2009-44-28_zpsqmysjzri.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-10-13%2009-44-28_zpsqmysjzri.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did not move the parts.
