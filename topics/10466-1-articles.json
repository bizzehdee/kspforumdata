If your engines have power to spare at this point, and your prop pitch is as aggressive as you can make it, then the only option at that point is more blades.\n\nBut trust me, those little electric motors don\\\u0027t have that problem. If you glue more blades on, it\\\u0027s going to spend more energy swinging plastic than moving air, and it\\\u0027s going to spin slower. Electric engines produce more torque at lower RPM\\\u0027s, but more power at higher RPM\\\u0027s. So with more mass, more drag, and less power going to the props with 4 blades than 2, do you really think the 4 bladed prop will see any advantage? Probably not. I would also skip the landing gear for the same reason, weight and drag. Every gram makes a difference on these little planes."},{"CreatedByName":"mincespy","CreatedById":9003,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T07:18:05Z","Content":"I beat y\\\u0027all, I\\\u0027m building THIS!\n\n[http://www.rcmf.co.uk/4um/index.php?topic=50323.0](http://www.rcmf.co.uk/4um/index.php?topic=50323.0)\n\nIt\\\u0027s not a UAV, but it\\\u0027s bigger than what any of you have ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"sss","CreatedById":24050,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T09:16:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I beat y\\\u0027all, I\\\u0027m building THIS!\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.rcmf.co.uk/4um/index.php?topic=50323.0](http://www.rcmf.co.uk/4um/index.php?topic=50323.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E It\\\u0027s not a UAV, but it\\\u0027s bigger than what any of you have ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\ndosent look as big as my titan. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nUgh, its one of those nights when i cant get to sleep."},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T10:40:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I beat y\\\u0027all, I\\\u0027m building THIS!\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://www.rcmf.co.uk/4um/index.php?topic=50323.0](http://www.rcmf.co.uk/4um/index.php?topic=50323.0)\n\u003E \n\u003E It\\\u0027s not a UAV, but it\\\u0027s bigger than what any of you have ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nWhat do you mean \\\u0027not a UAV\\\u0027?
