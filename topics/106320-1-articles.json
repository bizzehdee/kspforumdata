Wrapping the entire bit with the probe in a fairing fixes it, and incidentally makes the rocket more aerodynamic. In my case I had an okto on top of a capsule basically for doing rescue missions and such. After about the 5th or sixth time something exploded I decided to have a look at the debug info; what happens in that scenario is the capsule builds up a lot of heat during the earlier part of the ascent (even if there\u0027s no reentry effects) - so much so that the capsule\u0027s temperature exceeds the probe\u0027s maximum, but not its own, and then the capsule transfers heat to the probe via conduction.

I think probe cores don\u0027t like heat very well, and there can be a lot of shock heating even without seeing the flames.
