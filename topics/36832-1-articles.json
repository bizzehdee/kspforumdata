My neighbor Jerry likes to call it a \u0022star party\u0022. Its basically where a bunch of guys get together and look at the stars. Jerry is a major player in this one place that hosts these things, he helps rent out telescopes, and helps with the star parties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so I signed up for that and all, and this morning, my mom ran the paper over to Jerry.

I guess it makes sense, you can\u0027t go your whole life without looking up at the stars, and some do it more than once. So even so, that doesn\u0027t explain why everybody struggles through watching one five minute video about Jupiter or something. I had a class in middle school once, and when I was going into it, everyone told me: Man, that class is boring as hell! I went into it, and it was great! It was just a ton of videos about space and stars. And all these crazy theories that I found interesting. We started some project about the solar system, and BAM I went through all the stations knowing more than anyone there.

From the research I have seen, a child\u0027s love of television can come from many things, including the ability to accurately make predictions (Even if what they are doing is post-diction), be part of a social group, or being able to teach somebody else something. The first one normally applies to young children, but the second and third often applies all the way to adulthood.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn computers, I feel that the more into a computer a child is, the better it is. Children who play games on computers will likely make strong social connections that may last a long time, and many children who get into computers will often want to know how to make something for whatever they do on a computer. The idea that computers are only bad for a child are wrong, and there has never been anybody to prove this. There have been, however, people that proved gaming and working on computers can improve certain technical and social skills.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my experience, children are overzealous about things outside of the house, assuming you mean current events and going outside. All of the children I know love to go outside given the right temperatures. I, personally, prefer time outside when it is cold, or is raining. As to current events, children will often take sides and defend their positions. They are erred in most cases, as they aren\u0027t likely to be taught proper research until they get of college age, and they often take the sides of their family, but they do take part.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nikolai","CreatedById":23085,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T12:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022MalletFace\u0022 data-cite=\u0022MalletFace\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EChildren are naturally curious, and learning is actually fun\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed.
