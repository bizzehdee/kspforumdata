Well as usual with kids about I got distracted and forgot to put on an antenna on. So began the numerous launches of rovers and items to get something to connect to the Radial Attachment Point. No luck with attaching anything yet so my question is does anything attach to this on the surface of planets? If not what\u0027s if for? \n\n[http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/BZ-52_Radial_Attachment_Point](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/BZ-52_Radial_Attachment_Point)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T17:09:24Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 05:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rollo1002**"},{"CreatedByName":"RapidUnplannedDissasembly","CreatedById":105769,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T15:34:44Z","Content":"Oh yeah, this part doesn\u0027t act like a docking port, I can see where you\u0027re confusion arises- the part is just for making a neat radial in the VAB or SPH connection onto 1.25 meter parts. It is massless and dragless, despite what it\u0027s part description says- its just a nicer looking alternative to a cubic octagonal strut. If you want to attach crafts together, you should use docking ports.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T15:37:15Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RapidUnplannedDissasembly**"},{"CreatedByName":"rollo1002","CreatedById":145192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T15:38:32Z","Content":"That\u0027s what I was afraid of.

I use it and I\u0027ve done this kind of work in 1.0.x my own self recently (in my case I used it to remove a Clamp-O-Tron Jr. and replace it with a full sized Clamp-O-Tron on an orbiting space station). OP, you should check out those mods if you want to save your mission - just send up Bill or whatever engineer you\u0027ve got available with the antenna part you want to attach, have him attach it, profit.\n\nBZ-52s were some of my favorite parts from the olden days - they were useful for building clusters of powerful engines (better than Mainsails) in the days before the Mk3 parts showed up, and they\u0027re still useful for that same purpose today (I built myself a craft just last night had an engine cluster in the core - career game without Mk3 rocket parts unlocked yet).\n\nObserve their usefulness (this album is OLD - back when nukes still required oxidizer - but it still demonstrates the point methinks):\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

BZ-52s also have a higher price point. Me, I always thought they looked cleaner. Plus in the olden days the Cubic Octagonals were at the far end of the tech tree, so you got BZ-52s first.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T16:01:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 04:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101**"},{"CreatedByName":"rollo1002","CreatedById":145192,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:05:07Z","Content":"Thanks everyone for the help to a solution.
