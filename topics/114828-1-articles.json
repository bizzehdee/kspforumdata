Having downloaded and looked over RO-10.0.0 it appears that I\u0027ll need at least make, python, and a C# compiler to build it. For this and other mods, what would be the best way to go? I\u0027ve seen some mention of IDEs, but is an IDE absolutely necessary? I\u0027m an old-schooler and am most comfortable using a CLI and make, but I\u0027ll learn how to use an IDE if necessary. I take it that I would still be installing build-essentials? Would an IDE include a C# compiler? If not, which would be recommended?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESide note: I\u0027m rather disappointed that KSP and its mods are written in C#, but it is what it is, I suppose.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bolche","CreatedById":132002,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T02:46:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can use the monodevelop to develop in C# on Ubuntu.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you want to only use the mods, you don\u0027t need to compile anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend using CKAN.
