Before I understood the vagaries of the contract system I took contracts I didn\u0027t have the skill or the tech to handle, or failed to read the fine print on height and speed of a parts test, or a 3-tourist contract but they all wanted to go different places. (Usually places I hadn\u0027t learned to go.) So I ended up with all contracts I couldn\u0027t do and no room for new ones that I could. I abandoned that career. But I learned to read the fine print.

Look at the contracts in Mission Control -- they will tell you \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E how much money a \u0022failure\u0022 will cost you. The reputation penalty is going to be huge. You obviously have a very high rep, being out at Jool -- and the rep penalty (which will look small on the contracts) gets multiplied many times over. I doubt it\u0027ll take you much below 250 on your rep, though.
