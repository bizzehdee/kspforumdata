If you want to implement things like automated ascend / landing guidance, autopilots etc. on an Arduino and you\u0027re indeed new to microcontrollers, one word of advise:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck the kOS plugin for KSP and implement your modules there first. Once they work, port them over to the Arduino and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy? Well a few reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Writing code for microcontrollers isn\u0027t the easiest type of software development since you\u0027re dealing with very basic (to say the least) debugging possibilities and the messiness of unclean electronic signals in addition to your software.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- kOS is a simple enough language and is editable in any text editor (Notepad\u002B\u002B is a good basic choice) while KSP is running. You have infinite chances to change your code while KSP runs, can simply revert to launch / quickload to try again. Changing the code on the microcontroller is more complicated (among other things you\u0027ll end up replugging the USB cable a LOT). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- kOS has an in-game console which is great for debugging. Since KSP and the Arduino use the serial connection to exchange data, the serial terminal console (Arduino \u0022debugging console\u0022) is not available so you\u0027d either have to attach an LCD display to the Arduino for debugging or resort to blinking LEDs or the like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E[edit to add]\u003C/strong\u003E- like Zitronen said, you\u0027ll very likely need PID controllers. While easy to write (documentation on the interwebs is good) it\u0027s very painful to tune (trial and error unless you\u0027re \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E good with math) - kOS makes it easier simply because you can iterate over your tuning parameters faster.[/edit]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI write software for a living and I consider myself reasonably good at it. It took me several long days to come up with a decent ascend guidance / automatic lander code in kOS. I wouldn\u0027t want to go through those pains on an Arduino without having many options to get a clue what goes wrong where and why.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll that said, I wish you luck \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-29T09:31:30Z\u0022 title=\u002210/29/2014 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MrOnak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
