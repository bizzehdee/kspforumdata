Specifically I decided to try and evoke its apperance post-rebuild. However I didn\u0027t really fuss over scale that much, just hitting the rough proportions, and because of that I decided to name this as its own distinct design rather than passing it off as an actual recreation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: I\u0027m putting screenshots from throughout the craft\u0027s development so some bits may be missing or present in some screenshots, and I didn\u0027t notice and fix the gap in the tailplane until I shot the stunts video.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDesign \u0026amp; Jank:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pXGYb7v.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pXGYb7v.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main fuselage has a lot of bouyant empty tanks, a cockpit and room for a passenger up front, I also took care to replicate the sand-coloured underbelly as best I could, as well as the italian flag on the tailplane. In the place of the ram air turbine (little emergency generator windmill) to the side of the cockpit is a dimmed spotlight in the same yellow colour, and I included a radio antenna in the place of the pilot\u0027s optical sights. Sadly, there are no machine guns in the game yet to aim at stuff so that\u0027s the best you get right now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wings and engine are mounted on decouplers (which unfortunately can\u0027t be removed from staging at the moment. I\u0027ll be honest the wings are a lot bigger than would be accurate but do mantain both the swept shape and large wingtip elevons. The pontoons continue the sand-coloured underbelly look though for these I swapped around the colours as the radial attachment point on the empty methane tanks is in the secondary colour. The engine block is quite loose. It\u0027s supposed to have the underside intake that I used the inline intake to represent, but on the original design this intake hangs down in front of the wing. Ah well, it still looks decent. Of course there\u0027s no propeller engines in KSP2 so a J-33 and a somewhat propellery looking front intake will have to suffice for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022H8Abmd6.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/H8Abmd6.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile it was quite nice replicating the design in spirt, from a practicality standpoint KSP\u0027s limited selection of what aircraft physics it simulates and the fact that I can\u0027t actually make anything more lighter than it is empty, posed significant problems when it came to getting that overslung engine to not just nosedive the plane to the bottom of the sea. It did force me to do a lot of tweaking of the engine\u0027s angle reletive to the craft and its thrust limit and, well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pXGYb7v.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pXGYb7v.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... normally, having the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECOL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in front like that would cause the plane to just keep on flipping over backwards, but... the top-mounted engine is already keen on making it flip over forwards, so... combining the two together ends up basically spitting out an almost normal controlling plane.

Probably a combination of the difference in drag between water and ground and the wings not going fast enough to generate enough pitch torque to offset the engine\u0027s contributions. I find that with the engine on 55% thrust the craft is capable of reaching takeoff speed without faceplanting into the sea, so for ease of use I just put a thrust limit on the engine that makes full throttle that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qRYaRbk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/qRYaRbk.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe S.21 from Porco Rosso is described as being \u0022difficult to take off but incredible during the air\u0022, and while the S22 does have a similar weak spot when it comes to taking off, the amount of space it needs to take off isn\u0027t all that bad. During testing I landed it on and took off from the lake to the north of Launchpad 1, and the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E canal system, which it just about barely has the space the S22 needs to land in and take off with if you choose your stretch carefully.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some control quirks to take-off. You need to be pitching up from the moment you light the engine to prevent a nosedive into the water, and due to a slightly annoying glitch regarding the placement of the centre of mass in the angled tailplane being flat broken in positioning, the plane likes to turn slightly to the right at all times, so you have to correct that in order to get up to takeoff speeds. Hopefully in future versions of the game, this incorrect mass position is fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EsNRRlD.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EsNRRlD.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding is also a bit finnicky. The S22 stalls very easy if you cut the engine, so the best thing to do is to fly down to within a couple meters of the water and slowly reduce speed until it drops. You can also stall it from a similar height and land in the water without any damage, she\u0027s a pretty sturdy gal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EY481hz.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/EY481hz.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, the S22 much like its inspiration does not have wheels so make sure you launch it from the boat launch instead of the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlight Performance \u0026amp; Video:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022cu9NJXy.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/cu9NJXy.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe S22 hits a really nice balance of being responsive/manouvreable, and being stable, most of the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause of its weirdly placed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, there\u0027s a degree of roll, where if you pass it then it does all of the pitching you need for a banking turn on its own. It can pull up from stalls incredibly quickly too, which is handy because it glides like garbage. It has difficulty mantaining speed when in a steep climb, but quickly picks it up again if you level out, and indeed the best way to build up speed is to angle a bit below the horizon to get the engine horizonal and let the speed and lift do the work to keep it level.\u00A0 Most importantly the wingspan is comfortably small enough to fit between the two car parks either side of the space centre\u0027s first two bridges. With a little bit of practice you can slip under them easily.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the stability side of things, if you take your hands off the controls it mantains speed and slowly climbs. Because of the offset mass tailplane bug aforementioned it also gently turns to the right. Again, hopefully with the next update that\u0027ll be fixed but it doesn\u0027t have that much of an effect (less than 2% trim worth of torque) unless you\u0027re going long distance. And as I mentioned above, this stability is there even without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E too.

It can do various rolls, though if you want to get anything resembling an aileron roll out of it instead of a stand-up guyised barrel roll, you need to pump the engine limiter up to 100%. It can do a Split S, but it\u0027s not too great at roll-off-the-top turns, however it\u0027s really in its element with stall turns, those are a lot of fun to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get used to the feel of it, you can really put on a decent airshow for the kerbals at the space centre.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as pushing for performance goes, at standard 55% limited engine power the S22 can mantain 70m/s in level flight, providing you give it 44-60% pitch down trim (I use trim controller for this, and add trim progressively in blocks of ~10%) to hold the angled engine in line with the prograde marker. When it comes to how high you can fly it... it doesn\u0027t climb all that fast so I didn\u0027t stick around to work out what height it would stall at, but it seemed to start losing speed in level flight at around 5000m up and steadily lose it above that, so I suspect it\u0027d stall at some point between 6000m and 10000m up. Not that you\u0027d want to spend time going that high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DdGjQMC.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DdGjQMC.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, as far as performance goes, taking it off and getting it up to about 2000m-3000m, it hits a peak burn time of 1 hour and 20 minutes. At 70m/s that\u0027s ~336km, probably comfortably 330km if you want to leave a large safety margin for a powered landing, which I would recommend. This\u0027d get you about 1/3 of the way to one of the poles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs noted I mostly keep the S22 with a 55% engine limiter to make take-offs possible. It\u0027s more that possible to fly it with 100% engine power, which raises the cruising speed from ~70m/s to ~120m/s and makes a lot of the more finnicky aerial manouveres that benefit from inertia a bit easier, but otherwise handles pretty much the same way. Being on low fuel doesn\u0027t effect the handling much either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClosing thoughts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m rather pleased with what I achieved with the S22, not just as a visual homage to the S.21, but also a plane that, jet engine aside, feels like it really captures the spirit of that sort of plane too. Its speed and handling feels about right, I really like the detail work I was able to add, and I think most poigniantly the fact that getting it to fly pulled from my knowledge of aerodynamics, or at least the game\u0027s aerodynamic model, felt appropriately pioneering. It\u0027s also just fun. I\u0027m gonna definitely keep this one around for when multiplayer drops.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Ov5QP8n.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Ov5QP8n.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDownload Link: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/file/d/16hA3IO-08gPiphQQojxPGyBUitV9NxF-/view?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16hA3IO-08gPiphQQojxPGyBUitV9NxF-/view?usp=sharing\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-22T19:07:34Z\u0022 title=\u002204/22/2024 07:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 22\u0022\u003EApril 22\u003C/time\u003E by mattihase\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Urus28","CreatedById":182121,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-23T17:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAwesome design ! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
