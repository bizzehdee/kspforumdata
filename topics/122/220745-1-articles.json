Yeah. Those bits aren\u0027t on the reusable spaceplane bit, and it\u0027s a real hassle to go out and recover those seperately.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Sideline Shuttle (with Big Orbital Tank) concept attempts to remedy that one singular sole problem with the Space Shuttle, by simply placing two Sideline Shuttles either side of the disposable tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ZFkUeaR.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ZFkUeaR.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see, twice as many main engines can be recovered now, 6 in total, and we\u0027ve gotten rid of those silly booster things too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was a pretty fun craft idea to explore, and I ended up creating two variants of the Sideline, one with a small passenger tube (in the first screenshot) and one with a Mk2 cargo bay capable of ferrying around small satellites or station components (in the second screenshot), both coming in at about 22 tons by the time they seperate from the main tank and make it into orbit. The Sidelines can make a powered landing, though ironically, given the whole reason I designed them, I\u0027ve yet to have any of them return from orbit without spinning out and damaging their precious engines during the inevitable crash, but hopefully I\u0027ll be able to work that out eventually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was planning on working on a bigger 4 engine per shuttle variant shortly before posting but then the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E ended up freaking out and creating a part singularity so I\u0027ve decided to call a day of it for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pbdzeXF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/pbdzeXF.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-10T02:24:01Z\u0022 title=\u002211/10/2023 02:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 10\u0022\u003ENovember 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by mattihase\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
