With that, all the Kerbals that go on the mission *might* return home using their lander and leaving the small single-seat rover behind. Not so with this one...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s an example of a large(r) rover built on the TR-3 \u0022Bulldog\u0022 frame with 3x RTC \u0022Rottweiler\u0022 truck chassis and 6x RoveMax TR-2L wheels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WnHFO6C.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022694\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WnHFO6C.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI attached a Kelus small ladder under each of the airlock doors on the Bulldog to facilitate climbing in and out.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI don\u0027t trust rover pods as flight controllers for anything other than ground operations as their coordinate frames are optimized for that, so right behind the Bulldog rover cabin there\u0027s a Mk2-DC drone core oriented so that it can control the vehicle properly anytime you\u0027re in \u0022rocket\u0022 mode vs. \u0022rover\u0022 mode. To that end I use action groups to force the \u0022Control from Here\u0022 setting for these two \u0022pods\u0022Aft of the Mk2-DC there is a Mk2 RFT-400 followed by an RF-AD 400 to carry the fuel needed for descent and landing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAft of the RF-AD 400 I placed a small reaction wheel to augment the torque in the Bulldog command module.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI mounted a\u00A0Rottweiler truck chassis with two RoveMax TR-2L wheels under each of the Bulldog, Mk2 RTF-400, and RF-AD 400. To get the Rottweilers to attach nicely I used BZ-52 Radial Attachment Points.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI attached three SM radial decouplers with an LT-2 \u0022Wombat\u0022 leg on each.\u00A0 Shift these down a bit so they legs don\u0027t get hung up on the Rottweiler truck chassis. Also, be careful with which stage the radial decouplers fall in - I put them at the top. Adjust their decouple force to be 0kN for the one that faces the ground when the rover is in \u0022rover\u0022 mode, and 5 kN for the other two.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAft of the SWR there\u0027s a size small engine plate with an LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022. This will provide more than enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for descent and landing and is reasonably economical in mass and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E. Adjust the interstage node of the engine mount to be just after the Terrier nozzle.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nComplete the rover part with two SP-XL \u0022Gigantors\u0022, a Communotron DTS-M1, and a plethora of lights. In particular, two forward facing spot beams for headlights, two aft facing\u00A0 wide beams for when you\u0027re backing up, some strip lights for on the sides and underneath, and some ordinary light bulbs for on top in strategic locations.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBelow the Terrier is a small decoupler, followed by RS-AD 800 Small to Medium fuel tank, an MRW-250 reaction wheel kit, an X200-16 tank, and an REI5 \u0022Skipper\u0022 to handle the transfer, capture, circularization, and at least the first part of the deorbit burn. Basically, a simple transfer stage with some added control authority to aid in pointing.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft files can be found \u003Ca href=\u0022https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QlGCExQk0i7Hmi01SAbolKQQiyttOMzk?usp=sharing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA note about fuel capacity: In my test of the system flown I left a 100 km circular Kirbin orbit using only the transfer stage and flying to the Mun. I wasted some gas fine tuning my PE at the Mun which would have been cheaper to do if I\u0027d done it before getting to the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. I then circularized at about a 50km orbit and descended from there. My piloting skills, and particularly my landing skills, may leave something to be desired and I probably waisted some gas on the way down as well. Consequently I ran out of gas at about 600m AGL while traveling around 20 m/s. I needed to switch on the infinite propellant cheat to get down. Flown properly, or if you\u0027re headed to Minmus, I\u0027m confident any reasonably skilled pilot can safely land this beast. I typically build my LV stages so that they can handle at least some of the transfer \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E too. If I\u0027d done it right, I wouldn\u0027t have needed nearly as much of my transfer stage getting to or circularizing at the Mun, and so more of it could have been used and then ditched on the descent. Nevertheless, be forewarned! If you waste a lot of gas you may get into trouble on the way down to the Mun, but there\u0027s really no reason to. If you\u0027re headed to Minmus then things will be even easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the rover after the deorbit burn with the transfer stage gone and the landing legs deployed\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022gfZa0Gk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022694\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/gfZa0Gk.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere she is getting closer to the surface.
