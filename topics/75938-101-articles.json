If you have craft out in the universe with stock wheels, they\u0027ll still flip when you try to maneuver them in strange ways. I use a MM patch to replace the stock wheel setup and add the stack nodes. Granted, the stack nodes won\u0027t work in every situation, such as with certain symmetry modes, but that\u0027s nothing new for anyone who used surface attached symmetry of that type without the stack nodes. I just prefer to use stack nodes when possible to ensure that the wheels are all at the same level along the side of the craft. I\u0027ve begun to look into even creating a resizable dummy part that would allow adding level stack nodes to the side of a flat surface for attaching wheels.

That way, the wheel itself could still handle the steering mechanism, and you could then add suspension to them by adding a this other part between the vessel and the wheel. I guess what I\u0027m interested in is the ability to separate the steering from the suspension so that the two mechanisms could be used separately, as well at together in custom-made wheels. It could also lead, eventually, to being able to steer a craft using thrusters which respond to the steering system.

Interesting. So, let me get this straight... if they\u0027re within physics range, only the last craft to be launched/loaded functions. If outside physics range, they work as expected. Anything missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thought, without looking at the code, is that the initialization process takes into account all of the repulsors attached to the active craft when figuring out how to handle everything, but any repulsor not attached will not get initialized because the method cannot detect them as active repulsors. When a craft outside of the physics range is switched to, the game has to effectively re-initialize the flight scene and so the repulsors on that craft are then initialized as well. \u003Cem\u003EHowever,\u003C/em\u003E when a craft \u003Cem\u003Ewithin\u003C/em\u003E physics range is switched to, there is no reload of the flight scene and so the repulsors on the other craft are not initialized fully. In this case, we need to add a check to detect if the active vessel has been changed within the same flight-scene instance, and reinitialize the vessel\u0027s repulsors when that happens, instead of waiting for the flight scene initialization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elo-fi will be able to diagnose this further, but I\u0027ll take a look at the code to confirm my suspicions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, you\u0027ve gotta share some of those designs.

The repulsors for the active vessel are only initialized when the flight scene is loaded, or reloaded. That means only the last active vessel will have working repulsors for each scene instance. The instance is not reinitialized when changing the active vessel within physics range, so the repulsors fail to repulse.

I had a look at the source (from the source currently available on github) and I noticed that the repulsors seem to be taking stock of themselves and initializing the repulsion system when the flight scene is loaded, and not specifically when the vessel is set as the active vessel. This would likely lead to only the most recently loaded vessel (launched, or when loading from outside physics/visible range, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E physics range we\u0027re looking for, but whatever range defines the vessel unloading distance) having functioning repulsors. However, I also looked at the code for the wheels and they seem to initialize all of their settings in the same way so this isn\u0027t necessarily the root of the problem here. It\u0027s just my feeble attempt at finding something that \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E be an issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Had a look at the log posted above, and this caught my attention:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003ENullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\u003Cbr\u003E  at KerbalFoundries.Repulsor.OnStart (StartState start) [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at Part.ModulesOnStart () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0 \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E  at Part\u002B.MoveNext () [0x00000] in \u0026lt;filename unknown\u0026gt;:0  \u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeems like this might be a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Climberfx\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Climberfx\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELove the repulsors, remember me Star Wars 1 (4 - first original)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that was one of the goals... that \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E making easy-to-control pod-racers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T22:29:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 10:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Gaalidas\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T22:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGreat, i can see now some one sticking these things on Omicron to see what happens...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ersrsrrsr\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaalidas","CreatedById":111158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T23:04:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat was my plan all along.
