The classification to me is secondary to the completion.\n\nOn this subject, I had bugged Fengist previously about using my own StockBugFixes in conjunction with this challenge. He successfully convinced me that the only real way about it is \u0022stock is stock, and if you add things to the GameData folder or fiddle with the physics settings, it\u0027s not pure stock anymore.\u0022 There are simply too many add-ons to keep up with.\n\nWhile I definitely find it frustrating watching my kerbals ragdoll in their seats, and my wheels to break if I click on them, I have also come to agree with Fengist that there\u0027s really no way to keep a list of mods that are \u0022okay to qualify as stock.\u0022 As such, I even uninstalled my own add-ons for this challenge. Although I\u0027m a nearly all stock player to begin with, so I suppose I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m missing much.\n\nI know he\u0027s trying to be generous and let people have their fun, but personally I agree that if you want that coveted Stock title, it comes with a certain level of pain. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) (Believe me...I forgot how often kerbals ragdoll while in seats, even in a boat on the water...)\n\nJust my personal two cents, but this is Fengist\u0027s challenge so he\u0027s definitely the king on this subject for Elcano. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nCheers,\n\n-Claw\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The KSS Airwhale has now landed!\n\nNice job.

So, if MJ or KE or any other such non-part or non-physics changing mod is used, I\u0027ll normally ignore it. If I listed them as stock but they used such mods, it\u0027s more of an oversight on my part but not a hard and fast rule.
