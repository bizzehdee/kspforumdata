As a result, things like the inability to mine, refine and scan on non-active vessels wasn\u0027t a deal-breaker, and the drawbacks of Kethane\u0027s single-resource model (like how a single combination mining/refining vessel can meet all your resource needs) didn\u0027t matter so much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the recent news that there\u0027ll likely be no official resources for the foreseeable future, we\u0027re now relying entirely on this mod.
