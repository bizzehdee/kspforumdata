I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve unlocked everything in the Tech tree and I just accepted a mission to perform pressure measurements on and above the surface of Eve. Getting to Eve is no biggy, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m having trouble designing an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cairplane\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s able to reach 4 mission-waypoints/landmarks (on different altitudes) without running out of fuel. The waypoints are relatively close to each other, within a radius of say, 10-20 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in my first design I wanted to build something that:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas Light (less drag)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad Lots of Delta V (so I have room for errors.. lots of errors)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad small wings (we don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t need huge wings in this dense atmosphere) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHad a Low TWR (because we can swim through the dense atmosphere)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI ended up making a small Ion plane, using 2 ion engines, 2 type A wings, some flaps, a small reaction wheel and a drone core. I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have any pictures of the plane because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m at work. The plane flew perfectly during several tests runs on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWeight, 1t \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 1.5t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDelta v, 10km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETWR, 0.2 on Eve (0,34 on Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe results were very disappointing.. due to the high gravity, the plane wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t able to climb to higher altitudes at all! And with a maximum velocity of 30m/s this mission would take many (rather boring) hours to complete! I guess I need more TWR to counter the high gravity of Eve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow did you guys design your vessels for these \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cscan missions\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 missions on Eve?I I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very curious!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T11:55:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right with the TWR. 0.2 is abysmal.
