I was able to dock to it previously with no problem, but was unable to take control of it from the map or the observatory after leaving it in orbit. Has anyone else run in to this issue? I haven\u0027t been back on since so I have no idea if quitting the build fixed the issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust had this happen to me as well.
