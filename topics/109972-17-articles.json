I mean you do have a fairing covering it, right? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)   I agree though, I had this conversation a while back.  If you look back through the thread, when I discussed adding the customization feature, there was quite the discussion on what to include in the part selection algorithm.\n\u003E \n\nI have at least two engines that are passable, as set in the manufacturer\u0027s config. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  Of course, both are engines with a ring of nozzles around a central tube - the tube is passable.\n\nI don\u0027t mind the idea of adding an option to tweak any part\u0027s passibility.  On the other hand, I think that might reduce the number of people who ship CLS patches with their mods - at the moment, if I have a part that needs passibility I\u0027ll write a patch and typically I\u0027ll pass it along as a PR.  If it was just a switch to turn on passibility in each part, I suspect a lot of times \u0027official\u0027 support would be forgotten and the default response to be \u0027just turn on passibility in that part\u0027.  Path of least resistance and all that.  Honestly, \\*most\\* mods have good support for CLS at this point - and I\u0027ve even talked one author to include a patch that set passible to false so that you could switch that part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E if you wanted to.  (Since it looked passible, but probably wasn\u0027t designed for it.)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, Bit Fiddler said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E well windows does that natively no need for a new program.  that is how I do it now, however the problem is the .cfg file name is not always named similar to the part in game..  so it becomes a game of digital hide and seek.\n\u003E \n\nIf you have to look for the .cfg file after searching - or are searching for the name of the config file - then Windows doesn\u0027t do what I\u0027m suggesting. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  I\u0027m suggesting to look in the \\*contents\\* of the config files for the part name in the game - which should get you the name and path of the cfg file.\n\n(And even if it does do it natively, it might be worth taking a look at a program that gets you better/easier to use results.  I know MacOS\u0027s find can in theory do this for instance - but isn\u0027t very good at it, so I typically use BBEdit\u0027s search instead.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-29T17:37:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, DStaal said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I have at least two engines that are passable, as set in the manufacturer\u0027s config. ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)  Of course, both are engines with a ring of nozzles around a central tube - the tube is passable.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t mind the idea of adding an option to tweak any part\u0027s passibility.
