Constant minor adjustments to the throttle and direction are required to keep it in one piece while landing! Those landing gear are only good for about 8-10 meters per second max descent speed at impact. Found that out the hard way. Wanna slow down change direction really fast? Cut the throttle. Warning: do not attempt that maneuver below 2000m! LOL Found that out the hard way too! This thing will hit some pretty amazing speeds, but after about 550mps, it disintegrates. After about an hour in the air and multiple crashes, I finally got the hang of it. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI usually end up putting parachutes on all my aircraft as a \u0022when all else fails\u0022 option. This craft is no exception. I also put my next favorite parts on it too: air brakes. Deploying these at high speeds will make it flip around to retrograde, just like cutting the throttle.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;m really liking some of the new parts, like the engine pods I used on this craft. They remind me of the ones used on a B-52 bomber. I can\u0026#39;t wait to see what other people make with them!\n"}]}
