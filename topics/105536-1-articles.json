There\u0027s nothing that changed about dV costs in empty space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a rule of the thumb, reasonably well executed launches from Kerbin now appear to require around 3,400 dV, or in other words, about 25% less than the old value of 4,500 m/s. Not sure if that holds over exactly for the other atmospheres, but it probably holds up well enough that you can get a ballpark estimate figure. For instance, an Eve ascent used to require (from sea level) 11,500 to 12,000 m/s dV. Now, you can expect it to be more in the realm of 8,700 to 9,000 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T11:15:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 11:15  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EDerp!\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T15:49:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Eve will be dramatically less, whereas Duna will be basically the same.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are 3 things you need to consider:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Absolute dV requirement: This would be for a ship with a drag coefficient of zero, and an infinite TWR-\u0026gt; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETylo orbit is 2,200 m/s - you have to spend at least that much to get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe orbit is 1850m/s - you have to spend at least that much to get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna orbit is what... 950 m/s? - you have to spend at least that much to get to orbit. (also, you have to add a bit extra to get to a certain height above the planet/moon)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Gravity drag - Because you don\u0027t have an infinite TWR, and even if you did, you don\u0027t want to exceed terminal velocity on airless worlds, and your timng is not perfect (and using an infinite TWR drive would be as bad as lithobraking on tylo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Aerodynamic drag - this is the main thing that changes in this update, but this should also affect gravity drag on worlds with atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerodynamic drag on Duna was always a small portion of the dV costs. If you have a 50% reduction in something that accounts for 20% of the dV cost, its only a 10% reduction to the total dV.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Kerbin, we were spending 4,500 dV to get to a 2,300 m/s orbit (ignoring increased altitude, coupling it with terminal elocity/gravity drag ascents, ignoring equatorial velocity)... we spent about 2 km/sec fighting aerodynamic drag and associate gravity drag... Now... its about half that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuna ascents took... what? 1,300 m/s... call it 350 m/s due to drag. Lets assume that is reduced to 175... It may now take 1,125 instead of 1,300... a 15% change... meanwhile Going from 4,500 to 3,400 is a 32% change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cost of a duna ascent from high altitude will see even less of a change, because the atmosphere was even less relevant....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve on the other hand... Eve we were spending 12,000 m/s to achieve an orbit of less than 3,500 m/s... 8.5 km/sec lost to gravity drag and aerodynamic drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of raw dV, it should be much easier... but the atmospheric thrust nerfs to engines, and Isp continuing to decrease as pressure goes above 1 atm should make it quite the challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think Aerospikes will be in order (they were previous contenders, but the 48-7s was still better, as was one of the ARM pack engines IIRC... because aerospike TWR was too low)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kelderek","CreatedById":131312,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T16:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt just cost me between 1200-1300 DV to go from the surface to a mostly circular orbit of about 60km at Duna - I should have made a more precise notation of the DV I used.
