It would be a good idea to at least play through career at least once. If you\u0027d have played through that you would understand why your tutorial for getting orbit is pretty useless. If you want to teach people how to get to orbit, then do so with a rocket that weighs 18t maximum and show them how to do a gravity turn to get there. Because if you can\u0027t do that then pretty much every other tutorial out there is better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirBlazinGames","CreatedById":136531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T19:53:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah this was my first tutorial and I will admit it was pretty bad, but I do know how to play KSP so... yeah.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirBlazinGames","CreatedById":136531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-30T00:32:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow To Kerbal: To The Mun and back will be up soon \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirBlazinGames","CreatedById":136531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T15:10:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENew guide out.... also I dont know what too do next D:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SirBlazinGames","CreatedById":136531,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-07T19:36:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Arial;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003EI will be ending this series as part of a big channel update/reboot I am doing, also it has been a while since I have made a tutorial so it has died down a bit.
