You don\\\u0027t really need more than 1 between each section, the parts connected to each other with normally strong joints should hold themselves up. You could probably cut that number down to like 50, tops. It might not be as aesthetically pleasing, but it\\\u0027d make it easier on your PC.

Like all that cross bracing you have on top of the first wings there, you don\\\u0027t need like 90% of those. Move the wheel base out a bit so it\\\u0027s better supported on the ground, tie the engines to the hull, and then tie like the center and outside panels of each \u0027strip\u0027 (depending on how \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou connected them) to the hull.

Try to attach the extra fuel directly to the hull of the craft. I\\\u0027m not sure if they have the capability with their node placement, but that would allow you to remove even more struts from the design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the above idea works, then remove the wing connectors and other structural/delta wings you have covering/connecting them. If it doesn\\\u0027t work, consider removing the outside fuselages entirely, as you should already have enough fuel to get you around the globe and enough lift with what you have strapped on to it. I know this is for aesthetics, but if the craft can\\\u0027t be flown then there\\\u0027s no point for it to be there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Shorten the entire craft by 20-30% and reshape the wings to accommodate it. You have plenty of fuel on board already and shortening it as a whole will reduce the number of parts drastically. Move the main wings up a bit and take off one or two of the fuel fuselages on each of the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Don\\\u0027t worry so much about the wings being properly angled/curved. It\\\u0027s nice to look at and you did a good job, but having them shaped that way increases the number of parts you need. Redo the wings with delta/structural/wing connectors and you should be able to take about 20-30% of the entire parts of the wings while keeping a similar look, but it won\\\u0027t be as fluid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou did good with removing the struts, but it seems like the engines attached to the wings are still too heavy. I can\\\u0027t tell what\\\u0027s causing breakage (it exploded on the runway but my fps was too low to determine what was causing it), but the whole thing is just too big. You can have a beast of a computer and the game still might not be capable of handling and processing all that information until performance is better optimized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main problem to me it seems is all of those extra fuel fuselages you have strapped to the main hull. They\\\u0027re hanging on the wing connectors, which means you added struts to support them, but that means that the wings and everything attached to them is pulling down on the wing boards/fuel and just exacerbating the issue. If you can remedy or remove those fuel tanks in the middle then I think it will help the craft as a whole in terms of stability, strength and lessening the amount of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat build and it\\\u0027s unfortunate that it\\\u0027s so difficult to get it working because of frame rate issues, but like I said, if you can\\\u0027t fly it then it\\\u0027s worthless. The only other thing you can do is hold onto the designs and see if performance issues are addressed in the future, and hope that .craft files become transferable between versions of KSP. I\\\u0027m sure you don\\\u0027t want to rebuild this thing from scratch, but it doesn\\\u0027t seem like the game can deal with it atm.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xvdBanksbvx","CreatedById":30451,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T23:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the tips they have helped and I have managed to make it work a little better with fps, still needs a lot more redesigning though. I\\\u0027m not sure if it because the craft is so heavy the wheels want to sink into the runway and that causes it to rip itself apart, but when I have overcome this problem by throttling up and down until it moves I still need to be able to make it take off without hitting the back end on the runway. So I am going to spend today doing some redesigns and try to make it so at least others can fly it as I want to try and keep it as large as possible. Also do you or anyone reading this thread know about standard sas, does more equal better control while sas is engaged and does it matter how they are placed? \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wildkittyv1","CreatedById":30893,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-31T23:47:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing you can try, and it\\\u0027ll be a pain because you\\\u0027ll basically have to rebuild the wings, is check out the rescaled plane parts in the mod forum. I know this is all stock and you\\\u0027d probably prefer to keep it that way, but as a temporary placeholder until the game runs better as a whole, you could probably use the large swept wings instead of having to use a bunch of the smaller ones - that\\\u0027ll reduce the number of parts right away and keep the swept look you have going.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as the SAS is concerned, I\\\u0027ve never really used them with planes at all. I put the nosecone and nose avionics package/ASAS on pretty much all of my planes, but I always try to balance them and make them capable of flying without them. I don\\\u0027t have a joystick, so I mostly use the ASAS as a sort of autopilot for longer trips since we can\\\u0027t set trim yet. My understanding is that regular SAS modules and the avionics ASAS work with different parameters, and that they should be used only with their respective craft - SAS/regular ASAS for vertical rockets, and the avionics package for horizontal rockets/planes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, good build, and I hope you can manage to get it workable while retaining most of the aesthetics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xvdBanksbvx","CreatedById":30451,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T00:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I have done I have done a bit of a redesign and still cant get it to take off but I don\\\u0027t have any fps issues now, still a step in the right direction.
