Its not much to look at yet, but in the pic you can see I am docking some more modules. I have to say that seems to be the most time consuming process. I did work up a nice launcher package with a self contained rcs module (for docking manuvers). You can see a pair of them still docked at the station. Next tripI plan to salvage my (big red) fuel tank form the rocket to transfer there liquid fuel before i jettison them from the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s my start, hey where on the forums could I keep a journal of my progress?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rFiSp2b.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rFiSp2b.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt\u0026#039;n Skunky","CreatedById":1261,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T23:14:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHappy Launching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArrr!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECapt\u0027n Skunky\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#800080;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Community Manager\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrChumley","CreatedById":58555,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T22:45:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHiya Mission Control!
