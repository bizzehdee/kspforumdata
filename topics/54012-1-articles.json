So if you want to go to a star 200 million light years away, and you could get past the speed of light, how would you go about accelerating to that speed? I\u0027m gonna reckon that for a long (order of months, maybe years) burn, 2Gs would be the maximum limit normally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever that still means you can only accelerate at 19.62m/s^s. And that\u0027s accelerating to way past 299 792 458m/s (quite a few orders of magnitude). Now if we wanted to get to that place within, lets say, a year (FTL travel being possible) how would we deal with the g-forces that are going to want to plaster us into a pinkish smear on the rear wall of the cockpit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought of a system that converts the velocity into angular momentum for the crew compartment leaving the crew compartment spinning at a very fast speed (which would slow down over the course of the journey), having brakes of some sort to slow down the angular acceleration.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-22T15:20:03Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2013 03:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mmmmyum\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chrisd857","CreatedById":57291,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T15:22:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the real problem is that, when relativistic effects become significant, your increasing mass, decreasing ship length, and dilating time will prevent you from reaching light speed (since your mass will be infinite and the ship will have zero-length). Faster than light, imaginary numbers start popping up all over the place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, you need some trickery like the theorectical Alcubierre drive to manage this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kahlzun","CreatedById":39989,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T15:24:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve got access to an energy source that allows you to maintain that acceleration, then you\u0027ve probably got the technology to diminish G-forces.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep in mind an engine can only accelerate something to the speed of its exhaust (give or take), so to get to lightspeed, you need to be firing out light-speed particles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you were trying to get to something 200M LY away, the months or years it takes you to accelerate to C would be trivial compared to total flight time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZetaX","CreatedById":60692,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T15:40:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kahlzun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kahlzun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKeep in mind an engine can only accelerate something to the speed of its exhaust (give or take), so to get to lightspeed, you need to be firing out light-speed particles.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, just no! Don\u0027t think that rocket engine exhaust travels at orbital velocity or higher, because it doesn\u0027t, and it doesn\u0027t need to. You get faster by Newton\u0027s laws if you eject some mass with any speed backwards, however miniscule. More speed of the ejected mass just means you accelerate more at once, i.e. you are more efficient in regard to mass spent as exhaust (-\u0026gt; specific impulse).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELight speed being impossible to achieve for anything of positive mass is a purely relativistic problem and has othing to do with such matters of Newtonian physics.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mmmmyum","CreatedById":85231,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T16:30:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI looked up how long it would take to accelerate to c at 1G, and that\u0027s just over a year ignoring the annoyances of relativity.

It\u0027s the map distance covered in unit proper time. From perspective of the crew of the ship, that\u0027s the true velocity. And that can go as fast as you like. Better yet, once you are going fast enough, it becomes easier to speed up. At proper acceleration of 1G, it\u0027s possible to make a round trip to Andromeda in a little over 50 years of ship time. So speed of light isn\u0027t that big of a problem for crew of the ship. On Earth, however, millions of years will pass, which might be a problem depending on what the goals of the voyage are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jim DiGriz","CreatedById":92465,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-22T17:39:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starwhip\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starwhip\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou see, you guys keep saying NEWTONIAN physics.
