It\u0027d move very slowly, but would be perfect for tiny little probes, and with enough power you could use a little fuel to go at some quite noticeable speeds; mass*velocity, a little of one and a lot of the other works both ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here my journey begins, first mod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all I\u0027m gonna get some modelling done as I\u0027m still slightly unsure on how to make new resources... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy plan for the solar wind collector is simple, just an air intake that only collects the resource outside of the atmosphere of any given planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, my coding skills are good but not great, so I\u0027m gonna need a little advice on how to create new resources and plugins, a link to a tutorial on how to do this would be great if possible thanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll start the modelling later today, I\u0027ll keep updating with renders every now and then. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E Aesthetics: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the drives\u0027 engine flare I\u0027m going to mix the particle exhaust from a SRB and a small flame from a liquid fuel engine, already managed to test that much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003E Update 1: \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EResource working absolutely great, engine and fuel tank models still WIP, gonna be a while still.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-02T18:56:08Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2013 06:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Chant778\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fyrem","CreatedById":57131,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T09:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe solar sail / collector would have to huge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chant778","CreatedById":2731,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T16:59:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fyrem\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fyrem\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe solar sail / collector would have to huge.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the plan, large and folding\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T17:35:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EResources are simply defined in config files (text files) in the Resources folder, create a new one named something.cfg and use the same structure as the one with the default resources.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
