You can pick a name for your nation, and then choose a starting planet. The only planet exception is Jool and Kerban. Kerban is occupied by the United Kerbal Empire (me) and Jool is a gas planet. If you wish to have Jool as your starting planet, you will need to construct a large space station to orbit Jool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShips:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo make ships, they need to be in 1 piece. I will not accept any giant ships that you need to put 3 parts together to make. There\u0027s a small exception: You can make resupply ships to resupply carriers or other ships with weaponry or drones. Please do not include orbital equipment such as boosters, or things you use when launching.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPiloting: Each ship requires at least 3 kerbals to pilot it (doesn\u0027t matter the cockpit or how the 3 kerbals are on the ship, as long as they are secure) except all small manned ships such as scouts or cruisers required 1 kerbal. If colony attack drones are used in carriers to be dropped into planets to wipe out bases or such, they are NOT to be manned. They must be piloted by satellite or some other robotic function.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMods: I will not accept anything with mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommanding a nation: You can contact me in any way you can to execute operations, attacks, and other diplomacy. I will reply to you with a summary of what happened for the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to join this, let me know!
