I believe the most efficient ratio for a rocket engine is 4:1, but that\u0027s very volume inefficient so real engines compromise and run in the 5:1 to 6:1 range. The current 15-1 ratio we all use is about 4.7:1 by mass, and at a 10-1 ratio it would be about 7:1 by mass. So it\u0027s not really closer to reality, just different. But this is not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E and none of that is relevant ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)\n\n[This image](https://i.imgur.com/5y1Ecn6.png) shows the current problem with the mixed tanks well. Since 15-1 works out to 3-1 by volume you can use 4 identical tanks, with 3 holding pure LH2 and the other holding Oxidizer. The left half of the image is the vessel using pure tanks, and the right half is mixed tanks. They should be identical but the mixed fuel setup has both a heavier dry weight and less total fuel. If you do not agree they should be identical in both total fuel and dry mass we have different ideas of \u0022balance\u0022.\n\nWhile switching to a 10-1 ratio would improve fuel mass, simply correcting the above issue would by itself have a significant impact on vessels using mixed tanks.\n\n| Ratio | Tons Fuel per 1000 units of volume |\n| --- | --- |\n| 15-1 Current | 1.213 |\n| 15-1 Corrected | 1.516 |\n| 10-1 Proposed | 1.903 |\n\nNote that the dry mass is also too heavy on the current tanks so the difference is more dramatic than just the fuel mass the table shows.\n\nThere is also the proposal to compress the hydrogen to 150% to allow smaller tanks on pure LH2 vessels. Doing that to the pure tanks means you *should* do it to the mixed tanks as well. Only the LH2 portion is compressed from 5:1 to 7.5:1, the Oxidizer portion remains 1:1 per unit of volume. That gives you this:\n\n| Ratio | Tons Fuel per 1000 units of volume |\n| --- | --- |\n| 15-1 150% LH2 | 2.021 |\n| 10-1 150% LH2 | 2.447 |\n\nSo by correcting the volume issue, compressing the hydrogen, ***and*** changing the mixture to 10-1, and you are doubling the mass of fuel in mixed tanks compared to current. I think that might be more than some people are bargaining for. *(It\u0027s actually slightly more fuel than the old double density tanks held: 2.425 tons per 1000).*\n\nA less gamey approach to compressing to 150% would be compressing to not more than 120% and calling it slush hydrogen. That\u0027s at least a thing. I don\u0027t really have a strong opinion there and you can do what you want with compression without effecting other mods. Changing to 10-1 means other mods have to follow suit or we have incompatible engines and tanks."},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbital","CreatedById":170602,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-04T00:48:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 4/2/2018 at 5:28 PM, theonegalen said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E You make me sad.

Since 15-1 works out to 3-1 by volume you can use 4 identical tanks, with 3 holding pure LH2 and the other holding Oxidizer. The left half of the image is the vessel using pure tanks, and the right half is mixed tanks. They should be identical but the mixed fuel setup has both a heavier dry weight and less total fuel.\n\u003E \n\nPart of the issue there is that the mixed-tank definition of 6 units of LH2 and 0.2 units of Oxidizer per liter only adds up to 0.8 L, so the mixed tanks are only 80% utilized.  Increasing the per-liter contents by 25% (7.5 U LH2, 0.25 U Ox) would make the two setups hold identical amounts of fuel.  (Normally I\u0027d also increase the dry mass per unit by the same amount, but that would exacerbate the gap in dry masses, so some other tinkering may be required -- possibly an issue with the math in the tank-switcher patch, since keeping a consistent 20% LH2 and 12.5% Ox mass fraction should work out the same for four mixed tanks or four pure tanks.)  It would also let people get away with rockets 20% shorter than they currently fly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-07T03:36:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2018 03:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbas\\_ad\\_astra**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nertea","CreatedById":83952,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-07T18:20:09Z","Content":"A test version of CryoTanks with most of the planned balance changes can be downloaded by pulling my [dev branch](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/CryoTanks/tree/dev).

I love the new short tank clusters, and especially the \u0022compact\u0022 and \u0022bare\u0022 configurations.\n\n2. The tank contents switching utility seems to work fine with a small sample of stock and mod tanks I\u0027ve tried out, including Fuel Tanks Plus, SpaceY Heavy Lifters, and Home Grown Rockets. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E engines appear to pull the appropriate ratios evenly, so that\u0027s working as expected.\n\n3. The gold foil texture for the tanks seems closer to foam, in fact more so than the older textures I think.  I think that\u0027s a function of them having low contrast between the bright and dark areas of the \u0022crinkles\u0022, a softer apparent transition between those bright and dark areas, and a relatively low specular reflection overall on the tank.  I think \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s Kontainer Tank textures are a good example to refer to for improvement.  The default gold texture on those parts looks much more metallic.\n\n4. I\u0027m withholding judgement on the densification to \u0022gameify\u0022 the tanks until there are updated Cryo and NTR engine parts.  As I\u0027ve noted earlier, I think both sets of engines were chronically underpowered to begin with.  This impacted the utility of the LH2/O2 engines for second stages to finish the last leg of the climb and circularize to orbit.  For the NTRs (without O2 thrust augmentation), I thought the engine count or size class to get a large Duna-bound craft to no less than a 0.1g \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to keep gravity losses reasonable during ejection burns (even from high orbit) was also a bit disappointing.\n\nEither way, I\u0027m looking forward to the updates.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-08T13:17:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2018 01:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 8, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by KSPrynk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wyzard","CreatedById":162363,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-08T14:49:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 19 hours ago, Nertea said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E - 7.5 units of LH2 per volume unit (instead of 5)\n\u003E \n\nThis seems a little weird to me \u2014 it\u0027s sort of an indirect way of changing the volume ratio from 15:1 to 10:1, by keeping the 15:1 numerical ratio but changing the units in which the 15 is measured.  It\u0027s a bit confusing because it breaks the usual CRP rule (if I understand correctly) that 1 liquid unit is 1 liter.  But I recognize that it\u0027s probably simpler than actually changing the volume ratio, and less likely to have \u0022ripple effects\u0022  since engines don\u0027t need to change.  So I think it\u0027s weird, but I\u0027m not really opposed to it.\n\nBTW, I noticed a few small issues with the tank models:\n\n- There\u0027s some Z-fighting on the bottom of the H250-16 tank, around the 1.25m attachment plate.\n- The HR-1 tank looks like it\u0027s missing one of the metal supports that hold the tank.
