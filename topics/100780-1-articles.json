These rockets have fuselages 10 meters in diameter, however, even with tweakscale, the size in KSP tops out at 7.5 meters. For this reason, I am posting a download link to the original tweakscale mod, as well as my custom configuration file that adds microscopic 31.25cm parts and massive 10m parts to your arsenal!\n\nTo install the custom config:\n\n1. Make sure you have tweakscale (if you don\u0027t, you can download it [here](http://kerbal.curseforge.com/ksp-mods/220549-tweakscale/files/2222766/download))\n\n2. Make your way to this location in your file explorer: (Main KSP Folder)\\GameData\\TweakScale\n\n3. Rename the current DefaultScales.cfg to back up the file\n\n4. Extract the custom config file from the zip and place it in the folder\n\n5. Enjoy your new parts!![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nCustom config download:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/jktjstqb9svqtu0/TS%20Custom%20Config.zip?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jktjstqb9svqtu0/TS%20Custom%20Config.zip?dl=0)\n\n**License:** **All rights reserved**\n\n**Also, if you\u0027re looking to have some rockets built, custom or historical, take a look at my new** [**Rocket Builder\u0027s Thread**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111659-Pacific-Sun-Rocketry-NEW-AND-TAKING-REQUESTS)**!**\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-26T15:32:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2015 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vigilante96**"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T15:16:20Z","Content":"Moving this to Add-On Releases, please add a license to your post and the download to comply with our [Add-On Rules](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87841-Add-on-Posting-Rules-Aug-21st-2014)."},{"CreatedByName":"Vigilante96","CreatedById":138457,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-26T15:21:32Z","Content":"Sorry, my first mod post, Ill be sure to do that."},{"CreatedByName":"woody_11","CreatedById":68426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-10T20:25:47Z","Content":"Can you do a 1.875 Meter Version?"}]}
