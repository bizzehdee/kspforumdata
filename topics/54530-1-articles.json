I did a quick search and hadn\u0027t seen the idea I\u0027m about to propose be suggested before. I\u0027ve logged around 100 hours in KSP so far, and I\u0027ve spent all of it in Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. Probes, landings, and exploration in LKO, Mun, and Minmus. Just the other day I sent my first inter-planetary probe to Eve and was very happy with my first construct to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt made me want to record the incident, so I took a few screenshots, but then thought of the idea that it would be neat if every campaign or sandbox game could have some sort of in-game \u0022List of Records\u0022 sub-menu. Perhaps in the Tracking Station of the Space Center? I use the tracking center feature often to find all of my different craft, flags, etc. I thought it would \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFlight that is furthest in distance from KSC.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EFlight that has traveled the greatest distance.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\u0022First flight\u0022 to enter SOI of different objects in Kerbol system.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EKerbonaut with most days in Space.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOther ideas such as \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_exploration_milestones,_1957%E2%80%931969\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethe one compiled by Wikipedia\u0027s community\u003C/a\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis feature is non-essential to gameplay, but I wanted to bring it to the community, since I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve seen mention of it anywhere else.
