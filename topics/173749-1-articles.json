I also got the chance to stay two weeks in Newport,\u00A0Rhodes Island, in 2007 and it was a pretty nice place.

I do remember the time that we pulled into Corpus Christi, Texas on 4th of July weekend. My ship was the U.S.S. City of Corpus Christi. It was Texas. It was pretty wild.

I took a long weekend and visited Botswana with a friend of mine, spent the weekend camping in Khutse Game Reserve.

We went to Alaska for two weeks to see one of her grad school friends get married. We went to Australia for two weeks, did a Coral Sea live-aboard dive trip. We went back and did Orlando together for a week. We were all over California, we did the Sierra Nevadas, Joshua Tree, dive trips off the coast. We had a great time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, then we had kids. Traveling with babies is an ordeal. We actually decided to take a road trip to Oregon the last two weeks of our family leave after Thing One was born. Our original goal was to make it all the way to Portland, but we wound up cutting it short at Crater Lake because traveling with an infant was just exhausting. So, we didn\u0027t travel a whole lot over the next five years or so. We got annual passes to Disneyland and called it good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now, they\u0027re grown enough that we can travel more. Although flying five of us anywhere is prohibitively expensive, we\u0027re driving all over Hell and half of Georgia, camping all over the West. Yellowstone, Zion, Bryce, Arches, Canyonlands, Death Valley, etc. We did a four-day cruise out of LA to Mexico last summer too, kids loved it.
