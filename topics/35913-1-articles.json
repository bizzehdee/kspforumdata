As in, it refuses to even lift. I\u0027m using the LV-909\u0027s, 4 of them. I need them so my rover can get under my lander and KAS it into place. You see, I need a small yet powerful engine that my lander/rover can lift off of any planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the same as in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/38925-Need-to-get-this-Rover-Lander-into-orbit-and-not-spin-before-doing-so\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I tried to mod the engine to be more powerful; as powerful as the Areospike engine, and also have the Thrust Vectoring of the Mark 55 Radial Mount engine, by getting into its config (I made a backup), and tweaked the thrust and the gimbal, and saved it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022new\u0022 engine shows up in my Propulsion tab, and I attach them. But on launch it behaves as if the original rockets are still there. Even MechJeb\u0027s Vessel Info tells me it can only do 200 kN. It should be doing 700 kN.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease help. I\u0027m clueless, and raging. Obviously there\u0027s a setting I didn\u0027t see, or I can\u0027t just edit it and expect it to work. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_angry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:mad:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Woot!
