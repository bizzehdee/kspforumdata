Fortunately for us however, we dont need a scientific paper to determine if this is possible, with \u0022some\u0022 back of the napkin calculations, we should be able to make a pretty decent guess. You\u0027d definitely need to carry cold hydrogen with you, you\u0027d be using the heat transfer to perform work in the form of propelling your ship forward and to cool down the ship. The fact that mixing an equal amount of pure hydrogen will always equalize the temperatures, there\u0027s no engineering around this, this is just basic thermodynamics. Fortunately for us however, the sun isn\u0027t pure hydrogen. The sun has a specific heat of roughly 12 j/g K, compared to hydrogens 14.304 j/g K. This alone however, is only a ~20% difference however, likely not good enough with this alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFortunately for us, we don\u0027t need to cool it down all the way, as long as it doesn\u0027t melt the tank its in, and the tank is strong enough to handle the extreme pressure that this tank will likely have to save space, then we are golden. While the tank will conduct heat to anything touching it, since we are in space we don\u0027t need for it to touch the rest of the ship much, after all we have no gravity and can easily get a vacuum to get rid of most conduction. The question becomes now though, what material works best for the tank. We need a material that has both a high melting point, and a high ultimate tensile stress. Fortunately for us however, we already have a material more then capable of this. Graphene has a melting point of 4500 K and an ultimate tensile strength of\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E130 Gigapascals\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E.

This means that for every gram of hydrogen you use for cooling your collected gas, you get slightly over 2 grams of collected gas back\u003Csup\u003E5\u003C/sup\u003E. You\u0027ll have excess gas to still use for cooling and manage to gain more at the end of the day. Keep in mind that these numbers are for our sun, for kerbol you\u0027d get a smaller margin due to the increased temperatures, but considering that red giants have around half the temperature of our sun, they\u0027d be relatively very easy to collect fuel from.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
