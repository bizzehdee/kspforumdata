If you use the right-click menu to disable flow from a mono tank (click the green arrow) then a kerbal will not remove mono from that tank when they exit the craft. I\u0027ve been using this fact in conjunction with some of the 10 unit tanks from the KSPX mod to prevent my kerbals from emptying the entire mono supply whenever they leave for a walk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just turn off all but one tank and the command pod so that only twenty units are available, and then when I get back I refill those two tanks by pumping manually from the ones that are turned off.

It\u0027s a reasonable assumption anyway, if you\u0027ve got air stored in the same part as Kerbals, they\u0027ll be able to access it easily. If it\u0027s in another part (say, an external tank or another module), then active ventilation is required. This doesn\u0027t cover all imaginable cases, but is a reasonable approximation. Of course, this wouldn\u0027t stop you from manually pumping oxygen/CO2 around the station, but I think you could say that manual pumps and valves are provided as a part of emergency equipment and operated by Kerbals when you do that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-05T17:23:51Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2014 05:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Guest\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scripto23","CreatedById":95288,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-05T17:57:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah I think having some set amount of time a Kerbal will live once electricity runs out, while not optimal, would still be better than have no electricity requirement whatsoever.
