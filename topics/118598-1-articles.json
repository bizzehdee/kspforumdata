When i wanted to explore eve i dont want to send a kerbal down because of the hard return. So i send a remote rover at the surface. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it would be great if my Kerbals at an orbital station can control the Rover without any remote tech conection to Kerbol?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you can understand me, i am not a native speaker.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T12:51:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you can do that with remote tech. A craft with kerbals can act as local control for anything in range instead of having to send the signal back home.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T15:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, put 6 Kerbals and the largest probe core on a ship, and it will act as a Command Station (like Mission Control). You\u0027ll get a red dot, and you can control anything that connects to it, even if you have no connection to Mission Control. It doesn\u0027t work for science, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/#command-stations\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://remotetechnologiesgroup.github.io/RemoteTech/#command-stations\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
