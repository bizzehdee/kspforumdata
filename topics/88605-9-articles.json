If you run into an issue, please provide me with details on how to reproduce it. Help me help you...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKnown Issues: If you drop the Ponderosa, it might explode on impact with the ground. This is a KAS issue. The Ponderosa has no handy attachment nodes to make it store extension parts and such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the Ponderosa, Wild Blue Industries\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 top of the line colonization module. The Ponderosa can be stored in a KAS container (it takes up 90 KAS units of space) and stored on a standard KAS container bay. To deploy the Ponderosa, simply grab the module while on EVA, walk or fly over to the desired site, drop the module, and deploy it. Optionally, you can attach it to the ground before deployment, but you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll need to re-orient the module first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added the Portable Crew Tube (PCT). The PCT is just like the Flex-O-Tube except that the PCT has a more stock-like appearance and it can be stored on the MBU for easy attachment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Repositioned the location where new spacecraft are spawned by the Skydock250 and Skydock375. Hopefully that will reduce the chances of the docks causing an explosion when spawning new craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added MM config file to hide unused MKS/OKS parts. They\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re still around, just not shown in the editor. If you want to keep those parts available, simply remove the MM_USI.cfg file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added MM config file for KSOS modules: The cupola can now become a Colony Command Center; the station power module can now become a PDU; the KerbaLab can now become a Multipurpose Colony Module; the hydroponics module may be used as an efficiency part for the Aeroponics module; and the habitat module may be used as an efficiency part for the Kerbitat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: You might need to delete your ModuleManager.CONFIGCACHE and ModuleManager.ConfigSHA.CONFIGSHA file, located in the GameData folder, for the MM config changes to take effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Added OSE workshop to the Fabricator template. Now you can print KAS grabbable and storable parts! OSE Workshop by ObiVanDamme downloaded separately.
