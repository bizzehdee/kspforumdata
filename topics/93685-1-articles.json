One of the great joys of Kerbal for me was that I could just build stuff and try it. I pretty quickly exhausted the base game, but first add-ons, then realism OH, made the problems really interesting. Getting to the Moon, let alone Mars (and back) with full realism is tough - without any cost or technology limits. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow - playing the game feels like work. Funding agencies that want random irrational stuff (test a rocomax booster in orbit.....why???). Trying to pay to upgrade facilities while keeping a science program going.
