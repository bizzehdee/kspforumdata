Are you using staging to decouple the inline chute? If so that\u0027ll deploy the canopy during the hot part of reentry. You have to right click on the chute or set up an action group for a safe decouple, then only use staging for the chute deployment. (I like to make an action group so I can detach my OM and service module in one action)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
