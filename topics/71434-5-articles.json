Why not track the docking port by a changes name Like FIXME-1 or so ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. I read on the Internet that it is possible to repair a broken docking port with KAS by removing and reataching. Also could not try this out yet but i made a config file for me.

At least I \u003Cem\u003Ethink\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027m pretty sure I created the problem by docking ships that had stuff grabbed by Klaws. If I understand correctly, it\u0027s the likeliest cause I can think of, it was a normal operation otherwise. The affected ship is actually my main transportation hub on my career save, so actually resurrecting it would be really awesome! I have already thrown three hours yesterday editing the savefile to save most of what can be easily saved, and I\u0027m not shy of putting more work into it, if I have any hope of success... but I\u0027m doubting there is a fix, because now the problem seems to either be in every docking port in the ship, or something else entirely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, background. I had a couple of times, upon docking ships with Klaws grabbing something, of the camera going on its own merry way. I know that I can short of work around that by going to the space center and back, but I knew something iffy is going on, so I proceeded to run some diagnostics... and thus I found the first bugged docking port. The specific appearance was the \u0022undock\u0022 button disappearing on me without the two ships disengaging, or the button reappearing afterwards. So armed with Notepad\u002B\u002B and this thread, I dived into the savefile to fix the port. It took some doing, but I nailed it... and when it finally docked the UI option stayed available. No matter, another savefile editing and the port on the departing ship was as good as new. Now, obviously that wasn\u0027t the end of it. I was already in full \u0022let\u0027s make sure this is fixed before we make an even bigger problem\u0022 mode. So testing further, I found that in about three other docking port connections \u003Cem\u003EI could get successful undocks that bugged the ports afterwards the very same way\u003C/em\u003E. These were things that had nothing to do with the original misbehaving port, and in fact had worked perfectly before. It seemed that as soon as I fixed one, another would break. And then I started testing the re-engagement of the fixed ports and... well, now I have a pretty good idea that \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E dockign ports are bugged. Or at least they bug when I undock them. The specific variety is \u0022don\u0027t want to reconnect\u0022, and in the savefile they all gain weird properties for the \u0022state\u0022 line in the ModuleDockingNode module, like \u0022disabled\u0022 or \u0022docked (same vessel)\u0022. After some time I also started noticing that they also have DOCKED VESSEL modules when they shouldn\u0027t (undocked), and sometimes they didn\u0027t when they should. I honestly don\u0027t know how I fixed that last one, it was 2 AM and I was running on frustration by then.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince these thing are nothing without hard data an repeatability, here you go, a bunch of saves and snipped-out ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/bfn30521na4s240/Bug\u002Bcompenidum.rar\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/bfn30521na4s240/Bug\u002Bcompenidum.rar\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFour files in there, for anyone that thinks they can help (also, it is my career save... just saying, cool stuff in there). The two plain .txt ones are the affected ship itself, snipped from the quick save at two different times. The first is with me having messed with it only a bit (I had only messed up with a couple ports and decided to backup before I started deleting DOCKED VESSEL modules on unused ports left and right), the second one is where it now stands, with all docking ports disengaging but none of the ports that were engaged, re-engaging afterwards with anything, and anything docking to it bringing up the \u0022camera jumping\u0022 bug that started it all. I also provide two savefiles, a mostly-stable quicksave, and one where I actually caught the root part of the affected ship misbehaving rather dramatically: I can\u0027t remember what I did, but every time I loaded that one and switched view to the station, it would start zipping away pulled by the root part (a big RCS tank) at quite the speed, sometime ripping through the station in the process Other times it would simply detach itself and float away like nothing was happening, clipping through parts and leaving RCS-tank sized hole on the thing. A sneaky root part, could be part of the problem, or a nice diagnostic tool, or just some random bug caused by me fiddling with it and/or the gazillion reloads I had done by then. And if you need anything else, just ask, I\u0027ll be happy to oblige.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA handy Klaw pod is nearby to test ports after fixes, BTW.
