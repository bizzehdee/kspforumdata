Mods don\u0027t scrutinize their parts for balance or matching artstyles. Hence why most KSPX parts got an art overhaul and some minor tweaks before implementation.

Basically, the past 2 updates was a whole load of backend work and preparation for career mode. They could\u0027ve easily released all KSPX parts at once and we would\u0027ve loved it. Only to complain when next update there are no new parts. By staggering the releases we are kept content while they can work on career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-29T11:49:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a very easy and simple explanation why they don\u0027t add mods directly to the stock version. Doing so would make SQUAD directly responsible for any bugs and/or flaws. SQUAD has already a lot of work on it\u0027s plate with building the actual game. Troubleshooting 3rd party mods would only take valuable away time from that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course it would be great if certain mods would eventually become stock and I am sure at least parts of some will. KSPX is an excellent example and so are RemoteTech\u0027s antenna relays, Kethane\u0027s rescource management and B9\u0027s plane parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
