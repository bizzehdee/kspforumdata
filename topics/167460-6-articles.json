A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E: I love mods, I would not play KSP anymore without some of my favorite modders like ShadowMage, Nertea, Angel125, CobaltWolf, RoverDude and many more. I like realistic looking ships, not the stock gumby-meets-lego style of parts (just my opinion), so I rely on mods like SSTU, NearFuture etc to put that sparkle in my eye. Mods make this game so much more awesome than it already is on it\u0027s own. I\u0027ve not played a game as much as I have KSP, thanks to the mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe largest group of people that don\u0027t like mods are most likely people that are not savy to installing or maintaining them. There is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E to help them out\u00A0but even this could be off-putting to people who are only used to installing their game. People using a lot of mods are ussualy able to go into config files and get a general idea of what is happening and how to change stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, ofcourse, the vanilla-snobs that feel using any mod\u00A0is downright cheating, as if that is possible in a single player sandbox game like KSP. It\u0027s about having fun building stuff and exploring the mechanics of orbital flight,or even just blowing stuff up. If you like to make that as hard as possible, or as real as possible, or as easy as possible then that is your right to do so. Mods can help in that regard as there is something for everyone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaters\u00A0gonna hate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
