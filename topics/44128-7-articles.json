The game starts to hit single digit framerates even on high-end machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately there just isn\u0027t a way around that without Kerbal moving from PhysX (built-in and OMG piss poorly implemented) to something like Bullet Physics or Open Dynamics Engine... which isn\u0027t a bad idea to be honest, as it would provide better opportunity for optimisation, multi-core and OpenCL (GPU) support - but they aren\u0027t the easiest thing to implement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-|-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis said, and consider this for a second... if instead of focusing on making an asynchronous multiplayer (traditional Server-Client, everyone playing at the same time) instead you looked at perhaps something that simply allowed players to Collaborate... i.e. Aerospace Manufacturer(s) [sPH] ... Launch Vehicle Manufacturer(s) [VAB] ... Mission Control (Provides Missions / Objectives / Budgets) and Pilot(s) (who actually Fly the Missions)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen that might be a far more interesting form of Multiplayer that doesn\u0027t require any real alteration of how KSP works at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead you could then have a group of friends who are basically playing together doing each of the individual components, then sharing what they come up with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example someone working on an Space Plane, would be considered to be in a \u0027Simulated Environment\u0027 once they\u0027re done they would then hit the \u0022Ship to Space Agency Button\u0022 that then makes it available to Mission Control for actual Missions they want to set the Pilots.

Some alarm clock and sort of simple autopilot shuld still be there in case you need to sleep\\work\\do other things during some of the maneuvers.
