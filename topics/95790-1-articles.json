The fan runs while playing KSP. I downloaded from the KSP store, not Steam, so Steam is not causing your fan to run- KSP is. As for running KSP without Steam, I\u0027m certain you can do this even if you downloaded from Steam. As a non-Steam user, I can\u0027t help here, but have no doubt someone will answer this quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally wouldn\u0027t be concerned about fan operation, it\u0027s simply your computer doing what it is supposed to, namely keep the circuits cool. Even if your fan dies, the MacBook (I\u0027m assuming all modern computers also..) is smart enough to shut itself down if temperature goes above a set limit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wallygator","CreatedById":97357,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T08:58:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESame here.

I then don\u0027t restart till the fans shutdown completely. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people have suggested that running graphics intensive programs like ksp reduces the life of the GPU but I rather think it\u0027s more likely the fan life which will be affected.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"milter","CreatedById":138600,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T08:51:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running the game on a 13\u0022 macbook pro with i7 processor.
