(discussion about new part in orbital colonies)","CreatedByName":"Presto200","CreatedById":232857,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-15T21:31:54Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Presto200","CreatedById":232857,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-15T21:31:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI as well as many others in the KSP2 community am extremely excited for the Colonies update coming sometime in the coming months. With the\u00A0 sneak peak for orbital colonies post made today (link below), I wanted to point out the different gravity rings and suggest that the dev team considers making them procedural\u00A0 for different size spaceships/stations.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe image below was released with the heating VFX dev chat made before the For Science! update, notice how it is different from the one in the recent leaks for orbital colonies. I wonder if this was a change in design or if this is a whole other part, I\u0027m speculating that the 1st image below is some sort of special resource storage/refinery that would need to feel effects similar to gravity for some reason. I say this because there are no visible windows where as the gravity rings in the 2nd photo has many windows. This also makes me curious about the box-y rotating modules because they seem to have windows and rotate too (this is more obvious in the video from the sneak peak post). Seeing windows there makes me wonder if those are also for kerbals. This seemed odd to me because at the different levels there will be different effects of the artificial gravity due to being at a different radius from the center of the craft it is rotating around.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would also like to suggest that the gravity rings become procedural parts similar to the wings and the radiators(not in the game yet). I hope they make them procedural mostly for ascetics in case I want an extra large or a mini space station, I would like to choose the size of the rings I put on it. This would also play a certain role in the physical aspects of the game. Procedural wings in the game act differently based on the way you design them, the procedural radiators are planned to manage heat differently based on the way you build them as well. Spinning parts will introduce torque into the game, If I want a balanced craft I will need to have an equal amount of mass going at the same speed with the same radius in opposite directions. If these parts were procedural we could have fun problem solving our own crazy designs for these colonies/motherships. I would also suggest if these parts became procedural, that the rings spun to create 1g\u00A0 of artificial gravity no matter the radius (Or you could override it to make the kerbals legs extra strong \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAnyways I feel hyped for rotating parts and wanted to open a thread for this discussion.

It would take the user\u0027s requested radius for the ring, then they figure based on the size how many structural beams and struts would be needed, this is just a design decision they can make on how many structural parts to put in between, then they can find where the structural components should attach to the center by dividing the circumference of the circle by the amount of structural components to get equal spacing. It would also have much less inputs as wings in the game which have wing span, wing angle, root length, root thickness, tip length, tip thickness, tip angle, ect. Procedural gravity rings would only have 4 things at most being radius, thickness (which probably wouldn\u0027t be implemented), structural beams (which also could be just an automatic decision of the game), and speed(which again could be an automatic thing). From there the only complicated thing to calculate would be how it all effects drag. I don\u0027t think it would be extremely hard to calculate especially for a modern computer/game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224373126\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224130\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221710587571\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022224820\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lowi_Sace\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, Lowi_Sace said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like them to also have a gameplay aspect.
