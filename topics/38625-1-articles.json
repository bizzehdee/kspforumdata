Correct me if I\u0027m wrong but these command parts are unmanned command pods in terms of reaction wheel strength. They\u0027re supposed to be used for putting large unmanned craft into space, such as space stations modules, or moving them once in space. For that they need to have similar reaction wheel strengths as the manned pods do, but unmanned and at possibly higher electrical charge consumption than normal probe bodies. Yet the largest of the two has half the reaction wheel strength of the smallest manned pod, meaning it\u0027s utterly incompetent at turning large craft/rockets. Right now, they\u0027re either bad manoeuvrable unmanned guidance units or large, but bad probe bodies with massive electrical consumption.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArcticX9","CreatedById":72020,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T02:27:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just an unmanned feature if I remember correctly, it should probably require assistance from the standalone reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maccollo","CreatedById":72759,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T02:35:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy objection would be to the mass of the reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the regular probe bodies\u002Bone reaction wheel unit has the same mass as 1 man lander can (0.6).

However, I still don\u0027t consider that a reasonable balance. Yes it weighs more than the other probes, and it should since it has more reaction wheels. But the Mk1 lander can has twice the torque AND a flight computer AND life support (ok, so life support costs nothing at this time, but you get the point) AND living space for a kerbal, and it fits all of that in a part with only 20% more mass. The 1.25m part masses the same as the other probe parts, so it having the same torque makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Kerbal","CreatedById":207217,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-28T17:02:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know.
