I\u0027ve created a 4 petal type interstage fairing, by making each act as a separator. I then use an action group to separate each petal simultaneously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe logic works fine, but I want to be able to dock the two stages after separation. At the moment this isn\u0027t possible, because even with ejectionForce set low (1 is shown below, but I\u0027ve tried 0.01 for example) it separates with too much force, often imparting pitch and yaw to the stage I want to dock with (making it excessively difficult).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there any way I can get around this problem without using an additional mod like KW petal adaptor?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode prettyprint lang-html prettyprinted\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022pln\u0022\u003E\tMODULE\n\t{\n\t\tname = ModuleDecouple\n\t\tisOmniDecoupler = true\n\t\tejectionForce = 1\n\t}\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-08T18:15:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2016 06:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Flamin_Squirrel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flamin_Squirrel","CreatedById":164091,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T08:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs anyone able to provide some advice on this one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-11T09:05:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis probably isn\u0027t even related to the decoupler Force, but to the part colliders.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EMake sure that the colliders of the patels don\u0027t interact with each other, and that they also don\u0027t get in the way of the \u0027main \u0027 Interstage the petals are attached to.
