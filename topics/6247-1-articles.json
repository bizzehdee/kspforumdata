I have no idea where to post this as this thread has two meanings , one to show off my craft and the other to ask newbie questions. I have made a heavy plane and so far the basic design is very nice and sortof basic , and so after seeing some people do it , I tried to attach a bomb to the underside of it. I fiddled about with the payload and how to attach it , and found that having a jet fuel tank with nose nozzels and two premade wing jets (the ones you find in the parts menu , not made by me) work well , with the engines starting up in the previous stage and then dropping it meant that I could drop it easily and have it glide to the destination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is , that it has become bottom heavy (As in underside heavy) , and when this is a space plane it ends up leaning against the take off pad tower , even if I throttle up and take off right when it loads. Like I said , this thread has two meanings , one to help me and the other to check out my craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. How would I alter the center of gravity without making the plane or the payloads attributes much?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. How would I go about making a jet engine out of seperate pieces? I have tried but the vagueness of the descriptions and the lack of C7 guides doesn\\\u0027t help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. What is the C7 Hardpoints pack that people have been talking about? I have looked for it but found nothing , has it been amalgamated into another C7 pack?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.
