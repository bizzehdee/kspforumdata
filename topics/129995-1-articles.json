The biggest example of this if using the text in the SPH/VAB to record what your action groups do. I also some time list instructions on how to properly manage a craft. The text editor already exists in the SPH. This becomes more of an issue as your barn of craft builds up, you develop similiar yet different craft or play the game over weeks/months. You might for instance fly some ships with certain action groups/instructions to the Mun, while starting flights to Duna and Jool. You may jump back and forth to the Mun several times then go to your Duna lander after a few weeks of real life then a month later play the game to when your Jool ship is landing. Do you remember all the action groups?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0What I would like is:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n= add a button to all command modules that allows us to see the existing ship info text. It would need a scroll button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n= Optionally give the in mission viewer an editor\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n= Give as a small phsyicless (or physic low) part that allows additional text fields. For example putting one on near your mining gear to remind you all the steps to configure the ship and another near the rockets for your checklist for launching off the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T10:57:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess you are suggesting \u0027pop up\u0027 windows that give the ship info text and list the action groups for that vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, I think that would be a very useful feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Matt77","CreatedById":69015,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-16T20:45:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.
