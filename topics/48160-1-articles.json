I hope Sal managed to answer your question. When I first when to Duna at the dawn of .18, my first landing on another planet, I essentially packed a bunch (8) nuclear engines in an asparagus staging system behind the tiny unmanned lander. Once you get a general idea of dV changes you can pretty much eyeball it. Don\u0027t bother with calculations if you don\u0027t have the exact formulas: I once made a probe for laythe with 8k m/s dV in orbit. I actually ran all the numbers with pen and paper and thought I just had ~2k m/s. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
