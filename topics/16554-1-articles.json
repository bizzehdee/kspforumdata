The problem comes first when I try to circularize my orbit. I just CAN\u0027T get her to point prograde, or to point pro-grade reliably without giving some throttle on the main engines. Usually, at this point I have my lander stage, and my injection stage (4 full Large fuel tanks, 1 large LFE, and 4 radial engines) up there. The problem with giving throttle to the main engines to maneuver is that it also completely messes up my orbital paths. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnwards, when it comes time to do an injection burn to either Mun or Minmus, I have the same problem, with the additional problem of timing. By the time I get the craft lined up and ready to fire for injection, I almost always miss my window. I know, I should start earlier, but it seriously is taking 5-10 minutes to wrestle the craft into orienting prograde, and without the main boosters, it\u0027s not gonna happen. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was considering using one of the larger, half-LFE\u0027s as my injection engine of choice, due to their more efficient vacuum operation, larger gimball range, and less amount of thrust, but I am still using the injection stage to also circularize my orbit, so I still need a decent amount of thrust for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts or ideas on this dilemma?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-10T16:55:45Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2012 04:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Wild Card\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ECorrect some engine terminology....\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T17:01:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a tricky one that\u0027s for certain, I try to get a slight rotation well in advance of when I need it, rather than try to overload the craft with RCS, it\u0027s not a perfect method though, the large pod and engines are just so heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe extra SAS would do it but I have not yet experimented with them enough to know, I tend to rely on the capsules SAS which is barely adequate, and a tiny bit of main engine thrust just as you have been doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally, RCS should do the job but it\u0027s going to use a lot of gas unless you take it slow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrMadGameplay","CreatedById":20225,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T17:12:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with sal_vager it can be tricky and I usually just use a tiny bit thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clouds","CreatedById":32610,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-11T06:36:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust one full large fuel tank?

For your initial orbital circularization (pre-AP), as long as you stay pointing 90o, firing the engine at almost any positive or slightly negative pitch angle will still be pushing you the direction you want to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you don\u0027t need to fire the engine the whole time. Use the lowest throttle setting to get some rotation started, then shut down and don\u0027t burn again until you need to stop the rotation. MechJeb is an incredible help for this, since it will always be pushing in exactly the right direction while you have the engine burning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird, anything you do with big rocket is going to be slow, so start early. Heck, if you know you\u0027re going to need to fire retro at some point in your orbit, you can get yourself pointing prograde half an orbit early, which will have you pointing the right direction when the time comes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
