It would work more or less like the sticker mods out there, but the models would also have normal maps. These parts would be physicsless and non-functional, just cool looking little details such as tank raceways and other little pipes and bumps. Ideally these would be able to be attached to parts of various sizes and shapes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan anyone with more knowledge say whether or not this idea is actually possible in KSP?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tyko","CreatedById":164179,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-12T22:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCool idea.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can make parts physicsless, that\u0027s easy. I\u0027m not sure if you can set something to zero mass, but if not, you could go with .001.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne possible\u00A0issue would be an increase to number of parts and slowing game performance. Another way you could do greebles that wouldn\u0027t be quite as flexible, but would solve the parts problem - you could build a compound part\u00A0that references the Squad base model\u00A0(this is allowed AFAIK) and adds your greeble models into the same part using offset values.
