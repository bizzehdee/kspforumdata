I have essentially no experience going in, so the development of my skills as a modeler, texture artist, and coder is something we can share together.

Then you have the thrust transform inside the colision mesh (Which stops any thrust actually being created, thanks to the way unity works.), and voila, you have a smoke part. Making the smoke will be easy, unless you want it to be coloured, in which case you will have to make your own FX and learn to use the new FX system, at which point it becomes very hard.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noctrian","CreatedById":92320,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-04T11:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, this really helps, I had almost given up on the project, for now it will be stock smoke, later I will try the FX system.
