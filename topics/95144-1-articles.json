The Advanced Jet Engines mod already fixes this for jets, but rockets still have the issue. the correct model of rocket thrust when fully simplified is... thrust=mass flow rate*exit velocity\u002Bexit area*(exit pressure-ambient pressure), when you divide this value by the mass flow rate you get the equivalent exit velocity which when divided by the gravitational acceleration at the surface of earth which is 9.81 m/s gives you the Isp\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"somnambulist","CreatedById":62108,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-31T17:38:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think KIDS or Real Fuels will do what you want\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52882-0-90-Kerbal-Isp-Difficulty-Scaler-v1-4-2-12-16-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/52882-0-90-Kerbal-Isp-Difficulty-Scaler-v1-4-2-12-16-14\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64118-0-90-Real-Fuels-v8-3-Dec-20-14\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64118-0-90-Real-Fuels-v8-3-Dec-20-14\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
