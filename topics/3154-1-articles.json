I\\\u0027ve done some .cfg editing, so I think it might be easier to just post the /Parts/ folder (zipped) along with the .craft file. For those of you who don\\\u0027t know, you should rename your /Parts/ folder before copying mine in, to avoid problems. Pictures and .craft are attached, parts soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight characteristics: decently stable during most launches, but extremely wobbly on the pad. You\\\u0027ll want to launch right away, ideally before the rocket loads, and hit the SAS and full throttle as well. This will ensure upward launch. RCS should be activated at ~28km or so. Also, the bottom stage likes to cause problems upon jettison. Look out for crazy spinning due to SAS confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-23T02:38:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\\\u0027s the link to the /Parts/ folder you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://db.tt/rsqI8cxx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://db.tt/rsqI8cxx\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-23T15:39:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elooks like a Delta IV/Falcon Heavy\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-24T00:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\\\u0027s similar, yeah.
