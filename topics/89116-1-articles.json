Anyway:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I am a huge fan of KSP and even though it is in early access, still love it dearly! I know that there are many plans for KSP, but because they are focusing on completing the career aspect of it, we don\u0027t see too many, well... aesthetics. Don\u0027t get me wrong, though, the game is very aesthetically pleasing (Who doesn\u0027t want to see a huge building crumble into flames after you crash into it!), but there aren\u0027t as many changes in the game other than career right now. Basically, I\u0027m looking for a mod that can allow you to chose where you want to have your KSC located from a number of predetermined locations, and allow you to have multiple KSC\u0027s under someone else\u0027s control (which can go along with some multiplayer mods). There is a mod (\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/40374-WIP-KerbTown-v0-13-Beta-Place-static-buildings-cities-launch-sites-more!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbTown\u003C/a\u003E or something) that lets you place static objects in your world, but to me, that\u0027s not what I\u0027m thinking of. I\u0027m thinking of possibly duplicating the terrain around the KSC, the KSC itself, and each function, view, and destructibility script of the KSC and copying it over to a different location. (Not sure if its possible, but worth a try... maybe) Even if the new KSC\u0027s are just giving me an excuse not to destroy my own KSC, I still would like to see this implemented, whether in the game itself or in a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Thanks for reading and let me know what you think about this mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-MNG \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Helix935","CreatedById":71312,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T16:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-Mission-Controller-2-%28Version-1-08-02%29-%28KSP-25%29-%28HotFix-Texture-Oct-30%29?highlight=mission\u002Bcontroller\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/43645-Mission-Controller-2-%28Version-1-08-02%29-%28KSP-25%29-%28HotFix-Texture-Oct-30%29?highlight=mission\u002Bcontroller\u003C/a\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Malah","CreatedById":96644,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-01T17:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55145\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReal Solar System\u003C/a\u003E you can choose where the KSC is placed (I don\u0027t know if \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/90088\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbol 6.4x\u003C/a\u003E do that too).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd in WIP, you can try \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/93699\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Konstructs\u003C/a\u003E with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/82785\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbinSide\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
