However, I often come across scenarios while building things that I want to make a truss structure (for the weight, looks, etc) and just wanting a single part that would fit in that space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, I needed to go from a 1.25m to 3.125m stack in a flat adapter, but my options for trusses were:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nUse a Procedural Fairing truss base, which at 3.125m bottom radius, doesn\u0027t fit the 1.25m stack, as well as lagging my game with the fairing preview lines\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUse multiple skeletal adaptors from Near Future Construction, which is 2 parts and is too long vertically for my needed use.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nKitbash one with PP structural parts and structs, which is really, really part heavy for what should be a single part.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAll three options aren\u0027t ideal, which is why I\u0027m asking if such a mod (or mod for Procedural Parts) for trusses exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nED: I\u0027ve since made a feature request on their Github, let\u0027s see what happens:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-RO/ProceduralParts/issues/321\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/ProceduralParts/issues/321\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nED2: It seems they have merged an existing pull request for trusses:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022213573\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5781853330\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/204080-18-procedural-parts/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=4155954\u0026amp;embedComment=4155954\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-07-18T21:05:12Z\u0022 title=\u002207/18/2022 09:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 18, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by bigyihsuan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
