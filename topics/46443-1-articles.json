Don\u0027t get me wrong, I\u0027ve always enjoyed Edgar Rice Kerman\u0027s stories, where the veteran falls asleep on Kerbin and wakes up on Erf, and ends up uniting the white, black, red and yellow humanoids to defend themselves against fearsome, warlike, slave-trading quadruped beasts called \u0022kittens\u0022. Very entertaining escapism, but that\u0027s science \u003Cem\u003Efiction\u003C/em\u003E.

Of course what we tell the public is it\u0027s all about \u0022humanoids\u0022. Fact is, we don\u0027t know what they are. But we have captured one of their \u0022beasts\u0022 from a crash 52 years ago. We have labeled them \u0022K-9\u0022 and all we know is that if these \u0022beasts\u0022 are allowed into our solar system and bread we will become snacks for the K-9 race. This can\u0027t be allowed to happen. We are not drumming up budget support, we are clearly 100% black budget (I.E. we are printing the money) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis mission is purely about tracking. Dres PS-1 mission is all about putting some eyes and ears in a location so that we can see them coming in a place they would never look. We have to date never found anything on Dres that would indicate a landing there by the \u0022humanoids\u0022. No ships, no nothing. So either they are underground on Dres or... they don\u0027t even worry about landing on this piss ant planet. Either way, we need the base there.
