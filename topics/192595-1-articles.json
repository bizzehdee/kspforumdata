air-breathing nuclear-turbojets are very impractical and ineffective because air isn\u0027t a particularly good conductor of heat.\u00A0 This means the heat exchanger has to have increased surface area, and thus be heavier.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMore effective variants use a wet system where a coolant heated by the heat exchanger is injected into the airstream.\u00A0 Typical coolants would be methanol, liquid CO2, Liquid Helium or Liquid Hydrogen.\u00A0 The combustion of the coolant is minimal and not a real source of expansion compared to the raw heating power of this setup.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven water can be used in this manner, but it isn\u0027t the most effective option.\u00A0 It\u0027s thermal properties and boiling properties pale in comparison to methanol, which is the least effective coolant I mentioned.\u00A0 As of where water is used in the design, it is usually used as a stage 1 coolant to move heat from the reactor core to the heat exchanger, which would be water or heavy water in a traditional design, although newer reactor designs small enough for this purpose move to molten salt or other materials less prone to boil-off.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere were experiments with this sort of thing in the 60s and 70s, but none of them were deemed practical, and most of them exceeded the radiation leakage level for regular usage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHonestly, if air-breathing nuclear-turbojets were determined a viable option, there would be no stopping the US Military from using them for Operation Chrome Dome in the early 70s.\u00A0 No amount of political pressure would outweigh the option to have bomber that only has to land to take on food and water supplies for it\u0027s
