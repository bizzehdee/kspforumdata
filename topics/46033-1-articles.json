Continue to add prograde juice until your orbit touches the muns orbit. If you don\u0027t get an encounter with the mun... no worries. just grab the center of the node and slide it around on your orbit until you get one! once you get an encounter just warp to the Pe you will get from the mun and burn retrograde until you get a capture orbit.

The 45 degree magic number does NOT apply for transfer between two seperate orbiting bodies. (Planet to Planet or Moon to Moon). That involves Phase Angles, and that\u0027s an entirely different ball game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, the answer to the universe isn\u0027t 42.
