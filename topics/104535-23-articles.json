Just a docking washer at the base of the wheels right? Now if you want proper steering control yes you will absolutely need KOS to mix the controls properly to turn while driving.

Their mass has to be low to avoid over-stressing the physics joint, but this also means they overheat fairly quickly via conduction of heat from nearby larger parts with a lot of thermal energy in them.\n\nTangentially, the mass of the robotic parts could actually be reduced. In my (rather extensive) testing and building with IR parts it seems to me that that mass is, in fact, not a signficant factor with respect to the wobbliness of the internal physics joint. Indeed, I have been able to pin a lot of the issues I\u0027ve had with wobbliness on mech legs down to the mass of the rest of the ship and, oddly, ground physics. Parts directly touching the ground behave extremely strangely, sliding around on their part connections and so on. Landing gear or wheels make the strangeness completely disappear. \n\nThe absolute strength of the robotic joint itself is indeed low relative to the weight of most parts, but I\u0027ve overcome that problem by making my mech parts weigh almost nothing... the leg sections are 0.05 each, the arms are 0.1 each, etc. This actually makes the two ankle joints per foot the heaviest part of the leg, giving them a high momentum relative to the rest of the craft and causing it to shake around a little bit during the higher speed movements."}]}
