This Mod adds new parts to build vessels everywhere!\n\n![fn0gqpZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fn0gqpZ.jpg)\n\n**[imgur](http://imgur.com/a/fApQ1)** (Old, new album in progress)\n\nThis pack contains converters like Furnaces, 3D-Printers and a Chemical Reactor to produce RocketParts from Ore or MetalOre. The RocketParts can be used by Kerbals to assemble new vessels anywhere. Launchpads or Survey-parts are used for the construction of new vessels and are also included in this pack (requires Extraplanetary Launchpads mod that is not bundled with this pack). A wide variaty of storage tanks comes with this pack to keep all the precious resources safe. If the recovery of vessel is too much effort, it can be recycled and converted to RocketParts again.\n\n**Download from [Spacedock](http://spacedock.info/mod/308/Keridian%20Dynamics%20-%20Vessel%20Assembly)**\n\n**Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/EleusisLaArwall/KeridianDynamics-VesselAssembly/releases)**\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n- [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219)\n\n**Dependencies for full functionality** (I consider them dependencies but you don\u0027t need them to make the parts show up in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E)**:**\n\n- [ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/59545)\n- [Kerbal Inventory System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/149848-122-kerbal-inventory-system-kis-v141/)\n- [Kerbal Attachment System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142594-12-kerbal-attachment-system-kas-v062/)\n- [Interstellar Fuel Switch](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/106243-11interstellar-fuel-switch-120-updated-16-4-2016/) or [Firespitter](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/22583-firespitter-propeller-plane-and-helicopter-parts-v71-may-5th-for-ksp-10/)\n- [JSI Advanced Transparant Pods](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138433-113-jsi-advanced-transparent-pods-v0170-previously-part-of-rasterpropmonitor-22nd-june-2016/)\n\n**Supported / recommended:**\n\n- [OSE Workshop](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97537-11-ose-workshop-kis-addon-v0130-20160426/)\n\n![ctt_small.png](http://www.areadenialgames.com/ksp/ctt_small.png)~~https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/1035/Vessel%20Assembly~~ \n\n**Installation:**\n\n1.

(If both are NOT installed, two tanks for RocketParts and two tanks for Metal are available.)\n\n2016-05-01 - PECUNIA PER KERBULUS - v0.6.1  \n\n    -Reexported models with Unity 5 and PartTools 1.1.  \n\n    -New Company Motto: PECUNIA PER KERBULUS. (Thanks to DaniDE for translation!)  \n\n    -Reworked Logo and Flags.  \n\n    -Used \u0022Icon\\_Hidden\u0022 tag. (Thanks to Badsector for the hint!)  \n\n    -Added ExperimentalSection (needs \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E).  \n\n    -New experimental part: KD-Fundament. (Thanks to colmo for the suggestion!)  \n\n    -New experimental part: KD-LaunchSite.  \n\n    -New experimental part: KD-SledgeHammer \u0022Susie\u0022.\n\n2016-04-16 - Recycling - v0.6  \n\n    -Added Interstellar Fuel Switch dependency. (Tank names have changed, be careful with savegames!)  \n\n    -Reworked models. (Colliders have not changed.)  \n\n    -Added Normal maps.  \n\n    -Added Emissive maps.  \n\n    -Added new animations.  \n\n    -Reworked Furnace behavior. No more seperate heating needed.  \n\n    -Furnace needs much less EC but produces more heat.  \n\n    -New part: KD-Recycler. (Roll-animation and ExRecycler need to be activated seperately)  \n\n    -Updated CTT-compatibility.\n\n2016-02-27 - 2016 update - v0.5  \n\n    -Reworked tanks. (Names have changed, so be carefull with savegames!)  \n\n    -Changed RoverPads to TopPad and SidePad. (Names have changed, so be carefull with savegames!)  \n\n    -New mesh-colliders for all parts (be carefull with savegames!).  \n\n    -Toggleable Spawn Marker for all Pads added. A vessel from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E will point in the direction of the arrowtip. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E vessels will still point upwards.  \n\n    -KD-OrbitalPad, KD-SidePad, KD-TopPad and all tanks now share the same texture (KD-OrbitalPad.dds).  \n\n    -Added thermal properties to KD-Pad and KD-OrbitalPad to prevent overheating-explosions during vessel-launch (might be exploitable ...).  \n\n    -Added thermal curves to KD-Furnace and KD-3D-Printer.  \n\n    -The Furnace needs to heat up before Metal can be extracted. CoreTemperature must at least reach 1800 K to start the extraction! Heating needs a lot of ElectricCharge. Once the extraction has started the heater can be turned off.  \n\n    -The 3D-Printer needs 20 ElectricCharge instead of 10. It needs RoomTemperature to operate (300 K). Heat production is rather low.  \n\n    -Some minor model and texture changes.  \n\n    -Added 512x512 textures to Customisation.  \n\n    -Added \u0022KD-Example Craft.craft\u0022 to Customisation.  \n\n    -Updated CTT-compatibility.\n\n2015-08-23 - License update - v0.4  \n\n    -License changed to CC-BY-SA 4.0 International  \n\n    -New experimental parts: KD-RoverPad \u0026 KD-RoverPad2  \n\n    -KD-Furnace: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E -0.1 down  \n\n    -KD-Pad: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E -0.87 down  \n\n    -KD-OrbitalPad: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E -0.47 down  \n\n    -Moved \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E-patches for EL into one config. (Delete old versions before updating!)\n\n2015-08-10 - Orbital Assembly - v0.3  \n\n    -New part:    - KD-OrbitalPad  \n\n    -KD-Pad fixes:     - Now transparent in Editor when not attached.  \n\n            - Model and texture refined.  \n\n            - Center of mass adjusted.  \n\n    -KD-3D-Printer:    - Model and texture refined (a little).  \n\n    -Added support for AVC.\n\n2015-08-03 - Hotfix - v0.2  \n\n    -Fixed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E-config for MetalOreFurnace and MetallicOreFurnace.  \n\n    -Reconverted textures to DDS.\n\n2015-07-27 - Initial Release - v0.1  \n\n    -New part: KD-Furnace  \n\n    -New part: KD-3D-Printer  \n\n    -New part: KD-Pad  \n\n    -New part: KD-TankHex1-Metal  \n\n    -New part: KD-TankHex1-RocketParts  \n\n    -New part: KD-TankHex2-Metal  \n\n    -New part: KD-TankHex2-RocketParts\n\n**Notes:**\n\nThis project is under development. I\u0027m trying to learn blender/gimp/unity and this is what I\u0027ve got so far. These are my first parts and I don\u0027t have much experince so any feedback, ideas, tutorials, etc is very welcome!

I want to use stock Ore to make it as simple as possible (MetalOre would at least require another drill or a patch for stock-drill and another storage-tank). There is a MM-patch included that replaces Ore with MetalOre for the Furnace but it\u0027s even less balanced. \n\nI\u0027m open for any balance suggestions because I have no experince with that.
