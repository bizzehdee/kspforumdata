The idea is to fill it with missile/gun racks so you can close it off when doing hypersonic speeds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next step is to fill that bay full of ordinance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the craft file for anyone who wants to give it a go. It\u0027s completely stock, although I did use Kerbal Joint Reinforcement to keep the part count down so you may need to add some extra struts to keep it from wobbling around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/78894495/Banshee.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gag09","CreatedById":57494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T06:50:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am glad i was an inspiration for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
