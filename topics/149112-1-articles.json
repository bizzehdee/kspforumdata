A small engine, cheap compared to the others, perhaps heavier too. Higher impact tolerance (due to ap0r\u0027s decision to go for thicker materials for a higher safety margin at the expense of a heavier engine) would potentially make it useful for landers. Maybe if it was also tuned for atmospheric use (same as the actual one) it could find a role as a 0.625 atmospheric launch/lander engine (which KSP doesn\u0027t really have).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jonfliesgoats","CreatedById":168077,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-06T05:52:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like real life projects inspired and rewarded by KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DrLicor","CreatedById":165712,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-06T06:32:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnly problem is that he is in real life, and you are playing in KSP with liquid fuel and oxidizer..
