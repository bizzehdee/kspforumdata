I wanted a Steam card, but I didn\u0027t expect that much! But that\u0027s good, because what I was really itching for on Steam was Civ 6. Right now it\u0027s at only 10% off for $72 which is still a little steep. Civ 5 is 75% off, a mere $8.24, but Civ 6 is such a huge upgrade in gameplay, with multi-tile cities and such. But now I\u0027m reading the reviews and it seems the AI diplomacy needs work, to put it mildly. So I\u0027m not really sure what to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnybody have any recommendations on what to do with my Steam windfall? I don\u0027t have much on Steam, not even KSP, My library consists of Cities: Skylines and SW:BF2. The only Civ game I\u0027ve played is Civ 4\u00A0(full BTS version) and put many hours into it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I only buy Civ5, then that\u0027s a lot of dough left in the wallet.
