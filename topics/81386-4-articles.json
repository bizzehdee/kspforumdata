The unique selling point is supposed to be the higher aISP than other engines, but if you do that then it just makes the other engines not worth using on lower stages because they will always be worse. So you have to tread a really fine line between rendering everything else useless for lower stages, and making the aerospike itself useless because it doesn\u0027t fill it\u0027s own niche. I like to think the Cutter is balanced by having it only really be the best choice below 10km altitude on Kerbin, meaning you\u0027ll want to drop them for a T30/T45 if your stage goes above that. Obviously for asparagus staging it is always going to be very good because you drop outer stages quickly, but that\u0027s an issue that stems from asparagus staging itself being very good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did consider just cutting the Cutter completely before v10 was released because of how hard to balance it is, as well as it not really filling any niche. But I didn\u0027t see that going down very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock aerospike I feel is in a bit of a weird place.

Engine thrust is directly dependent on backpressure, so engines will always be much more efficient in vacuum than in atmosphere, and further bell nozzles are designed for a specific altitude (i.e. pressure), below or above which they will be less than optimally-efficient-at-that-pressure. Altitude-compensating nozzles (aerospikes) avoid this second type of loss, but not the first (and are never as efficient as an optimal bell at its design altitude).

Isp is a measure of \u0022thrust per weight unit of fuel per second.\u0022 400s Isp means 1lb of fuel will provide 400lbf of thrust. In real life, turbopumps don\u0027t magically run twice as fast at sea level (pumping more fuel to maintain thrust constant); instead, fuel flow is constant, and thrust varies with Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
