I know not everyone these days has a joystick with a dedicated throttle..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eeg.. I set my joystick throttle full way forward.. which controls the rover wheels\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehaving no battery.. they transmit the generated power.. when voltage increases, they turn.. less RPM on the alternator means less torque to the wheels.. more RPM means more torque.... in a stunning display of how squad seemingly modeled powered-underpowered systems.. unexpectedly. it works great\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe direction is easily reversed by sliding my joystick throttle backwards.. then repeating the process\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI seek though a modification thats currently beyond my means.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea popup window similar to mechjeb etc with 3 settings.. forward, reverse and neutral.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat I envision would control the rover wheels.. so that then the generators can be used and transmission energised without\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esomeone having to use a hardware throttle or hold the relevent forward key etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif anyones got any ideas i\u0027d love to hear it.. heres also a crude video.. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Emy system is currently not 100% being a former server with minimal ram so I had to downgrade the video..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_8kAI0dd-oQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eapologies for the random horn blasts at times... the horns are modified LV type engines.. that use the horn sound for shutdown and startup..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eregretably I didnt fix the heat tollerence.. and they do have a habit of exploding when the locomotives in full warcry battling a hill as the do follow the \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egeneral throttle setting if not hit again to shutdown to prevent explosion \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(apologies for the long video that repeats, I discovered I trimmed it wrong. .but you get the idea \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T01:59:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 01:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overland\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
