I know not everyone these days has a joystick with a dedicated throttle..\n\neg.. I set my joystick throttle full way forward.. which controls the rover wheels\n\nhaving no battery.. they transmit the generated power.. when voltage increases, they turn.. less RPM on the alternator means less torque to the wheels.. more RPM means more torque.... in a stunning display of how squad seemingly modeled powered-underpowered systems.. unexpectedly. it works great\n\nthe direction is easily reversed by sliding my joystick throttle backwards.. then repeating the process\n\nI seek though a modification thats currently beyond my means.. \n\na popup window similar to mechjeb etc with 3 settings.. forward, reverse and neutral.. \n\nthat I envision would control the rover wheels.. so that then the generators can be used and transmission energised without\n\nsomeone having to use a hardware throttle or hold the relevent forward key etc\n\nif anyones got any ideas i\u0027d love to hear it.. heres also a crude video.. \n\nmy system is currently not 100% being a former server with minimal ram so I had to downgrade the video..\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_8kAI0dd-oQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\napologies for the random horn blasts at times... the horns are modified LV type engines.. that use the horn sound for shutdown and startup..\n\nregretably I didnt fix the heat tollerence.. and they do have a habit of exploding when the locomotives in full warcry battling a hill as the do follow the \n\ngeneral throttle setting if not hit again to shutdown to prevent explosion ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(apologies for the long video that repeats, I discovered I trimmed it wrong. .but you get the idea ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-22T01:59:03Z\u0022 title=\u002202/22/2015 01:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Overland**"}]}
