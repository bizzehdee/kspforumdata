We are working hard to try and get things wrapped up here for release, but every time we get close we realize that we are missing something. For example, the other day, it was noticed that the KIS wrench cannot attach items to nodes. This is a problem, as SEP *requires* node attachment for the power conduits to look right (they would theoretically work, just wouldn\u0027t actually line up with the plugs), and the KIS electric screwdriver unlocks far too late in the tech tree. So on the train home, I had to whip together this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zkMRtcz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022zkMRtcz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe SEP Port Attachment Tool allows you to attach parts to nodes, but not surface attach.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s somewhat hard because we\u0027re trying to get the mod to a place where it is \u0027feature complete\u0027 enough to release. At the end of the day, it\u0027s going to come down to having enough experiments in the first release that the mod feels full. Right now, we have four. Is that enough? Personally, with all the new requirements for setting up a SEP, only having a couple experiments to set up seems like it isn\u0027t worth the return on investment. So we might take the time to add a couple more before release.

Obviously the original ALSEP, being intended for the moon, didn\u0027t have an atmospheric component, but we\u0027d like to give people stuff to do on atmospheric bodies as well. Some ideas that have been tossed around are weather station components, for example. But for the most part, the canon ALSEP parts are a priority. Including the mortar \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI was planning on making a rack to carry the pieces. The intent is to allow a decent sized setup ride just in the seat inventories of the lander can, but a larger setup would need additional storage. The current KIS containers are pretty big, so we\u0027d include some lower profile ones, probably resembling the appearance of the real ALSEP racks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-19T03:57:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4rHeW/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs mentioned previously, there are several ways to provide power for your Surface Experiment Package. The easiest is an RTG - one part, and it\u0027s what the real guys did. But the RTG unlocks late in the tech tree. Early on, you\u0027ll want to use solar panels, or even large amounts of batteries. Intrepid players might connect their spacecraft to the system in order to provide power, but bear in mind the system is meant to provide data after you head home!\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0027s an album of me setting up a full solar-powered SEP. Of note, and this didn\u0027t occur to me until the last second, but you need to bring both the KIS wrench and the SEP screwdriver to set up a SEP, and you\u0027ll need to switch between them constantly.

I don\u0027t believe we have anything planned that would provide science over time. With that said, most of the ALSEP stuff transmitted back after the astronauts left - heck, most of the experiments didn\u0027t even run until after the ascent stage had left, and some of the more, ah, explosive experiments weren\u0027t conducted until the CSM was well on its way home, for fear of the ejecta reaching up to the orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\nCurrently, we are planning on requiring all the experiments to be activated by Kerbals. That is a hard requirement, and mostly because, from a gameplay point of view, we don\u0027t want the experiments to work at all on, say, an autonomous craft. Like I said before, that is not how most of the real experiments worked. On the other hand, most of the experiments worked for a month tops before their electronics stopped working.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you\u0027re interested in learning about the real Apollo Lunar Scientific Experiments Package, these two web pages have been an invaluable resource, though I can\u0027t 100% vouch for their accuracy. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/ALSEP/hl_alsep.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe first is an online \u0027essay\u0027 on the ALSEP project\u003C/a\u003E, and provides a lot of great info on things like the objectives of the missions, as well as scientific equipment that was brought but not considered part of the ALSEP.
