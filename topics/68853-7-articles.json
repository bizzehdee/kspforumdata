Sucks to be them. I am not a fan of major mod changes that rename or remove parts like that, but oh well I can\u0027t change the way he\u0027s making his mod and I guess that\u0027s what we get for using a Beta release mod in an Alpha release game.\u003Cp\u003EMy only suggestion is to make a new part file that has that part\u0027s name by using some other engine for the model. Apparently my install is already unusable without me going back to and making sure things I have already downloaded are always up to date all the time, which will be too much work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did say this was a project that\u0027s not for the faint of heart. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s fixable, but we\u0027re getting into territory now that requires even more knowledge about how KSP works if you want to continue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk understood.
