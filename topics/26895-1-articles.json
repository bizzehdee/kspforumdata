Gravitoelectromagnetic toriods are the concept behind Alcurrumbie drives, and a group at nasa, specifically Harold White and his group, are working on a method of using high-density magnetic fields to \u0027Pinch\u0027 space-time to create a spacial-temporal bubble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that matter cannot exceed the speed of light, right? Well, the bubble described would surround and act as a forcefield around the generator, removing the matter from the universe (effectively), allowing the mass-less bubble to accelerate at insane speeds, and possibly exceed the lightspeed barrier. Your ship could pass through a sun and never feel it. You could accelerate at 100g and not notice a change from freefall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownside- Well, if the bubble hits anything, it carries it along at speed, and there seems to be no limit on how much energy the material that is hit by the bubble can absorb, so when you throttle down (turn off the bubble), any matter that hit the bubble is blasted into, well, atoms moving at near-lightspeed away from your ship. (solar systems would vanish- oops) Also it requires alot of energy, but that amount of energy is being lowered ever day.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
