Meaning that you can put weapons on the surface, and shoot down vessels in low orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo here\u0027s the challenge:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStage 0 - Prepare:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBuild a series of fortresses on Minmus, heavily armored structures with massive guns. These are your primary surface structures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen deploy dozens, maybe even hundreds of smaller gun turrets around the surface. These could be anything from mini-forts with flak cannons, to tiny probe cores with a .50 cal turret that can be deployed from a rover en masse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve completed the construction of your surface defenses, put a few defensive stations in orbit (I would recommend lasers for this, as guns could de-orbit the structure with their recoil.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLeave a few tanks and gunships near the forts, you\u0027ll need them later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, build a few colonies on the surface. At the center of each colony is your flag. Remember to put defenses around the colony.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce your defenses are complete, send the save file to a friend.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStage 1 - Attack:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour friend must then assemble their assault force, be it a single ship, or a massive fleet. Also, bring some landable turrets and drop pods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen bring the fleet to Minmus, and engage the defenses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf possible, destroy the turrets protecting a colony, then replace the flag with one of your own, capturing it. You may repeat this step however many times you want until your forces are destroyed. Leave a turret or two at each captured colony to defend it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce your friend has done as much damage as they can with the forces they brought, the save file is returned to you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStage 2 - Repair and prepare for next attack:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerform repairs using the resources available on the surface. Use your tanks and gunships to liberate the colonies that have been captured.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdjust the defenses however you wish. But you can\u0027t use anything you don\u0027t already have on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThen Repeat from Stage 1.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see this game would be rather time-consuming, but incredibly fun. Especially if you and your partner record footage of your turns and share them, so you can see how it went.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe defender must survive for as many turns as possible. The attacker must conquer Minmus in as few turns as possible. If the attacker fails to conquer the whole moon after ten tries, the defender wins.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe attacker may use \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003EBurn Together\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E to assemble fleets.
