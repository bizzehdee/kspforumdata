The current panel output in undefined units is replaced with the output in kW from that, so the unit for the engine consumption has to be kW too. I\u0027ll make the engine consume more energy to keep up with the higher output of the new solar panels, but I\u0027d like to know what you guys think about making them use fuel too like normal ion engines, so I added a little poll to this thread.\n\nBTW, the battery capacity whould be in kilowattseconds then, right?

Currently I use your mod to make generators that burn fuel to create the energy for the ion engines, which simulates using ion engine fuel. But if I have RTGs or solar panels the engines work even if the generator runs out of fuel, so an option to use a small amount of fuel in the ion engine would be nice. \n\nAlso I\u0027d love to be able to edit a part.cfg to make a part use a small amount of energy per second. Even if you couldn\u0027t stop the part from working when energy runs out, it would still simulate energy drain and stop other parts (like the ion engines) from having unlimited power.
