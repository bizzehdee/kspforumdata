Now I am trying to fix that mistake and attach a pure battery module. I\u0027ve lost track of how many failed attempts I\u0027ve had. A big thing is that when I did the stock Docking Tutorial, I could rotate my craft at a decent rate without activating any of my thrusters. With mine that\u0027s not the case, so I\u0027m wasting fuel and knocking myself off course just rotating. My theory is that my craft is disproportionately long to its diameter so I could either cut back on some of my batteries (probably don\u0027t need as much as I have anyway) or try to make the craft wider. There\u0027s probably also a more efficient design for a rocket than I have.
