The cores could be tied with the Tech tree so that the better probe core you have the more Mits of data it can hold for more or less complicated maneuvers. Also Kerbals could be trained with new Equipment unlocked from the Tech tree and learn how to pilot or accomplish Planned commands from mission control.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
