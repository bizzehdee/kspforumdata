The best way to be one is in my opinion, try and break the game. Doing things that you wouldn\u0027t normally do (so long as you aren\u0027t messing with code or such, if you want to actually test, play stock only. If you want to play, do mods). Doing things out of the ordinary is probably the best way to bugtest or doing simple things through complication. Even if it seems weird to try and do that, remember that someone on Earth is trying something similar or will in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-14T04:53:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rassa Farlander\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Rassa Farlander\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow do I be a better Alpha Tester for KSP?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EReport bugs in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/58-Support-Bugs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESupport \u0026amp; Bugs\u003C/a\u003E forum.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMake suggestions in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/59-Suggestions-and-Development-Discussion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESuggestions and Development Discussion\u003C/a\u003E forum.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDon\u0027t crap up \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forumdisplay.php/33-General-KSP-Discussion\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EGeneral KSP Discussion\u003C/a\u003E with whine threads.\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kyarao","CreatedById":80722,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T04:02:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlpha stage of game development is for pumping lots of features into the game very quickly, as well as improving features that are already in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeta should pretty much be the full game\u002Btons of bugs and not very optimized.
