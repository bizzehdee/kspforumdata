I understand why it would be such a problem of getting the weather to have an effect on launching rockets. I agree with celem that with all the water on Kerbin, you would think there would eventually be some weather. Besides, I think it would enhance the launching experience having the rockets dodging the clouds. Especially if the rockets blow up in the middle of the clouds and all you see is a bright light piercing the clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a thought.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
