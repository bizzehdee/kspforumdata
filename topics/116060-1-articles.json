I\u0027d like to install a couple of more mods that I\u0027d predict to be memory heavy and wanna see if the Force OpenGL trick might allow it.\n\nI have read around various \u0027tings on t\u0027interwebs about how to monitor the RAM usage of a process and the majority answer seems to be a windows program called \u0022perfmon\u0022. I\u0027ve had a poke at it but its rather complicated and has about 20 different variables that can be monitored for memory use alone . . . . I don\u0027t have the first clue which one to pick. (Edit: Ok, after some playing about it seems \u0022Working Set (Private)\u0022 is the one reported by task manager so I\u0027m guessing is the one to log with Perfmon) \n\nSo how do people do it?\n\nIdeally I\u0027d like just a nice little idiot proof stand alone utility.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-16T11:08:32Z\u0022 title=\u002207/16/2015 11:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bishop149**"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T10:58:12Z","Content":"2 main ways:\n\n1) If you have 2 monitors, just load up Task Manager and put it on your second monitor. Sort by memory usage. KSP should be at the top of the list (if it\u0027s not, I suggest closing whatever is). When it gets to 3.4 or so, close it and restart.\n\n2) If you don\u0027t mind installing mods, install a mod to display it on the screen. I can\u0027t find the one I used (My Google Fu is weak today) back when I was having memory issues, but there are a couple.\n\nNote: You really shouldn\u0027t have to do this anymore, so it implies you\u0027ve got an unknown memory leak. Finding it and plugging it (or reporting it to the modder or Squad) should be your goal, not finding when to restart."},{"CreatedByName":"Bishop149","CreatedById":82368,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-16T11:18:44Z","Content":"\u003E 2) If you don\u0027t mind installing mods, install a mod to display it on the screen.

I\u0027ve never noticed it (though when I stopped crashing, I stopped looking). I know memory jumps at that time, but that\u0027s not (as you mentioned) a memory leak nor do I think it\u0027s even a bug.

I haven\u0027t played enough to see it myself, since I\u0027ve just been part-modding lately (which means generally KSP isn\u0027t running for more than 5 minutes at a time, when I\u0027m testing parts).\n\nBut a friend / co-worker is running into memory problems constantly. He does have a bunch of mods, but he tried removing them in batches to see where the problem was, and never got a good answer, other than the fact that EVE eats up so much memory that he runs close to the limit with the other mods installed. What he did find though, is that the leak appears to be with scene-switching.
