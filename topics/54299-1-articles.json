Obviously you can\u0027t play the entire game with so few buttons, but you can certainly cover all of the basic flight controls. How would you guys make use of it? Here\u0027s what I was thinking:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeft Analog - Pitch and Yaw\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight Analog - Roll and Camera zoom\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED-Pad - move camera\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER1 and R2 - Decrease/Increase throttle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL1 and L2 - Switch active vessel\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022X\u0022 button - Stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Square\u0022 button - Toggle SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Circle\u0022 button - Toggle RCS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Triangle\u0022 button - Kill Throttle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER3 (Press right analog in) - Alt key, mostly for adjusting trim\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL3 - Toggle fine control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat are your thoughts? Did I miss any critical functions? Again, I know I\u0027ll never be able to play keyboard-free, that\u0027s not the point.
