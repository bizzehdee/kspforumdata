That\u0027s a great idea, and actually I previously considered doing just that.\u00A0 But chose not to, because reasons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, now the long-winded version:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom a technical standpoint, what you suggest would be trivially easy.\u00A0 The game has a convenient API for getting the slope at my location, just takes one line of code to get it.\u00A0 In fact, I can easily get not just what the slope is directly under the ship, but also which \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Edirection\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E it\u0027s sloping (i.e. am I going up-slope? down-slope? sideways along the slope?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause it would be so easy, I actually considered doing exactly what you suggest.\u00A0 In fact, I even considered taking it one step further, and just extrapolating linearly (i.e. \u0022assume that the slope is going to continue at the same angle as the ground directly under the ship right now\u0022 instead of what it currently does, \u0022assume that the ground is flat and level\u0022).\u00A0 That would be a better approximation, right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, having played around with it a bit, I decided not to.\u00A0 It\u0027s a matter of game design and UX, not technical programming.\u00A0 I came to the conclusion that it would be a cure worse than the disease, from the player\u0027s perspective.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is that slope is \u0022noisy\u0022-- any time you have a little \u0027bump\u0027 in the terrain, the slope changes by a lot in a very short distance.\u00A0 And essentially every solid surface in the solar system is bumpy, except for Minmus\u0027 flats.\u00A0 Even terrain that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elooks\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E \u0022smooth\u0022 to you is very bumpy indeed when you\u0027re sailing over it at hundreds of meters per second.\u00A0 (Try driving a rover at 20\u002B m/s and turning physics warp up to 4, and see how long your tires last.\u00A0 You\u0027ll quickly see what I mean.)\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo if you\u0027re sailing over terrain at a few hundred (or even just several dozen) meters per second, it will usually be the case that the slope is very rapidly \u0022jittering\u0022, by a lot.\u00A0 So if there\u0027s any UI calculation or display at all that\u0027s based on that slope, it\u0027s going to be very hard to make it something useful to a user.\u00A0 To take your specific recommendation, for example:\u00A0 there would be two UX problems with that.\u00A0 The first would be that I\u0027d have yet another visual indicator for the user to have to see and understand, which would add complexity that I prefer to avoid if possible.\u00A0 (I\u0027m fanatically obsessed with keeping UX as simple as possible.)\u00A0 The second (and worse) problem is that the indicator would be flickering and blinking all the time. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(\u0022It\u0027s approximate!\u00A0 No it isn\u0027t.\u00A0 Now it is!\u00A0 No it isn\u0027t.\u00A0 Whoops, now it is again!\u0022)\u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 It would look horrible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea of extrapolating the slope would make it even worse-- the estimated time would be jumping up and down erratically, by a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, to the point that it would be totally useless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, it would be possible to add technical fixes for the above.\u00A0 I could, for example, take a sliding time-weighted average of observed slope, rather than the actual current slope, in an attempt to smooth out the jitter.\u00A0 But that would \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ealso\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E be more code to write, more code to test, more potential bugs that I\u0027d miss and then have users report and then I\u0027d need to put out another update, etc.\u00A0 I\u0027d rather have something simple that I \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eknow\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E works (if imperfectly) than build something complex, unpredictable, and likely bug-prone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd the final nail in the coffin:\u00A0 even if I implemented all of the above, and it worked perfectly... \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eit still wouldn\u0027t have solved the problem\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that ExEvolution ran into.\u00A0 ExEvolution\u0027s problem was not that \u0022the slope is nonzero\u0022.\u00A0 The problem was that the slope \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Esuddenly got steep\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E, and the countdown that said \u0022you have 15 seconds\u0022 almost immediately jumped to a value much less than that.\u00A0 Having a feature such as you described \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ewould not have solved that\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 All that would have happened would be that ExEvolution would have gotten a \u0022WARNING\u0022 indication in those last couple of \u0022\u003Cabbr title=\u0022what\u0022\u003EWTF\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u0022 seconds before impact, \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eafter\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E the countdown suddenly jumped down, i.e. when it was too late to do anything.\u00A0 It would have been a redundant warning because it was already \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eobvious\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E that \u0022there\u0027s a problem\u0022 (since the counter did in fact suddenly jump down).\u00A0 In fact, such a warning would have accomplished nothing useful to ExEvolution at all.\u00A0 \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003E(Maybe it would have been an indicator that \u0022this is a feature\u0022 rather than \u0022this is a bug\u0022... but he\u0027d still be wondering \u0022what the hell just happened?\u0022 and would probably still have posted here to ask about it, and rightly so.)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... if I ever decide to try to actually address the problem for real, I\u0027ll probably just add trajectory-extrapolation-to-actual-impact-point and be done with it.\u00A0 In fact, if I imagine \u0022what would be the next major feature, if any, that I add to BetterBurnTime\u0022, my best guess would be that very thing.\u00A0 But that\u0027s \u003Cstrong\u003Enot a promise\u003C/strong\u003E (either for a schedule, or that I\u0027ll do it at all), just an idle speculation, so don\u0027t

So, it would be better to do it with a fresh save or even stock only\u002BBBT.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T15:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222530604\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022126111\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461330919\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:11px;\u0022\u003E\u0026lt;rant\u0026gt;\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt turns out that the Unity API has \u003Ca href=\u0022http://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/05/16/custom-operator-should-we-keep-it/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea so-called \u0022design\u0022 feature that is stark raving stupid\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0 I won\u0027t go into technical details, because it\u0027s the sort of thing that only a programmer would care about, but I gotta say it\u0027s one of the most idiotic things I\u0027ve ever seen, and I have no idea what on earth they were thinking when they wrote it that way.\u00A0 So I feel comfortable putting the blame squarely on Unity, here.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0026lt;/rant\u0026gt;\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust curious, how does that misfeature cause problems for BBT? If I recall previous posts, you\u0027re checking for null and then using functions or properties on the object, as per normal practice, and the null check is failing to protect you from null reference errors. But that means their overloaded operator must be returning false in some cases where the system operator would be returning true, right? From the unity3d article, it sounds like they would be returning true when the system operator is true,\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eand true when that operator is false but\u00A0their object\u0027s internal state is destroyed\u003C/em\u003E, and false otherwise. How does their wrapper object create the possibility to return false when the reference is actually null?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sinpro","CreatedById":119813,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-22T19:15:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll give a try to this mod.
