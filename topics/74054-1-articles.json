Considering the sandbox nature of the game these sorts of things can help keep the game fresh and add interesting layers of depth and nuance. I thought it would be neat to compile a list of roleplay techniques used by the community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is one to start off with:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re using radiator systems in \u003Cstrong\u003EKSP Interstellar\u003C/strong\u003E or \u003Cstrong\u003ENear Future Technologies\u003C/strong\u003E you should consider not radially mounting your radiator panels such that they can \u0022see\u0022 each other. Thermal radiation is just a form of light, it shines in all directions from an emissive source. Ultimately, the point of a radiator is to reject waste heat out into the depths of space so that it doesn\u0027t melt your spacecraft. However, if the radiators aren\u0027t mounted 180 degrees apart then they will be effectively radiating heat on to each other rather than away from the spacecraft. If your panels radiate on to each other then the total heat rejected by the system will be reduced by the view factor F, which is engineering parlance for the fraction of radiation leaving one surface that is intercepted by another surface. If you assume that the panels are of equal dimensions and have a roughly common edge (i.e. the radius of placement of these panels is small compared to their overall length) then the view factor is approximately \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EF=1-sin(alpha/2) where alpha is the angle between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the total heat rejected by your radiators will be \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eqnominal*(1-F)=qactual\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI often see screenshots where people mount their radiators at right angles to one another. This reduces their effectiveness by roughly 30%. Panels with smaller angles are even less effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor applications in an atmosphere heat is usually removed more quickly by forced convection than by radiation so it is okay to mount panels more closely (in this case they would be called fins). Here surface area is the main thing you really need to care about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr point your radiators away from light sources (such as other radiators).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-04T01:11:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EK.
