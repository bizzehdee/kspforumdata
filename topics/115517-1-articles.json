There is a house in our county that was assigned an emergency number of 666, the owner wasn\u0027t able to sell it until he changed it to 667.

I have found references to ambisinistrous. The first was on the Wikipedia page for handedness but there is no source listed and the entry is marked with a dubious tag. Which in a Wikipedia context just means someone else viewed the statement with incredulity. So I searched farther and found this (It is the same line from Wikipedia and I am not sure which is citing the other.):\n\n**\u0022Ambilevous** (or **ambisinistrous**) - where people have equally poor dexterity (are equally clumsy), with both hands.
