Yes, it will work on 1.9\n\nYou can run the old version, as long as you have the current Yongtech Tech Tree mod installed.

I\u0027ve been in a very long break from KSP and seeing it being updated again is bringing me back.\n\n- Some feedback regarding items 4 and 5 (icons):\n\nI think an icon is supposed to pass information in a very simple and minimalist way. We\u0027re supposed to quickly glance at the image of the nodes and immediately know what it does. For that, the silhouette of the image must be perfectly clear (ideally, we should be able to tell what that part is just by looking at the silhouette) so if you go down that road, I\u0027d say you\u0027ll need to choose carefully the angles of the pictures you want to capture. Also, because all that, I\u0027d advise against using complex parts, like the bottom one with a star in your picture, it\u0027s hard for me to tell what it is and what it does, while the one near the \u0022Jet Engines\u0022 is easier, since it\u0027s more recognizable. Both regarding the silhouette, and the colours, which brings me to the next point:\n\n- Regarding items 1, 3 and 6 (colours):\n\nLike I said, the bottom star is a complex shape, it seems to have too much going on for such a small image. I\u0027d stick to simpler parts to choose as an icon if you want to use pictures instead of flat colours.\n\nI like the idea of different colours on the icons according to the function, along with the banners to describe what those colours are. Another idea, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible: Change the background colour instead of the icons (maybe make a giant icon, paint it white, give it some transparency, and adjust it behind all the Aviation nodes for example? And put a banner named \u0022Aviation\u0022 there somewhere so you\u0027ll know immediately that everything white is related to that?)\n\n- Regarding size:\n\nI also like the idea of varying size according to part size, again it makes it easy to understand what that node will do with a glance. It\u0027ll be hard to know how the entire tech tree will look like before applying all that I guess, it could end up huge.. but that\u0027s what the zoom is for right? ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)\n\nHope I managed to make myself clear on this brainstorming!

Thanks again for the great work\n\u003E \n\nThanks for the feedback [@markinturamb](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/152101-markinturamb/)!  I really appreciate it.  I just re-read your banner comment and I understand what you mean.  That is a great idea.  I\u0027m going to try it out and see what it looks like.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 6/14/2020 at 1:22 AM, ev0 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Are these changes done through a plugin dll, or through a Module Manager config file?\n\u003E \n\nI\u0027m making these changes using the tech tree editor for convenience.  All of them could be done using module manager I believe."},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Cattman423","CreatedById":205810,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-29T04:54:08Z","Content":"Can you change the BDB integration so it matches better with the progression of the actual US space program? The way it\u0027s currently integrated I can make a Titan II Missile before I can make a Redstone Rocket, also in order to unlock the engine for the Redstone Rocket and Mercury deorbital engine you have to upgrade the RnD building yet you have almost everything for a full fledged Gemini mission before the RnD upgrade.\n\nOther than my issues with BDB I am loving the experience and ability to select where I focus my science points and the actual progression feel it has over the stock tech tree and CTT."},{"CreatedByName":"Hallebumba","CreatedById":117485,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-20T12:25:41Z","Content":"I love this Techtree! I played with it some time ago and want to start a new playthrough on 1.9. I tried using the 1.8 version of ETT but sadly it didn\u0027t work so i wanted to ask if you know when or if there will be a 1.9 release (with 1.10 already being out). I hope i didn\u0027t miss any info and defintly don\u0027t want to stress you, i can only imagine how much work this must be.   \n\nOn your Ideas from earlier:  \n\nI think if you are able to color code different branches with the icons that would be helpful. I am with markinturamb on the simplicity of the icons and would say keep them stock(-ish) and well maybe change the color. If you are able to change the Node color itself it could be nice to seperate aircraft and rocketry with that. i.e.: Jet Engines are Black bg with green icon, Wings are Black bg with yellow icon, SRBs are white bg with red icon and Liquid engines white bg with blue icon and so on.  \n\nAnd bigger nodes for bigger parts is maybe an idea but i would vary the sizes to much.  \n\nI hope everything is sort of understandable, i am not a native speaker and rarely ever post in forums, so sorry for the textlayout and languagemistakes i guess^^  \n\nlooking forward to grind through the ETT once again!"},{"CreatedByName":"OwariTY","CreatedById":207190,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-21T17:23:48Z","Content":"Hi. I have a question: how you guys reach the orbit with 30% of science or less? You need atleast two engine nodes ( for the big engine with gimbal and the second one for the vacuum engine if you are playing with bluedogs parts) and other for tanks and decouplers. However, even walking through the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003Eksc\u003C/abbr\u003E i can\u0027t get enough science. \n\nOf course, this is just a question and not a problem with the best tech tree ever made."}]}
