The mission is a double rescue from low Munar orbit, plus science return from my Munar station. The docking port is needed to collect the science from the Munar station, plus I want to refuel there -- while it might be theoretically possible to do the LMO rescues and be able to return, the margins of error get too thin for my liking (and I\u0027m not 100% sure it\u0027s even doable).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also noticed that liquid fuel boosters based on Reliants cost about the same as those Kickbacks, m/s per m/s, and experimented a bit with them.

The Kickbacks have a better TTW ratio so take-off is easier and more efficient, but because of the insane acceleration near the end of the burn I have to fly a pretty high arc, which puts me at about 120-140 klicks which is slightly sub-optimal.
