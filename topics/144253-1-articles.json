No fiddly docking - just mine and refine until large ore tanks and fuel tanks are full then launch and rendezvous with an orbital refinery. Transfer all ore to the refinery along with any fuel not needed for a return to the surface. For a conservative safety margin, I look at how much fuel I used to make orbital rendezvous and keep about 150% of that amount of fuel on board the miner to return to the surface. I like to do this all at once so the time I\u0027m not mining is just the time required to perform the manoeuvres.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Kerbin and its moons, I found it more economical to run an ore shuttle between Minmus and Munar orbit than to lift ore up off the Mun.

If you have a miner works well on the Mun with a good fuel safety margin, then it should work well on Ike also. My very earliest Mun miner built for an early-ish career mission was up until very recently in use on Ike!

This was my first mistake when I started drilling - I mounted drills too low.
