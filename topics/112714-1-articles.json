I\u0027m trying to build a full scale Saturn V. I was pretty disappointed when I found that TweakScale wouldn\u0027t modify FASA parts. Then I learned how to edit part cfg files. I\u0027ve been able to change the size of the F-1 Engine, but can\u0027t seem to change the thrust. FASA has the thrust at 1800 kN, I need it at 6770 kN. When I open the cfg file, it has some stupid number for maxThrust that doesn\u0027t even match what\u0027s in the game. I change it to 6770 and still get 1800 kN in game. Frustrating since it takes 10 minutes for my KSP to load...

While what it does is patch other things, that makes it no less a mod. If you\u0027re playing on .90, you can install it via CKAN.

Minor bug but hey it works. ... until I attempt to launch. The sound fx are fantastic but no flame under the engine?
