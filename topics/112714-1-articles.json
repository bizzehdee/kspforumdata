I\u0027m trying to build a full scale Saturn V. I was pretty disappointed when I found that TweakScale wouldn\u0027t modify FASA parts. Then I learned how to edit part cfg files. I\u0027ve been able to change the size of the F-1 Engine, but can\u0027t seem to change the thrust. FASA has the thrust at 1800 kN, I need it at 6770 kN. When I open the cfg file, it has some stupid number for maxThrust that doesn\u0027t even match what\u0027s in the game. I change it to 6770 and still get 1800 kN in game. Frustrating since it takes 10 minutes for my KSP to load...
