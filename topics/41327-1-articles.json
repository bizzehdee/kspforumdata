There are maybe 3 - 10 starsystem orbiting that supermass star/black hole. That would reduce travel time and fix the problem with realistic engines. We need no SciFi warp drive tech or something like that and have a realistic interstellar scenario.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJhonny\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-09T11:17:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2013 11:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Jhonny007\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ace_Of_Spades","CreatedById":63298,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T02:19:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eim just proseccing how much delta-v that would take\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T02:35:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDude come on, there\u0027s already a thread about this, just post your idea there\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jhonny007","CreatedById":77768,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-07T14:29:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022 data-cite=\u0022chaos_forge\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDude come on, there\u0027s already a thread about this, just post your idea there\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esorry dude didnt saw that thread since the title wasnt clear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell I think my thread can be closed then.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
