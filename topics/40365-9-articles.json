So you are overlooking some vast resources... On kerbin for example you have ~ 78% nitrogen, this can be used as a propellant in a thermal engine. On duna you have ~ 95% carbon dioxide, this can be used as well, eve\u0027s atmosphere is 98% carbon dioxide, and so on. Liquid hydrogen is actually one of the worst propellants to use in terms of thrust, but has the highest specific impulse. In my models I was using plain h2o which has excellent thrust and relatively high specific impulse, at least when compared with traditional chemical rocket engines.\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is that you should include more of these resources and alter the function to support their use. So for example you can power a thermal engine using electricity \u002B h2, co2, h2o, N, o2, etc - no nuclear heat is necessary assuming you have enough power to drive the internal microwave magnetrons which act as the heating element in the supercritical compression (heating) chamber of the engine. The more energy available, the more DV you can get out of a given amount of propellant, up to the design limitations of the compression chamber of course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pina_coladas\u0022 data-cite=\u0022pina_coladas\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHave you guys checked out the modular fuel tanks/fuels thread?

First of all, I really like the modular fuel systems mod, it adds a lot of realism to the game in terms of configurable propellants in your fuel tanks. LiquidFuel being Kerosene/RP-1 also makes a lot more sense given the specific impulse values found in the game (except for the LV-N anyway). That said, I don\u0027t want to duplicate the work found in that mod, there is no point but nor can I assume that everyone who plays this mod will also have that mod, adding dependencies to other mods is generally a bad idea. It would be ideal if I could find some way of making my mod make different assumptions about fuels depending on whether that mod is installed or not, but it does seem like a lot of effort for probably a very small subset of players.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch as it is, I have to make assumptions that are actually useful primarily to the players of this mod. Adding more fuels, e.g. Nitrogen or Water might be appealing from a realism standpoint but from a playability standpoint it would mean I\u0027d have to add a whole bunch of fuel tanks of different sizes for Nitrogen resources and indeed any other resource that I chose to add. I\u0027ve already added a couple of liquid fuel tanks for playability purposes, I don\u0027t really want to go adding hundreds of different types of fuel tanks to cover every possibility or people will get quickly fed up when they accidently add the wrong fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m very much open to suggestions on how to resolve this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SpaceK531\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SpaceK531\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI found this article while browsing today:\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/green-energy/4243793\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/green-energy/4243793\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s basically solar technology that uses the difference between hot and cold to generate electricity at a large efficiency.

In my experience, while a disconnected thermal engine will work, it has limited isp and thrust compared to a connected one, and it still does consume fuel.
