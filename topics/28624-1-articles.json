Following the typical KSP naming convention of taking something real and making it start with \u0022K,\u0022 it was called the \u0022Kerbwith Kamel.\u0022 It was quite difficult to fly, as it didn\u0027t turn very well and had a tendency, when taxiing along the ground, to lean to one side of the other and tear off the lower wings (taking the landing gear with them). If open-cockpit planes were going to be of any use, these problems would have to be fixed. After going through a few prototype aircraft and several test pilots, the Kerbwith Swallow was born.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnlike its predecessor, the Swallow has only one engine, mounted below and behind the lower wings, and half as much fuel. Despite this seeming drop in power, its top speed is still comparable to that of the Kamel. It is also much more agile, and doesn\u0027t flop about when taxiing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPictures\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECompulsory perspective shot:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/EFeSFcul.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022EFeSFcul.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlan Kerman with his shiny new aeroplane:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/T8LFhgMl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022T8LFhgMl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow to Fly\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part, the Swallow is the same as any other plane. There are just a few things you need to know:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst, to get into the cockpit, send your Kerbal on EVA and then right click the seat. Select \u0022Board\u0022 and you should teleport into it. Then, press space to discard the command pod. Finally, right click the Kerbal and choose \u0022control from here,\u0022 otherwise you won\u0027t be able to yaw the plane due to a bug in the controls.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, before taking off, press \u00221\u0022 twice before taking off to extend the antenna and disable the motor and steering of the front wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, don\u0027t go over 60m/s while on the ground, or else the front wheels will break. Yes, I know I could have used actual landing gear, but these just looked so much \u003Cem\u003Ecooler.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDownload\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/4inm4vz5vvflh0q/Kerbwith_Swallow_Mk_I.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbwith Swallow Mk.

It got out of hand sometime back with everyone beginning everything in sight with a \u0022K\u0022. And while quite a few modders still do it, it can be considered rather cheeky Old Sport.
