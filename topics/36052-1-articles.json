So, for example, if we had 1 mainsail firing at full power, that has 1500 kN. If we get that and we have a total rocket mass of 150.0 tons, then 1500 divided by 150= an acceleration rate of 10 meters per second per second.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ecorrect me if i\u0027m wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, Is the equation (if it\u0027s correct) called the TWR?

Consequently, 1kN = 1T * 1m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. So if you divide thrust in kN by mass in tonns, you get acceleration in m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, TWR is a related quantity. It is thrust of the rocket divided by weight of the rocket. Weight is just mass multiplied by acceleration due to gravity, so you have the same units as thrust. (Both are a kind of force, so that makes sense.) So in your example, the weight of the rocket is 150T * 9.8m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 = 1,470kN. Therefore, TWR is 1,500kN / 1,470kN = 1.02. You need TWR \u0026gt; 1 to liftoff from Kerbin, so this rocket will just barely do so. Typically, you want TWR of roughly 2 to make efficient ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also said that what you got is related. Well, if your rocket has TWR of 1, it will accelerate in vacuum at 9.8m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2. So an alternative way is to take acceleration and divide by acceleration due to gravity. TWR = 10m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 / 9.8m/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 = 1.02. So you get the same number either way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-05T23:15:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sun\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sun\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have come up with a rocket equation of my own: The acceleration of a rocket(in m/s) = the thrust of all the rocket engines (in kN) combined divided by the mass of the whole rocket (in tons).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re using Newton\u0027s second law to calculate acceleration given mass and force.

This should be constant for a rocket in constant pressure and constant fuel flow. The *acceleration*, however, is T/m so its rate of change should be da/dt = (-T * dm/dt) / m^2 which is positive, because dm/dt is negative (the mass is decreasing). So a is increasing, and as time goes on it increases faster and faster (m^2 gets smaller). Also, you can get the Tsiolkovsky equation (i.e. delta V) by integrating the acceleration over time and changing the integration variable to mass (and as it turns out, it works for any dm/dt, i.e. fuel flow, constant or otherwise, which is why it\u0027s more general and useful).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you want to calculate this over a trajectory in the atmosphere, things get more complicated because the thrust isn\u0027t quite constant (the exhaust velocity depends on the pressure).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, equations relating to rockets (in a vacuum at least) tend to be very simple, because rockets themselves are very simple engines.
