I used waypoints to track my journey, and I got a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebit\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Etoo trigger happy about the waypoint generation, and as a result the whole route is covered in waypoints. I don\u0027t have the heart to delete all of them, since it took me nearly a week to cover all that distance. Si sometimes I wish i could hide them. Normally, so many waypoints isn\u0027t all that much of a problem, but since I\u0027ve set up a Extraplanetary Launchpads Base on the same body, its getting tiring to ignore all the waypoints, and they also interfere in landing and maneuvering.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I was wondering is there a mod that can hide waypoints? If not, can someone make it so that their visibility can be toggled on or off?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DStaal","CreatedById":155685,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-04-18T16:17:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWaypoint Manager can set conditions on when you\u0027ll see waypoints:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed8902142026\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/94432-16x-waypoint-manager-v275-2019-01-31/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:228px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
