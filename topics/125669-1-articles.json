It also seems like the longer I work on it, the laggier it becomes. Is there some sort of memory leak with the mk3 cargo ramps, or is it just me being an idiot (it seems to be exclusively them)[/SIZE]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Right","CreatedById":80269,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T01:26:09Z","Content":"\nI\u0026#39;ve always noticed the KSP slowly get more laggy the longer it runs. Restart the game if its feeling sluggish compared to startup. As for you\u0026#39;re main question, my money is on the ramps hogging your RAM for some reason.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"X9Squared","CreatedById":149583,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T01:43:29Z","Content":"\nI would think that the ramps might be a little memory hoggy, especially with more yello-timewarp on my crafts with the ramps. Try decreasing the ramps if you can...\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T02:45:16Z","Content":"\nLag != Memory Leak. Memory Leaks do not cause lag and lag does not cause memory leaks. Lag is caused by either overusing the CPU or overusing the GPU (most likely the former in KSP), and memory leaks cause the game to crash. Running out of RAM doesn\u0026#39;t cause the computer to run slower. Anything can cause lag in KSP with enough of them, animated parts even more so. That doesn\u0026#39;t mean anything is wrong with the part, you are just exceeding it\u0026#39;s design limitations.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T02:53:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 02:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bubbadevlin","CreatedById":136524,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T03:03:02Z","Content":"\nI guess i am exceeding it... thanks for clarifying it, i am kinda nooby at that stuff. It just seemed REALLY laggy, even compared to when i just used a regular cargo bay.
