Pick the one you like the most that has gotten the closest to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome general basics. Start with the smallest Mun lander you need. Larger landers require larger rockets which makes things complicated. When you fail to reach orbit, ask yourself why? Common problems are thrust to weight ratio too low at launch, inefficient engines, too little fuel in radial stages, heavy Mun landers..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxMurder","CreatedById":11958,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T23:32:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) from your description it seems that you are building ungodly huge rockets. Unnecessarily big rockets tend to fail miserably as they are so heavy that they will crush themselves under their own weight. Having a lot of thrust will add to the problem as the G forces become more extreme. Start with the smallest design possible, try not to use full throttle if your rockets are exploding frequently (keep an eye on your g meter), don\u0027t add unessasary boosters (if its gaining velocity it has enough), plan your stages carefully (launch stage should get you out of the atomosphere, orbit stage should take you to orbit and TMI, lander stage for landing and an optional return stage) and always remember KISS!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-15T05:17:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGuys, Mr. ProbeIke seems to have mistakenly created redundant threads, and this one is duplicating his \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/20437-Creating-large-stable-non-laggy-rockets-for-three-person-lunar-landing\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/20437-Creating-large-stable-non-laggy-rockets-for-three-person-lunar-landing\u003C/a\u003E.
