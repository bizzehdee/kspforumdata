I\u0027ve been playing KSP for about a month now and really love this game. I\u0027m 45, live in a small studio apartment on Long Island in New York, and work as a warehouse supervisor at a medium-sized nutraceutical company.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been interested in astronomy, physics, and math since I can remember. I only officially have a high school education (and that\u0027s only because I haven\u0027t been able to afford a college education) yet I regularly read books on science, math, technology, and so on. I call myself a pedantic autodidactic polymath. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy other interests include gaming (duh), science fiction (duh), fantasy (particularly so-called \u0022urban fantasy\u0022) and comic books.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m relatively new to KSP, and I struggle with things like delta-V (that is, getting enough delta-V to do things like interplanetary transfers). My latest KSP project is getting to Duna. My plan is as follows: send the Lander and the Transfer Vehicle up separately and dock them together all using stock parts. I\u0027ve already tried it once and found that you can\u0027t do that when one vessel is docked to the side of the other; it causes the whole unit to spin uncontrollably. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E My new plan is to dock them head-on, but by the time I get the transfer vehicle docked to the lander, I often only have around 2,000 m/s delta-V. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m having fun, and I guess that\u0027s what\u0027s important.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Volcanix","CreatedById":117245,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-27T20:15:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forum!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the introduction. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave fun around here, remember, if you have any questions, here is the right place to ask \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
