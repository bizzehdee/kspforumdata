It has about 10k \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv on its own engines, and it\u0027s towed many stations and things out to various planets/moons, but the lander itself is restricted to stuff with Mun gravity or less. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could probably do a bit heavier gravity, but it\u0027s sort of hard to land it on something big, simply because this thing has like a kiloton of mass when fully fueled. Landing it on Minmus/Mun is easy though. I made the landing base as wide as possible for that reason. Idea is to have it in orbit as a depot, run it down to bare minimum fuel to land, then refuel and take off to be a depot again. You spend a TINY amount of fuel getting off of minmus due to the low gravity, so that\u0027s why it\u0027s there right now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could do with a little refining.. the fuel lines are messy and I could have made it look a bit more interesting, but it works fine for what I designed it for.
