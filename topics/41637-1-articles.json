You want something to hook the viewers. Not just watching another game. Special effects and funny voices are okay but in the end there has to be a story or something to look forward to in the next video.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chaobaozi","CreatedById":67278,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T02:31:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have never considered a story, thanks for the idea. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the idea of wanting to make the viewers crave for more by making them look forward to something, it\u0027s a smart idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
