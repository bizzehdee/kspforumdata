The same happens with the SPH, but a flipped building is outside the door instead. Everything seems to work fine, but when I select some parts, such as SP\u002B pods, they won\u0027t show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd when I launch a craft, it cuts to the KSC with an invisible ground, but Kerbal Konstructs buildings are visible. You can\u0027t move the camera, but the game still works. When you time accelerate, the view goes crazy and you start to fly off of Kerbin. The list of mods and screenshots is included in the Imgur album. This never happened before, and I even deleted some mods after this started, but it was all working fine for a few launches before this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/BJdl0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EImgur album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tobjv","CreatedById":50269,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-16T15:12:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, Please follow the guideline here so its easier to narrow down the problems. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92229-How-To-Get-Support-%28READ-FIRST%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to trying the mean time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your using the 64 bit launcher switch to 32 bit and try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETry the game with no mods and see if the problem persists. if it does then ksp is possibly bugged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your copy of ksp is on steam then try a verify cache file check via the properties menu.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JTG","CreatedById":106203,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-17T22:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI figured out it was DebRefund anyways.
