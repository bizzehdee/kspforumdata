This is not a problem with radially attached stages, however central primary stages are less obvious as to how to handle this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out, a 1.25m service bay will allow attachment of a a stayputnik inside. It clips of course, but I am reasoning that we are using the flattened version for fitting inside a service bay :-)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also put the chutes needed inside the service bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, my standard early game setup is one stayputnik probe, and one service bay. Inside the service bay is chutes and one battery. On outer stages, the probe is mounted on top of the stage, on central stages, inside the service bay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are using remote tech, of course you\u0027ll need an antenna inside the service bay as well, which also fits nicely on the top part of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWorks like a charm, and the service bay doors serve as poor man\u0027s air brakes (air vanes, anyway :-) ), as long as you are through the heating effects. Open the service bay doors the moment you are through heating, as chutes will not deploy if you dont. And of course, even though it is nerve racking with high flying central stages, wait until below 280m/s to open the chutes, or use drogues to slow down first if you have them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, this setup also works with 2.5m service bay as well, which I use standard to protect battery and chutes. As a side point, for central stages I always use two decouplers back to back (arrows both pointed outward) in early game to provide total stack separation. That loses me the part, but it makes things a lot cleaner and reduces the chance of a mishap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelieve it or not, this works more reliably in water than on land, since on water the chutes don\u0027t cut until the whole stage has laid over (for long, skinny stages) while on land, the chutes cut as soon as you hit the ground and there is a chance the stage will explode when it falls over.. in water the chutes gently bring it down and have never exploded on me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use tweak scale, the service bays can now be resized, so if you don\u0027t have the 2.5m bay, you do now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I recommend pausing (in real life, not in game) before hitting the button to switch to another stage.. I have found if I hit the button quickly after landing a stage, it can crash the game (maybe only relevant to me). If I wait 5 seconds or more to do it, I haven\u0027t had it crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd also, in the later game, you can just pop on a flower of airbrakes on the top of your stage as well, as you never have to worry about going too fast to open chutes, nor coming in too hot, or at a bad angle. Deploy them in space and just wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats it!
