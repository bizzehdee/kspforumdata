It was around 588 parts before changing stuff. The older craft worked fine and still does.. I updated it and it\u0027s around 600 parts. it now crashes every time I do those two things making the ship unfinishable. Mind you I could normally make ships up to 2500\u002B before getting any crashes from parts count from the shortcuts window or similar things. And this ship used to be near 700 parts in 1.0.4 with no problems. What is odd is alot of the other stuff works with a bit less lag than before but these things now CTD the game seemingly from performance overload frome these functions way out of proportion to what I have traditionally experienced. And compared to now even the rest of the game running.. There is something messing them up badly!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just deleted and reinstalled the whole game after updating to see if it helps. It did nothing. There is also odd lag and stutters at the two title screens that feels kind of similar... I wonder if they are related. Something is bloated or something in the code. ***Now I just got a crashes at the beginning of my game also...(This only happened once so far.) it zooms in near the middle of the KSC and stops and I back out to the last menu but the game menu options are all darkened with all the other text and nothing is selectable. When this doesn\u0027t happen the KSC is also laggy on it\u0027s own without anything else present. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, I can move parts individually but I can\u0027t move or rotate the whole ship or access the custom shortcut screen. Something I also assume access info from the whole ship and not a single part. This kind of thing used to not be an issue until near 2500-3000 parts. I now may be capped at 600!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I just put on 8 of those new little mining devices and upped it to another 8 larger ones on the bottom.
