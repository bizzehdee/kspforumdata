But I\u0027m have two crazy problems with the UI. \n\n1) Every other time I click the button, the maneuver node \u0022closes\u0022 forcing me to re-select it, then right click it to get back to the advance-orbit-button. \n\n2) I also get a ton of popup\u0027s to select various targets, as though I were clicking on them or empty space, as opposed to a button. These popups appear over the manuver node controls, and often gets clicked accidentally. My workaround for this, which wont always help, is to orient my view such that a small section of the button remains visible behind any other popups (but this doesn\u0027t always work).\n\nI\u0027d like to be able to click the advance-orbit-button a few dozen times in a row, without pulling my hair out. Does anyone have a way to work around this UI oddness? Also looking for any suggestions on how to advance a maneuver node a huge number of orbits, like in the hundreds, without clicking hundred of times.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T03:04:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 03:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Glurth**"},{"CreatedByName":"Padishar","CreatedById":97386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T14:36:33Z","Content":"Yes, I think the stock manoeuvre node UI annoys lots of people lots of the time...\n\nThe usual workaround for this would be to install either PreciseNode or MechJeb, both of which can give you much better control over nodes..."},{"CreatedByName":"Glurth","CreatedById":148386,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T15:46:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The usual workaround for this would be to install either PreciseNode or MechJeb, both of which can give you much better control over nodes...\n\nThanks for the reply Padishar. I do have mech-jeb, and I see how I can use it\u0027s maneuver node editor to \u0022shift TIME\u0022: So, to advance a number of ORBITS, I need to look at the time difference between my next apoapsis and peripapsis, double it, then punch that into the Mech Jeb maneuver node editor. But even that (painful) way it\u0027s never quite precise, which ends up messing up my angles. Is there a better way?
