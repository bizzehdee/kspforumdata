Like trying to manualy control the thrust limiter on one engine while another goes, so that I don\u0027t start cartwheeling (bad problem I have, and as fuel drains from one tank, I have to keep adjusting my engine) but the nav ball gets in the way of the window. Or If I am trying to transfer fuel from one tank to another nearby tank, the windows overlap, making it hard to see the numbers. I can swing the camera around, but if the tanks are right on each other, it doesn\u0027t always help. I tried clicking and dragging the windows, but it doesn\u0027t seem to help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-26T07:24:04Z\u0022 title=\u002201/26/2015 07:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DeMatt","CreatedById":90539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-11T02:49:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the moment, you can\u0027t.
