If you are going to procede with a $500 million \u002B Project its has to be planned out to the detail and all the bases covered, if it is cancelled then its down to fundemental reasons. If you dont think you have the budget to do multiple big projects then DONT! do one or two at a time instead of starting a dozen and cancelling half of them. he budget needs to be set by the govement but it needs locking and descions on project and dircetion left to the experts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Comrade Jenkens\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Comrade Jenkens\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese problems are not limited to just NASA but the majority of western industries and companies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost goverment agancys are.

We could use the RD-180, an off-the-shelf component that costs about 11 million dollars per engine. Much cheaper than other engines. A semi-rigid structure for the Core, which would be \u0022inflated\u0022 to get more structurally sound, like the Centaur and the original Atlas. This makes the entire thing much much lighter and even easier to build, reducing costs. Perhaps if this is done soon, we can actually get some sort of a rocket by 2020. The cost would be amortized, reducing the launch costs to less than 100 million dollars, which is affordable even for NASA.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KASASpace","CreatedById":71352,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T03:22:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022G\u0022 data-cite=\u0022G\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell with SLS\u0027 date=\u0027 it seems to me to just be something that\u0027s meant to break NASA away from the Space Shuttle (which for years has been what most of NASA\u0027s major mission have been centered around) and bring them back to where they were before the Shuttle program, with rockets launching dedicated space craft (and not hybrids) into space. \u003Cp\u003EObviously beyond that basic premise SLS has little defined goals (I mean, SLS\u0027 uses can range anywhere from a return to the Moon to simple ISS resupply runs), but I mean I can\u0027t blame necessarily blame them considering they\u0027re basically trying to reinvent the Saturn V\u0027s capabilities (If not the Saturn V itself). Just the idea that they\u0027re having to basically reinvent something they put together themselves (Yes, I know why this is) is cause enough for SLS\u0027 existence.[/quote\u0027]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDid the S-V have a core based off of the Space Shuttle ET? SRBs based off of Shuttle SRBs? Granted similar capabilities, but when you think about it ,we had it the whole time. Just put the RS-25 or SSMEs or whatever on the ET, remove the Orbiter, flatten the top of the ET, and you can get over 100 tons into orbit with just THAT. So, why is it taking so long? It should only take about 2.5 years of full commitment. But is NASA committed? Is Congress committed?

So the monkeys in suites in congress can cancell the project if they wish but as soon as it hits a certain point then its locked. The window should be the intial concept and devopment phase.
