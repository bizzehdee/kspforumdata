Is there a way to rotate the entire animation so that I can have the part facing the (Blender) -X direction? I tried childing everything to an empty, and it works, but when I put the part in KSP it is not rotated the correct way in the part list and SPH, and the node is in a weird spot..\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T20:24:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy understanding and experience is that Blender\u0027s animation keyframes record the \u003Cem\u003Eabsolute\u003C/em\u003E positions of your mesh(es), irrespective of any later reorientation of your model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your animation is relatively simple, you re-key (i.e. redo) the animation in Unity using the model\u0027s final orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your animation is complex, the best bet is to orient the model and animation in its final configuration in Blender.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lo-fi","CreatedById":111099,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T20:26:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERotate it 90 degrees in Unity before writing?

Some other issues I\u0027m having though: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Is it possible to create an effect on engine shutdown where the thrust gradually decreases as opposed to instant 0 thrust? engineDecelerationSpeed does this when running, but when the engine is \u0022Shut Down\u0022 or \u0022Toggled\u0022 the thrust goes to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Neither the intake nor FSplanePropellerSpinner module are working on this part, and I can\u0027t figure out why.. the intake has it\u0027s \u002BZ facing out, and I believe that the propeller spinner object is supposed to be \u002BX facing out, which I have it set as.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#ff0000;\u0022\u003EEdit: Fixed the intake.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rsw0h5Wh.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rsw0h5Wh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
