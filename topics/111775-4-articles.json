The one coming up with the name Pluto, for that ex-planet, was a girl 9 years old at the time.\n\nAnyway, we\u0027re running out of Greek/Roman gods unless we want to name the rocket after some God of Healthy Bowel Movement. The Greeks and Romans had a myriad of deities but few of them were something you\u0027d associate with huge rockets and exploration. Saturn, Mercury, these names make sense. Titan too. Ares on the other hand is not a name NASA would want to use in peaceful space exploration. Dionysus is right out. We should perhaps look beyond Greek/Roman mythology and Old Norse or Hindu mythology generally don\u0027t catch the public\u0027s enthusiastic approval to the same degree as Saturn does.\n\nPerhaps have a look at the mythology found in North America. Look around, ask around. Surely there must be some awesome name to be found that can be used.\n\nEDIT: If you think that\u0027s far fetched, think about how the military helicopters in the US are named after North American tribes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T19:39:07Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 07:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LN400**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T19:53:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027m happy NASA is getting anything at all. I can think of plenty of things my tax money is being wasted on, but human exploration of space is definitely not one of them.\n\nNo, I\u0027d be fine with giving the entire ~2/3 of total federal spending called \u0022programmatic\u0022 entirely to NASA. \n\nAs it is, with their 0.5% of total spending budget, they need to use every penny the most frugal way possible. Sadly, NASA has little to do with this, as their choices get second guessed by Congress, which gives them money with strings attached (to spend a ton on SLS/Orion because those contractors own the right congress critters).\n\nI was optimistic when younger.
