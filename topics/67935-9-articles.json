I still use all the same parts I always did. Skippers, Mainsails, every tank type depending on what I\u0027m building. Now however I can reduce the number of Mainsail \u002B stacked silver tanks I have to put on for the same lift. I\u0027ve still got a Mainsail in the center of the bloom, just now he\u0027s got 4 LFR KR 1x2s instead of 6 more stacked silvers and a mainsail. I\u0027ve got 2 KD25ks on each instead of 6 of the older SRBs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe dV I\u0027m getting for putting 120T into orbit is about the same. Tiny difference. The fuel costs and effort to get one of the huge, heavy new parts to Eve isn\u0027t worth it - you\u0027re better off going with a super-efficient design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know about ion engines; I haven\u0027t unlocked them yet.

The KR 1x2 is a bit more powerful than a Mainsail but can\u0027t stack, doesn\u0027t fit well against other parts and saves 2 tons. I can\u0027t put one central but as a radial lift booster it\u0027s generally a better choice - more space-efficient in that regard. The 25x4 cluster has an 8% thrust increase over 2x Mainsails but requires special fuel tanks and isn\u0027t going to fit mounted directly under another stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre they better? Absolutely. A little bit, but yes. For very specific roles and designs. Same with nuke engines though - or wings, canards and lift elements. Same with wheels, lights and solar cells. In general the upgrades are flat out superior but there are still niches for the prior parts. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave no issue with it.
