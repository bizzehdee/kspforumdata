Infact the fabled V-22 Osprey currently in service is prohibited from aerobatics or evasive maneuvers. \n\nThis makes me a little bit sad because I grew up reading Dale Brown\u0027s novels \u0022Hammerheads\u0022 and \u0022Air Battle Force\u0022 where tilt-rotor and tilt-jet aircraft are often seen running rings around the opposition. \n\nI decided to bring my old Turbo Compound Tilt Rotor design out for a spin and see how far I can stretch the flight envelope. To my surprise, she could pull in excess of 10Gs with no sweat and swiveling the nozzles about at high angles of attack created some sort of potential for supermaneuverability as Dale Brown narrated in his books.\n\nWithout further ado, here\u0027s le proof (video below) and [craft file on KerbalX](http://kerbalx.com/pandoraskitten/XV-1B%20Hummingbird%20Tilt%20Rotor).\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/_M48M2NDe0c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T14:41:32Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 02:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T14:39:34Z","Content":"Very nice!"},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T02:48:24Z","Content":"That\u0027s great!\n\nIs that FAR?\n\nAlso, stock revamp, right?"},{"CreatedByName":"meve12","CreatedById":65193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T00:56:37Z","Content":"So, why are there no acrobatic VTOLs in real life?"},{"CreatedByName":"Adester","CreatedById":131235,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T01:26:24Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, why are there no acrobatic VTOLs in real life?\n\n i think because of the structural stress.

While Stock Revamp makes the task of explaining the mod list when sharing the craft file a bit more challenging, due to how it affects certain attach nodes, I find I cannot live without the nicely streamlined parts and the way the basic jet engines and annular aerospikes look incredibly good. \n\nTo other posts:\n\nI think to date there is only one licensed helicopter aerobatics pilot in the whole of the USA or maybe the entire world. We could say that the Harrier and upcoming F-35B STOVL Joint Strike Fighter are \u0022aerobatic capable VTOLs\u0022 - Harriers have demonstrated some cunningly effective use of thrust vectoring during aerial combat, while F-35 would likely be restricted from doing such things in hover mode.\n\nOperational tilt rotors like the V-22 Osprey probably are prohibited from aerobatics as aboveposted, structural issues, and let\u0027s just say the size and complexity of the craft makes it dangerous to push hard around the sky. There have been various accidents during the prototype stage due to exceeding flight envelopes, which gave the Osprey a bit of a bad reputation in some circles, despite its overall excellent safety record in operational service.\n\nStill a bit of a sitting duck vs small arms fire though. If you grab the craft file for the turbocompound tilt rotor in OP, you can see that there are certain areas of the flight envelope where pushing too hard or over-speeding can cause fatal loss of flight control.\n\nI had read that smaller tilt rotors like my other favorite, the AugustaWestland AW609 are more agile, but I haven\u0027t heard of them doing all out aerobatics.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T10:20:34Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 10:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pandoras kitten**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wanderfound","CreatedById":112611,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T11:24:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, why are there no acrobatic VTOLs in real life?\n\nThere are: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrier_Jump_Jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrier_Jump_Jet) \n\nAerobatic jet VTOLs work in KSP, too:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xKT9C3ROgE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-23T11:35:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/23/2015 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound**"},{"CreatedByName":"meve12","CreatedById":65193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T01:15:00Z","Content":"Forgot about that."}]}
