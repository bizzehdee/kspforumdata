I don\u0027t know if this was because of the fact that Max was streaming, or maybe his game was running slow due to background applications, or even if Twitch had something to do with it, but regardless of the condition, this worries me. I\u0027m worried because I don\u0027t know what this could mean for my own gameplay experience since I have a poor computer and the game runs fairly choppy for me already. Potentially, this could be just the new FX doing it, but there\u0027s no doubt the buildings required a lot of processing power to play their destruction animation. I hope for all the people with slow computers that it was simply a stream issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks For Reading,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Flying! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythbusters844","CreatedById":72313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T23:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI noticed that too but found out it was a stream issue since his facecam also stuttered with the gameplay stream.
