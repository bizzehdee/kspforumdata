G-force, like impact force, is still force - you just exceeded the structural limitations of the joints.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally I think this is awesome. I\u0027d like to see a lot more distortion of parts and joints, and less total-destruction of parts. Makes surviving a crash landing and attempting a recovery far more interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HighFructose","CreatedById":180349,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-08-12T22:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. I wish parts would bend a lot more before they explode or snap apart. It surprised me when this happened though, I expected the plane to shear itself apart and disentigrate, but it didn\u0027t.
