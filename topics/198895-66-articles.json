This is the second planet i visit and its also buggy. Also the planet looks weird when going between scaledspace and close in model. I get the impression this modpack isnt well made. Also the science messages dont see that i turned on habbitable mode on Narath. Are there even different ones at all?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
