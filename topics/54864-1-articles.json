The initial burn from Kerbin to Moho will take slightly more delta-v, but the final burn, to orbit Moho, should take much less delte-v. That said, the reason you\u0027re getting a really huge orbital injection burn is that you aren\u0027t getting an ideal intercept with Moho. Your intercept should occur at your closest approach to the sun, anywhere else means a much bigger orbital injection burn. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t use delta-v maps for Moho, they assume all kinds of ideal situations which make them basically useless.

Don\u0027t bother with waiting for transfer windows or figuring out the ideal burn times.
