I couldn\u0027t get to Duna yet!\u003Cbr\u003E\nNot because of lacking tech nodes but the fact that Duna was about 140 through 180 degrees behind the desired launch window (months behind). I\u0027m not willing to store that contract in the active mission list because I want to fully uttilize the max contracts available, not have one sitting idle for a few months until the mission actually arrives. I would need a Eve/Kerbin gravity assist with a very very long mission time just to get there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would really consider a in game system that detects this interplanetary dance around the sun to know it\u0027s even possible to get the mission done that the random slot machine (that is the KSP contract system) pumps out now and then.It\u0027s about as random as a slotmachine, you can get 3 berries or 3 x 7, KSP doesn\u0027t give a #@!*#@\u0026amp;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis should also be incredibly easy to program. The KSP universe starts at a fixed date with the planets at a fixed position. So a toddler could program the actual time frame in which these contracts should spawn in your contracts list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAtleast these missions don\u0027t spawn in the early career game when your reputation is to low. But they also don\u0027t when you do have higher rep before your first Duna launch window (or Eve for that matter)\u003Cbr\u003E\nAtleast not in my case, and I got my rep very high in one of my savegames prior to my first Duna launch window. So that\u0027s the overal silliness of the contract system for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very important atleast to me because since it\u0027s random the contract system oftenly refuses to spawn Duna missions in the contract window when Duna does reveal itself in a desired relation to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\nVery Ironic, because I want my Duna missions to earn money. When I go to Duna first time in 1.2 I want multiple sattelites being sent right there immediately on the first transfer window.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nPreferably including atleast a fly-by contract if not a additional contract to obtain experiment data around Duna and it\u0027s surface.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso I want the contract system to have the intelligence to determine that I have actually send a mission to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd when it detects this that the contract system atleast spawns 1 additional mission with Duna in this case as a target in the next week after signing the first Duna contract so I don\u0027t have to wait 2-3 revolutions around Kerbol to do a 2nd Duna mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, certain game activities seem to trigger certain contracts. So it might not be completely random. However, I don\u0027t know this for sure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it seems that when I go interplanetary from the get go the contract system seems to spawn more interplanetary contracts from there on.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe you\u0027ll have to go interplanetary first before such missions are spawned in mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing is, I don\u0027t want THAT!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the early career, either Duna or Eve are months away from their desired launch window, In those early weeks months I do many Mun/Minmus missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI want that damn contract system to give me any interplanetary missions whenever any target planet is in a normal hohman transfer window. Duna in this example, but the same goes for Eve/gilly or Ike obviously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want to install a contract configurator as a necessity to bypass this silliness or have to use the Debug panel to spawn contracts I desire in stock KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-11T11:32:35Z\u0022 title=\u002210/11/2016 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 11, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Vaporized Steel\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-11T11:40:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with everything you said except\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222796975\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022149646\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221476184801\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022108520\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vaporized Steel\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n18 minutes ago, Vaporized Steel said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile my hopes aren\u0027t high for the devs to ever fix one of the few calamaties in KSP I\u0027m suffering from since they\u0027re leaving\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReally they\u0027re not \u0022leaving.\u0022 Squad has more developers now than they did last year at this time.

Accepted a bunch of them and launched another (unmanned) mission to Duna at the next launch window. When arriving at Duna everything went wrong.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne contract wanted testing a headshield above the planet. The wiki mentions Duna can be approached by air braking and so the contract seemed to fit into a sounding mission planing. But the parameters of that test contract were so artificial that I had no chance to fulfill it with my craft and be at the right speed in the altitude range. The contract was both, stupid and very not beginner friendly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother one wanted to put a satellite in a specific orbit around Duna. Of course that orbit was so different to the one I arrived at that I had no chance for that as well. Again, not the best contract for the first few flights to Duna.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second part testing related contract was stupid and failed as well, don\u0027t remember the details anymore...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Ike flyby contract was actually a good one. Ike is so near and huge that you can\u0027t miss him. But that contract vanished somehow. Maybe it was me messing with some contract related mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo the only thing I could do was a \u0022gather some science from the surface\u0022 contract. Although I had brought in a nice but small rover. But he ended in the middle of nowhere nothing to do but driving several days to the next biome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy point is the whole contract system while being a nice start is not polished enough to give me a good gaming experience. The new player is not guided enough. At least one handcrafted Duna contract with some words about launch window and planet constellations, a rough estimation about the needed deltaV. It should also encourage a sounding mission planning, not introduce silly goals which make it more difficult. When there is a goal that makes it more difficult it needs to be optional, make some sense, give a reward that is balanced and be very verbose about the extra difficulties involved (with extra deltaV if needed). Later in the game you learn to judge better which contracts are suited for you or don\u0027t make much sense at all.

Upgrading the Admin building is fairly cheap as those things go so you\u0027ll still have, what, 6 free contract slots to use if you accept\u00A0the Duna exploration contract? Plenty of opportunity there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re really worried about it just increase the available contracts in the config files and it\u0027s a done deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nE: Also, moving the explore contracts to only show during optimum Hohmann transfer times would reverse the situation you\u0027re describing for\u00A0people doing other interesting things with those contracts, such as using an Eve -\u0026gt; Duna slingshot or a high-energy transfer; instead of you waiting with the contract in queue now they\u0027d be waiting.
