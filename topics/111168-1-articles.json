I started quicksaving after it happened the last time, but when I am designing a new plane, driving it several times, switching to the tracker (which also triggers autosave just like everything else I mentioned before), landing a plane and afterwards something goes wrong I don\u0027t want to hit load to see I am reverted 3 hours in game time, because my autosave disappeared magically.\n\nYou could start by auto-backupping since the persistant slot gets overwritten so fast or sometimes is so old it doesn\u0027t work as a failsave. From my view my plane crashlanded and since I was at the tracking station after my first landing I couldn\u0027t revert the flight after my second landing anymore and I loaded persistent and it was something massively old (like 10 hours old). It is especially dumb since I couldn\u0027t quicksave midflight this time."},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T01:34:09Z","Content":"I\u0027d love a notification window that says something like: \u0022This save is from ww years xx days yy hours zz minutes ago, are you sure you want to continue?\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T04:36:11Z","Content":"I think this is a pretty good suggestion, for the autosaves to rotate names (or something like that). Or maybe a periodic isolated save every hour or so.\n\nIn the mean time, there are a few mods that also do this for you (if you aren\u0027t opposed to add-ons). Otherwise, MOD\u002BF5 is about the only way.\n\nCheers,\n\n~Claw"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappus","CreatedById":100574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T13:23:47Z","Content":"I mean it could simply always have autosave 1-5 and always overwrites the last one and the problem would mostly be solved, because there is little chances to behave in a way that leads to triggering autosave 5 times before you do something."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:43:09Z","Content":"Autosaves seem basically useless because quickload only loads quicksaves, and exiting the game causes an autosave to happen, so you can never load any autosave other than an exit game autosave unless the game is quit due to an unhandled exception.\n\nThere should be a way to load autosaves."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T15:47:23Z","Content":"Mod \u002B F5 opens a save dialogue that lets you rename saves, and mod \u002B F9 lets you load any save from the current game from a list, I know it\u0027s not what Pappus had in mind but it\u0027s better than nothing and there are addons that improve save functionality.\n\nBut yes a better system would be better."}]}
