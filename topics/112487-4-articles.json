The logic behind it is that the recipe will essentially give you a ratio, instead of an absolute measurement. So long as you use the same cup to measure your flour, sugar, milk, etc, the ratio is preserved, and the recipe should stay the same. Of course, eggs complicate this, and they go and ruin the whole thing by measuring butter in \u0022sticks\u0022 instead of by volume, but the basic principle is reasonably sound, especially as I believe it was developed before kitchen scales were particularly widespread or easy to use.\n\nThis is false.
