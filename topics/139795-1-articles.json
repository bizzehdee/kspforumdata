This is no matter what wheels or probe core I use. I downloaded a fresh new copy of 1.1.2 and continued to have this problem, even with some of the stock rovers like Rover \u002B Skycrane and Prospector Rover (I don\u0027t see this problem with the Crater Crawler nor with the Bug-E Buggy).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, this is not a continuous turn to the right - it is only upon \u003Cem\u003Epressing\u003C/em\u003E forward. For example, from stop, I will press W and the rover will begin to move forward\u00A0and turn\u00A0right about 15\u00A0degrees or so, and then if I continue to have W pressed, the rover will continue straight at the new 15 deg angle. However, if instead of continuously holding W I pulse W for one second pressed, one second unpressed, one second pressed, etc., the rover will go forward-right ~15\u00A0degrees, then forward-right another ~15\u00A0degrees, then forward-right another ~15\u00A0degrees...and eventually I am traveling in a huge circle, without ever hitting any other key but forward. This will happen even if I disable\u00A0steering on each of the wheels. This will also happen if I try to create a rover with awfully misaligned wheels to see if it will drive left or affect it in some way\u00A0- and it doesn\u0027t. The rover does the \u003Cstrong\u003Eexact\u00A0same\u00A0thing, with no differences.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EI have tried this with a 4 wheeled and a 6 wheeled rover, and\u00A0the problem seems more pronounced with a 6 wheeled rover. I have tried it on completely flat terrain and I have tried to make sure the terrain was exactly the same for all wheels (driving on the runway and in the grass around the KSC).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried downloading a fresh new copy of 1.0.5 and this problem was no more. The rover drove as straight as could be. I even tried to create a new rover with misaligned wheels again, and even this\u00A0horribly\u00A0asymmetric rover ran 100% straight. So, this seems to be a problem with some release after 1.0.5 (I do not know which release\u00A0because as I mentioned before, today was my first ever trial with rovers). Does anyone else have this problem with 1.1.2? This seems to me to be a pretty significant bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am running Windows 10 64-bit.
