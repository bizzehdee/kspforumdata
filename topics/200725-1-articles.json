Says director-general Cernan MacKerman, \u201CThe completion of the first round of kerballed landings has allowed the technology to catch up. Using this the plan is to test long-term habitation in space with a visit to Gilly, as well as gather important scientific information to share with the space international group.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCritics of the plan and Cernan\u2019s abandonment of first-generation Triton landings say that the wide reaching plan is trying to do too much, too quickly, and not for enough scientific gain. Amberger Kerman, a science journalist and leading skeptic, claims that the plans involve \u201Cboth too much legacy hardware and too many new components. They threw out the stuff [Triton first-generation] that was working well, and want to replace it with equipment that have never been tested.\u201D Many also express the opinion that the program cost too much, more than the barely acceptable Triton program,\u00A0when that money could be used for safer, cheaper, and more investigative unkerballed craft, or just used on Kerbin instead of shot into space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSkeptics of the wide-reaching plan in the parliament that have expressed their opposition do not number enough to strike down the budget request. However, many are wary of Cernan\u2019s decisions after the KSA decided to abandon Triton Munar landings in favor of service to Munar-orbiting space stations which will be supplied by a much-delayed Pegasus lander.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNonetheless, members of the scientific community and KSA are excited about the possibilities of this proposal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-03-05T06:35:07Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2021 06:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Clamp-o-Tron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clamp-o-Tron","CreatedById":201818,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-05T07:02:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EYear 1021, Day 24\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Y21D24.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/0KvdkQj/Y21D24.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nConstruction\u00A0of the GLSSDR spacecraft (Gilly Landing Site Scout and Data Return) has begun in the KSA\u2019s spacecraft assembly building.
