Not on the economy side (tho there are options there with mods), but the mission planning and overall goal side of things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me introduce Remote tech 2. A lot of the old timers know about it. A working communication relay system that adds the requirement of having a working line of sight, or omni relay system in place to communicate with unmanned ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn v.22 career mode it also adds the need for mission control contact to relay back science data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow this affects your tech race.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Antennas draw power whenever extended. The power pinch we all felt at the very beginning with no solar cells and limited batteries is tripled when you add antenna\u0027s that cyphon power even when not transmitting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Line of sight. Antennas need a line of sight bounce back to mission control. Not a problem till you go into you first orbit... at 80km altitude, you really only have about 4 minute windows to contact the ground in every orbit, and that is only in the equitorial. Eccentric orbits can leave out out of contact for many orbits and limit contact times all the way down to seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Just science missions doesn\u0027t work anymore. There is a limit to the science you can get done with out communication satelites in place to relay data. Even the Mun is a far push out for radio, and minmus or other planets totally out of range until you start adding extra satelites. No chance to just do science until you are all done, but launches for the purpose of setting up comms links to the other worlds becomes a requirement. no science just work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI rate the addition of Remote Tech to career mode a crashing success (but only twice... stupiud sputniks). It has good intergration into the tech tree and really does add something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETell me what mods you are using to find your hard mode in career.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlacrity\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T06:10:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find this sort of question rather silly. Career mode, at least in its present state, isn\u0027t intended to be either hard or long-term. It\u0027s intended to be a sort of tutorial for new players, teaching them the basics of the game and what the parts do in a gradual fashion, so they don\u0027t get overwhelmed right off the bat in sandbox mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not a new player, then you don\u0027t need this schooling. Furthermore, you\u0027ve been doing sandbox all along limited only by your own imagination, so are quite capable of setting all sorts of challenges for yourself. \u0022Go to (insert destinations) and do (insert challenging tasks) using (insert part/mod limits or requirements).\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is thus no such thing as \u0022hard mode\u0022 in KSP. The physics behind it all don\u0027t change unless you use OP mods or cheats, it\u0027s always just a question of going somewhere and doing whatever when you get there. Adding things like Remote Tech, Deadly Reentry, FAR, life support, whatever, doesn\u0027t change this in any way. The only thing such mods do is add a few more items to your mission and/or ship design checklist. Take care of those items and it\u0027s back to business as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jwenting","CreatedById":57735,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T06:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eand another veiled demand to make things harder for the small core of experts while making things next to impossible for the beginners and casual players.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T07:17:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI run the mods in my sig.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut most importantly FAR, DRE, RemoteTech2, Kethane, B9 and KSPX and KER.

Unmanned launch of a sputnik class probe as a relay for LKO and LMO communications. Thats right... the noob launched an unmanned probe, with tony engine, minimum fuel... AND NO WAY TO TALK TO MISSION CONTROL unless I was passing directly over it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt around 63km altitude I was going to loose contact and therefore control of the ship. Thank the gods I have read wiki\u0027s and watched Manly and figured out radial in/radial out thrusting. When I lost contact I managed to get a 519km by 49km orbit. Enough altitude that on my next pass over mission control a radial in burn pushed my orbit around leaving me at 325 by 108.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for some others...
