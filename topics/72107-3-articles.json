Why not? I think its useless to force people to time warp for minutes just to fill a tank. I hate resource systems that make me do that. I believe eveyone knows how to time warp, so there is no challenge or fun in that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I don\u0027t want to implement a system that works while the ship is not focused (e.g., greenhouse that produces exactly the amount of food for the kerbals onboard). It would be cool but it is too complicated. There are too many unknowns. Is there electricity while the ship is not focused? Is it in the shadow? How many kerbals are consuming resources? Are any containers full? ... You have to simulate the whole vessel and its environment. I don\u0027t want to do this, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I hope you understand that this mod will be more on the fun and gameplay side than on the 100% accurate simulation side.

If I didn\u0027t know what the Rosetta - Philae lander looks like (awesome that you made this part btw), i might have put it on upside down. Perhaps that caused the problem posted above. It attached the second time for me. The first time one of the legs bumped into the asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- My only gripe with the conversion is that water is transformed in food and oxygen. It seems a bit to magical. Perhaps you could use something like algae that feed on water and waste to make food and oxygen. Not sure about the conversion rates, maybe less food unit made per unit waste and water so you don\u0027t create a loop. It is a bit late for me:confused:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIdeas:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Turn the water into ice and create something like a heater.

For example, I am running it on two different instsllations (clean one and heavily modded) without any issues. Have you tried a clean install with just Asteroid cities? I\u0027d bet it will run just fine. Once you keep adding more mods it will then break again. Memory is most often the problem. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I strongly doubt that your crash is caused by this mod becsuese it uses quite little memory and does nothing fancy.
