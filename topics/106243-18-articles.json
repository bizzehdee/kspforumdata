However, the ONLY thing that changed was IFS update when this started.  I had actually loaded the save and as I was going to the VAB to work on my latest miracle of space faring technology, decided to go ahead and exit to perform the update.  So...everything was fine immediately before the update...and not immediately afterward.  I am not saying it is IFS specifically but possibly having to do with the CKAN update?  Also - it might not be a save corruption it might just be looking for information that is no longer there and won\u0027t do anything till it finds it (that occurred with another mod a few months ago - but I was able to unload / reload it and fix the problem).  I can pan and rotate the view of the KSP complex, just not enter into any of the buildings or exit the program (normally).

My mods originaly assumed it was always active and expected the Resize Method to be called at startup which allowed it to store its size.. As a result, initial partmass was never  properly initialised resulting parts getting too high mass when unscalled. The problem is easily sovled by verifying initial partmass on higher than 0 and used factory mass if otherwise.\n\nThe problem of this bug is that it can go unnoticed for long, untill people start to notice their delta V is a whole lot less than planned resulting in stranded vessels and ultimatly mission failure and dead kerbals.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-26T15:00:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2016 03:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by FreeThinker**"},{"CreatedByName":"SciMan","CreatedById":12748,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-01T18:26:47Z","Content":"Slight bug, all tank setups of the included Interstellar Gas Tank have 100 ElectricCharge and 10 MonoPropellant in them, including the \u0022structural\u0022 one.\n\nI looked at the configs, and sure enough it should have 100 EC and 10 Monoprop according to the stock resource nodes.\n\nThe IS Fuel Switch module also has the line \u0022resourcesToIgnore = ElectricCharge;MonoPropellant\u0022 in it.
