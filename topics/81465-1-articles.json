There have been some updates, one of which is the inclusion of contracts, of which I am being offered none and another a budget of which I have 10 000 units. This is clearly an oversight. I have already been to Duna and its moon and back. I can\u0027t even exit the atmosphere for 10 000 units (maybe I can but I\u0027m not going to try because I\u0027m past that point and wish to proceed).
