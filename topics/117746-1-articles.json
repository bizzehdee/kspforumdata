However, when I checked the forums out of curiosity the other day and noticed a plethora of Star Wars crafts, I got the urge that seems to be going around. I booted up the game and whipped up this A-Wing fighter as my contribution to the SW frenzy. \n\nCapable of vertical take-off, good atmospheric handling, and space flight, this little guy is a blast to just play around with or use in your epic Star Wars armadas. Part count is 176. Enjoy!\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

And since they were SO low mass, docking them was a mess, since SAS would freak out. Actually, they were the reason I never released it. ^^\u0027\n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s not a trick.

The issue those reaction wheels solved was a) be low mass so I didn\u0027t have to put a bigger counterweight, ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) carry no fuel so their mass didn\u0027t change in flight and, yes, c) add some cheaty longitudinal stability, for pitch/yaw control with almost no lever arm.
