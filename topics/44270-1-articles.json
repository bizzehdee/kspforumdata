I now have a fully blown KSP problem. When I go to bed my last thoughts are how I could tweak my latest ship and as soon as I wake up I\u0027m into it. My wife and child are distant memories. Wife is now calling me \u0027Colonel\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just posted about a bug I\u0027m having since I bought version 21 from the store but won\u0027t go into it here. I gather I can\u0027t see it at the moment because I\u0027m a newbie on the forum or do all posts have a bit of a time lag before you can see them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I\u0027ve launched a neat little space station and successfully got one of the little kerbo\u0027s back and was rather proud of the fact I landed him right next to the VAB. I\u0027ve now built a remote controlled (didn\u0027t want to get the KSS crowded) ship to add fuel to it and try docking. This is the mission that is bugging out so instead of playing it I\u0027m on a forum about it. Am I a sad little man?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers from sunny Aus\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHenno\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheHockeyPlayer","CreatedById":73665,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T03:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey Henno, welcome to the forums!

Docking is a bit buggy, but you do have to be almost exact to dock something. In real life, NASA has to be dead on or else everything blows up.
