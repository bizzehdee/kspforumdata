Some things that helped me: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The navball always is using one of the worlds as its origin point. If you point the little -v- indicator at the yellow dot in the middle of the brown half of the navball, you will be looking straight \u0022down\u0022 relative to that world, and your ship will be pointing directly at it. Note that when you transition to another world\u0027s gravity-simulating sphere of influence, the navball will jump suddenly because it\u0027s now using the new world as its origin point, even if your ship has not actually changed heading. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Similarly, you can point the navball -v- marker at the prograde indicator. Then you know that when you switch to map view, your ship is pointing directly along the pale blue projected trajectory curve. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, once you know which line in space you are facing, you can switch back and forth from the live view to the map screen, and just roll the ship until the other two spacial axes line up with the map view. Then, fly the same direction in space as on the map view. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Once you get used to that, you can line up on the sun, or a part of the background nebula, or a constellation, etc., whatever is easiest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also used to help me to put some little piece just above the door* of the crew cabin of the rocket, like the small hardpoint here: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Yorr3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022Yorr3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebecause then I could tell at a glance that this direction was \u0022up\u0022 for the navball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*On the new 3-man capsule, it should go on the side with the windows, between them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sneezedr424","CreatedById":33670,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-26T21:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you need buttloads of fuel to go inside the sun. I used the TARDIS mod from kerbalspaceprogram.net because it has unlimited fuel. You blast off, and dont stop going. Keep burning. look at your map. if you burn long enough, you\u0027ll start following this random green line. turn off your engine, and coast all the way past that line. If you dont use time warp, then it\u0027s gonna be a while. You\u0027ll pass that line, drift for a bit, then POOF! You\u0027re orbiting the sun. Then all you have to do is burn retrograde untill your orbit is small and thin enough that it goes through the sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWARNING: If you use any rocket (I may be wrong) other than the TARDIS, your ship will explode because physics engine goes against u. If you use the TARDIS, your time warp becomes disabled until you exit the sun. It\u0027s horribly boring, and I suggest you leave it alone untill it get away from the sun.

As alluded to upthread, a bi-elliptic sundive can cut the delta-V needed to attempt a sundive from a starting point in LKO by more than half, at the cost of spending a /lot/ more time doing it.
