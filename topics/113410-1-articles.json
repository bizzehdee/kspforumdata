Landing struts sink into the ground, and other crazy things happen that prevent the kind of perfection required for surface docking. I can\u0027t spend 45 minutes docking for every fuel run. So my next solution was just go with the claw for this purpose. Ah, so much easier!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while my fuel lifter is filling up with fuel, I went back to put my over-extravagant, high part count mother ship into Minmus orbit from Kerbin. This thing is like a self sufficient ark, with about 9kdv, room for 20 Kerbals, great science lander w/ attached rover that \u003Cem\u003Eprobably\u003C/em\u003E can land and return from Duna, lab, a mining probe and ore converter, all powered by 24 nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs soon as I hit the time warp to the next maneuver, the ship comes apart and everything but the cockpit plummets toward Kerbin, triggering a spectacular chain of explosions and flying debris. Reloading doesn\u0027t help, but fortunately restarting the game did cure the problem until I could get to Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI haven\u0027t seen this before. My big mother ship has been fooling around in Kerbin orbit for a while with no issue other than the expected bad framerate. My question is, was this attack because of the claw? Is this something that will get worse while a working claw is in the game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T14:45:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EImpossible to say for sure, but I\u0027d say that very probably yes, it\u0027s the claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESaw the title of your post and thought \u0022probably the claw\u0022 even before reading the post. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Prepper-Jack","CreatedById":143834,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T14:52:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard the claw is the go-to tool for summoning the Kraken, though I\u0027ve never personally witnessed it. I\u0027ve been careful, however, and only been using claws in low-part count cases like rescuing a single capsule or rocket part, and in short durations for refueling landers. General advice seems to be to keep claws away from terrain as a whole, and not use them for permanent connections.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have had a large ship spontaneously disassemble, however. No explosions, but every connection just vanished. No existing claws at that time. I\u0027ve also seen videos where this has happened, and caused explosions, but these ships usually had a lot of clipping - which may have been the catalyst. I\u0027d guess the two issues are unrelated, other than being physics bugs.

New fuel trucks arrived in the orbit, but they didn\u0027t have enough fuel left for landing (a freshly manufactured batch, flying empty to pick fuel), so an older truck that was currently receiving the fuel on the surface had to fly to refuel them enough for safe landing. And ovbiously it was docked to the carrier bringing the truck... by the claw.
