First, my Kerbs discovered Minimus.\n\nThen, they discovered Tecto in it\u0027s orbit of Sarnus. Not that unreasonable, as it\u0027s the biggest moon, and it wouldn\u0027t have been inposible to find both before Jool.\n\nThen, they found Tal, in it\u0027s orbit of Wal, without finding Urlum first!\n\nThen they found Polta, and Urlum as a result.\n\nThen they found Ovok.\n\nThen they found a world I created to mess around with Kopernicus textures.\n\nThen, they found, finally, Eve, and Duna.\n\nFeeling creative, I hyper-edited a probe into Sarnus orbit and set up an encounter with Eeloo. However, most astrophysicists of Kerbin still seem convinced that Eeloo is a class-C object.\n\nIt\u0027s a great idea and a wonderful mod, but I think some of the which-planet-is-found-first logic could be improved upon."},{"CreatedByName":"simon56modder","CreatedById":119640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-02T16:14:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s a great idea and a wonderful mod, but I think some of the which-planet-is-found-first logic could be improved upon.\n\nDon\u0027t worry, I sent a message to CaptRobau, he will include the priority file in his mod in the next release. So you should discover Jool before Sarnus.\n\nI think I sould also modify a bit my priority system. \n\nThe problem with Tal, Wal and Urlum is that when you click research and that the random result is Tal, it figures out which Celestial body Tal is in orbit of, and if this orbited body is not yet tracked, it tracks it both with Tal, but the system doesn\u0027t go further !
