Most efficient would be to have nearly empty cargo holds that get filled with some asteroid mining once in system.

You\u0027ve mentioned that the destination is an exoplanet mapped some ninety years prior to the launch of your generation ship. Ninety years is a \u003Cem\u003Elong\u003C/em\u003E time, in human terms: roughly 3 generations, or 22 election cycles in most democratic systems. Plus, starships - whether they are multi-generation slowboats or near-c speedsters - cost a \u003Cstrong\u003Elot\u003C/strong\u003E of resources. So what\u0027s so important that humanity (Earth? Some planetary colony, or perhaps a solar-system wide culture?) invests the time and money to build, crew, and launch this ship towards a planet that is known only in the history books - and which nobody who boards the ship will ever see? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPossibilities include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EScientific inquiry\u003C/em\u003E - human exploration of the exoplanet may not have been possible at the time of the robot surveys, but it is now (or at least, barely possible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EExporting of dissidents\u003C/em\u003E - In the past, a number of cultures solved internal clashes by sending their malcontents somewhere else to live as they please. The ancient Greeks used this strategy to settle all around the Mediterranean, Europe exported a number of religious and cultural groups to North America, and so on. It was a win-win situation; both the dominant culture/polity and the malcontents got what they wanted. Future cultures might try this again to keep ethnic/cultural/religious conflict at home to a minimum. Such a political motive might also explain the sudden interest in a planet 90 years after it was first surveyed. (However, if you go this route, you\u0027ll need to take into account why these dissidents are being sent to another star, rather than to homestead somewhere else in the Solar System).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDesperate survival\u003C/em\u003E - Something Very Bad is about to overtake the human race or some fraction therefrom. There might be a plan A in action to deal with it, but the generation ship is plan B .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESome or All of the Above\u003C/em\u003E - Each of the above reasons is enough to launch a starship, but multiple reasons certainly increase the odds that a ship will be built, and built well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mention this because purpose will affect how your ship is designed. A scientific expedition might have a minimum population needed for genetic stability (probably fortified with a gene bank), but a migration program or survival contingency will probably aim for a much larger starting population (10,000 minimum). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA smaller population might keep itself together in a single habitat rather than subdivide into smaller groups. After all, if you\u0027re near minimum needed population, losing a good-sized fraction to an accident is pretty much the end of the entire mission right there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA larger population however, would see advantages in dividing into two or more smaller habitats as part of the starship. For one, redundancy. If your 10,000 are divided into, say, two groups 5,000 strong, and something happens to wipe one of them out, the remaining group can still go on to found the colony with a minimum of fuss. A second reason is to promote cultural diversity and cultural interchange. Generation ships have a major problem in that they are, in essence, island cultures and if you have only 1 culture present, it can decay quickly. A bad idea that gets a hold in the culture can spread far and fast, wreaking damage that will be felt for generations, if it doesn\u0027t destroy the culture outright. Contact with Earth, via radio or message laser, would be too far away for any kind of cultural support. Having a second culture interacting in real time with the first provides some insulation against bad ideas taking hold, and can provide stimulation and inspiration as the two cultures share concepts during the voyage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a division could give you the rationale to having two separate habitats, be they rings or cylinders. One might even have two (or more) separate ships - one per culture - flying together as a fleet, each ship within a few kilometers of the other. Or the ships could be connected by tethers during cruise mode (thus providing an easy means of transport between ships - and a plausible something which could Break with Disastrous Consequences for the plot).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Impaler","CreatedById":133913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-13T03:34:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMuch simpler to have a single wider Torus with two adjacent counter-rotating wheels inside it, the wheels are in contact with rails, motors and brake-shoes between each other to spin up and spin down.

You probably won\u0027t get the delta-V you need from just an inertial fusion drive with onboard fuel/propellant, though - maybe something like \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/slowerlight.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ea Bussard ramjet\u003C/a\u003E? Those are tricky, because you have to do proton-proton fusion (which is hard), and also because it\u0027s very hard to go faster than your exhaust velocity, since the drag from all that hydrogen you\u0027re collecting slows you down. Still, for a generation ship, 12% of light speed isn\u0027t terrible, and collecting your propellant from the interstellar medium means you won\u0027t have to worry about gigantic propellant tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are lots of different possibilities for very strong deep-space propulsion systems.

Personally, I love to go into the technical details about stuff in my writing, but glossing over is often recommended for this kind of thing, because it gives you more wiggle room and doesn\u0027t get you caught between the rock of your plot and the hard place of scientific realism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000CD;\u0022\u003EClosed cycle life support, algae farms, yeast, made into palatable dishes?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--According to my mother (a biology professor), this could actually be substantially harder to do than a sufficiently powerful propulsion system. Sure, it can be done, it\u0027s just that there are a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of variables to account for, and a lot of really tiny things that need to be kept alive. It\u0027s possible to do this, but you\u0027ll need to make sure that your crew is very careful not to destabilize anything, and that you have lots of buffering options to keep stuff stable as inevitable changes in environmental conditions occur. This isn\u0027t as simple as just having enough plants to make oxygen for your crew, you also have to take into account all the microbes that plants, humans, and whatever other critters your bring along are going to depend on. The biosphere on Earth is very interdependent and adapted for exactly the conditions on Earth, so getting it to thrive in a spaceship is going to be a very big obstacle. Make sure you have lots of room for storing oxygen, CO2, and trace nutrients, some chemical reactor systems to stand in for various biological processes in case of emergency (ie a CO2-to-oxygen recycler if all your plants die), and lots of space to store emergency food. You\u0027ll also probably want some frozen microbe cultures too, in case someone has a gut flora problem or one of your artificial biomes loses its microbe population.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000CD;\u0022\u003ECommunication system with earth?

You can decide what wavelength you want; I hear that microwave lasers are relatively easy to make powerful (and go through gases with minimal loss), but you can also try to go for visible light or even shorter to maximize your range.

The need for human input does seem rather inevitable, but for the most part, a society advanced enough to build a Bussard ramjet and maintain a stable ecosystem inside a spacecraft shouldn\u0027t have much trouble making a near-totally-autonomous repair system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000CD;\u0022\u003Ecargo for setting up colony on extrasolar planet\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--Sure, just disassemble the habitable modules of your ship and fly them down one by one. If you pick a planet that already has life, good luck - even putting aside the possibility that someone sentient lives there, the interaction between Terrestrial life and alien life is going to be very unpredictable and probably dangerous (don\u0027t go around eating whatever you see, and be mindful that breathing near something is probably a good way to kill it, or you - the the microbes in your body might be extremely infectious to local species, and vice versa). Maybe you could go for something where the planet\u0027s temperature is perfect and it has liquid water, but its atmosphere isn\u0027t breathable and it has no life? Then a human could walk around with just a breathing mask. Of course, you\u0027d probably start terraforming the place right away whether you wanted to or not, because you\u0027d track microbes all over the place and leave behind tasty chemicals, and eventually you\u0027d introduce something that likes the local environment, and, \u003Cem\u003Ebam\u003C/em\u003E, proto-biosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to be\u003Cem\u003E really\u003C/em\u003E clever and wildly speculative about colonizing a planet containing life, you might do some large-scale preparation in advance: send a sterilized uncrewed probe to the surface, take samples of the local flora and fauna, and then either grow yourself some humans that can exist in that environment, or else find a way to convert a living human to be compatible. You\u0027ll then need to grow enough specimens of local wildlife to use in your shipboard biosphere, and then maintaining that gets a hundred times harder than it would be if you used Earth life. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of this has some pretty serious ethical and logistical ramifications, obviously, but could easily make for a very interesting story.

(would that be necessary?)(i do want rings, more space for population that way)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--You could have variable-angle floors (probably by having the rings made of a number of cylindrical modules, and then just rotating those). Easier than that, though, would be to design the ship for an always-running propulsion system. You\u0027d get where you\u0027re going a lot faster if you have some kind of torch drive that burns constantly throughout the trip - accelerate constantly up to the halfway point, then flip over and decelerate the rest of the way, which will bring you to a stop at the destination. This has another added bonus: if you were to fire the engine hard enough to accelerate at a constant 1 gravity throughout the trip, you could do away with spinning entirely, and have the gravity come from the drive alone. A Bussard ramjet could probably attain this kind of power, but in all honesty you\u0027re probably better off with an unspecified handwavium stardrive (or antimatter, but you said you didn\u0027t want that) if you go for this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegardless, You\u0027ll probably want to plan for having the engine on more often than not, because doing a short burn at the beginning of your trip and then trying to coast the rest of the way will probably not get you there in a short enough time to be meaningful (try millions of years). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you really want your ship to hold up to lots of varied thrust, variable-angle modules would work well enough, but like the counter-rotating rings idea, it just doesn\u0027t really seem necessary for the kinds of things your ship will be doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis sounds like a cool story!
