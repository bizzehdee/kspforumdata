Well, because it\u0027s still not assembled! \n\nFirst stage separation!\n\n![OyL31lg.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OyL31lg.jpg)\n\nThe drone leaves the cargo bay. In the background, Kraken starts lurking. Surprisingly, this time the Kraken was not related to the Klaw. It was the big separators that summoned it... two times.\n\n![O9amBk3.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/O9amBk3.jpg)\n\nPreparing to move the monopropellant tank into position. (it also serves as an adapter for vessels that dock with the Klaw.)\n\nThe monopropellant is only for the drone. The ship\u0027s RCS uses Vernor engines, LF\u002BOx.\n\n![duB45o1.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/duB45o1.jpg)\n\nAnd here\u0027s the Kraken.\n\n![OJHZuli.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/OJHZuli.jpg)\n\nAfter reloading the game, I continue moving the adapter modules.\n\n![cC82sXl.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cC82sXl.jpg)\n\nAnd the first engine!\n\n![uOMgSxr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/uOMgSxr.jpg)\n\nEngine installation almost complete.\n\n![REaufbp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/REaufbp.jpg)\n\nEngine installed!\n\n![M57R7ZJ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/M57R7ZJ.jpg)\n\nDecoupling the module storage bay again, summoned the Kraken. Also, I forgot to put batteries in it. So, another piece of space junk ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nNevertheless, ready to move the other engine into position.\n\n![5Huh7K2.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/5Huh7K2.jpg)\n\nInstalling.\n\n![VITVQhv.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/VITVQhv.jpg)\n\nThe drone is parked. Finishing touches\n\n![tT0BE2B.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tT0BE2B.jpg)\n\nAnd here\u0027s my new Tug.\n\n![m18xs1X.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/m18xs1X.jpg)\n\nTest burn - circularizing the orbit.\n\n![SkxO4rV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SkxO4rV.jpg)\n\nA photo with all the adapters (there\u0027s room for the Sr. version when I develop it, and whatever else I might come up with.\n\n![l6aiQOL.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/l6aiQOL.jpg)\n\nAnyway, the only two blunders were the lack of battery on the storage module, and no dedicated oxidizer tank (needed for Vernor engines, RCS.) Still, it used several small tanks for \u0022structural purposes\u0022 (mounting the engines, the klaw adapter, the Jr. to standard adapter) so it has enough oxidizer to last it some time... and will steal some from the \u0022customers\u0022 ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) Plus the big reaction wheel works fine, so it doesn\u0027t need much fuel for the RCS.\n\nThere, my first orbital assembly complete.\n\n![mXkXmhD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/mXkXmhD.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T16:09:18Z","Content":"That is a very...unconventional construction ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) You will have a lot of trouble balancing it with any payload attached to side ports."},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-20T18:37:04Z","Content":"The side ports are just for accessories and other lightweight stuff.
