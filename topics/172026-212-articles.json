There you can change anything you want if you understand the code (i don\u0027t tbh, got lucky since what i was there for is kinda clear) lastly if you want specifically what i did for transmitters then open warpPlugin\\Beamedpower\\BeamGenerator.cs and change\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nline 63 \u003Cspan\u003E: \u003C/span\u003E[KSPField] public double powerMassFraction = 0.5;\u00A0\u00A0 to: [KSPField] public double powerMassFraction = 0.005;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nline 178: targetMass = power * powerMassFraction * 0.001;\u00A0\u00A0 to: targetMass = power * powerMassFraction * 0.00001;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nline 189:\u00A0 targetMass = maximumPower * powerMassFraction * 0.001;\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 to: \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 targetMass = maximumPower * powerMassFraction * 0.00001;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand click F6 for compile,\u00A0 then you go to C:\\Users\\Username\\source\\repos\\KSP-Interstellar-Extended\\FNPlugin\\bin\\Debug or release\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsort by date, and copy the interstellar.dll to your C:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kerbal Space Program\\GameData\\WarpPlugin\\Plugins\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand replace it (do backup of original tho)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat\u0027s it, yes i just pasted some zeroes hehe but its good inaf for me to call it done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhope this helped you. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-06-09T20:46:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2024 08:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jun 9\u0022\u003EJune 9\u003C/time\u003E by Mystos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MrWizerd","CreatedById":106063,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-07-03T05:16:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224253652\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172026\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678156293\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022224282\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KolonelKerbal\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/6/2023 at 6:31 PM, KolonelKerbal said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve encountered a bug, I think.

mod.\u00A0 I have done some work on it many years ago, and thus I am fairly familiar with it and love using it.\u00A0 I have got to the point in the game that I will be able to start using KSPI-E properly and thus decided to do some work adding containers, refiners, reactors and such using the resources I have.\u00A0 Last night I found the MU import/export plugin for blender so I may after figuring out how to use that be able to do custom skins for LLL for many of the reactors and such.\u00A0 The problem I am having right now is that I am adding in the all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E so I can start up my transuranic element harvest and refining loops.\u00A0 I started with round tanks but they do not look like much for a base so to LLL I go.\u00A0 I decided that the 2.5m units more or less fit inside the 2x1 units and so converting those was a synch the problem is in making the larger 2x1 units.\u00A0 They should be producing roughly double and some change and be slightly more efficient but I would accept double.\u00A0 Some of the modules that have inputs and outputs are easy to adjust and I have done most of those but found that there are a lot of automatic ones that seem to maybe have a size modifier.\u00A0 When I look for instance at the refrigerator there is a\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0

double here is two and while I have not tested this exactly it makes sense and likely works that way.\u00A0 The processor works this same way for the Ocean, MethanePyrolysis, etc so I could move those but I am only assuming this is what they do.\u00A0 I will test them later, its just hard to build stacks to do that quickly so its a little slow.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026lt;\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0MODULE\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0name =

require tweaking or are they based on the size for the atmospheric processor.\u00A0 If not is there a place somewhere that discribes the method to make the converters make, use and produce more for a larger size unit?\u00A0 If I were to increase the size of the 2x1 it would increase its volume by roughly 8 times, if I just stack the module it increases by 2.\u00A0 When I used tweak scale an increase in the atmospheric processor on the refrigerator got to around an 8 when it was like 5m.\u00A0 The tanks are a lot more forgiving for sure, but I am sure to run into similar issues trying to convert the reactors and thermal electric generators and such.\u00A0 Luckily I was not planning on making any of those any bigger than they are.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know if they have tweak scale on them I haven\u0027t checked but my assumption is that there going to be a bit of a bear after a quick once over of one of the CFG\u0027s\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny direction on this would be
