Alternatively, you could change it to be FSanimateGeneric and use the firespitter plugin, which comes with the advantage of actually playing the animation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I will second this and say that pretty much everything TweakableEverything does needs to go stock, sooner as opposed to later. Right now, it\u0027s just an interim patch to fix an incomplete feature.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
