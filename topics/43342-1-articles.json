It is extremely hard to create a craft that can take a load of fuel down to the surface of the Mun, refuel another craft AND get itself back up into space!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMay I also suggest that for this scenario you use MechJeb to guide your landing. Once you have seen how MechJeb does it then you can do it yourself, but spot-on landings such as are needed for refuelling are very hard and need a lot of practice first. If you don\u0027t want to use an autopilot then I suggest you rescue BIll and leave the craft until you are much better practiced at precision landing!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1D-1()T","CreatedById":75340,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T08:49:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have any fuel left?
