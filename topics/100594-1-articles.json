During flight when an aircraft goes above FL180 (18,000 ft) it changes from Baro pressure at the nearest airport to 30.15 IIRC. The craft is no longer referenced to the ground pressure anymore.

Most areas of the world are radiation cold spots, there are hot spots and people do live in them with no observable ill health consequences. One of these areas is in Northern Iran and there is no increased tendencies in cancer or birth defects with radon sourced radiation about 10 fold higher than normal. During a flight you have 5 fold higher than that, and it probably puts some of the fastest growing cells at risk, for a man if you were to say conceive in the next 48 hours your child might have a slightly higher risk for birth defects. And pilots who concieve after the age of 40 would have a much greater risk. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that nothing unusual or to be worried about. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe types of exposures that greatly increase are the absorption of certain isotopes into the body, such as following chernobyl. These isotopes concentrate in the body in places where they can do excessive damage or next generation risk. This is not solely restricted to radio-isotopes, a much bigger problem in places with high rates of uplift (e.g. India) is the level of chemicals (such as arsenic a phosphorus mimic) that occur and can cause damage over time. The environmental risk areas with chemical hazards are much greater than radioactive damage, and whereas the bodies damage repair generally recognized radiation stress, it does not always recognize chemical stress until its too late. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you were to increase the rate of radiation exposure by increasing the planes altitude to say 3Gm from earth and then accelerate it in the direction of some local recent super nova, that story would change rather markedly since you would be not only increasing the amount of energy of particles hitting but very much reduce the shielding.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-24T21:53:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat dosage, although interesting, is hilariously not lethal.
