Do you think they will be a threat to the dominance you\u2019ve established so far this year?\u201D I shifted on my feet and heard a puddle slosh under my boot.

He was lying down on the track, staring up at the sky. The trophy was next to him, gleaming in the street lights. I stopped and smiled.

So I was probably also thinking how I could impress a girl with a trophy.\u201D Max grinned, and we both chuckled. I felt a buzz in my pocket and checked my phone. Andy had scheduled a debrief for the following day at 8. I was happy for Arcazon, but I had to shift my focus. I\u2019d gone six races without a win, now; the longest stretch of my career.

The track detail was especially thick this week since the Solarian GP circuit had undergone a big re-profiling since the last time we had visited the circuit. As such, Andy made sure that we got even\u00A0\u003Ci\u003Emore\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0studying in for the upcoming race weekend.

The fact that we had these reports\u00A0\u003Ci\u003Eevery week\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0made me a bit nervous about the state of our printers and the health of forests.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNew report for you,\u201D Andy said, popping his head in the door.

Instead of a simple on/off switch, the Power Modes had turned more into a slider.

Today we say hello to Solaria: Home of space travel and a stunning race circuit nestled on the coast of this Kafrican nation. Following a thrilling race last race, rookie Arcazon Kerman is looking to rekindle the magic after claiming his first career victory- at his home race, no less. While the rookie rose, the veterans faltered. The race exposed the big dogs of OTech and Monster, who are looking to return to form following a wild race in the rain.\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u201CNo rain expected here today, though, in this gorgeous city. With 20 turns- nine to the left and eleven to the right- this circuit features some of the more dramatic elevation changes on the calendar. Renovations over the winter have re-profiled four sections of track, which will only add to the excitement that\u2019s in store for us today. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the commentary booth! My name is Jim Kerman, and joining me is 2025 K1 Champion Jeremy Kerman!

The telemetry looks good, so you can come to the grid if you want. Remember to deactivate your Fails on entry.\u201D I did my best to limit strain on the engine by shifting up extra early and coasting and running the added Fail Modes. Even though it was just four races into the season, the team had been busy with upgrades- 11 modes for both Engine\u00A0\u003Ci\u003Eand\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0Electric power, eight specific default modes, and over 20 fail modes that we probably wouldn\u2019t even need. I was grateful for Landin\u2019s help in managing everything from the cockpit. As I coasted down the hill, I noticed a slight dissipating cloud in front of me. I turned into the banked Turn 18 and felt the rear slip out a bit, despite going so slowly on practically fresh tires.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CHey, there might be some fluid or something on the track in Turn 18.

A small trail of smoke was still coming out of the rear, and I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be good for the team. I shook my head and listened to the team radio for a little bit before stepping out of the car. A few cameras clicked and rustled as I passed, but it was mainly silent on the short walk to the start-finish line for the anthem.

Get-away will be about that off the start.\u201D I weaved down the straight before negotiating the first turn- a tight hairpin with loads of runoff but little grip. Turn 2 was an uphill, nasty corner that had a raised curb on the exit. The car got light on the apex, and I knew it would be difficult to make a move- or even hang onto the car with worn tires. Our first re-profile came in Turn 4. It was tighter than before, but the banking had been raised to help us speed through the corner. However, one benefit was that Turns 5 and 6 had been re-profiled to have less of an aggressive bend, which would help maintain speed into Turn 7.

I was glad that the clunky right-left hairpin was finally gone, as it opened up a new opportunity to carry momentum. The uphill straight of 11-12 felt even more dramatic this year, but I enjoyed the aggressive climb. Turns 13 through 16 had gotten a new look as well, with the chicane essentially being smoothed out to allow for more speed through the Loop.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGrip feels good.

I wasn\u2019t bothered in Turn 1, and I let my breathing begin to relax on the corner exit. There was a slight lockup from one of the cars behind but no significant contact as the field started to thin out. Max led from P2 away from Michael, Juan, and Lewis, who had leaped up from a P7 starting spot. The car got light over the rise in Turn 2, but I kept it pointed in the right direction before Turn 3. Max was trying to close in, but the dirty air wasn\u2019t helping at all as we climbed the hill into the Stadium. I exited the long corner and heard a loud noise from the crowd as a cloud of smoke appeared in the second corner. The lights on the steering wheel didn\u2019t change as I took Turn 4 for the first time at speed.

Max was too far behind as we entered the braking zone and focused on playing defensive against Michael. I attacked the curb and exited the corner right in the middle of the rumble strip as Michael came under attack from behind. I navigated Turn 3 and tested the limits of grip out of the corner. Max couldn\u2019t keep up, and by the time I broke for Turn 4, he was already over a second back.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201COvertake has been re-mapped to Default-Three.\u201D I dove through Turn 5 and ran wide on the curbs before I responded.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGot it.\u201D I spun the thumb-wheel to reduce the normal engine mode, transitioning out of the restart phase and into the race phase. The car reacted well through the high-speed Turn 7 as I carried all the speed I dared. I touched the curbs on the exit and went back up the track to get ready for Turn 8, braking smoothly. The apex was smooth, and I made sure to use every bit of curb that I could since we knew from practice that it wouldn\u2019t cause a risk of spinning. The wall on the exit wasn\u2019t a concern, and I stormed through the chicane as hard and fast as I possibly could.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CFantastic stuff, the gap is already growing.

The car flowed through 13, and I powered out of the corner to fly through The Loop. I turned the engine up to Rich to get as much speed as possible, combining the strength of the power unit with the gravity from the hill. Sparks came off the rear of the car as I hit the bottom of the hill. I ran through the banked Turn 18 and immediately got going back up the hill. The left-side tires got up onto the runoff curbing, which created a loud buzzing sound before I came back on the racing line.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CGrip is absolutely fantastic,\u201D I radioed in before rising over Turn 19 and then diving back down the hill. I felt the car get a little bit loose over the crest, but I held the wheel firm and kept the nose pointed forward. The braking for Turn 20 was clean as possible, and I attacked the curbs both at the apex and on the exit.

The battle behind him had gotten incredibly tense, with Louie storming up from 6th place at the restart and applying the pressure. However, the biggest surprise was Lewis, who made the engine work a treat down the long straights and actually took the fight to Michael in the battle for P4.

Tire wear was much better than we expected, which helped me blast off fast times even after 11 laps. I dove into Turn 1 and rolled over the curbing that had already started to develop a fine line of rubber. The car shook over the exit curb at low speed before putting a tire past it and onto the runoff. The smoothness allowed me to accelerate up into Turn 2, and I cut down onto the apex curb. The rear got loose, and I fought the oversteer before flowing uphill into Turn 3- my heart beating just a little bit faster than before.

The guys said everything in there was totaled.\u201D I nodded just as a loud noise came from the crowd, followed by angry yelling. Arcazon laughed as I turned around to see Hope being led away from Juan\u2019s car, shouting in Feguan and waving her arms. \u201COh gosh, she hit him,\u201D Arcazon chuckled, looking at Juan, who was yelling back, even though the two were separated by 3 or 4 team members.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201C\u003Ci\u003EYou ruin my race!\u003C/i\u003E\u201D Hope yelled through her heavy accent, holding her hand out at Juan.

The air temperature of 40\u00BA was making everyone cold since we were used to much warmer temperatures on race-days. I looked at the newer tire compounds (Marked as \u201CCompounds\u201D One through Five) piled next to the car, as well as the base prototype car that everyone had been given to test. Each team had been given one prototype, which mimicked what the series expected our 2039 cars were supposed to look like. It was a massive departure from anything I\u2019d seen before, with a newly re-designed front wing and a smaller rear wing than before. The back end was more tightly packaged on these cars, with the unfortunate removal of the shark-fin design. Even with all of these changes, everyone\u2019s attention was drawn to one piece of the vehicle. The Aeroscreen. Despite calls from teams and drivers that the design wasn\u2019t needed, K1 had mandated the new windshield design for the upcoming season.

Built on a former airbase, the NCA was a circuit that would really test everyone. Two high-speed right-hand corners would make the tires really stress, but the long straights on the old runways would serve to break up the fast corners. I was excited to be testing at this circuit, which couldn\u2019t have hosted our first Pre-Season test due to the weather. The newly constructed esses were exciting to look at from a distance, rising from the ground like a snake before dropping down to rejoin the main straight. 19 turns- 10 to the right and 9 to the left- made up a fantastic circuit.

The raceway had a classic design, with grass runoff on the exit and walls close to the line. Some areas, like Turns 1, 5, and 9, had lots of runoff in the event of a big accident. However, others, like Turn 4, had walls that were close- ready to catch a driver that tested the limits.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThere\u2019s not a lot of grip,\u201D I radioed in before slamming on the brakes for T3. \u201CWhat compound is this?\u201D These prototype tires were very lacking in grip, but that\u2019s what testing was for.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThis is C4, second-hardest compound,\u201D Andy responded. The car created a trail of sparks as I swung through Turn 4 at full-throttle. I went up onto the tarmac runoff and almost lost the rear. I corrected the car but ran past the white line, drawing notice from the stewards. As I climbed the track to the next corner, Andy was back on the radio. \u201COkay, that\u2019s another warning, Jeb.

The rear started to swing around, and I tried to correct, but it only added to the force of the slide. The vehicle went onto the dusty runoff on the corner exit and swapped ends, covering my view with a cloud of white smoke. I got off the gas as the car looped around. The squeal of tires changed from asphalt to gravel, and I eventually came to a stop with the engine at idle.

The rain clouds had dispersed, but it was still difficult to see through the remaining wispy clouds. The recon lap had been clean, but I was still nervous with the start coming on the intermediate tires. The rain had been present all weekend, but some dry running in Practice 1 showed promise when the track dried off. The crazy weather all week had thrown the grid into a bit of chaos. Arcazon, our newest wet weather prodigy, had blasted up to P5 in qualifying and would have gotten further if Riley Mitchell hadn\u2019t run wide out of Turn 12 and looped it out of the corner.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0The circuit was challenging to get a hold of in the dry, but even more so in the slightly wet conditions that we were experiencing tonight.

We were running a medium-downforce package for the race weekend, which really would help in the high-speed sections.

I looked down at my helmet and shrugged. The lighting later in the race would mean that a clear visor would be more beneficial, but the early race rain and the sunset brought the need for tinting.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI think the first tear-off sheet is tinted,\u201D I said as I fiddled with the flap. \u201CThe rest are clear.\u201D Max nodded and looked at his helmet before turning back to look at the rest of the grid. \u201CI think Michael\u2019s gonna be quick off the start.

The lighting in Turn 11 threw me off a little, and I missed my apex, but Michael didn\u2019t have enough room to attempt a pass. The black and green car had the grip on the corner exit and closed onto my rear just enough to take a look. The circuit was too tight to make a pass, and I held my position- for now. I turned the engine up to Overtake down the short straight before releasing it, shooting into the 120\u00BA Turn 14.

The engine echoed off the concrete before I dove to the right under braking, stealing the position back. I ran a bit wide, and Michael tried the switch-back. We climbed the crest, and I barely held onto the position through the left-handed Turn 17. The spray was a lot more apparent in this part of the track, where the drainage wasn\u2019t as well-developed. I followed the racing line into Turn 18 and under the hospital tunnel- a feature that, as you might expect, was a tunnel that went through a local hospital. Michael went wider over the curb and onto the ambulance runoff before returning to the racing line, taking a risky path due to how the wall stuck out. If you want too wide, you made contact with the wall before making it to the runoff. Not wide enough, however, and you just ended up weaving and possibly opening up an overtake for cars behind. I broke for Turn 19 and was cautious on exit, not going next to the wall. Michael had to correct his vehicle and allowed me to get a slight gap that I immediately erased on braking for Turn 21. A double-apex right-handed hairpin, Turns 21 and 22 were difficult to get right even in the dry. I went deep on the brakes at Turn 21, and Michael took advantage, sweeping past me on the inside of Turn 22.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CMy fault,\u201D I said over the radio, fighting the spray and getting grip to sling into the left-handed Turn 23.

We whipped through the right-left-right of 27, 28, and 29 before flying up the hill. The spray was most intense as we climbed the arch-like bridge, but it was wide enough for me to quickly make a move if I wanted to. I held in the slipstream of Michael but didn\u2019t make a move, instead biding my time and looking to set up a pass down the straight. I followed him through the apex of Turn 30 before we shot uphill, joining the highway through Turn 31. We had a brief reprieve from the water before coming out from beneath the overpasses, and I was hit by a wall of water. I kept my eyes on the flashing lights of the car ahead before pulling out at the very last moment, taking the left side down the long front straight. The slipstream had allowed me to pull alongside, and, with the help of Overtake, the engine helped me get a nose out on Michael.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u201CAbsolutely fantastic battle here down the front-straight, as Jebediah moves to the outside!

Meanwhile, behind, Max was engaged in his own fight- trying to chase us down while Arcazon hounded him for the final podium position. I kept behind in Turn 3 as we crested the hill. Michael did the same thing to me that I did to him on the opening lap- covering off an attack by defending the apex. It made for a bad run on the corner exit, and I took to the right side of Turn 5- a left-hander that went downhill on exit. I almost lost the rear and had to gather myself after giving him a gap.

He looked inside of Michael into Turn 4, and he didn\u2019t defend, which led to the rookie taking the line. Michael had to give way, and Arcazon rolled past without losing any time to me. We raced downhill in Turn 5, and I held my ground in 6 and 7. Michael latched onto the slipstream of Arcazon and blasted past around the outside. I had to take the defensive line down the straight and into Turn 8, which bunched all of us together. Michael re-took P2 but couldn\u2019t get past me for the lead, while Arcazon held back. The spray that had once blinded cars behind now was little more than a mist, and it was challenging to keep the tires from overheating.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;color:rgb(0,0,0);vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CThere\u2019s almost no spray..

As Michael moved to the left to attack me, Arcazon did the same- sending us three-wide into Turn 1. Arcazon was the first to back out and followed me through Turn 1, but Michael actually held his line reasonably well. I was just able to clear him out of Turn 1, but he out-broke me into 2- forcing me wide at the hairpin.

Monster was a team with two significant factors in its competition with OTech: Their Chassis and their Pit Stops. The Monster GP car had a much better weight balance than ours on the inside and a much more powerful aerodynamics package on the outside.

Michael and I dove into our respective pits at the same time. Four intermediate tires went off, and four dry tires came on, along with a reduction in the front wing angle. The crew got me serviced seemingly as fast as usual, but I was held as Arcazon\u2019s car went past. Michael hadn\u2019t been forced to wait for as long and got a good launch out of his box, which meant that I had to wait for both cars to pass before I could release.

The summer sun was glaring down on us, causing me to sweat. Still, I enjoyed the break playing some soccer for fun. Kim was in her own offseason at the moment, relaxing after a strong season that earned her the Bronze Boot, which signified the most goals in the Division. However, her strong performance in the regular season just wasn\u2019t enough, and River City missed the playoffs. To keep us both in shape, I had volunteered to defend some penalty kicks from her in the yard. Needless to say, she was proving why she had the silverware on her shelves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAre you sure you can handle it?\u201D She was trying to hold back a smile, holding her hands on her hips.

Kim took three steps back and two to the left, lining up her shot. I saw her eyes go to the bottom left corner, so I got ready to jump. She took two steps towards the ball, and I leaped, but the ball never came. I hit the ground as Kim moved off the stutter-step, sending the ball screaming into the back of the net. Kim covered her mouth to muffle her laughing, but Max wasn\u2019t remotely interested in protecting my feelings. His full belly laugh echoed through the neighborhood as he went to his knees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYou good?\u201D Kim looked over at my limp body, walking in circles to blow off the giggles.

I slowly pushed myself off the ground and made my way over to him, brushing grass off my shirt. Before I got there, he looked up at me. His face was confused, and I slowed down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIs something wrong?\u201D He looked at his phone and shook his head in confusion, running his hand through his hair. \u201CI..

In a bit more than 10 minutes, we have some news coming out of Monster Race Team! We\u2019re hearing that they are having a press conference, but first, we have a quick run-down of the Silly Season! It\u2019s already been announced that Matthias Blomqvist of Carthia is leaving the team at the end of the year to retire to greener pastures. However, Matt, what other changes do you see coming?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI expect a shakeup at Monster, for sure. I\u0027ve heard some rumblings through sources that their young driver, Louie Kerman, is falling out of favor with the Angel City Team. If you look at the results, Louie Kerman has just not been cutting it recently, and that team is in win-now mode. What has he given them so far this season? A P5 in Carthia, a race he had a good opportunity to win at one point? A P11 at the Aquarian Grand Prix? With Michael Kerman challenging for wins and podiums throughout the season, he needs to step up. Obviously, the team won\u0027t outright say it, but that is what I have been hearing. I think that the press conference coming up is going to be something to do with their 2039 driver lineup- or at least one of them.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat\u2019s the midfield looking like for you?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CIt\u2019s obvious that Adam Gardner is absolutely not happy in that car, so I expect him to be announced as out by the time we reach the Temple. Of course, looking around, I think that Emily Walker might be staying put, but I\u2019m hearing a lot of rumblings about her teammate, Riley Mitchell! Mitchell has had an outstanding season to this point, but Walker has been really kind of struggling. I think that you can count that to being the backup in an all-rookie lineup, but I think we might see an open seat in Kindia. Otherwise, I don\u2019t see a lot of changes, except for perhaps the Archer team. They\u2019ve been languishing down there at the bottom of the field, and Lucas White, let\u2019s face it, isn\u2019t getting younger. If I were Lucas, I\u2019d definitely be considering hanging up my helmet after the final fireworks are off in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWhat about next year\u2019s rookies?\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u003Cem style=\u0022color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0e101a;\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u201CKelli Blue has gotten massive amounts of hype coming out of Fegeland, and, if my sources are correct, she\u2019s all but signed for Carthia on the dotted line. Meanwhile, I see Carlos Kerman slowly moving up on teams talent boards, which not many people expected! However, if Blue falls through, Hayden Bryce from Carthia is a perfectly reasonable driver for Carthian Motors to pick up to partner Arcazon. If this happens, it will reunite their K3 lineup with the departure of Matthias Blomqvist, but insiders have told me that-\u201D\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CI\u2019m absolutely stunned that you haven\u2019t brought up your favorite driver yet!\u201D\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell, I\u2019m saving the best for last, Michelle!

Wow, this is a lot harder than I thought.\u201D He chuckled and looked at his notes before glancing at the executives to his left and right. He had a sheet of paper in front of him, and it rustled beneath the mic. Michael was typically calm, cool, and collected. Now, however, he looked distracted and nervous. \u201CSorry, um\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019ll just get started with all of this, then.\u201D Realization slowly dawned on me. \u003Ci\u003EWe\u2019re going to have a grid without #3 next year.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CWhen I started out in K1, it was 17 seasons ago.

Looking back, this career has been one that... That I will cherish forever. I\u2019ve been grateful to have the support of the people around me. Of course, Dominic, who brought me back to Monster a couple of years ago. However, I am also thankful to others who work a bit more behind the scenes.

Max extended his hand for Eve to grab, and he pulled her over the wall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CYou good?\u201D Eve nodded through the helmet, turning back around at the car. She took her gloves off before removing the helmet, leaning on the concrete wall. Her hair fell to her shoulders, and she scowled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CI have no idea what happened\u2026 Damn.\u201D She leaned over and shifted the legs of her firesuit before letting two gel kneepads fall from near her shoes. She picked them up and threw them in her helmet, still looking over at her car. After removing two elbow pads, she turned around and stared up at Max with a raised eyebrow. \u201CWhat happened on your end?\u201D Max shook his head as the rain fell harder.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CJust too wet.\u201D Eve nodded as the Safety Car approached from the pit entry. They both watched as the cars rumbled past before stopping in the queue. Max looked at me roll past and sighed. \u003Ci\u003EDamn.\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E{Jeb}\u003C/i\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003EI took my helmet off and looked around as the team worked around me. I stood and immediately saw Max off on the side, walking back into the garage. I decided to leave him be as I got out of the car, walking around my car a couple of times to survey it. There was no damage to the body, aero, or suspension; the lack of grip was 100% down to the water on the track. Andy and Landin both approached me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CMax went off on his own.

I saw the fans beginning to file out of the stands and nodded. The puddles on the track were reflecting the amber lights, and the water pools were only growing. I shook my head, walking back into the garage. Max was nowhere to be seen, but I noticed his gloves had been hurled at a cabinet. I heard a loud yell from inside the driver\u0027s lounge and a smash behind the door. I turned around, giving Max his space. I walked out of the garage and immediately was met by the press. One reporter came to the front, Claire Rivers. She had the TV camera in tow and was the first to ask the questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CJeb, you were talking on the radio for a few laps about the conditions; how bad was it out there?\u201D My mind thought back. The series had let us out in those dangerous conditions, with all the standing water, and had let us go on. I shook my head, trying to keep from saying something that would hurt later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CIt was\u2026\u201D I sighed, unable to say much. \u201CI mean, you saw it.

The car had been smashed into an unrecognizable wreck on the left side, and it had taken a flatbed to just get it onto the cargo plane. He watched the replays again, shaking his head. I reached my hand across the aisle to give him a shake, and he weakly hit my fingertips.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CIt\u2019s not fair, man. I know it.\u201D Max nodded, pausing the video. \u201CYou deserved that one.\u201D He shook his head, staying silent for a moment. After a few seconds, he looked at me out of the corner of his eye.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CWere you following team orders when you let me pass?\u201D I chuckled and shook my head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CHeck no, Landin wanted me to stay ahead of you. I just knew that I couldn\u2019t stay ahead in those conditions. I figured I\u2019d let you go ahead, realize how bad the grip was, and then call for Default Map 2-1.\u201D Max nodded, looking out the window at the storm before turning back to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CIf they had just stopped it one lap earlier\u2026\u201D He paused, sighing. \u201CIt just doesn\u2019t feel fair.\u201D I shook my head and reached across, putting a hand on his shoulder as the aircraft began pushing back from the gate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ci\u003E\u00A0 \u00A0\u003C/i\u003E\u201CNothing you could have done, bud.

But that\u2019s how it goes sometimes.\u201D I now had a 19-point lead heading into the Hermish Grand Prix at a brand-new circuit. The engines began to rise in volume as the aircraft prepared to take off into the stormy evening sky. With a win, I could lock the title if Max finished third or below. I sighed and looked at the trophy in the seat next to me. I didn\u2019t really feel like I had earned it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarkOwl57","CreatedById":161624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-02-06T02:01:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is turning into one chapter a year almost, BUUUUUUT I\u0027m back at this again.

Inflander Circuit, Hermia\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0The press room was almost capacity, with at least 50 or 60 reporters crowded in amongst the cameras. Cameras flashed as we got ready, and I looked to my left. Louie leaned with his elbows on the table, looking down with a shaking leg. Even though he had won in Basil, rumors about Monster\u2019s second seat being open had swirled around since the Summer Break. After Fegeland- Louie\u2019s home race- the team had announced that the seat was open, just without Louie in contention. Marty Williams and Riley Mitchell were the prime candidates for the seat. Still, Louie hadn\u2019t been confirmed to any rides for the upcoming season. It would be a massive mistake if he were released, but much of the grid had already confirmed their driver lineups. Louie\u2019s leg shook rapidly as he tried to burn off the nervous energy. I put my hand on his shoulder and leaned in to be heard over the chatter in the room.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAre you feeling okay?\u201D Louie looked up at me and nodded, leg still shaking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CY-yes\u2026 Thank you. I am\u2026\u201D he exhaled and moved his hand through his hair. I noticed that his accent was much stronger than usual. \u201CIt has been a crazy two weeks.\u201D Though we were on rival teams, I felt terrible seeing Louie go through this stress.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAlright, if we could all settle down, we will get ready shortly!\u201D As everyone got ready, the chatter died down, and Louie wiped at his eyes. It was going to be a rough week for him. \u201COkay, so this is Jebediah Kerman, Driver 13 of OTech; Max Kerman, Driver 33 of OTech; and Louie Kerman, Driver 10 of Monster. Questions are now open.\u201D The cameras flashed, and there was a clamor for questions before the host pointed out a reporter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CJebediah, you\u2019re heading into this week\u2019s race with a 19-point lead. You clinch the championship with several scenarios. The most likely of which is a win for you, with Max getting no better than 3rd. What are your thoughts on possibly clinching the championship a round early?\u201D I nodded, thinking it over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CWell, it\u2019s a special opportunity, but I think that we\u2019ll have to see how the car is on track. Max is a talented driver, and he\u2019s not going to go down without fighting hard for it.\u201D There was another clamor for attention before the next reporter was called. It felt as if every reporter in Hermia was here for a Thursday Press Conference. The racing culture in the nation was incredible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CLouie, are you surprised by the decision, and was there any warning this might happen?\u201D Louie\u2019s eyes were wide, and I could tell his heart was racing. The rustle of the camera shutters was almost deafening. Louie took a shaky breath and accidentally bumped the microphone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CUhm\u2026 Yes, I... I was surprised. I understand that I have not been performing as well as I could this year, but\u2026.\u201D He sighed, shaking his head. \u201CI thought I had more time, that is all.\u201D\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAnd did you have any warning?\u201D Louie looked down at the desk for a second before looking back up.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNot until after the last race.\u201D There were some more questions for Max and me, but Louie got the final one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CLouie, do you have a seat lined up for the 2039 season? With the end of the year coming up, there aren\u2019t many drives that are still available. Do you know where you\u2019re going for next year?\u201D He looked away from the reporter and shook his head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CNo... No, not yet.\u201D I felt horrible for Louie.

Jebediah Kerman and OTech lead the championship by 19 points. Still, there\u2019s no chance his teammate, Max Kerman, is going to give up without a fight. However, this new circuit- the Inflander International Circuit- will throw a curveball into the mix for all of the drivers on the grid. With 17 corners, Hermia\u2019s Inflander Grand Prix Circuit is bound to send drivers for a loop. Welcome, one and all, to this exciting edition of the K1 World Championship! My name is Jim Kerman, joining my esteemed co-commentator in the booth, Jeremy Kerman. Jer\u2019, this is looking to be a thrilling race in-store today.

I think we are going to have a thriller today! The cars are fast, the drivers are ready, and the weather is fantastic! However, not everyone is feeling happy heading into this one. Unless you\u2019ve been hiding from the media for the past two weeks, you\u2019ll know that this man on your screen now, Louie Kerman, is out of a job going into next year. He starts in P3 today, and he\u2019ll be looking to signal his intentions to the other teams around the paddock. Now, who will replace him? According to insiders, Marty Williams and Riley Mitchell are the two prime candidates, and they start alongside each other on the grid in P7 and P8.\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E[Jim]: \u201CAnd another big talking point is the schedule for next season!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E[Jeremy]: \u201CYes, of course! The 2039 preseason has been announced, with two new circuits for 2040- Kafrica and Owlia- hosting the tests. We\u2019re looking at two fast circuits with plenty of speed, but nothing has been finalized for whether they will join the schedule. Should the Angel City circuit be announced, it would be a huge blow for the Owlian Grand National Raceway, which has hosted races for over 20 years. However, looking at today, this Hermish circuit is going to give us a fantastic spectacle. With all of this and more in store, it\u2019s time for the exciting Hermish Grand Prix!\u201D\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E\u2026\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0I sat in my vehicle with the engine rumbling behind me as the team finished their final checks.

As the team moved to the side, I wiggled my shoulders to get ready. The downhill run into Turn 1 was unique, and I was a bit nervous to see how it would go. Still, the Pole position was the best place I could be in for a situation like this. I pushed in the clutch as the light went from red to green. A quick push of throttle and a released clutch shot me forward, and I managed what little wheelspin there was at low power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CStandard stuff, make sure to warm up the tires.

The sky had shown threats of rain earlier in the morning, but those clouds had since cleared out. Despite one of the most challenging weekends of his life, Louie had put the car in third on the grid, lining up on the outside slot just behind me. Max made up the middle spot of the Top 3, but he had only just beaten out Louie to the place. I felt confident heading into the race. Turn 2 was an almost blind hairpin that was downhill, requiring concentration to not mess up. It was followed by a slightly less steep climb heading up a long straight to Turns 3 and 4. The esses of 5, 6, 7, and 8 were easy to take at low speed, as well as the tight Turn 9. The rest of the lap was mainly spent warming the tires and bunching the pack. I exited Turn 16 and got onto the 1.2km long back straight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CRemember, Default-Fifteen on the Start.

Eve then spun sideways and out of control before slamming into Matthias Blomqvist.

He tried to correct it but shot back to the right, sending the car into the tire barrier. Both the left side and the tail were torn to pieces as the tire barrier spat it back out onto the runoff, where he was lucky not to get hit. Matthias was spinning wildly out of control and was thrown backward into the gravel trap. In the chaos, his hand had been slammed into the sidepod during the impact that measured almost 15G. After the contact, Alexia had suffered a broken suspension and rolled past the carnage, pulling off to the side at the Turn 1 Marshal post entrance.

Max had a much better launch than I did and took advantage, drawing alongside me before I had a chance to cut down to the inside. I noticed Louie had run wide over the raised curbing on the corner exit, and then the chaos ensued behind. I cringed and ran my hands through my hair when Eve slammed into Blomqvist.

The left side had been flattened, the rear was just shattered into pieces, and everything except the right-front suspension was shattered. He doubled over for a second with his hands on his knees but started slowly walking down the track to the Turn 1 Marshal Post. Alexia pulled her steering wheel off the car and pulled herself up, quickly getting out of the vehicle. She sat on her left-front tire, looking across the gravel trap at Eve\u2019s car. Her hands were on her helmet, watching the scene. Matthias was the last one out of his car, holding his left hand after being lifted out by the safety crews. Finally, after another couple of minutes, Eve could crawl out from underneath the car. She slipped through the hole the marshals dug in the gravel trap and slowly scampered out.

The wheelspin was unexpected and I pursed my lips, upset at the mistake. I would just have to hope that the restart was good enough to get the lead back. Arcazon, who was back in 10th, was still sitting in his car. I noticed that Monster was focusing on the car\u0027s right-rear, but I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. Once the vehicles had been cleared from the gravel and the runoff, the debris was quickly cleaned off the track. The tarmac had scars and marks from the accident, with a trail of fluid that had been dried leading into the gravel trap. When the announcement was given for the drivers to return to the cars, I was more than ready.

How are we looking for the restart?\u201D The race start had been in Default 15, which had the same power deployment as the MAX mode. However, it was mapped to the higher end of the rev range, which was supposed to reduce the wheelspin on launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CLooking good, we\u2019ll be in Default-Nine.\u201D She pointed to my steering wheel before looking back at the tablet. \u201CDo not use it past Turn \u003Cem\u003EFive\u003C/em\u003E, please.\u201D I made a mental note to change the dial back before the esses began. \u201COvertake Map to Default-Seven on the opening lap, then drop to Three.\u201D I nodded, moving to twist the overtake dial.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CAm I allowed to fight?

I looked in my mirrors at Louie, who was talking with his crew over some final adjustments. The green #10 seemed to glow against the black nose, which looked menacing, to say the least. I clicked the visor down, and the noises were slightly quieted, allowing me to focus. We would have a rolling restart with the Safety Car leading us to the flag. I did a final check of the steering wheel dials.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CBlankets off.\u201D The team removed the tire blankets and showed the shine of a fresh set of rubber. I looked to my right and saw a camera pointed at my helmet, so I gave a small wave. After what seemed like an eternity, the green light at the end of the pit lane came on, and Max got away from his spot. I quickly followed, exiting the pit lane on the inside of Turn 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CRemember to warm the tires. We did a gear check on the start, but just cycle through before the back straight if you can.\u201D I did the same process as the first start: Warming the tires, checking the fuel, and putting myself in the right mental space. I saw the bright white OTech logo gleaming on Max\u2019s rear wing, and I knew that I would have to pass him at the start to have much of a chance. We exited Turn 16, and he slowed, allowing the Safety Car to get a gap away from the field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E[Jim]: \u201CThe Top 3 in this race all going for the lead, of course, but everyone with something to fight for.

My breathing sped up as I mentally counted down for the release. Max typically didn\u2019t have good launches, which I was hoping to exploit.

Max had a terrible run, spinning the wheels briefly, which allowed me to slingshot up behind him. He had no chance as I started closing in. I took the left side, which was the outside for Turn 3, but it didn\u2019t matter. Max had to leave space on both ends as Louie came alongside, and we passed on either side of his car through the left-handed Turn 4. The crowd roared as we passed, signaling their appreciation at the move.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0Max saw both cars split on either side of him and almost lost it in 3. The sudden move by both cars meant that he had lost all the momentum with an overcorrection, which meant that he now had even less speed down the straight into Turn 5. Michael stuck the nose in down in the Turn 5 braking zone, but Max still hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock of the two overtakes. He left the door wide open for Michael into 5, where he eventually got past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E[Jim]: \u201CNow, Max leading from Jebediah, Louie, and Michael Kerman, up out of the corner, and Williams has made up places at the start- BUT HERE COMES JEBEDIAH KERMAN!!!

He lunged up the inside at Turn 9, forcing me high. Further behind, Max locked up in the off-camber corner, allowing Jesus to slip clear before the apex. I managed to switch back on Louie on the corner exit and drew alongside out of 10, using the momentum to get by. The steering wheel alerted me to the charge levels, but I couldn\u2019t afford to reduce the engine modes now. I turned up the Harvesting mode into Turn 11 before slamming the brakes, but Louie did a better job of going deep.

I was able to keep getting to the outside, but he squeezed me up the track to get a better line for himself. He swept past on the inside, and I had to give way to avoid running over the sausage curbs on the inside apex of Turn 14. I lost time to Louie ahead and groaned, eventually backing off. Michael was looking to make a move to pick up the pieces, but he was too far back to do anything down the straight. I went deep on the brakes in an attempt to gain positions, but Louie was too far ahead after a clean run through Turn 14.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCharge is less than optimal here; we need you to conserve deployment down straights. Max has fallen to P6, so this position is critical.\u201D I turned the fuel mix up to compensate for the reduced electric deployment, moving to the inside as Michael started to close. The massive straight was perfect for slipstreaming, and I knew that any defense would be difficult at best. Michael used the slipstream as I ran to the white line on the right, trying to make any move as difficult as possible. He ran to the left of the track, and I followed as he drew alongside, trying to get the best line into Turn 17. I got the better dive on the brakes into the hairpin and stayed ahead, using the run out of the corner to get clear.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CCar ahead, Plus One-Point-Five.

I again got a better run, now free from worrying about the electricity. Further back, Max dove up the inside of Juan into Turn 1. Sparks flew from the floor as he pulled the move off, running up onto the exit curb after clearing him.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003E[Max K.

He had overcorrected and spun to the right-hand side, heading into the runoff. I saw it almost in slow motion as his car turned, creating a brown cloud behind it as the vehicle slid over the grass and eventually the dirt. Louie was helpless as the car slid sideways.

The car had hit left-front first by a small margin, sending the car into a minor spin and barely reducing the impact force. Both vehicle and barrier were lifted into the air by the power of the crash, but Louie thankfully avoided flipping. When he landed, the car was obviously totaled. The right-hand side had some significant damage from the landing, but the major damage was at the rear and left of the vehicle. The impact to the Left Front had ripped the wheel off the suspension and essentially backed the car into the wall. The rear wing was gone- likely in a literal million pieces- and the Left-rear tire had been torn free of the tethers from the crash, and the right rear suspension was broken with jagged rods poking up.

They\u2019d definitely gotten their work in today, and I respected them for it. The team was ready to congratulate me as I unbuckled my belts upon parking. I couldn\u2019t get out of my car fast enough and practically leaped off the nose of the car.

I extended my hand to help him out of the car, which he took, and I wrapped him up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u201CYou deserved this one.\u201D He shook his head and hugged me before releasing me.
