On the other hand, I\u0027m not really sure how good of an idea it was to get it, with two exams left to be done at Uni next week.. But, I\u0027ll manage! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, so far, I\u0027ve managed to launch my Kerbals into space, build something that very barely represents a space shuttle and actually flies and after a lot of trying and tinkering around, even construct a rocket and a lander that can take my Kerbals to the Mun / Minmus and back as well! But of course, before I managed to do so, there were \u0022a few\u0022 mishaps bound to happen.. Jeb for example, was brave enough to land on the Mun, take off, come back into Kerbin\u0027s orbit, but ran out of fuel to actually re-enter...
