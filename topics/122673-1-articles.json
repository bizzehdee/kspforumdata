It would be nice if they could make the panels adjust their radiation/absorption based on the auto-rotation. But even if they can\u0027t do that because it\u0027s hard for some reason, then at least don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Elie\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to the player by making the panels appear to rotate. Why not just have them be simple, fixed, non-rotating things that just extend/retract?
