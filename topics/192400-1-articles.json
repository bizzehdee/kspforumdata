I activated Phys-warp so I could speed up the journey a bit, but (as it was a new save) the notification came up saying that warping can affect big ships. I pressed the button several times, even pressing lots of other buttons on my keyboard (That went well :P). It looked like it had pressed the button, but nothing happened. I also noticed a similar issue almost anywhere I had to press a button.
