It doesn\u0027t do it very often for me though. It sometimes doesn\u0027t minimize for hours and sometimes a couple times in 5\u00A0minutes. I was trying to correlate it to other open apps, like browser or spreadsheet but nothing obvious so far. It seems to do it more when actively flying rather than in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E... but maybe it just ticks me off more when flying so I remember it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRunning 1.9.1 on Win10.

KSP minimizes when I press something (say, \u0022m\u0022 for the map mode) but Windows think I\u0027m pressing a Win\u002BM shortcut.
