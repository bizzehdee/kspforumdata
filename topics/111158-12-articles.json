Couldn\u0027t that help reassure users when you guys just want to participate in a discussion, and don\u0027t see any need to step in otherwise? I\u0027d like to understand what the potential pitfalls might be.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI share the view that a moderator\u0027s words will always be read with an undertone of \u0022official\u0022 noted around it. Some users even hold a belief that moderators are Squad employees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crux of the \u0022if users need special fonts or colors to figure out when you\u0027re moderating then you\u0027re doing it wrong\u0022 is that, when posting in a moderator capacity, it should always be done in an extremely clear manner. One of the things that moderators need to be most cautious about is not inadvertently weaving in personal opinions and thoughts into a post that\u0027s meant in a moderator capacity. That\u0027s much easier to slip up on if one relies on using color coded words to delineate personal opinion from moderator action. Even worse, is when personal thoughts are posted in a post that locks the thread. It\u0027s something that I generally try to avoid, and that (to me) is the essence of \u0022you\u0027re doing it wrong\u0022 if people can\u0027t tell.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a guess as to which thread you might be referring to. Most specifically, when emotions are worn down, there\u0027s always an air of \u0022moderators waiving around their authority\u0022 regardless of the capacity in which they act. This is a primary reason why I avoid personally commenting in contentious threads. Which is unfortunate because I certainly have opinions, but have to forfeit some of them for the sake of neutrality. Anything I say pro-Squad (regardless of the color font) comes off as \u0022moderators are fanboys.\u0022 Anything said that is anti-squad can (and sometimes does) get quoted later as if it comes from squad itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if that really answers it for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
