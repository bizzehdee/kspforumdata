Here is a pic of one of the many concept plans for it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www3.gobiernodecanarias.org/medusa/ecoblog/mgaryan/files/2013/12/1991-hermes-dessin.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221991-hermes-dessin.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here it in top of one of the proposed launchers, the Arianne 5:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://astrotek.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/hermes_4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022hermes_4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to try to make a mock up of this shuttle in stock ( note, mockup, not replica. I just want the basic features in, not the looks ) and after some days working I got to the Moho shuttle, in top of a Arianne 4 mock up:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/xaNUHdp.png\u0022 alt=\u0022xaNUHdp.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that the pic above is from a earlier interaction ( I forgot to take a pic of the current version in the launchpad ), but the changes made after this were mostly cosmetic.

View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do find that it actually is a very balanced rocket and the shuttle itself is far better than I was expecting ( hence I reserve the right of changing the wings to something more close of the original Herm\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A8s plans ( and probably add chutes to that version ) ). Just don\u0027t expect a lot of cargo in the cargo bay \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, here is the craft file. If someone wants , I might provide the shuttle subassembly, but that can be easily taken from the rocket above, since the shuttle does not contain the root part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/o056l5wfvag1nx1/Moho\u002BDelta\u002B2.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Craft Here\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome warnings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) The shuttle in top makes the rocket to turn westwards if launched from the orientation it has in the save. That has a reason ( to help in the \u0022gravity\u0022 turn ), so change it at your own responsibility. Also it is recommended to not disable SAS in the first 10 km, exactly because of the westward turning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Because the shuttle does not contain the root part of the rocket ( that is the probe part of the auxiliary stage ) on separation the action groups of the shuttle tend to not work. if that happens activate engines manually via right click ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I changed the download link.
