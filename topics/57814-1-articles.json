Built a tiny bi-plane, super stable, stalls at 30ish m/s and fitted with the little material bay, a goo container and a little antenna. All good at ground level, basically lands itself. But 4 hours later can I land it on some of the flatter areas, can I hell. At 4000 m you have to fly at about 80m/s and at landing it just can\u0027t stay stable on the uneven ground. Best I\u0027ve managed was to leave a cockpit and two wing bits littering the wilderness. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anybody else out there managed to land an aircraft on the mountains, and even better have it in state that it could fly home again? At this rate I\u0027m going to have to cheat and parachute a probe or something down there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EXrayLima\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snarfster","CreatedById":80347,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T21:54:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is parachuting a probe down cheating?

If I just can\u0027t do it, plane on chutes is the next best option.
