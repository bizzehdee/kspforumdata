You are safely coasting to apoapsis at that point anyway. Wait until you are out of the atmosphere, then time warp. You can tell MJ to circularize your orbit for you when you get to apoapsis if you think it might be miffed that you cut it off early \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lobsterbark","CreatedById":57253,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T08:07:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou should be able to warp on the pad, or when you are still.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lacedemonian","CreatedById":79686,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T18:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022flightmaster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022flightmaster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou aren\u0027t allowed to time warp in any of the situations you mentioned, it\u0027d be something to do with putting ships on rails within an atmosphere.

For instance, he cant time his launch because that requires using time warp and physics warp is not fast enough and destroys everything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T18:55:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou do know your replying to a post that\u0027s months old, right?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
