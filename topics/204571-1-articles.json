I am on 1.8.1, sitting on a rather hefty list of mods, mostly engine packs and Real Exoplanets. I really don\u0027t want to do a full modlist check, since I have a large pile of mods, and the game already takes long enough to load. Anybody know any mods that clash with KSPI-E? Also, deleting the part won\u0027t help, as playing this self-made \u0022modpack\u0022 before had the same issue, and I\u00A0just got stuck on the next part.
