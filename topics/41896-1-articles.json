And for these activities, kerbals will need various things and equipment. Here are my thoughts about how this may be implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe obvious solution is to make inventories for kerbals. These may be made of cells like in Diablo or list of items like in Fallout. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may be limited by weight or size or both and the limit may be individual for different kerbals. Items\u0027 weight will slow down kerbal\u0027s movement speed (until full stop) and reduce efficiency of their jetpacks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you control a kerbal, there will be a special key that opens the inventory and you can pick the item and use, equip, deploy, drop, give it to another kerbal or put it to some container. Two latter options basically mean opening another inventory and interacting with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a kerbal dies, his inventory stays (if there was no high speed impact) and can be picked up by another kerbal. I would like it even better if dead body stayed too and you could loot it and then bury or return to Kerbin (and stack behind the VAB)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECommand pods will have bigger inventories that can be filled in VAB or on the launch pad (in career mode this will cost money). Kerbals can use these inventories in IVA mode, so IVA becomes somewhat useful. If the ship has several command pods, you can transfer items between them without kerbals having to go EVA and carry these items (like the fuel is transferred now).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere also may be various boxes, containers and cargo modules that can be used in EVA. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf inventory capable part is destroyed, its inventory may stay or be destroyed too, depending on impact velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat can be stored in the inventory:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Parts (small debris can be picked up and disassembled to parts)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Tools (can be equipped)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Flags\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Ground samples and whatever else kerbals can pick up on the planets\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Scientific equipment\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Jetpack fuel. This will be a part of inventory and kerbals must resupply it from a limited amount in the command pod. Or they may take it from monopropellant tanks. This systems allows kerbal to become lighter when he spends fuel and also allows sharing fuel between kerbals.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Other types of fuel. Fuel can be taken from tanks and poured into other tanks, so we have refuelling without docking or fuel lines. Good for rovers and small things.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Jetpack itself may be part of inventory. So kerbal can choose between different jetpacks (for example, big one with more dV or small one which is more powerful and allows to move faster) or go without jetpack and run faster and carry more other items. There also may be a parachute that can be taken instead of jetpack (so there will be no need for command pod saving system)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Oxygen, food and water (if there will be life support someday)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my vision of how inventory system can improve the game and add more possibilities and variety to it. I think the developers already have something similar in their plans or may be deep in the game code, but I didn\u0027t see any detailed suggestions on this subject. So here\u0027s mine.
