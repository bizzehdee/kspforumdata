Launch into a 90 degree polar orbit using the Mun for angular reference (since it\u0027s inclination is 0 degrees to Kerbin), as close to noon time as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

Adjust solar inclination to noon/midnight by burning anti/nominally at the poles (think of your polar orbit as its own \u0022equator\u0022 with the sun as the inclination target). You will have to eyeball it since there is no exact reference point to the sun except the visible daylight termination points on either side of the planet. Adjust your polar plane to slide between those two termination points and you\u0027ll be at noon/midnight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Adjust polar orbital inclination relative to the Kerbin\u0027s equator or the Mun, to 89.68 degrees to precess the sun synchronus orbit to account for annual drift caused by Kerbin\u0027s orbit around Kerbol, so that you are always above Kerbin at all points in your orbit at noon or midnight local time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis orbit will allow your satellites to always pass over any spot on the planet always at noon or midnight local time, which is perfect for eliminating shadows and thus perfect for spy...er scientific imaging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-12T16:06:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2013 04:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by inigma\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Shifty","CreatedById":68146,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-11T18:18:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m trying to understand how the orbit processes.

IRL SSO Sats use the bulge at the equator of the earth, and take advantage of the perturbations caused by that deferential in the gravitational field to torque the orbit by about a degree a day in order to maintain the orbit in a sun-relative position. Kerbin\u0027s gravitational field is perfectly spherical, so there are no such perturbations produced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe polar inclination you indicate would make no difference. I think what you\u0027re proposing is a powered orbital adjustment to maintain the sun relative position....which is probably a good role for an ion engine because nothing else will have enough dV in it to allow that kind of annual change for any useful Satellite mission time. However, you\u0027d still have to go back to the flight about once a day to make the adjustments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
