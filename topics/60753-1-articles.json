I\u0027m not sure how useful the station will be, maybe it\u0027s just for practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m playing in Career mode because I liked the idea of needing to acquire science using parts that might not be up to the task to unlock the really useful parts. So it\u0027s quite possible that a lot of very important station building parts aren\u0027t available to me yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first unit consisted of a command module, hitchhiker container (for kerbals to live in) and a Mobile Processing Lab (with the theory that I could dock probes there to unload their science and reuse them or something). I also remembered solar panels, batteries, and lights. Once it was in orbit I EVAed a kerbal and got him to the command module (I remembered ladders!) so he could control the thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice, however, that I forgot to add any sort of RCS or monopropellant. This made my first docking experience quite an ordeal, since I couldn\u0027t orient the station very well. But I finally managed to get my Fuel Section docked and attached, including some monopropellant tanks and RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far the station is basically a long tube.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question is coming up. But a little more background is important.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have an asparagus setup for putting my pieces in orbit. It\u0027s a fairly normal rocket, except at the top it has a docking clamp. Then I design a piece for my station and attach it to the docking clamp. This results in a somewhat topheavy-looking rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the main problem is when I lift off, the docking clamp between my asparagus rocket and the station piece experiences a lot of stress. It starts to wobble and eventually breaks off and everything blows up. To fix this, I built some Strut Connectors between the rocket and the station module. This strengthens the thing enough to launch with no difficulty. My thought was when I undock the docking clamp, the Struts will break.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was my plan for attaching my Fuel Section to my Command/Science section. It seemed to work, I got them docked, and I released the clamp from my ship. The Struts broke, and the ship and station were no longer connected. The station looked nice, and I thought I had figured it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Fuel Module was pretty empty though (sending it up full made my rocket too heavy) so my next job was to make a fuel tanker ship to fly up and fill up the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I designed the fuel ship and sent it up. It still takes me a while to intercept, but I finally got everything lined up (easier now that the station had RCS) and moved in to dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThat\u0027s when I noticed the PROBLEM.\u003C/strong\u003E The end of the station\u0027s Fuel Module didn\u0027t have a docking clamp anymore! It must have been damaged or destroyed back when the struts detached. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily there was another docking port at the opposite end of the station, on the command module, so I rotated it and managed to connect and transfer the fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut my station isn\u0027t the way I wanted it. It\u0027s supposed to have the command module on one end, and the new modules attached to the other end. But there\u0027s no docking port there anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESo here, finally, is my question. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs there any way to ADD a docking port to the end of my station while it is in orbit?

Not without mods or modifying the craft file manually. And if you aren\u0027t pleased with the aesthetics of adding on multi-port dock connectors to continue building, and you want to play the game clean without mods or \u0022cheating\u0022 it, then my advice would be to undock the broken module and deorbit it and send up a new one.
