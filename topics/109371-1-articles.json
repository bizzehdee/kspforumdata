This raises two problems\n\n1) My little plane won\u0027t make it on the fuel it carries and I\u0027ll probably need to upgrade to get better wings etc (manageable)\n\n2) it is a \\*long\\* flight and even at 4x speed I don\u0027t think I can sit there babysitting it - and if I step away from the keyboard you know that\u0027ll be the exact moment it decides to nosedive into the ocean.\n\nSo what do people do for long flights over kerbin? Do you wait for faster jets, or can something like mechjeb fly there for me? Not used it so far, as I\u0027m enjoying flying manually, but I might need the help.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T19:47:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 07:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by mrklaw**"},{"CreatedByName":"jarmund","CreatedById":126888,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T17:03:42Z","Content":"Mechjeb allows you to set heading and altitude hold"},{"CreatedByName":"FleshJeb","CreatedById":111640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-15T17:10:48Z","Content":"A lot of us use SMART A.S.S. in Surf mode to hold a pitch and heading.
