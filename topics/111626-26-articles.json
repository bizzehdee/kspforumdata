I opted for just letting the nosecone overheat. And go with the Oscar b in front above 10km.\n\nOne tip about the fairing. There is a feature/bug in that the part you close the fairing around does not have its drag affected at all by the fairing. And a part will have its drag increased a lot if it is followed by a smaller part, even if that is bellow the fairing.\n\nIf you where to replace the t200 tank with 2x t100 tanks and close the fairing to the one in front it would reduce drag and allow for greater airbreathing speed.\n\nWhat intake did you use?"},{"CreatedByName":"Nefrums","CreatedById":145422,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-22T18:32:22Z","Content":"For my entry I used only three engines.\n\nBy letting the nosecone overheat I was able to reach 1640 m/s in air breathing mode,  This greatly reduced the amount of lf/ox I needed to carry.
