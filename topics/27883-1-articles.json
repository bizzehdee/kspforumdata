So what would be the best way to approach this say from LKO. I dont mind if the moho orbit ends up being a polar orbit just as long as its an orbit. cheers:)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stochasty","CreatedById":57264,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T04:31:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient method is a gravity assist using Eve, but it takes a lot of work and timing to set up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Akala\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00ABl","CreatedById":58210,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-21T09:35:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou want to arrive at Moho\u0027s SOI when the planet is at is periapsis.

By the normal delta-v calculations it makes a difference of about 700m/s for the whole one-way journey. Be warned though that the eccentricity of Moho means that it isn\u0027t where the phase angle calculators expect it to be and with the inclination you might end up spending an extra 1000 or so getting your capture orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t do what I did and only allow 15% more fuel then the theoretical value and end up with two Kerbals stranded in Moho orbit unable to get home.
