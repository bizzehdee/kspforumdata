One high-ish quality picture of a relatively hard sci-fi\\* spaceship every day, for at least a hundred days. I will post the drawings here as well as Twitter.\n\n\\*Propellant tanks are required, engines must be reasonable for the context, and no spaceship-bricks. Think Europa Report or Interstellar rather than Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica. I\u0027m allowed to use Warp Drives or other FTL travel, but otherwise I will stick to using the [Atomic Rockets](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/) philosophy. I am allowed to break this rule as much as I want to because I\u0027m challenging myself, and I might want to do a Star-Trek style ship once in a while. Or, you know, Thomas the Tank Engine spaceship.\n\n***Day 1: August 2nd 2015***\n\n**Thomas the Tank Engine as a Space Ship.**\n\nThis was done as a joke, I meant to have the next drawing out on that day, but due to scanning delays, the simple webcam image of a sketch had to do for my first Spaceship. I calculated that if you filled his boiler with Hydrazine, and added a monoprop motor, he would have about 510-520 m/s of delta-v, which is more than Soyuz. It\u0027s enough for Minmus Landing and Orbit in KSP. He has to be launched on a Saturn V of course, if you want to put him into Earth Orbit.\n\n![CLZ0TAtWcAUZYt9.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CLZ0TAtWcAUZYt9.jpg)\n\n\u0022My boiler is on fire!\u0022 Thomas said. \u0022No,\u0022 said the Hype Train Driver. \u0022That\u0027s just the hydrazine.\u0022\n\nThis drawing [endorsed by the Northwestern Region of British Railways\u0027 controller](https://twitter.com/SIRTOPHAMNWR/status/627837591015002112).\n\n***Day 2: August 3rd 2015***\n\n**Steampunk Aethership**\n\nIt\u0027s a steampunk spaceship with a NERVA/NTR/LV-N rocket and ammonia propellant. This was meant to be Day 1\u0027s image, the Thomas the Tank Engine one was done as a joke, but this image was not scanned in time to post on the day it was meant to, so it had to be posted a day late. There may be two Spaceships for today, because I want to draw a spaceship today.\n\n![cVKv2d7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/cVKv2d7.jpg)\n\nUsing the principle of atomic power brought back in time from the year 2017, aetherships can explore the planet Mars and beyond! Of course, scientists had no idea what the power-generator was at first. It seemed to be running off of magic. The scientist in charge decided to remove one of the nuclear damper rod for closer examination, and the whole situation rapidly deteriorated. They were of course able to replicate the reactor eventually by 1885, and it was described by physicists that matter and energy are interchangeable. What exactly the formula was was still a mystery. This later became the fundamental groundwork for Dr. Einstein\u0027s theory of mass-energy relation, published in 1902. The theory of relativity by the same physicist also required the retroactive renaming of all in-service Aether Ships to Space ships or Rocket ships.\n\n[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/GregroxMun)\n\n***Archive:***\n\n[***Day 1: Thomas the Tank Engine spaceship***](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130526-Art-GregroxMun-s-Spaceship-A-Day-thread)\n\n***Day 2: Steampunk Aethership***\n\n[***Day 2.5: Gemini-esque Exoatmospheric Lander***](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130526-Art-GregroxMun-s-Spaceship-A-Day-thread?p=2118735\u0026viewfull=1#post2118735)\n\n[***Day 3: The (Late) Nuclear Turbojet Space Shuttle***](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130526-Art-GregroxMun-s-Spaceship-A-Day-thread?p=2124280\u0026viewfull=1#post2124280)\n\n[***Day 4: Apollo Warp Ship of the past.***](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130526-Art-GregroxMun-s-Spaceship-A-Day-thread?p=2127632\u0026viewfull=1#post2127632)\n\n[***Day 5: Heavily Damaged Rocketship.***](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130526-Art-GregroxMun-s-Spaceship-A-Day-thread?p=2129204\u0026viewfull=1#post2129204)\n\n[***Day 6: AST Vintage Space Lunar Lander.***](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/130526-Art-GregroxMun-s-Spaceship-A-Day-thread?p=2131215\u0026viewfull=1#post2131215)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-11T03:14:03Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2015 03:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GregroxMun**"},{"CreatedByName":"Endersmens","CreatedById":80723,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-03T16:58:56Z","Content":"that\u0027s so cool that the railway controller commented on your picture.

Closing in on our orbit. They\u0027re charging lasers.\u0022 Captain Gary was shocked, and pressed some buttons on his chair. \u0022Ektrodine, charge the rayguns. We\u0027re going into battle.\u0022 The rayguns were usless against the new shields carried by the Uranian ships. Before they knew it, the *Ad Astra II\u0027s* own deflectors were shot and some shots were fired at the propellant tanks and impulse engines of the rocket. \u0022Ektro, try modulating the rayguns through the frequency of the Uranian shields.\u0022 Forest ordered. The engineer von Ektrodine went to work modifying the raygun computers. The rayguns were finally able to penetrate the shielding of the Uranian Rebels. They destroyed the weapons and shields, forcing the rebels to retreat to a higher orbit out of the raygun range. Unfortunately, the new Uranian lasers had a special trick up their sleeve. The antimatter containment bottles were losing their magnetic force. Antimatter containment would soon be lost. The Propellant Hull was open to space, a minor meteor impact would cause a leak. Using RCS-thrust only, *Ad Astra II* limped to the Europa orbital station. \u0022At least they didn\u0027t hit the spacewarp motor, we\u0027d have a 3-year trip home.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"Plume \u0026amp; Akakak","CreatedById":142955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-09T21:53:34Z","Content":"These are really nice drawings, GregroxMun.
