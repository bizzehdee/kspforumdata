It\u0027s the chemical reaction itself that can\u0027t get much better. It doesn\u0027t matter what material you\u0027re building an engine out of, and what level of precision goes into it; if it\u0027s a kerosene/LOX engine, you\u0027re getting roughly the same performance as other kerosene/LOX engines. When Antonio Elias says that engine technology has peaked, that is what he means: people have already exploited just about all the capabilities of known rocket fuels in engines that existed 30-40 years ago. There simply is no more power left to extract out of the chemical reaction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the Merlin engine does to get its great TWR is the fact that advanced materials and construction techniques make the engine lighter. So it weighs 450kg instead of who knows what, maybe an engine from the 70\u0027s with that kind of size and performance would have weighed 600kg. That looks great on paper, because it\u0027s a 25% improvement in TWR. But ultimately, whether you have 4.5t or 6t of engine mass on a 505t Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket doesn\u0027t make that big of a difference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I\u0027m not agreeing with all of Mr Elias\u0027 ideas in the video, because he more or less cherry-picks specific metrics that support his point while ignoring those that don\u0027t, but I\u0027m fairly convinced myself that advances in engine technology that actually reduce launch costs will not come from improving existing engines but rather from changing the fuel used, and from using economies of scale in production and refurbishing (for those parts that are meant to be reusable). SpaceX and NASA both are developing methane/LOX rocket engines at the moment, because that reaction offers more Isp than kerosene/LOX but costs only a fraction of cryogenic LH2/LOX. They\u0027re hoping to get an engine that costs the same (or slightly less) to fuel as existing kerosene/LOX engines but has 15%-20% more Isp, thereby reducing fuel consumption and decreasing the price of launch stages. There\u0027s also an added incentive in ISRU because methane is relatively easy to make on-site on Mars for example.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd there\u0027s actually a fairly good reason for SpaceX to be doing what they\u0027re doing with the Merlin engines in terms of mass production. A few years ago, when it was announced that they would be building 40 engines per year, people were shaking their heads and saying \u0022what the hell could they possibly use even half that many for, they can\u0027t launch often enough\u0022 because they were used to rockets like the DeltaIV Heavy that makes do with four engines. But look at the Falcon 9: 10 engines per rocket. If they keep up producing 40 engines per year, that would be enough for 4 launches per year. That\u0027s not all that much. SpaceX is already launching more often than that, so they had to ramp up their engine production. Then comes the Falcon Heavy, to premiere this spring: 28 engines per launch. Twenty-eight. Almost three quarters of the amount that people thought totally overblown, for just a single launch. What SpaceX is doing here is an attempt to combine the added safety of engine-out capability, where they can lose an engine inflight and still have enough thrust to make it to orbit, with a sort-of mass production program for rocket engines. Never before has any company anywhere built so many engines per year. They\u0027re doing this to lower cost. Does it work out for them? I have no idea, I don\u0027t work there. But that\u0027s their strategy at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd wow, this thread sure went off topic in a hurry \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-05T13:01:28Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2014 01:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T15:33:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Streetwind\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Streetwind\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd there\u0027s actually a fairly good reason for SpaceX to be doing what they\u0027re doing with the Merlin engines in terms of mass production.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure there are.

People wouldn\u0027t like that they couldn\u0027t swoop around in their spaceships as if they were WW2 fighter planes, and would therefore grow bored. I\u0027m pleased that KSP seems to disprove the notion that space-based realism cannot also be fun. So you can probably tell that I don\u0027t care much for the \u0022who cares if it\u0027s crazy unrealistic, it\u0027s just a game\u0022 argument. Nobody here is saying KSP should completely mirror reality, also nobody is saying we should ditch everything that makes KSP realistic. I think most everybody would like some combination of realitic-ish, and fun to play, so the discussion is about what that means to the game. It is fine to discuss that. It is also fair to discuss balance for single player games. The main thing I dislike about ion engines in KSP is that we get bored so easily we have to fundamentally alter them to basically be just another high-isp rocket engine, and force them to be something they are not. All ion engines are used for long duration burns, this is what defines them. KSP ions can only ever be aesthetically like RL ions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022maccollo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022maccollo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEngine technology peaked in the 70s.
