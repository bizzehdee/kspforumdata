You may ask, \u0022What the heck is an HIAD anyway?\u0022 It\u0027s simple: it\u0027s pretty much a durable piece of cargo on an inflatable innertube with a parachute that deploys at the last second. Most people would consider this a heat shield (now you know what i\u0027m talking about), except meant for use on Kerbin, not A planet with a ridiculously thick atmosphere. The idea is to collect samples, fly a ship back to kerbin, and dock it with a space station. Then you would decouple or transfer or whatever you want to do to seperate the samples from the ship, then attach a heat shield with a parachute and an engine to de-orbit it. Then, when it\u0027s near the ground, instead of jettisoning the heat shield, you simply deploy the parachutes, then go to the tracking station and hit \u0022recover\u0022. You will get more research points that you would just transmitting a picture. If you had a rover that would stay on the planet for a very long period of time and it had an antenna or comms dish or whatever you put on it that had radio capability, you might even get more points for all those pictures it could send back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jake Shifter","CreatedById":84013,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T20:34:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else think this is brilliant?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T20:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHilarious, and genius.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T20:44:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this idea. I\u0027m also sure that people will find all sorts of creative ways to get data back to Kerbin for the most SCIENCE! possible. Small rovers could land with a docking station featuring an orbital return stage that would then transfer to the original bus, which would return to Kerbin and deploy a reentry vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RQuinny","CreatedById":58048,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T20:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReturning samples back to Kerbin is a really good idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sharpspoonful","CreatedById":83734,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-05T21:17:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like this a lot.
