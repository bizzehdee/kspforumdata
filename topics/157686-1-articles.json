I was really excited to give it a shot but when I found out it was 1.1.2 I thought I could just go into betas in steam properties and find 1.1.2 but I cannot I only see 1.0.5 and 1.1.3. Is there any way to get 1.1.2? Any help would be most appreciated.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T07:49:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou may try if version 1.1.3 works (Steam shows that as a previous version still downloadable, selectable from Properties/\u0022Beta\u0022 tab with the game library). Compatibility really depends on each single add-on included in the list. You may have to verify yourself with each single add-on if there was any new version built for KSP 1.1.3, or the version that worked in 1.1.2 still was valid in 1.1.3. This may become such a heavy work, to nullify any advantage with using the mod list.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, this problem with obsolete versions is exactly what I hoped would be improved making new rules for modpacks recently. Glad you reported this, it should come useful to further improve rules.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
