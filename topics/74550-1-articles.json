But for right now, let\u0027s ignore this part to focus on the first question. I\u0027ll come back to this afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to turn your Jool fly-by into a Jool orbit, you have to slow down relative to Jool. Since you\u0027ve come in from a solar orbit you\u0027re going to leave again at the same relative speed unless you burn to reduce that speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two ways to do this with Jool: One way is to fly past Jool at very low altitude... so low that you dip into its atmosphere and the drag from the atmopshere slows you down. This would be an \u0022aerocapture\u0022. But if I\u0027ve interpreted your situation correctly, that\u0027s clearly out of the question... you\u0027ll be passing Jool near the edge of it\u0027s sphere of influence and, of course, nowhere near the atmosphere. So from this altitude your only option is to burn. You need to point your chevron at the retrograde indicator and fire up your engines until your fly-by trajectory closes into a captured orbit. Do this as you reach your Jool periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow let\u0027s look at getting your inclination closer to the plane of the moons. Well, depending on how out-of-plane you currently are, this could cost you quite a lot. But the technique is probably one you\u0027re familiar with: after you capture using the retrograde burn from the previous paragraph, set the moon you\u0027re interested in as a target, find the ascending or descending node and perform the appropriate burn in the normal minus or normal plus direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you have a save from when you were still in solar orbit a ways out from Jool... say, still a quarter of an orbit or so away from the intercept, you can save some gas. At that distance you can make very small burns that will significantly change your fly-by altitude as well as your inclination when you arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iFlyAllTheTime","CreatedById":111190,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T05:20:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like the craft is travelling from right to left in that pic before \u0022escaping\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore senior forum members might chime in to correct my noob answer but, click on the periapsis and reduce you velocity, i.e. drag the retrograde marker on the manoeuvre node until you see some sort of ellipse.

Let\u0027s think about why this is. In order to aerocapture you have to have a very low periapsis - low enough to dip into the atmosphere. When the aerocapture is complete your periapsis will still, of course, be very low. Your apoapsis, on the other hand, is likely to be quite high. In other words, you\u0027ll be in a highly eccentric orbit, which means one that is a very stretched out ellipse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo why is this often considered expensive? Well, in a very eccentric orbit, you are moving very slowly at apoapsis. A moon at the same altitude would, on the other hand, be moving much more quickly... that\u0027s why the moon stays up there instead of falling sharply down the same way you will! And so if you want to then orbit that moon you have to speed up a lot to match it\u0027s orbital velocity around the planet. In other words, you pay a lot of delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in the case of Jool, that\u0027s not actually a big deal. Jool has a *lot* of moons, and you can use them to help you out by performing gravity assists that increase your apoapsis velocity, pulling your periapsis up out of the atmosphere and giving you a more circular orbit. The fact that there are a lot of moons means you have a huge amount of flexibility when you do this, and can pretty much turn any orbit into any other orbit pretty much for free (or at least for a very small delta-v cost) just by gravity assisting from moon to moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such, generally the best method for visiting the moons of Jool is to come in from solar orbit with a very low periapsis and to perform an aerocapture, then bounce around the moons until you get where you\u0027re trying to go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-09T05:33:49Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2014 05:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"allmhuran","CreatedById":66124,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-09T05:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Qwotty\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Qwotty\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust a heads up, I\u0027m \u003Cstrong\u003Ebelow\u003C/strong\u003E Jool, very much so.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s OK as far as capture goes... the technique remains the same: Get to periapsis, and then burn retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat will happen is that you will end up with a highly inclined orbit... in fact, you\u0027ll have an orbit that\u0027s closer to going around the poles of Jool instead of around the equator. And you will indeed pay a very high price to turn that into an equatorial orbit. Unfortunately from this position there\u0027s no way to make that cheaper.
