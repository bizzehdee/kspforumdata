I wasn\u0027t saying that Singapore* or UAE don\u0027t need to spend money on defense, they definitely do. And they are certainly being taken very seriously in the sense that Indonesia probably wouldn\u0027t dare to think of invading Singapore. But on the other hand neither would they ever seriously consider the possibility of Singapore invading them, because that\u0027s obviously never going to happen. What I meant was that countries like Singapore or UAE are usually not perceived as external threats, and thus their defense expenditures do not spark an arms race. So for example when UAE buys new tanks, Israel or Iran is not going to double their defense expenditure in panic, because they know very well that the chance of these tanks ever being offensively used against them is pretty much zero. But if and when UAE developed ICBM and/or nukes, I expect it would all change - they would suddenly graduate from \u0022small, opulent state with an oversized defense force\u0022 to \u0022serious competition with power projection capabilities\u0022.
