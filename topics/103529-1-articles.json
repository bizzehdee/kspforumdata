I am a huge fan of the KSP and I have been following the development closely so I think this is the best time to stick around and play some KSP!\n\nBut enough of that - I need your help! Do you have troubles in KSP? Have you recently started Career and come to a grinding dead end? Would you like to see a real solar system sandbox series or you have even better idea? Let me know, use the comment section in the video if you have suggestions, I\u0027m happy to read and interact!\n\nThat\u0027s going to be me for now and see you in the next one!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/tj-hWx0gWqo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}]}
