Thing is, right now the pylons are structural parts. They can stand on their own, at least on level ground, but will fall over when hit. I planned to set them up with a launch clamp or two and hack the complete setup into position by modifying the savefile. That did work but was cumbersome. I replaced a dummy vessel that I had driven to the site that the pylon should be.
