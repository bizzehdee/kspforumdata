At the time he was on a collision course with the Mun, and smacked his craft right into it.\n\nOn his second attempt, this time with a proper trajectory, he *did* get the contract completion as soon as he entered the SoI. It appears that you do at least have to have a proper flyby trajectory at the time of entering.\n\nThis might also explain why I have seen people report that they have successfully flow by an object without getting a contract completion. They might have had an invalid (colliding) trajectory upon entering the SoI, which they then manually corrected, but the trigger opportunity had already passed."},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T09:20:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, you can.\n\u003E In fact, you will complete the \u0027fly by\u0027 conditions of a contract as soon as you enter the SoI of the target body, regardless of what you do next.\n\nThe other day I had a tourist who needed to fly by Mun and Minmus. So I planned a trip where the ship entered orbit with the Mun, and later orbited Minmus. I was expecting orbiting both to be enough bacon for trigging the requirements for the contract.\n\nBut it didn\u0027t. Orbiting Mun did in fact fulfilled the fly-by the Mun part. But no matter how many orbits I let the ship do on Minmus, the fly-by Minmus part didn\u0027t check positively.\n\nHow\u0027s that?"}]}
