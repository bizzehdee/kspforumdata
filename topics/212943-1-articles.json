Anything else like poodleing about something not working right \u00A0 If you didn\u2019t expect that then don\u2019t buy EA games sheesh\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n..I think it\u2019s great ! Awesome job devs it\u2019s amazing \u00A0thank you guys for all your hard work \u00A0giving us early access to the game you all rock and are appreciated by many !\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a similar \u00A0suggestion to the one \u00A0I\u2019m making here to the devs at elite dangerous a year or so ago just on a more limited scale that would probably work within that game \u2026I\u2019m a big space sim fan ..started with kerbal space ..where I played a million hours moved to elite ..now it\u2019s back to Kerbal 2!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nok so I don\u2019t know if something like this is possible as it may be too difficult to develop or won\u2019t work in the framework of the game or who knows but here it is..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na hard core mode much like some mods that were actually out there for Ksp \u2026.where you have to manage your oxygen and resources to survive that appropriate machines like water reclaimers \u00A0\u2026where you can move about in your ships ..manage battery fuel food \u2026mine asteroids for resources say to get water to make fuel ..have a green house onboard to grow food ..gather resources on planets to manage your food ..gather resources to keep you batteries maintained ..a hard core mode that is just like it would be on say a real mission to mars where it\u2019s not just getting there and back and making a colony etc ..but you gotta take or on longer distances or \u00A0acquire all the resources to keep your crew alive and the ship going ..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sure there are many people that would really enjoy a hard core mode like this where it\u2019s nit just about flight and orbital mechanics docking landing but also super realistic \u00A0in resource management and running your vessel to even make it to your destination and keep your little green buddies alive and the ship maintained and fueled \u2026for very long trips there would be the planet exploration for resources and asteroid mining and what not \u2026I think it would add a lot to the game ..\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyeah maybe it\u2019s way too much to ask but it would be super cool probably inspire future astronauts and even innovation\u2026if there was say a mode that functioned on a realistic frame work using parts that you could make in todays world with the resources available on earth \u00A0not make believe stuff \u00A0to make your own machines to say extract water or resources ..who knows what amateur kerbalnauts would come up with maybe a ksp player figures out to make a real warp drive on day lol \u2026heck if it was complex enough maybe even real astronauts would practice and train with ksp 2 one day hahha\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyways just an idea.. probably way to complex to add in but yeah maybe pieces of the idea as like I mentioned I remember a mod in ksp1 where you had to manage a limited set of resources like oxygen \u00A0during journeys \u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
