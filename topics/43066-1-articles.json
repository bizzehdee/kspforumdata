Nose cones need looked at and part weights adjusted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut one of the things we need the most is weights added to things like Air Intakes. Why should they be so light? There is no penalty for adding a bunch of these to your craft. Shouldn\u0027t they weight about a quarter to a half ton per intake? That would fix all those crazy planes that defy attempting something like that in a real space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd put some weights and transfer limits on fuel lines. It takes pumps and power to move fuel through a fuel line. So add a ton per fuel line. And make them transfer fuel only so fast. Like maybe the rate of a a Skipper engine. This way you would see some real problem solving in KSP. Crazy larger asparagus lifters wouldn\u0027t be happening because you couldn\u0027t pump the fuel fast enough. And if you did put enough fuel lines on the tanks to get the fuel to move fast enough, it would be too heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah I know the community would bitch about it, that\u0027s because they\u0027ve been spoiled on an easy kiddie mode space program.

I personally think it was just created to bring some people imaginations to life about flying spaceships into space. I dunno, ask one of the devs why it was created, but if the air intakes were made heavier, you couldn\u0027t make the funny and crazy contraptions that you\u0027ve always wanted to make.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beeman","CreatedById":28178,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-19T06:09:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA lot of the older parts are going to be reworked at some point, I believe. They\u0027ll probably get a visual overhaul but might also get a balance shift as well. But right now, nosecones aren\u0027t really a concern because they\u0027re only cosmetic at the moment. Whenever they get around to reworking aerodynamics and atmospheric effects(weather and such), I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll tweak or remake a lot of those parts. Especially the spaceplane parts which haven\u0027t seen an update or modification since their introduction into the core game. They were just a mod, if I recall correctly...until the mod creator was hired on by SQUAD.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo be patient, we\u0027ll undoubtedly see a rebalance of a lot of the parts at some point. But right now they\u0027re working on career mode stuff \u0027cause it was so underdeveloped(actually, about zero progress in that area before .21). We\u0027ve got R\u0026amp;D coming next with who knows what to follow. It\u0027ll be a couple patches, probably, before they start looking back at flight mechanics and parts again \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should add that Bac9 of B9 Aerospace mod fame was also hired by SQUAD and he\u0027s the person who redid the space center buildings. So we might see his spaceplane parts to some extent(or at least a touch of his art style) in the game at some point. I\u0027d say grab his mod and see what you think. If nothing else, you might enjoy the mod for what it is for a while \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-19T06:12:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2013 06:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Beeman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
