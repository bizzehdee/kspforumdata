Elite Dangerous has eaten my spare time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrontier Developments is literally modelling the entire Milky Way Galaxy in this game. Singe, Binary, and Trinary star systems with Planets, Moons, Asteroid belts, different kinds of space stations, some 40\u002B different ships to fly (as of now, there are only three - soon four). Elite Dangerous is fully\u002B funded at about 2-million pounds sterling, and is under full development. Yes, you can fly to and explore all of these locations up close - as you approach a planetary belt, at first you see just the haze, then you start making out individual dots - eventually it starts looking like gravel, but you are still a long way off. As you get closer you finally realize just how massive each of the asteroids really are - and there are billions of them, just around this one planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are a couple more Science! videos worth mentioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere I talk about how Elite: Dangerous is going to model some 400-Billion stars:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/k1Q1sXSdY7U?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this one I talk about Artificial Gravity:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3XzUYh6QSs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T14:34:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEpisode 4 - Touring New Systems!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHjmi49fAq8?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"}]}
