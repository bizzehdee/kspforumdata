The plane practically falls to a gentle landing right on the spot. Take-offs are another story though, but I think it might be the way Snoj does his lift code (his Sabre has the same issue if you mount the wings perfectly level).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-08T02:26:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2014 02:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by PolecatEZ\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T02:32:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a question.

I do so much skewing with the model meshes that any patterned textures turn out crap in the game, so I\u0027m back to plain colors that need to still match other B9 parts.
