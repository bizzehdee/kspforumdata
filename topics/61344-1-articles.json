For full GR treatment, the answer has to be \u0022None of the things you want information on exists.\u0022 (or at least the bits I think you are talking about). From the viewpoint of the orbiting body, it just moves on a spacetime geodesic. For the kind of situations you talk about (multiple relevant bodies), there are no orbits to talk about. There is no globally well defined way to talk about directions, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you have to simplify the situation: The only scenario we can talk about is one heavy central body that your small craft is moving around. The next thing we need to do is pick a suitable coordinate system that both works with GR and is intuitive; spherical coordinates with the heavy body at rest at the center and the distant galaxies at time fixed angular coordinates are the best choice. That coordinate system is also a reasonably good choice if your central body is orbiting an even heavier body, by the way, as long as your keep r small. Assume for now the central body does not rotate. And in that coordinate system, all your intuition and what you learned from KSP essentially applies. The plane of an orbit is fixed. Apoapsis and periapsis distance do not change over time. What does happen is that over time, they slowly rotate in the orbital plane. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two reasons any \u0022But RELATIVITY! There is no absolute!\u0022 do not apply. The first, as K^2 already stated, relates to rotation. Rotation speed is something you can measure, it is absolute *. You know you are rotating when you feel \u003Ca href=\u0022http://xkcd.com/123/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ecentrifugal\u003C/a\u003E forces. The second relates to motion. You have a very heavy central object that you can measure your speed relative to. And as the main problem you are facing is the gravity of said object, the frame in which the object is at rest is special in the sense that it makes calculations easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, to answer the thread title question: Orbits are relative to the orbited body. Because if the orbited body\u0027s rest frame is not a sensible frame to work in, you are not in orbit around it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* locally absolute. There is frame dragging near rotating bodies and of course general geometric distortions. What does not exist is an absolute reference frame for directions. If you take a small, nonrotating object and move it around without applying torque, it will always stay nonrotating**. However, if you bring it back to its starting position, it may have changed its orientation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E** Ok, pulling that out of my rear right now.
