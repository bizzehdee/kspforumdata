So let\u0027s say you first make a maneuver node where you want to change your orbit. The game will then show you what your orbit looks like after that maneuver node. If you then place another maneuver node right \u003Cem\u003Ebehind\u003C/em\u003E that one, it will actually show it as one orbit later. So now the screen will show what your orbit will look like after 1 more orbital period. Leave the second maneuver node at 0 m/s. Now if you change the first maneuver node, the screen will show the effect of that first maneuver node on your orbit after 1 more orbital period. You can add a 3rd, 4th, etc maneuver node, each one behind the previous, to see what your orbit will look like 2, 3, etc orbital periods in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI found this useful for planning encounters with planets or the moons of Jool. It is also useful for planning ship-to-ship encounters in advance, since an earlier burn = less delta-v used.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
