Any part exposed to the light would produce drag the same as a solar cell produces power. Thicker atomsphere stronger light more drag. The more surface area a part has the more drag it can produce unless you point the pointy end toward space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s at my thinking anyway but probably full of holes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
