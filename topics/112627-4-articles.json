Unfortunately, since so many of your nodes are so close together, some of the tech lines intersect through tech nodes (see the Science \u0026 Experimentation area). If you want to check it out, you\u0027ll need to first change the top part in the \u0022overrides.cfg\u0022 from \u0022@TechTree:NEEDS[CommunityTechTree]:FINAL\u0022 to \u0022@TechTree:NEEDS[CommunityTechTree|ETT]:FINAL\u0022. I\u0027d be glad to see what I can do to fix it if I have free time between now and version 1.1.\n\nAlso, just a side note: if you want your start node to be centered when you first open the R\u0026D center, you could subtract 760 from all the nodes\u0027 x position (at least, it works for me.

In case anyone else it using it as well, the following ModuleManager snippet puts the parts into the \u0022Hydroponics\u0022 node (otherwise it would be in \u0022NiCad Batteries\u0022, which doesn\u0027t seem very logical ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)):\n\n    @PART[SETIgreenhouse1]::NEEDS[zETT]:AFTER[SETIgreenhouse] {    @TechRequired = hydroponics}@PART[SETIgreenhouse3]:NEEDS[zETT]:AFTER[SETIgreenhouse] {    @TechRequired = hydroponics}\n\n**Edit: Just a little heads-up about a stock bug:**\n\nI just (re-)discovered a little stock bug that is affecting this mod. If the science cost of a node is exactly the science limit of R\u0026D (i.e. 100 or 500 depending on the level), the node is not researchable. It does **not** show \u0022Cannot research technologies over 100 Science at this level!\u0022 in this case, but instead the highly misleading \u0022Technology has unresearched requirements.\u0022 This affects for example the \u0022Field Science\u0022 node and a few others.\n\nTo work around I suggest lowering all science costs of 100 to 99 (there are no nodes with a cost of 500 in the mod AFAICT). Until such a workaround is included, the following MM-Config will do:\n\n    @TechTree:AFTER[zETT] {    @RDNode:HAS[#cost[100]] {        @cost = 99    }}@TechTree:AFTER[zETT] {    @RDNode:HAS[#cost[500]] {        @cost = 499    }}\n\n(Alternatively, one can install the CustomBarnKit mod and increase the research limits by 1.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-15T11:32:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/15/2015 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SpaceNomad**"},{"CreatedByName":"Garagoth","CreatedById":153716,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T21:47:41Z","Content":"Hi,  \n\nFirst: great tree, please keep on expanding it.  \n\nI wanted to ad some remarks regarding Station Science.

\n\n[/spoiler]  \n\nIf you don\u0027t like the inserted \u0022Advanced Rocketry 0.625\u0022 node, just remove the two \u0022RDNode\u0022 sections in the beginning and replace every occurance of \u0022advMiniaturization\u0022 with \u0022miniaturization\u0022.  \n\nI also considered inserting a node between \u0022Nickel Metal-Hydride\u0022 and \u0022Ion Propulsion\u0022 (maybe \u0022Electrical Propulsion\u0022) for the two engines I put in NiMH, but was to lazy so far :P  \n\nAlso, maybe the three parts I put in \u0022Advanced Bearings\u0022 could have gone in \u0022RadialDecouplers2\u0022 as there already is another \u0022Radial Attachment Point\u0022 in there. I only discovered it when I was done with it (and on the other hand \u0022Advanced Bearings\u0022 was empty for me before).  \n\nThe parts which are commented out (those with the two slashes in front), are the ones where the TechRequirement stayed the same as in original RLA\\_Stockalike mod, as it seemed correct with the ETT tree as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Probus","CreatedById":102512,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T17:11:49Z","Content":"Thanks SpaceNomad!
