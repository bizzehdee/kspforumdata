Integrating a ship causes it to be saved with the same name it had before you put it into integration.\u00A0 Thus, if you\u0027ve saved your design before integration, you end up with 2 copies of it, both with the same name, one integrated and the other not.\u00A0 I suggest having the save made by integration add a suffix to the craft name, such as \u0022-INT\u0022 to show it\u0027s been integrated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#2.\u00A0 Changing a design AFTER you\u0027ve integrated it totally spams you with \u0022integration has failed\u0022 messages.\u00A0 Each time you click on a part, or right-click on a part, or move a part, you get that same \u0022Houston, we have a problem\u0022 sound and the \u0022integration failed\u0022 message pops up.\u00A0 This happens even if you rename the craft before you start editing it, which is very annoying.\u00A0 The constant barrage of both sound and visual reminders that you\u0027re changing a previously integrated design causes mondo lag and eventually leads to game instability.\u00A0 And the most annoying thing is, frequently need to make minor tweaks and improvements to existing designs, so you run into this problem all the time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n#3.\u00A0 Sometimes you get a message \u0022Has suffered another component failure\u0022 without telling you what part it\u0027s talking about.\u00A0 Such as
