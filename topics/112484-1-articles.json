About a third a way down the page there are some sine wave graphs - the section header is \u0022Dynamic Stability\u0022. Dynamic stability happens to be what the simulator tab will show you - it shows you the tendencies of your plane after the initial, static conditions. So what you do is pick an axis you want to test (you\u0027re curious about your yaw, so use \u0022r\u0022) and put in an initial condition - I usually go with \u00225\u0022 - for that axis. Mash go and watch FAR generate the dynamic stability graph; the particulars of it aren\u0027t as important as the graph\u0027s shape. If the amplitude of the oscillations decreases from left to right across the graph, your plane will have a tendency to stabilize along that axis. If the amplitude stays the same, you\u0027ve got neutral stability. If the oscillations increase in amplitude with time, you\u0027ve got negative stability on that axis. And if things just fly off from the get-go, you have negative stability. With negative stability conditions, you want to re-design your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have come across situations lately where the static stability was all cool and froody, but the plane wound up having negative dynamic stability. You can try to correct for it with SAS modules, but I wouldn\u0027t rely on SAS to be able to fix the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T21:49:04Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by capi3101\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SavageSS27","CreatedById":145965,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T22:42:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022capi3101\u0022 data-cite=\u0022capi3101\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake sure you\u0027re using the latest dev version; Ferri\u0027s got the aforementioned bug when it comes to cargo bays, and I\u0027m seeing it in your cross-section curve (the green one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust downloaded the dev release as recommended.
