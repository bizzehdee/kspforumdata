Sometimes when I exit the capsule, let go, and activate the jetpack, my kerbalnaught orientates himself face down (he pitches 90\u0027 down) and I cannot get him upright and parallel to the rocket. Even if I use left click and drag to adjust pitch so that I\u0027m facing the rocket, using any keyboard controls just resets the pitch so that I\u0027m looking down the rocket again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t work out what I\u0027m doing that sometimes let\u0027s me do EVA\u0027s without this 90\u0027 pitch down problem - can anyone tell me what I\u0027m missing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPaul\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-16T22:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are two modes for EVA, auto-align-with-camera-mode and freeform mode, this can be selected in the settings screen/other input tab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn auto-align mode your Kerbal will align with the camera, in freeform you can pitch and roll by holding the left mouse button and moving the mouse, and yaw with Q and E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you are seeing is your Kerbal aligning with the camera, you can adjust camera mode with V, and this is the easiest mode to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreeform is tricky, but worth a go \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, welcome to the community !\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Paul G","CreatedById":101883,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-17T00:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant, thanks for the advice and the welcome, hope I will be able to help others as I progress.
