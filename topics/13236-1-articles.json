I thought I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122d take a stab at it myself. And while I realise that I may have gone off the deep end a bit with this little project, it turned out to be kind of fun. I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122d be interested to hear other forum member\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s feedback about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccurate modelling of re-entry dynamics is extremely complex and would require (at a minimum) the use of computational fluid dynamics. That obviously isn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t going to be done in a game. Instead, I would think that a method would have to be found that would have low computational overhead, yet still maintain some physical significance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving looked through some papers on the subject and dusted off an old textbook or two, I came up with what I think would be a good model. It is based on the assumption that a re-entry vehicle forms a detached supersonic shock, and that the shock stays detached all the way down to trans-sonic speeds. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExample\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/tpkCQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tpkCQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recorded telemetry data for a capsule re-entering Kerbin\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s atmosphere and then used the equations in the \u0027Background\u0027 section below to estimate the air temperatures that the capsule would have experienced during re-entry. In my test, the 1.45 tonne chute/pod/sensor assembly was placed into a 1 km x 85 km orbit for re-entry. The 1 km periapsis resulted in a fairly shallow re-entry trajectory and a maximum g-loading of 4 g\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s. Even so, the pod would have experienced an extreme environment during that re-entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInitial mach numbers during my spacecraft\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s re-entry approached Mach 8. This high Mach number results in very high temperatures inside the spacecraft\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s supersonic shock, but little heating would have occurred during this part of the re-entry because the air is still too thin to transfer much heat. Although shock layer temperatures outside the spacecraft approach 2500 K during the early part of the re-entry, the spacecraft\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s temperature wouldn\u00E2\u20AC\u2122t have started to rise significantly until 50 km altitude. Maximum heating occurs between 40 km and 30 km altitude, and the maximum spacecraft temperature of 1800 K occurs at 26 km altitude. Our intrepid Kerbals were still moving at about Mach 5.4 at that time. The spacecraft then rapidly cools to equal the static air temperature by the time it reaches about 8000 m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn calculating the data plotted in this example, I picked values of K\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E and C\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E that made the spacecraft temperature data \u00E2\u20AC\u0153look right\u00E2\u20AC. These would have to be experimented with in the game to get the desired behaviour. As stated in the \u0027Background\u0027 section below, K\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E would be hard coded in the game, while C\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E could be a parameter in each part\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s part.cfg file that could be adjusted to account for whether or not a part is, for example, a heat shielded part.

The orbital energy is dissipated in chemical energy, light energy, atmospheric kinetic energy, sound energy, heat energy, etc. Some of the energy also heats the spacecraft itself. Calculating the amount that it heats the spacecraft is what I\u00E2\u20AC\u2122m focused on. That heating is dependent on the external air temperatures (shock layer temperatures) surrounding the spacecraft during re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, there\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s a relatively simple equation that could be used to simulate the temperatures that the spacecraft is exposed to during re-entry. It takes advantage of the fact that a detached supersonic shock (normal shock) forms ahead of the spacecraft as it re-enters. The temperature rise through a normal shock in an ideal gas is approximately given by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/YeN43.png\u0022 alt=\u0022YeN43.png\u0022\u003E (1)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere M is the Mach number, T\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E is the temperature from the in-game atmospheric temperature profile and gamma is the heat capacity ratio of the ideal gas that the shock forms within. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we assume that Kerbin\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s atmosphere is an ideal gas\u003Csup\u003E1\u003C/sup\u003E with heat capacity ratio gamma = 1.4, then the above equation reduces to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dJUbF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dJUbF.png\u0022\u003E (2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilarly, if Kerbin\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s atmosphere is an ideal gas, then the speed of sound is just\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yTfdn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022yTfdn.png\u0022\u003E (3)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while Equation (2) is increasingly inaccurate at high Mach numbers because the heat capacity ratio gamma cannot be assumed to be constant, we\u00E2\u20AC\u2122ve got to remember that this is just a game! If we take these liberties, then calculating Mach number and shock layer temperatures that the spacecraft is exposed to during re-entry is trivial. All that remains, then, is to approximate how much heating occurs as a result of the temperature that the re-entry vehicle is exposed to. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spacecraft is heated during re-entry by forced convection. Heat transfer due to forced convection can be modelled according to equation (4) below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/MgL3z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022MgL3z.png\u0022\u003E (4)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere h is the heat transfer coefficient, A is a representative area, T\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003E(t) is the current air temperature from equation (2) above, and T\u003Csub\u003Ecraft\u003C/sub\u003E is the current spacecraft surface temperature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe heat transfer coefficient \u00E2\u20AC\u0153h\u00E2\u20AC is a function of atmospheric viscosity, density, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, as well as the spacecraft\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s geometry and the airspeed. Of these variables, the one that experiences the greatest variation throughout the re-entry is density. In fact, density experiences several orders of magnitude more variation than all of the other parameters, even when considering conditions inside the detached supersonic shock. As a result, for the purposes of an in-game re-entry heating model, equation (5) could be used to estimate the convective heat transfer coefficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/J4Pu5.png\u0022 alt=\u0022J4Pu5.png\u0022\u003E (5)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEquation (5) is derived from the definition of h for laminar forced convection. Well designed re-entry vehicles maintain laminar flow over large areas because this results in lower heat transfer rates. In the laminar flow case, h is a function of the square root of the Reynolds number. Reynolds number is, in turn, a function of the fluid density, viscosity, velocity and a characteristic length. Early in the re-entry, where densities are very low, Reynolds numbers are low enough that laminar flow is relatively easy to maintain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EK\u003Csub\u003E1\u003C/sub\u003E in Equation (5) is a constant chosen to give desirable qualities to the game\u00E2\u20AC\u2122s re-entry heating model.
