Basically all I want to do is create a map of Kerbin with different countries. This is NOT ROLEPLAY. All you do is you draw where your theoretical country would be, you make a flag and a name, and your done. Nothing beyond that. No wars, no government, nothing. This is just for fun so when you land somewhere you can say \u0022Oh, look, I landed in the Republic of x!\u0022 Role play is strictly forbidden on the forum, and any post that involve role play will be reported. Apply beneath, only with where your country is, a flag for it, and its name. You will not write anything about your country. This is mainly for people writing AARs with space age themes so they can have some countries to give characteristics to. For example, if you write an AAR and you want to have a few countries that have tension or conflict with each other, you can use this map to see if you want to use any countries on the map. Apply below and I will reply if you are accepted or not. One final thing, there will be a few continents just to group countries in a certain area. Same thing with countries, no war, just grouping certain countries together. For continents you will make a flag, but again this is only so people writing AARs can have flags for if they create unions of countries so they can make certain countries allied with each other. Basically the continental flags will be if people writing AARs want to make something like the European Union in their AAR. If you want to name a continent, write the name and put the flag undearneath and I might accept it. Area that the continents will have is predetermined. \u003Cp\u003EMap:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KqNGBSm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KqNGBSm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal rule: Please save your map with your country as a .png for the ease of use of the paint bucket.
