It\u0027s just that if you define your \u0022favorite\u0022 as \u0022the place you go to most often\u0022, it\u0027s funny that two of the five objects you\u0027re missing are the two most heavily trafficked bodies in my system. I hate really low-gravity landings in general, which\u0027d rule those two out, and most of the other bodies have some other major drawback; Eeloo is pretty featureless, Laythe\u0027s water means you can\u0027t do much wandering once you\u0027re there (unless you use a boat or airship mod), Eve\u0027s too hard to get astronauts home afterwards, and Mun\u0027s too familiar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for me that leaves it as a toss-up between Dres (fun canyon) and Duna (easy to get to, lots of stuff to do/see), with Ike as a dark horse. (Low gravity plus rough terrain means you can get some impressive air on some places, without the Gilly/Minmus escape issues.) The thing is, I\u0027ve only been to these once or twice each, while I\u0027ve landed on Pol and Gilly almost a dozen times apiece. Hence my original comment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we really need is a cross between Duna and Laythe; something with Duna\u0027s low gravity (0.3g, versus Laythe\u0027s 0.8) and lack of oceans, but with an atmosphere that allows jet engines. Laythe\u0027s just too massive, with too much surface gravity and too few usable landmasses. Besides making things difficult in general, it means that plane designs for Laythe will be the same ones you made for Kerbin; I want a planet where I can fly planes that would simply never function on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"brooksy125","CreatedById":27430,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T00:01:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like the huge valley on Duna, nearly all of my landings have taken place there...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T00:12:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t my picture, it\u0027s from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/27552-Long-term-Laythe-Mission-%28pic-heavy%29-Now-with-%2A%2APART-5%2A%2A\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EBrotoro\u0027s Long-Term Laythe Mission thread\u003C/a\u003E, but it\u0027s got my favourite landing spot marked out, Fido Bay. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rq6PXYb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rq6PXYb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wolfedg","CreatedById":58442,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-18T01:55:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy personal favorite so far, the Munar Grand Canyon\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/screenshot73.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot73.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1075.photobucket.com/albums/w424/wolfedg/screenshot74.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot74.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
