KSP uses Y up for the vertical axis. So lets say you have a basic little 2 nozzel RCS unit, with 1 nozzel pointed up \u0026amp; 1 down, your thrust vectors would be \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethrustvector0 = 0,1,0, 10.0 (this one pushes you upward)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethrustvector1 = 0,-1,0 10.0 (this one pushes you downward)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow for the FX, the FX format is, pX, pY, pZ, uX, uY, uZ, FXGROUP; where (p) is is the position on the model you want to FX to start from(origin point), (u) is the \u0027Up\u0027 direction, This should be the same as the thrust vector. FX group dictates which thruster creates which FX, this is the number following thrustvector. So for the above example you should have something like this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efx_gasJet_white = pX, pY, pZ, 0, 1, 0.0, rcsGroup0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efx_gasJet_white = pX, pY, pZ, 0, -1, 0.0, rcsGroup1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESubstitute pXYZ with the relevant coordinates from your model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedited because i have the dumb\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-04T04:25:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ego0sh why the hell does it not just use freaking degrees for the angles...... \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-04T04:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ealso, in my unmodified RCS block the E and Q effects disappared @_@ \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-05T18:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eadded a video to explain visually. into the main post. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will work no fut her untill this is figured out. there is nothign i can do :/ \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-05T19:45:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eslight break through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhen the RCS attach_node is 0.0, -1.67, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0 it Q and E effects work but whne it is 0.0, -1.67, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 or anythign else it does not. however this tilts the model at a weird angle.... and does not align up any more. wtf? \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-12-05T20:07:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERotation of the model was off for some reason when importing the .dae so i corrected and reexported. this fixed the rotation problems. so now with fixed code and mdel the Q and E rs keys effects work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehowever now the effects arn;t aligned \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E so need to figure those otu again :/ luckyl slew gave me the right numbers hop they work still. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm default ASAS also seems to work fine.
