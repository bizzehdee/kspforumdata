Click on the Images button and you will see the line \u0022SOME SCREENSHOTS FROM THE LATEST VERSION OF KSP\u0022 which is absolutely false because not one of those images is from 1.x.x, though a few of them there is no way to tell (except that I\u0027ve seen them before and know they were pre-1.0), but many of them have parts and not from 1.0 or GUI missing things like the app launcher bar. Some of them are pre-Spaceplane Plus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy opinion, they should hold a screenshot contest to replace them (and not just on Twitter or Reddit, Squad) The grand prize would be to replace the image at the bottom of the page.
