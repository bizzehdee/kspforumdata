I know it\u0027s possible to spawn a new ship into a particular orbit or even change the orbit/position of a ship already up there, but I have yet to see how to actually do that or figure it out for myself.

So pick something already in orbit you don\u0027t care about (warning: it will be deleted). Copy the relevant vessel details, which is everything you see in the example below in \u003Cstrong\u003Ebold\u003C/strong\u003E. This is all the non-part details, except for pid, name and stg. Then delete that whole vessel entry and save the file. Now put the vessel you want on the launch pad or runway. Now exit the game and open the persistence file again. Find the vessel by name, the sit should show it being on the pad or runway. Now paste in all the details you copied, preserving the pid, name and stg of your new vessel. Save the file and enter the game again, and hey-presto, the craft is now in the orbit the other craft was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to specify a particular orbit then you need to adjust the ORBIT data.
