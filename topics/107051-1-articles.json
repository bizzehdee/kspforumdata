You know, how many G\u0027s it can pull, Jeb freaking out, max range, max flight time, etc. All of your crafts are good, but I can\u0027t get the info I want from your posts.\n\nAh, I get it - I find normally i have so many craft I have to remove info from each post XD but I\u0027m more than happy to give you more info.\n\n I think it pulls 15 Gs - not to many, as it\u0027s designed for high speed at altitude, not turning, although it is capable of making turns at 20,000m. Top speed is tested to 1230 - that means it sits there safely, without overheating. Not sure if it\u0027s capable of faster, but that\u0027s close to the limit. She uses 6 Engines to get to that speed- they\u0027re hidden in one another, and it looks good too. But that means anywhere below 15,000m you\u0027re going to be draining fuel out the back trying to go at any speed. The drop tanks feed first, so when they run out of fuel you can jettison them if you want - I normally keep them on (as no peacetime air force would drop tanks, they\u0027re expensive) but you can to increase range if you\u0027re close to empty. Normal fuel load is about 1623L, but it has a full capacity of 2098L if you want to really push it - but I have no idea the handling or performance at that full a fuel level.\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
