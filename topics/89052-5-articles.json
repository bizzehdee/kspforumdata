So after about half an hour of googling I had it all sorted and my first recompile was done. Didn\u0027t even ue VS, but cmd-based MSBuild (which is far less bulky). VS is more comfortable, however, when working with git.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis still isn\u0027t representative, as I know my way around computers and general code concepts quite well (over 10 years of active coding/modding for other games.

While providing a guide to compile Win64 yourself would certainly provide a nice filter, I doubt it\u0027s a sufficient or fair one. As steve says, people are more probable to just come asking for the work done. When I made a post in the FAR megathread about having compiled my private win64-enabled dll, I immediately was contacted by a bunch of people asking on how I did it. On writing out the \u0022tutorial\u0022, all of them were like \u0022hell naw, can\u0027t you just send me the dll, pretty please?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I am conflicted myself.

Unless you actively want to experiment or simply can ignore those issues, you\u0027ll do better by just sticking to Win32 and keep doing the old snip\u0027n\u0027tuck on your mod set. The only section where you can go to would be the BugStomp-Reddit where people attempt to gather data on the bugs. Mentioning any Win64 bugs in any mod thread whatsoever doesn\u0027t make any sense, as Unity plugins are entirely platform independent.

You had to track everything yourself and all KSP itself did proper was let you fly the rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, the player base was pretty much limited to people who had reasonably high technical skills, these are the kind of people who are also likely to be reasonably computer savvy and so the forum (and mod bug-reports) reflected this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOver time, KSP became more and more a main-stream game, especially with the Steam release, and the player base changed to reflect that. You now have a player base that is pretty much the same as every other game out there and the forum/community has reflected this. While this increase in player base is good for the game itself, it also means that the average player is now much less technically adept, they go to make a post asking for help and don\u0027t realize that without posting the ksp_log that we are going to be unable to help them. No malice or anything on their part, they just don\u0027t know they need to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we look back at 0.24 and especially all the poor bug reports cluttering up the mod threads, we can see this effect in action well before the current events that caused this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while I strongly oppose the \u0022mod-makers need to suck it up and deal with it\u0022 as they most certainly shouldn\u0027t, it is a fact that the player base they are releasing the mods into has changed and the mod makers are going to need to take a step back and decide how they are going to handle it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a mod maker myself, I am going to post bug-reporting instructions in the first post of my thread and simply ignore bug reports that don\u0027t comply, but each mod maker will have to decide for themselves. I also have a fraction of the user base that the big mods have however so how applicable that is....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComing back around to the 64-bit locking issue, it has highlighted all this and has focused attention on the issue of mods released to undo the decisions of other mods. As a community we are currently trying to come to a set of agreeable terms on this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me personally, I fully support the principal of mods modifying other mods.

We are showing, that as a community, we cannot have a gentlemen\u0027s agreement where a mod is open enough to allow for enhancement and extension in a way agreeable and endorsed by the modder (i.e. I\u0027ve had at least three MKS forks, and whole heartedly support them all, and generally pull in features if they are good). Instead, we are showing (as a community) that defensive licensing is appropriate. Which will mean that when a modder departs (probably out of frustration), that bit of goodness is locked away forever until someone can do a clean room rebuild - and all users are out as a result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, I don\u0027t debate in any way the legality. I debate instead whether this practice is going to enhance or diminish the community, and ultimately if we look back a year from now, if we will all collectively say \u0027yeah, that was worth it\u0027, or instead lament because this was when it all started to go wrong, and nobody bothered to try and stop it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Beowolf","CreatedById":48927,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T01:03:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RoverDude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RoverDude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe modder is not going to be the one to lose - they just go onto another game or hobby (and if they are particularly maligned, will probably lock their license down before they leave).

That IMO is exactly the right thing to do. The license is where the author\u0027s intention is supposed to be specified. If that isn\u0027t the case, it\u0027s 100% the author\u0027s responsibility to fix it. And I\u0027m talking ethics, not legalities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there\u0027s a bug in a mod\u0027s code (within its intended scope), it\u0027s the author\u0027s fault, not the end-user. Well the license is a required part of a KSP mod. If there\u0027s a bug in your license, it\u0027s your responsibility to change it. It isn\u0027t my responsibility to scan everything you\u0027ve written across a 1000-page KSP forum thread and decide whether what I do will make you happy or sad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my perspective, it seems you\u0027re saying the licenses are just red tape that doesn\u0027t count. In my 30-year professional IT career, the only people I ever ran into who made that argument were the software pirates. No, I\u0027m not implying you\u0027re a pirate; only that yours is not a mainstream opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe place we go to find answers to common questions is called the FAQ. The place we go to find out how we\u0027re allowed to reuse someone else\u0027s code is called the license. If this type of reuse troubles him (and like I said, because the names weren\u0027t changed it would kinda trouble me), Ferram can add one sentence to his license like Chris did and the whole issue goes away.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T01:15:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Beowolf\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Beowolf\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrom my perspective, it seems you\u0027re saying the licenses are just red tape that doesn\u0027t count.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere are you getting that? It\u0027s clear to me that RoverDude has said that licenses do not solely determine right and wrong when forking a mod. Licenses can\u0027t perfectly encapsulate a modder\u0027s wishes, so they choose one that\u0027s close enough and make additional requests with the expectation that most people will politely respect their wishes. It\u0027s the difference between legal and common courtesy. In other words, licenses tell you what you \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E do; politeness tells you what you \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C/em\u003E do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESenshi\u0027s doing a pretty good job of finding a middle ground between the two: following the license, but also working to ensure the original authors\u0027 major concerns are addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
