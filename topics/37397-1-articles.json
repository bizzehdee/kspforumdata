This would allow you to transfer Kethane by docking. I\u0027ve used this method versus the fixed or rover-based Kethane operations, because it allows you to tap any deposit you like, and you can switch between them easily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MalfunctionM1Ke","CreatedById":71626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T08:55:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EQuantum Fuel transfer can do it. Just put the transfer probe on a tank from which you will transfer it. You might have to build a new ship and restart your mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI kinda did the same but i refine the kethane in the smallest tank on the digsite and transfer the monoprop and fuels during the docking. Than i go back down and fill up the tanks again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blizzy78","CreatedById":68543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-17T09:35:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use Romfarer\u0027s Lazor System alot which can beam anything with lasers.

If you\u0027re going to go with a rocket based rig that can land and take off, then extracting from a low gravity airless body is ideal. When I first experimented with Kethane I was mining it from Minmus and using an orbital station to do the actual refining (to save weight on the miner instead of carrying the heavy converter on the ship). The miner only had to have enough thrust to get off Minmus when fully loaded and carry just enough fuel to get to the station, to maximize the percentage of the craft weight that was Kethane (which should maximize efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways more than one way to do things though!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-18T07:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use KAS.
