Interestingly, the planet seems to be only slightly larger than eleven times Kerbin\\\u0027s size and has its own Mun in orbit. The newly discovered IL-543 is only slightly less dense than Kerbin, leading the Kerbals to believe that a gravity roughly identical to Kerbin\\\u0027s is present and holds an atmosphere slightly thinner. Future missions will be planned to land somewhere among the large land masses of IL-543 to attempt a search for life, no matter how evolved it may be.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=9690.0;attach=16357;image\u0022 alt=\u0022index.php?action=dlattach;topic=9690.0;attach=16357;image\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Radion","CreatedById":3273,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-29T23:48:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your question, no, it should not go in Roleplay, as it is completely unrelated to canon roleplay, and against the Roleplay Forum\\\u0027s rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7070.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=7070.0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-29T23:49:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer your question, no, it should not go in Roleplay, as it is completely unrelated to canon roleplay, and against the Roleplay Forum\\\u0027s rules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thobewill10","CreatedById":6148,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-29T23:58:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIntergalactic missions would take millions of years (not counting time dilation, which would reduce it, assuming a constant 1g acceleration, to ~50 years)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it supposed to be Earth?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-30T00:01:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thobewill10\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thobewill10\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntergalactic missions would take millions of years (not counting time dilation, which would reduce it, assuming a constant 1g acceleration, to ~50 years)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it supposed to be Earth?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, it\\\u0027s Earth, that\\\u0027s the joke.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere comes a sad and poorly thought out excuse for the time issue.
