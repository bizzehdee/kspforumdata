The wheels are a lie. They are fake! They are more fake than the fake water in the pool by the astronaut center!\n\nThey are only visually wheels. In fact, they are\n\n- square\n\n- with only one \u0022propulsion surface\u0022 on the bottom\n\n- not even cleanly square. They are roundish on the front and back, and they are clipped on top.\n\nSee for yourself.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ygJcrp99N8o?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nIs there some mod or some other way to get some true round wheels?

I see atleast 2. \n\nAs for the water near in the administrator pool OddFunction, that would be almost impossible to fix without changing the entire way water works in KSP (which is terrible at current, don\u0027t get me wrong), because it is above sea level.
