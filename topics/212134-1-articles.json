magical fps. but that may be because of the way a film projector works.\u00A0it doesn\u0027t display the frame for the full interval, it only opens the shutter when the frame is in the correct position.\u00A0 for the rest of the frame interval there is only black. when we moved to video systems, a lot of shows started to have what has been called \u0022the soap opera effect\u0022 (this effect is reduced on shows that were recorded on film and then transfered to video, compare st:tng to babylon5 is a good example). tvs, at least their crt anscestors, used phosphors to allow the frame to persist. so the frame was drawn and would slowly fade over time. you also interleaved 2 fields of alternating scanlines which swaps each frame.\u00A0 you are still blinking the frames, but for longer period of time.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nof course various flat panel technologies all changed that, and still do to this day. a frame can now persist for the whole interval with little or no blanking. persisting a frame like this makes the data get old the longer it lives on screen. gaming has also introduced a need to reduce the time it takes to scan out a frame. while you could reduce the time between the render call and the frame appearing on screen, you could simply let the frame persist. but if you can do that you have time to render more frames, and so thats what we do. this fills up the interval with new data, even if you are integrating your physics at a slower rate (interpolation tricks are used in this case). the whole point is to reduce the amount of time it takes to react to the game. vr has taken this to an extreme by racing the beam where a pixel is put on screen before the frame (or even scanline) has even finished rendering.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhuman brain does not work with a fixed clock like your monitor does. i think the eye reacts with changes in stimuli as they happen rather than scan everything always. so when your brain gets around noticing a pixel changing, it could be at any point in the render process, a new pixel, one thats been up a few milliseconds. resolution across the eye isnt even consistent, most of your res and sensitivity is in the middle of the visual field. so i figure a good portion of the pixels that actually render never even make it to your brain. early film and tv, with its blinking output, kind of forced your brain to refresh by blinking, and i think that may be why film is considered \u0022magical\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nultimately framerates are used as useless marketing data on various technologies. the thing that really matters is the latency. how much you can live with really depends on what you are doing. vr needs to have very low latency to reduce motion sickness. esports also benefit to help player\u0027s reaction times. most other games on the other hand, such as casual games, it really doesn\u0027t matter. it does very little for video. when i buy a screen, i usually go for size, then resolution, then framerate. now doing 4k at 144hz, and i doubt it has really improved games, or video at all over the 60hz
