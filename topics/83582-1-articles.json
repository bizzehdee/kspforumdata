This pack should be stable enough for the general public, but I really need more feedback to hone it in. The whole thing has been a fun Labor Day Weekend project. This is a total fuel overhaul, designed to adapt to new mods, and to lack the need for specific engine configs. It has basic boil-off simulation, with the ability to use electricity to store your fuels for long periods of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMajor note from dev thread:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs I have seen that there are a variety of fuel systems and tech trees, the eventual goal of this project must be to compile all of the config settings logic into a .dll so massive, that it will have appreciable gravity. The end game here must be to use this, to analyze parts on a per part basis, determine if mods are involved, and adjust settings procedurally. There is really no other way to do this. Truly, I invite people to come help on this project, because if I am left to my own devices, it may take till 0.26 to do such a thing. But this is really what needs to happen. Code needs to be written, which identifies what a part is FOR, what properties it HAS, and what dependencies it USES, and create a procedurally crafted modded config file for EACH PART. This must be the only way forward. I will continue development of the current setup for at least the next week, to make it play nice with most major mod deployments which include fuel dependencies, but then, I will be moving to the juggernaut .dll development only.

This is not a pack of wonder fuels. Not all engines will be able to run on all things. This is INTENTIONAL. If you want more variety with no extra challenge, there are plenty of mods which can provide that. If you took a look at Real Fuels and thought, \u0022maybe a simpler version would be nice\u0022, then this mod is for you.
