Not everybody wants to concern themselves with mods, therefore having a base game that is easy enough to pick up, yet has gameplay elements and options that require the player to exercise different levels of skill and knowledge, is a much better long-term choice. The career mode, such as it is, is pretty much perfectly aimed in that direction. The game limits your options greatly from the outset, at the same time not boring you with having to launch faceless probes and juggling maintenance and other running costs in your head. This allows a starting player to peek into a simplified game, start playing, and progress forward naturally as his/her skill improves, unlocking different functions and abilities gradually, slowly removing restrictions to allow them to become comfortable within the bounds they\u0027ve access to before going further.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA hardcore sim just won\u0027t be nearly as popular, and not nearly as useful as a teaching tool. A casual game will lack functionality, and any advanced realism features will have to be extensive mods, preventing advanced players from getting adequate tech support and encountering more problems than normal in the first place. A balanced mix of both would allow both teaching more advanced concepts to casual players as they reach them through Career, and mean the creation of unified systems for those advanced concepts, so that any mods bringing the game closer to \u0027hardcore\u0027 will build upon code already within the game, meaning less cross-mod interference and a better experience for everybody.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-10T14:32:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dreamixpl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dreamixpl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo Squad want KSP to be very easy, not complex, fun game?

Yes, as you might expect, regular members who have zero connection to Squad beyond having bought a product they sell will not be privy to the inner workings of their development process. It\u0027s the same way pretty much every company on the planet operates. In the past, Squad did very much try to be open about what was planned, but after the community proved it was unable to tolerate disappointments (e.g., some features having to be shelved simply because placing too much focus on them would hinder the rest of the game\u0027s development to a ludicrous degree) by causing no end of trouble when those inevitably came to pass they were more or less forced to keep things quieter.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
