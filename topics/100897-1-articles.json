All you need to do is get to orbit and Munar escape. Make sure that your Munar ejection burn is arranged such that it ends up sending you retrograde w.r.t. Kerbin. Set your Kerbin Periapsis at 30km, reenter and recover - for Science! I have returned with similar craft with similar equipment many times."},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T00:05:03Z","Content":"Should make it. I estimate over 1200m/s delta V which is more than enough.\n\nAdded- if you want to do the rocket equation delta V = g x Isp x ln current mass/ dry mass which in this case is 9.82 x 390 x ln3.76/2.715 = 1247m/s\n\nYour fuel oxidizer ratio is slightly unbalanced so you can only use 94 of your 98 fuel with that amount of oxidizer.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-28T00:14:05Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2015 12:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Reactordrone**"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T00:14:13Z","Content":"Don\u0027t forget, if you mess up, you can always get out an push!"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-28T00:43:09Z","Content":"You are lucky that tippy thing landed upright.
