I was testing a very basic launcher with four asparagus stages and no other staging. The fuel transfers just fine from tank to tank. Also if I remove the ductwork all is well with a simultaneous burn of all engines. With the asparagus staging I get a flameout in the middle of the third stage. Cause given is lack of oxidizer. All remaining tanks have fuel. It looks like maybe the ductwork handles the fuel, but not oxidizer, transfers from stage to stage so the fuel/oxidizer ratio becomes unbalanced to the point of flameout. Could someone please try one of their asparagus rigged launch vehicles to confirm that all is well internally. If so, then I will need to drill deeper to figure this one out.
