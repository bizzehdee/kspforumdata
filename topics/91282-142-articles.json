Skills is mostly a matter of hour spent learning, and this can be done during travel for instance. Depends also on drones. If you have drones and robotic servants, you\u0027ll mostly need engineer and technicians to be able to monitor, repair and program them. Agricultural skills can be limited at first, running an hydroponic farm can probably be automated a lot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, your colony is mechanized now and just need supervision. This supervision can be tricky, because you need background understanding of the specific system yur monitoring (for instance, you need to know at least about nitrates for growing plants, even in hydroponics) and it can require that humans have to do the job once in a while, to supplement a failing drone. But then, that\u0027s mostly tutoring tech, so a huge databases of all the knowledge, in read/write mode (a bit kind of a wiki) is needed at some point. As well as information tech skilled people (again, probably to monitor digital agents and assets, and fix them when needed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing you absolutely wanna do is have a high bus factor. The bus factor is defined as follow : How many people needs to be in the same bus when it have an accident and they all die for my organization to survive. When you look at company you would be surprised to note that it really often is one (for instance, the one guy who got the key to the office. If he dies in a bus accident, no one can enter the office, that\u0027s why you want more than one people with access to critical infrastructure \u2026 which then reduce the security of the access to said structure, extremely interesting topic, but then I digress).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, your first batch of colonist must have basic training is as much field as needed. Training that can be acquired during travel, but you do not want to have high skilled specialists at first, you want people who can work their way around unexpected stuff (because you\u0027ll have), being able to fix, repair and improve the tech, to be able to fix, repair and improve people, and to be able to fix, repair and improve social structures. Once everything is on the rail, you can have people specializing, which will happen naturally because of personal interests and the fact that you cannot know everything (or at least, you can only work some specific amount of time per day, and you need to share works with fellow colonists).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo maintain and grow a population, you\u0027ll need to have some medical and genetic tech. The higher your tech level is, the less people are needed. For instance, if you have exowombs and a diverse enough gene bank (that can be different from the colonist you send), you can grow your population following the growth of your outpost, with most of the adult of the trip in charge of raising the children, and teaching them (again, tutoring tech will help).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest issue is, I think, the social structure. We humans do not fare well alone or in cramped space with a limited number of people. That\u0027s one of the key recruitment issue for astronauts, you want people who can manage loneliness well, because their next email from his family is 2 light years away. Forget also about chatting with your relatives of planet, the communication lag makes it non practical (having to wait hours or month between sentences, makes conversation over long distance weird loveed up and inefficient). So your initial group should be big enough for colonists to find their social needs among the group.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat size is that group ? I think that going under ten is to low. Even ten is a low number. It\u0027s nice because a small group of people, means the strain on locally sourced resources is low, but your bus factor is low. And if the social structure is not strong enough, the colonists will eventually fights each other or be depressed and kills themselves, leading to a colony failure. One thousands seems like way too much and complex. Especially if you have one thousand people active on day one, that would requires a lot of planning and preparation before hand, remotely done without any live feed of what\u0027s happening there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, I\u0027ll guess anywhere between one to three hundred would be enough. Think nomadic tribes for instance, you want to stay in this kind of size. Your bus factor can be quite high, the initial planning can be low, especially if your space ship can be canibalised, their enough people for individual to satisfy their social needs, and it can take one or two severe catastrophic issues, leading to swath of colonists dying. Pack that with exowombs, a diverse gene banks, a good computer with\u00A0 lot of tutor tech and entertainment, and you should be able to do something permanent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really think that going under the thirty people is not viable, if you want a hard limit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arco123","CreatedById":201477,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-11T14:17:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223726962\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002291282\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221578752144\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129964\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022linuxgurugamer\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, linuxgurugamer said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurious as to where you got the \u201C600\u201D from.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhere in my mind.
