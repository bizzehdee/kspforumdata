They then return to their original positions. This even applies to containers attached to the ship via the container housing thing. When I connected a pipe port to the ground (why can you even do that?) and linked it to the rest of the ship, it did explode when the physics were applied after a switch away and back. A few more switches later and I did indeed have a total ship explosion. It would seem that this rather large variance when physics are first applied to a scene is the main culprit of the exploding. It\u0027d be nice if there were a way to minimize the amount of variance before the physics return to normal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) There is no longer a way to plug in the connector of a winch to the hook on your back without first putting the hook down. This would seem to be very inconvenient when in space or otherwise have no where to put said hook.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) What is the magnet on off when a kerbal is holding it for? Without a power source, you can\u0027t turn it on and off. However, when it is hooked to the winch and powered, the kerbal cannot turn it on and off anymore. Thus, he can only attach it to a surface, not magnetize it there. This is an issue because of the next problem listed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Once an electromagnet is attached to something, you cannot remove it again without a kerbal. Therefore, the magnet feature is no longer useful once it is attached via EVA. Is the method of attachment not magnetism? If not, what? Perhaps we need an option to fire a large solenoid from the center of the magnet and release the kerbal\u0027s chewing gum that\u0027s holding it in place?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) When getting lots of pipe ends (and I imagine other items) out of the containers, it is useful to simply keep clicking the button to get them out. They all fall on the ground, but it\u0027s much easier to get them than opening the box each time. However, this often causes the fourth or fifth item to go flying through to air at tremendous speed. While this may be a new way to reach orbit quickly, it does pose a problem if you wanted to use said part.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) After ejecting a winch, the instant stretch option appears to make it longer rather than shorter. Perhaps I misunderstand the purpose of this option, but in previous versions it appeared to very quickly shorten the extended cable to only what was needed for whatever was attached. If I miss an attempted grapple, do I have to wait for the winch to wind back in each time? My winches are modified to 300m of cable, which can take some time to get in even at full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) A fully retracted winch with an electromagnet plugged in does not pull the connector and hook up and lock in place.

I also used my own implementation for docking parts so I do not use docking node at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, about \u0022bugs\u0022 related to the way KSP handle things, I found myself that is really important that the root part of all connected parts are strongly FIXED and DO NOT MOVE when using pipes. The game rebuild the ship from this root part, so if you construct a ground base and it get inclined for what ever reason, using warp or save/load will reset parts position of the ship and you will have good chance that opposed parts get below the ground or in the air !!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Commander Gizmo\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Commander Gizmo\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOk, after some more testing with 0.4.1, I have a report to make:\u003Cp\u003EFirst, THANKS! for making such an awesome update to such and essential mod!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used the same test setup as for 0.4.0 (see my previous post), and now my ship no longer explodes instantly!

Perhaps I misunderstand the purpose of this option, but in previous versions it appeared to very quickly shorten the extended cable to only what was needed for whatever was attached. If I miss an attempted grapple, do I have to wait for the winch to wind back in each time? My winches are modified to 300m of cable, which can take some time to get in even at full throttle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) A fully retracted winch with an electromagnet plugged in does not pull the connector and hook up and lock in place.

The instant stretch option only set the cable lenght to the current distance between winch and connector. So if you eject the grapple, and it go the maximum distance, (300m for you), using it will change nothing. However, it will be usefull if for exemple you eject the grapple and it collide with something near, so the distance will be lower than the cable lenght. (ejecting set the cable lenght to the maximum allowed) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the magnet, I do not have this problem. If I fully retract a winch with a magnet attached it will lock.
