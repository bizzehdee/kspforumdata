So I tried KKKJ, K (from Kerbin), K (2 orbits later with a 200m/s retro grade burn, should bring up enough for the spacecraft to encounter Kerbin after an orbit, ideally below Dres orbit), K (relative velocity from the last assist should be enough to kick to Jool orbit) and J (final destination, Jool). In theory it should be able\u00A0to reach Jool with a 1100m/s ejection burn and a 200m/s retrograde burn, but however when I try I can\u0027t make pass Dres, can anyone try this path and also explain why this would work or how to make this work? I got stuck after the first Kerbin Assist pushed my Periapsis too high.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
