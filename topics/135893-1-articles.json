If you use Module Manager, you could either clone the probe core you require science ability from so that you can have an alternate version of it and can still use the stock core, or just edit the probe core\u0027s .cfg, if you plan on always needing to do science with it.\u00A0I\u0027d suggest adding the ModuleScienceLab and ModuleScienceConverter modules to the probe core in question, it\u0027d certainly look a lot nicer than a honey-I-shrunk-the-mobile-processing-lab deal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, though, not sure if it\u0027ll work.
