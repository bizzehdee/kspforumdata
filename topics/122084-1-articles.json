But It could use data on the actual dimensions so we have an easier time summing up the length for builds in some cases. The exact length and other dimension of parts could be useful depending on how a ship is being built. And knowing that(or it being more easily accessible) might make it easier to build certain things. Sometimes knowing how much weight you are putting into a certain frame of your ship can help you plan ahead of time. We already have thrust per weight. This is kind of just as important a piece of data. And it is not available easily or that easily derived for builds. People might figure out how to distribute the mass of the ship better in various ways and come up with better and more interesting deigns if it\u0027s easier to figure out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T07:06:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eon the little part icons when you hover over them I shows the height in the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-02T10:21:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Arugela\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Arugela\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWe already have thrust per weight.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe do?

The easiest would be a toggleable mode, where a reddish or bluish or you know color indicates the density of a part. For example, wings would be light ping, fuel tanks reddish, and nukes full red. With spaceplanes, the parts\u0027 density is really important, as you can move your CoM further back only by rearranging the parts in the fuselage, so you put the dense parts to the back. The problem is that it\u0027s hard to figure out the density of parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
