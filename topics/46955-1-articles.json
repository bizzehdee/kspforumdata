There are known issues with Unity for 64-bit Windows that cause severe crashing, to the point where the game would be beyond unplayability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not an issue that we can simply throw more programmers at or put pressure on Unity to fix either, they\u0027ve been working on the problem even longer than Squad\u0027s developers have. These things take time to fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, there already is a 64-bit binary of KSP. It is available for Linux, and takes advantage of the fact that Unity has good 64-bit support on the Linux platform. If you really want 64-bit right now, its time to install Ubuntu or Debian Linux and go right to it- although it should work on other distributions your mileage may vary. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E64-bit KSP for Mac should be coming soon, as Unity has announced that they are close to a fix that hopefully will be worked in for us as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E64-bit KSP for Windows is sadly still some time off, as they haven\u0027t yet solved the stability problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-30T05:41:03Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2013 05:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by OdinYggd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
