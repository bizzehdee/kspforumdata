Using the newly discovered rapierspike technology (thankyou to who discovered this, i cant remember who) and a futuristic looking low drag airframe, the hyperspike can get to mach 4.4 at altitude! which then makes the use of oxidizer in the atmosphere brief and minimal. it can take 8 kerbals or any cargo that fits in its bay (i didnt make a cargo version but it could easily be done by swapping the crew cabins for a long mk2 cargo bay) the crew version can have over 800 delta v in orbit!
