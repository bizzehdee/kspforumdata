See attached .craft file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy problem is this: Near the end of the 3rd \u0027stage,\u0027 (i.e. after the first two pairs of boosters have dropped, and the craft is burning fuel from the third pair of boosters) it becomes ridiculously unstable. Starts turning all over the place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy theory is that as fuel is burned, the center of gravity drops back toward the engines where it is harder for the engines\\\u0027 thrust vectoring to correct the heading of the vehicle. It doesn\\\u0027t crop up on earlier stages because the vehicle is still too heavy for the fuel level in a single booster pair to affect the CG enough for it to become a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny suggestions? RCS isn\\\u0027t powerful enough, if only they had come out with some \u0027super-RCS\u0027 thrusters to go with the super-sized engines and fuel tanks and the increased SCS torque on command modules.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Analogy","CreatedById":28969,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T08:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve managed to take this thing into orbit one time, when stars managed to align and not knock my vehicle into a spin...
