Much like Eve, but with the benefit of oxygen for air-breathing engines.\n\nI experimented with different engines but eventually used the Whiplash Turbo Ramjet as the thrust ramps up significantly as the speed picks up so you get increasing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\nI used four outer Vectors to get the party started - you need to get air moving through the ramjets and they help to lift the craft through the thick lower air. There\u0027s an inner core of 5 ramjets, with 4 on the outside. On top of all that is a Vector with drop tanks, followed by a final Aerospike stage. So, the staging order goes:\n\n- Fire up the ramjets and Vectors, drop the legs, drop the Vectors, drop the outer ramjets, drop the lower stage and light the Vector stage, drop the Vector drop tanks, stage and fire up the Aerospike.\n\n![eDhG8rd.png](http://i.imgur.com/eDhG8rd.png)\n\nIt\u0027s tricky to get it right and it took many attempts to find the optimal curve before I was eventually able to limp in to a 200K circular orbit.\n\nIt won\u0027t handle sea-level - needs to be at least 3000m ASL.\n\nParts are mostly stock - I used lithobraking legs just so it looks tidier (landing speed is around 10m/s so I could have used multiple sets of stock legs). I also used the ladders from the lithobraking pack - those are great, I had real hassle with Eve using fiddly small ladders.\n\nOf course, you have to get there first... I used my standard Space-Y heavy lifter and a nice reverse gravity assist from a handily placed Tylo to get to low Titanus orbit in one launch\n\n![3y0Gs04.png](http://i.imgur.com/3y0Gs04.png)\n\nThen you have to deal with the heat. I used the same trick as Eve - 4 inflatable shields at the base and then a \u0027flower\u0027 of 5 shields at the top to act as an airbrake and to keep the craft oriented through entry. I started from a very low (165K) orbit and dropped the PE down to just 168.5K in order to start a very shallow re-entry.\n\n![nTCvTkg.png](http://i.imgur.com/nTCvTkg.png)\n\nAt first the whole thing swings like a big pendulum but eventually it settles down and it was all a bit smoother than Eve.\n\nOnce through the heat, the upper \u0027Flower\u0027 decouples as one unit, then the craft flips upside down allowing the lower 4 shields to be jettisoned. After that, let the speed come down as the air thickens before deploying 2 drogues followed by 6 chutes. I was lucky to land at a high enough elevation at the first attempt.\n\nThen, a quick flag plant before we\u0027re off again.\n\n![zJwTrA5.png](http://i.imgur.com/zJwTrA5.png)\n\nNow I just have to go and pick my guy up... surely after that the rest of the planets will be easy!\n\nPlummet."}]}
