Mainly because they require a lot of seams and are cumbersome to unwrap properly. Try a cylinder first instead. Place a single vertical seam on one of the outer edges and seams along the top/bottom rims(in edge select mode so you dont tag all the verticies). If you want it easier You can also use the smart unwrap function. basically Dont use the default unwrap without placing seams first, The result will look like the picture you posted if you do.

UV mapping doesn\u0027t change the physical shape of the object. All it does is flatten out the shape to UV space, corresponding to X and Y on paper if you will, so the software knows which point on the 3d shape gets which pixel from your texture. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eimagine if you ironed a shirt, nice and flat. it\u0027s got some pattern on it. This is the UV unwrapped state. Now you change it up into some different shape, as you do when making a 3d model. The shirt looks different, but the pattern remains the same no matter how you bend, fold, roll the shirt. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUV unwrap changes this step around. You start with a shaped; and you flatten it out later so you can apply the texture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etake your eyeball for instance. I marked out the locations on the sphere that correspond to your texture. Red line is the middle of the sphere. The texture itself needs to be adjusted: The veins and the blue eye area should be on opposite sides of the map, the polar sections. The equator area is largely featureless, unless you want stuff there. The UV is then adjusted accordingly as you will be looking at the eyeball from either poles most of the time. So the UVs are flattened out from points of interest. You want the least amount of distortion at points of interest, so those areas should be the center of your UV patches; areas that are largely flat and featureless, you can push those toward the edges of your UV patches where distortions are more likely to occur. So in the 2nd UV unwrap the ball is split along the equator instead of vertically, the top half mapped to the eye side of the adjusted texture; lower half mapped to the back of the eyeball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FhnStZU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FhnStZU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-25T14:25:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/25/2014 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by nli2work\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
