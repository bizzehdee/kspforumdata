I\u0027m using the KW Rocketry pack for fairings and engine parts, and I have a simple, solid launch vehicle that is just a single engine, single fuel tank, winglets, and the fairing. This is the only mod I have that affects flight behavior in any way. For some reason, the payload is also subject to aerodynamic dis-assembly. Despite being totally contained in the fairings, weaker parts like solar pannels, batteries, and TAC life support containers break off as if they were attached to the outside. I\u0027ve tried flying at relatively low speeds, around 200m/s at 3-4km and holding that speed for as long as possible, but speed doesn\u0027t seem to be my issue here, because the parts fall off around the same time as they do if I launch without fairings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have another issue, though this one might just be my incompetence. If I have a particularly long payload in the fairings and I turn at all (5 degree turns) before I escape the atmosphere, then the rocket flips over and splits at the coupler. Even rockets that don\u0027t use any fairings are completely unable to turn more than 5 degrees before I leave the atmosphere altogether. Because of this, gravity turns of any sort are impossible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts and/or suggestions would be appreciated. I\u0027m going to try out NEAR when I have time to see if that helps, but if there\u0027s a way to fix the fairing issue I\u0027d prefer to stick with FAR.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BudgetHedgehog\uFEFF","CreatedById":104112,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T11:05:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@dweorg: Couple things - there\u0027s a bug with FAR that it sometimes doesn\u0027t calculate things correctly upon launch.

I bump it shortly after launch in the direction I\u0027m trying to go, maybe 5 degrees. After that, I\u0027ve tried a few different things. Another slight bump 2km or so up causes the craft to wobble if SAS is on or to spin out if it isn\u0027t. I\u0027ve tried letting the craft fall with the prograde after bumping it, but even stopping it with manual control and SAS isn\u0027t enough; it also spins out. I may just be going too fast, if all I need is 1.2 to 1.4. At half thrust this particular rocket has a TWR of ~1.75, but before this one I\u0027ve launched slower craft with similar results.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rabada","CreatedById":66044,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T17:25:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you Ferram for this wonderful mod, it has completely changed KSP for the better and it is on my list of must have mods for every game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still trying to figure out the intracacies of this mod.
