It happened previously with another craft that had 1 crew member on board. Everything happened the same, and after it did, the 2nd time I started up the game, he was listed KIA in the Acadamy. I suspect this will happen once I quit the game and start it again, but for now they are MIA. This bug, if unable to recover from, lost me 4 astronauts (like 300k\u002B each) and a ship that was 400k. This is ridiculous.

So I somehow restarted my game a second time and it seemed to have loaded up persistent or an autosave correctly; i think it loaded an auto-save, because I wound up where everything was fine shortly before I encountered the glitch, and contact with the asteroid. I viewed the 2 ships that were previously missing and they were there, so I saved a new save. I had yet to dock with the asteroid I was going to move from Jool; I realized I encountered the glitch after i finished moving the asteroid to a Jool encounter. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo since the game loaded 50min before I was to intercept the asteroid, I decided to check once more that I could visit the 2 ships the glitched out. They worked fine and did not induce the HUD glitch. So I decided to do as I did last time and move the asteroid. \u003Cem\u003EThe second after I docked with it\u003C/em\u003E, I went to the tracking station and went to fly the SP333.
