At least I thought so:\n\n![qiaJ9Io.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/qiaJ9Io.png?1)\n\nI just made this small plane, just screwing around, when I noticed this. See how the CoL isn\u0027t aligned longitudinally? WHY for the love of Kod? Everything was made with mirror symmetry and angle snapping, there is no way this is assymetric....anyone knows what is the problem? I tweaked the vertical stabilizers a bit with the rotation tool and it seemed to adjust it a bit, but not perfectly, the craft still has a tendency to roll."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T07:28:29Z","Content":"I\u0027ve seen similar problems. Based on my experience double vertical stabilizers aren\u0027t always mirrored correctly. In normal flight one should generate lift to the left the other to the right cancelling each other out. If both \u0027point\u0027 in the same direction you\u0027ll start rolling.\n\nWhat you could do is remove the entire engine-wing-tail assembly on both sides and reattach with mirror symmetry. With a little luck this will reset symmetry."},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T07:29:24Z","Content":"I\u0027d suspect something having radial symmetry when it should be mirror. My trick to make sure it doesn\u0027t happen is to grab the root part of the engine-wing construction, make sure the symmetry is set to \u0027mirror\u0027 (\u0027R\u0027 key switches that) and reattach it. If the problem presists do the same with the rest of the parts.\n\nAnd ninja\u0027d. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegetal","CreatedById":147251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T07:45:52Z","Content":"As I said, I made sure I was using mirror symmetry.
