You have to insert your decimal in front of a number after typing that number. If a 0 is displayed then you can\u0027t type the decimal at all. If you want 0.5 you have to type it as 5 then put the cursor in front of the 5 and type the decimal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom a coding perspective, there is another way of doing it, which is to treat that field as a string, then parse the string and then assign the result to your variable. If you don\u0027t understand coding then just accept that it\u0027s a problem with Unity\u0027s GUI implementation and not the fault of the people who coded or maintain or otherwise contribute to DREC. It can\u0027t be fixed from this end but it could be worked around and it\u0027s kind of hacky so maybe that\u0027s why nobody\u0027s bothered doing it. I contribute little code snippets from time to time so maybe one day I\u0027ll write something up myself and do a pull request but there\u0027s never anything less constructive I could be doing and from a player perspective, it can be worked around as I described.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other, there\u0027s that word again; difficulty and balance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the thing.
