When I bought it it was on the higher end of average (something about a dedicated graphics processor?) but it\u0027s starting to show its age. I started trying to make a bunch of spaceplanes and giant interplanetary freighters with a couple of mods, but flying them slows the game down to a crawl while my computer\u0027s fan goes full tilt. I know part of this was due to poor CPU optimization which can\u0027t really be improved with mods and I\u0027m unsure if newer versions of the game fix this. I\u0027ve heard that 64 bit KSP mostly gets rid of this kind of thing, but still seems to be unstable and has only a small selection of mods. My question is what are some mods I could use to help the main version of the game run faster and more smoothly?

You may need to pick just a couple and go with those.

Looking at the ones he listed, he could easily get rid of Lazor and likely save himself some memory.

I\u0027d get the Docking Port Alignment mod for that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB9 does work in 1.04 (Though you have to dig a little for the updated download) but if you\u0027re already having trouble running the game, B9 isn\u0027t going to help even after its been trimmed down unless you also go through it and delete anything you won\u0027t use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich also leads me to my next point: Culling and self optimization. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething I do to pack on a mod list like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L1xjL8n.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022L1xjL8n.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs to go through my mods and delete any parts that I won\u0027t end up using or just plain don\u0027t need. It does require that you\u0027re familiar with everything in the mod in question though, as well as a bit of tedium of tracking down the parts themselves if they aren\u0027t labeled clearly. But it does pay off, especially if you end up deleting a lot, as it all adds up over time. Sometimes you might download a huge pack like Tantares or KW, but then end up only using a couple of parts out of each of them, and getting rid of everything else saves boat loads of memory. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the same vein, I also recommend going through and manually reducing texture sizes. This wont\u0027 have much of a use if you\u0027re only going for pure parts and gameplay type mods, but if you ever want to do any graphics mods, manually downsizing textures (Which seldomly sacrifices visual quality to an unacceptable level) is a god send. Hence why I was able to pack on what I was able to in that list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, make a decision on what kind of style you want your KSP install to be. Do you want all stockalike parts, or do you want replicas? Sci-fi or realistic? Pure cartoony fun or strict utilitarian no-nonsense? Choosing how you want everything to be themed will help you decide what to get rid of from your mods, but also save you memory in the long haul as then you won\u0027t even bother getting certain mods unless theres specific parts you want out of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stone Blue","CreatedById":77721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T17:59:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E^^ Yup everything G\u0027th said...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso as far as the Lazor Docking cam, if thats all your using it for, if you use IVA\u0027s and RPM, you can install Hullcam VDS to get a nice IVA docking cam view on all your docking ports using an MFD in IVA view...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have been using KSP ModAdmin to cull parts mods...It is still kind of tedious and time consuming, but it definately makes it easier, as it shows both the part name shown in the VAB/SPH, and the folder/file names which dont always match...Plus, you delete the parts right in the prugram, instead of having to manually find and delete folders...Just be careful, as some mods reuse the same textures for multiple parts...
