I beg you to incorporate this into the main game just the way it is because its perfect. It allows us to change keys and create more than one profiles on the fly - in game. And those effects are immediately shown. For instance because I like to use my right stick for camera it means I have to decide on where to map roll and yaw, but since AFBW allows more profiles to be loaded I can just change between them in game without any problems.
