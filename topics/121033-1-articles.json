I like trying to overshoot by 30-50 km so I can bleed of excess speed with parachutes and airbrakes on final approach.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisclaimer: I totally used mechjeb to get detailed feedback on my exact position and predicted landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T17:57:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022thedanieldude\u0022 data-cite=\u0022thedanieldude\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am fine with using wings if I need too.
