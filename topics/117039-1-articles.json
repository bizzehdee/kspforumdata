I have Gigantor XL solar panels surface-attached to the longest I-beams (M-beam 200 I-beam) stacked in a series. Without SAS or anything turned on, the I-beams will start to build up a rotational wobble, like they\u0027re twisting back and forth like a washing machine. This causes the solar panels to wobble on them, and as the shimmy builds it will eventually cause the solar panels to break off violently.\n\n![screenshot8_zpsfvemb3gf.png](http://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q737/raptor_9000/Placeholder%20Photos/screenshot8_zpsfvemb3gf.png)\n\nI have the solar panel arms mounted with OKTO probe cores and RCS thrusters on the small docking ports so I can undock and reposition the solar arrays directly into the sun. When I undock the solar \u0022arms\u0022, the shimmy will go away if I momentarily tap time warp. As soon as I reattach, the shimmy will begin to build eventually."},{"CreatedByName":"MalevolentNinja","CreatedById":150038,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T02:28:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Trying to set up a mining operation on the Mun.
