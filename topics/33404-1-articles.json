Whatever you eject is the propellant. It can be rocket exhaust, stream of ions from an ion drive, light from the photon drive, or even the wrench you decided to sacrifice to try and get yourself back to the ship you accidentally drifted away from.

For starters, your fuel is your propellant. The same stuff you burn for energy, after undergoing a chemical reaction, becomes the stuff you eject to comply with conservation of momentum. Worse yet, bipropellant fuel consists of two components, one of which we usually call fuel and the other oxidizer.
