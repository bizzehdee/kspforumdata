Drag is calculated and applied on a per-part basis, with the drag area being calculated as 0.008*m*Cd using mass in tons as m and the part\u0027s drag value as Cd. Not all parts have a Cd of 0.2, quite notably nosecones have a lower Cd and thus create less drag per unit mass. That means that placing nosecones ahead of the CoM increases the directional stability of a craft, while placing them behind decreases stability. Location matters, but orientation (for non-wing parts) and occlusion do not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, the very minor stabilizing effect of well placed nosecones is generally a poor tradeoff for the increased mass and drag. Hopefully the new aero model that is coming will take shape into account in a way similar to FAR and make nosecones more useful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"7499275","CreatedById":70640,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T00:34:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPoint is, don\u0027t need it in stock.
