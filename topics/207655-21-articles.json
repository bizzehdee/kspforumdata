If do that together with black rams, the lambs born colorful.. If do that with colored sticks before the sheep\u00A0eyes, the principle remains.\u0022, that\u0027s what happened in that story.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u0022Don\u0027t let a pregnant woman see ugly things, or the baby may born ugly\u0022, and other such traditions. Because they understand the birth energy as a sum of energies consumed by the fertile female.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso this means that if a non-human \u0022energy\u0022 had been used (Zeus\u0027 in case of his girlfriends and their sons (partially affecting younger semigod\u0027s brothers), or bull\u0027s in case of Pasiphae), the result may be viable but anomalous (a semigod or a teriomorphous monster), but absolutely not unexpected or impossible. Of course, in the archaic picture of the world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, the archaic people easily can accept that a hero or a monster may have several fathers (say, a god and a king), as the god\u0027s \u0022mating energy\u0022 enforces and overrides the human one.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, Heracles is also the king\u0027s son.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat the archaic people often don\u0027t see, is the discrete character of a\u00A0 connection between that exact mating act and that exact birth.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey see the birth as a female function from all or some mating acts of the preceding period, and other kinds of events, like seen images. The antiscientific telegony theory follows this tradition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis also makes strange the idea that a hunter could even care about pregnancy duration of wild species before he became a cattleman and started observing exact animals in controlled environment.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be interesting to look at the paleolythic hunter familiar with that exact female deer for eight months instead of killing it.

IIRC the caves were abandoned and re-populated several times during a thousand year period or so, so each series of paintings stretches a few hundred years, say a dozen generations at most.

None of that means the markings actually refer to fertility cycles, but you can rest assured that people were aware of how baby deer came to be long before the Lascaux paintings were made. One of the reasons the Lascaux paintings are considered so interesting is because the depiction of the animals is quite advanced, using techniques like perspective that weren\u0027t seen before. It\u0027s safe to say these people were astute observers of the animals around them and made an effort to reproduce them in a realistic rather than symbolic manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI visited the Lascaux site in the 80s, it\u0027s quite impressive.
