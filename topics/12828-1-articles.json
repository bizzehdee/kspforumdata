I found that these are the best for take off and ascent, as they allow you to lift the nose whilst keeping the craft stable. However, re-entering the atmosphere at orbital velocities is a bit of a problem...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nose lifts like crazy and even with your finger strapped to the W key, it\\\u0027s near impossible to reach the ground safely - you flip up and go into a mad spin, and then the ground gives you a nice 100m/s hi-five in the face...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has happened with a lot of my high altitude, high speed air/space craft, but with a bit of research, I found that the Advanced SAS more than solved the problem!

We\\\u0027ve found that reentering at a very slight angle helps maintain control of the space plane. Of course this makes aiming for the space center a hundred times harder, but at least you won\\\u0027t spin out of control (or in my case sometimes, fly backwards).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, tapping the SAS key helps stabilize the plane, but only if you\\\u0027re not at a steep angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut yeah, I\\\u0027ll have to try that Advanced SAS for landing, hehe.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
