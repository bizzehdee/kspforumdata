For the first part of the game (inside Kerbin system) everything was normal but when I tried to use aero breaking with higher speeds the ships keeps exploding on reentry with practically no loss of ablative shielding (maybe just few units before the explosion). So there is plenty of ablative shielding left but ship keep exploding. I tried different angles and heights as well as different heatshilds configurations (including multiple heatshilds sandwich) using the Hyperdit and Jool reenty as the reference but looks like it is almost impossible to perform reentry on speeds over 4 km/s with most heatshilds configurations. Where no FAR installed there is normal reentry with proper heatshilds and proper loss of ablative shielding on reentry. Is this normal behavior or a bug?

There\u0027s a lot of H2 in Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere so Jool\u0027s atmosphere is probably not very dense. You wouldn\u0027t be getting very much drag in the upper atmosphere so if you\u0027re coming in too steep then you don\u0027t have enough decelleration before max Q and that\u0027s where you\u0027re going to hit the most severe reentry effects. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is probably the reason, (I need to do some testing to figure out more), but you might be right, since reentry to Eve with the same design goes ok with FAR and DR. But this makes Jool virtually inaccessible without some significant design efforts (i.e. even smaller mass, larger heat shields, real chutes mod with kevlar aero breaking at high altitudes e.t.c.) . FAR also mostly ruin the aero breaking especially from the high speeds. Aerobreaking at high altitudes is inefficient and going deeper into atmosphere makes your ship explode.
