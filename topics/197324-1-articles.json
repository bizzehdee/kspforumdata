When making maneuver nodes and getting encounters the game stops and glitches. And sometimes you miss those predicted encounters and you have to play\u00A0with the maneuver nodes more. When moving the muniver nodes on a particular part of this orbit your on its sometimes go really slow and sometimes goes really fast. This is annoying because then i have to make a whole new node in a different place. I wish it would go faster and less glitchy. Or it would be able to hold on the muniver nodes and move it quickly across the orbit your on like PC. Please fix this in KSP and KSP2 (for future reference).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
