Real reaction wheels *do* rotate the craft about the center of mass; anything else would violate conservation of momentum (as it would change the velocity of the center of mass without ejecting anything). Not sure what the method is precisely, but real reaction wheels can\u0027t move the craft precisely because they *do* rotate the craft about the center of mass. The real question is \u0022what in KSP moves the center of mass without using some form of reaction\u0022; *that* causes reactionless motion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor instance, if the method is something like \u0022rotate so the full tank is behind, pump fuel from back to front, rotate so the full tank is in the back, repeat\u0022, the issue is that transferring fuel from back tank to front tank would really shift the craft backwards while keeping the center of mass in the same place. Not sure if that\u0027s actually what makes this \u0022drive\u0022, but it seems to fit the description you gave; this type of scheme works if reaction wheels rotate about the CoM and fuel transfers don\u0027t keep the CoM in the same place (shifting the craft). Propulsion appears to happen on the rotation, but the real propulsion happens when you transfer fuel (the craft may appear to move during rotation, but the important motion is the center of mass, which would only happen when you transfer fuel). A similar scheme (you just rotate to put full tank in front and transfer fuel from front to back) works if fuel transfers shift the craft to keep CoM in the same place but reaction wheels rotate about the wheel. Here, propulsion appears to happen when fuel is transferred (shifting the craft), but actual propulsion happens on the rotation (when CoM moves).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-22T14:54:40Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2014 02:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by cpast\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JWag","CreatedById":112631,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T15:27:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESomewhere I read that \u003Cem\u003Evernier\u003C/em\u003E engines were coming in 0.24.

I can\u0027t remember the name but it showed how to RW did stuff against the laws of physics such as rotating the craft at its center of mass. You can try this by putting a reaction wheel in between two symmetrical fuel tanks. Make sure one is empty then put it in orbit. You can actually move your craft by transferring fuel to the tanks every time you rotate once. In real life this is impossible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe video was about KSP\u0027s way of cheating with regards to inertia, in that it doesn\u0027t simulate a momentum shift accompanying the pumping of fuel from one tank to another. Scott was able to \u0022walk\u0022 the ship through space because the CoM shifting that KSP does when pumping fuel, only applies as a \u0022center of rotation\u0022 and \u0022camera focus\u0022, rather than physically moving the spacecraft around the CoM (That is, the CoM moves in space relative to the universe, while the fuselage\u0027s position doesn\u0027t, when in fact it should be the other way around). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the video:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lnvh08GBOII?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T19:38:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cpast\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cpast\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Efine control is because it\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Emuch\u003C/em\u003E weaker than the main RCS, so controlling how long you fire it for gives fine control)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeaking of that, I\u0027d love to see something like RLA Stockalike\u0027s tiny RCS quads added to the core game...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T21:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAren\u0027t the RW\u0027s shaped wrong as well?
