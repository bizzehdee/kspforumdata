What happen is you have a package which has a bundle of x-ray gain medium rods, each with targeting mechanism. When a nuke goes off near the bundle of rods each rod is energised by the flood of photons from the bomb. The gain medium then focus all that energy into a laser beam just like conventional visible light laser, only this is a beam of x-ray capable of doing tremendous damage.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt has to be powered by a nuclear bomb because as with regular visible light laser, you have to pump the gain medium with photos of same wavelength, and there\u0027s not that many good source of x-ray or gamma ray. Fortunately nuclear bomb is an excellent source and a ship with orion drive has nukes on tap when it\u0027s thrusting. So with Michael, it would fire a bundle of these x-ray gain mediums in between detonation, each of the rods then get pointed at a target. When the next bomb goes off it both propels the ship and energise the spurt bomb. X-ray laser shoots everywhere blowing up enemy digit ships all around Michael. After firing the gain medium rods would have been vaporised by the bomb, their job done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-02T03:06:00Z\u0022 title=\u002201/02/2016 03:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rocket In My Pocket","CreatedById":154640,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T03:36:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the design of that thing, very \u0022hard sci-fi\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould be amazing to see it built in KSP, but idk if it\u0027s even possible...I mean it\u0027s just so damn huge!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI gotta read this book.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galane","CreatedById":77949,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-02T05:51:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n$4 for the e-book \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.baenebooks.com/p-920-footfall.aspx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.baenebooks.com/p-920-footfall.aspx\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note the Free Library for free books.
