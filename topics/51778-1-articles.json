I would just like to see a realistic looking little colored light where a planet is (not like a ship marker, kind of like how you can see Saturn at sunset) just so you know where the planet is. It could fade away when the planet reaches a distance where its barely visible without mods. You should also be able to switch it off in settings in case you have a telescope mod installed, where the light would block out the planet if you where looking at it from far away. It\u0027s nothing game changing, just a few dots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-PBW\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T02:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can already do this, it\u0027s just that the planets are incredibly hard to see. As far as I know, it\u0027s not just a light, it\u0027s the actual scaledspace mesh of the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou might be able to find one if you hunt around with the target marker and the IVA zoom, but I agree that perhaps there should be a more intense or easier to see light from the planets. Perhaps at around the brightness and size of Minmus from Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
