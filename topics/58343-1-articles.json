I\u0027ve been messing with these tanker stations in ~125-150km Kerbin orbit for my outgoing gas guzzlers and to experiment with docking configurations for orbital ship building other than in a straight line. I want to have my pieces arranged rotationally correct basically so that if I build something large I can fire the engines off in pairs and not have the ship cutting cartwheels through space like my Minmus mission (single docking ports) where the outside engines were .1 degree off from each other. My first dual port design worked pretty well, which was to just pick lines on the tanks and reuse the same core with docking ports already placed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2013-12-2502-18-48-75.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2013-12-2502-18-48-75.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is what if I want to put something different onto the same ports? I am scared to just guess how far apart to put them and hope it works. So I tried this method:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/KSP2013-12-3003-15-12-44.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP2013-12-3003-15-12-44.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a bi-stack adapter with a battery as a spacer to prevent clipping of the docking ports out the backside of the adapter. It\u0027s gotta look nice too right? The battery packs aren\u0027t heavy and I certainly don\u0027t need that much electricity but the problem is it doesn\u0027t seem to be very stable. It already flexes just when I rotate the station, I\u0027d hate to throttle up the outside engines. And I can\u0027t exactly hang that huge assembly off just any payload coming into orbit, it\u0027d be silly. That and it leaves my connected modules miles apart, which in this one case is perfectly fine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I\u0027m asking is there a reliable way to place dual or more docking ports that I can make it standardized for use with all my building needs and won\u0027t fall apart or add too much extra crap to my ship? How do YOU make sure your orbitally constructed vessels aren\u0027t going to shake apart or thrust different directions? Maybe I\u0027m missing something here.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-31T02:43:04Z\u0022 title=\u002212/31/2013 02:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Duke23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zxczxczbfg","CreatedById":74636,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T02:45:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI make sure they don\u0027t thrust in different directions by using MechJeb\u0027s docking guidance and enabling \u0022Force Roll\u0022 on both ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Duke23","CreatedById":96591,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-31T02:49:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, I see.
