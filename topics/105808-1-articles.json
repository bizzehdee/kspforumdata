It claims to allow viewing from the \u0022safety of Kerbin\u0022, but I can only activate the map by right-clicking on the Survey Scanner part. The resources menu (in the \u0022Knowledge Base\u0022) doesn\u0027t even show up in the map view, and does nothing at all in the Tracking Station. Am I doing something wrong here?\n\nMaybe it\u0027s just me... 1.0 is a great update but Resource scanning seems pretty hacked-in and glitchy."},{"CreatedByName":"Lorunification","CreatedById":135645,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:37:29Z","Content":"Hi Nikola,\n\nThe resource system actually works perfectly as intended.\n\nThere are basically 2 things you need to do:\n\n1. Get a satellite equipped with the M700 Survey Scanner into a polar orbit around any object. From there you can trigger a scan for resources. (Note: The satellite needs a coms device)\n\n2. Get a drilling rig to the body that is able to drill up ore and convert it into fuel.\n\nThere are a few other things you can do to improve the outcome. The Narrow Band scanner for example gives you more detailed information about the ore deposits. But you can also just land where the map shows lots of ore (i.e. cutoff \u003E 70%)\n\nStep 1 is optional (in theory) but you do not know where resources are when you do not scan a body beforehand.\n\nAfter you performed step 1 you should be able to view the resource deposits within the map view by clicking the resource button on the right hand side of the screen. From there you can also setup color and texture as well as the cutoff.\n\nFew Notes:\n\n- Having an engeneer in you drilling rig massively increases efficiency.\n\n- ISRU Unit uses massive power. So don\u0027t forget to bring solar panels and batteries.\n\n- Panels also help against overheating.\n\nHave fun!\n\nIf you have any more questions just let me know.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T22:41:33Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 10:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lorunification**"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:09:39Z","Content":"But that\u0027s the problem: There is no resource button in the map view, and in the Tracking Station, it won\u0027t show anything."},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:25:31Z","Content":"It is the button under the planet information tab in both the Map View and Tracking station. \n\nHere\u0027s a Quick and dirty tutorial\n\n[https://youtu.be/tDmJZueCK4s?t=432](https://youtu.be/tDmJZueCK4s?t=432)"},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T23:38:45Z","Content":"Ohhh, I didn\u0027t realize you had to click on Ore!

Even with an engineer and 36 small wing/stabilizers, everything eventually shuts down and stops working. This system is non-funtional. They should have included some heatsinks in this release or they should have reduced the heat output at least to where these things work at greater than .2% efficiency.
