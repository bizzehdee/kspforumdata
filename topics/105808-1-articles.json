Get a satellite equipped with the M700 Survey Scanner into a polar orbit around any object. From there you can trigger a scan for resources. (Note: The satellite needs a coms device)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Get a drilling rig to the body that is able to drill up ore and convert it into fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few other things you can do to improve the outcome. The Narrow Band scanner for example gives you more detailed information about the ore deposits. But you can also just land where the map shows lots of ore (i.e. cutoff \u0026gt; 70%)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1 is optional (in theory) but you do not know where resources are when you do not scan a body beforehand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you performed step 1 you should be able to view the resource deposits within the map view by clicking the resource button on the right hand side of the screen. From there you can also setup color and texture as well as the cutoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFew Notes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Having an engeneer in you drilling rig massively increases efficiency.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ISRU Unit uses massive power.
