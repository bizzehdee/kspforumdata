Blender changes the axis of the files, so it\\\u0027s not your fault.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBlender changes the scene axis on export, but not the object axis. When the game loads the parachute model, it uses the scene axis for the parts. But for the chute, it checks the object axis, which Blender has not corrected. (At least as far as I can tell).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, there are three ways to fix this. Rotate your entire model 90 degrees on the x axis. Go into the .collada file and edit the attributes in a text editor. Or do it the way I do and \u0027cheat\u0027. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI make a new axis (Add: Empty) then rotate it 90 degrees on the x axis. Call this obj_canopy. Now go to your chute object, and change it\\\u0027s parent to the new axis you made. Rotate your parachute -90 degrees on the x axis. You should now have your chute facing the correct way in Blender, and when in game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ll try and add this to my tutorial ASAP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"prefim","CreatedById":842,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-29T17:33:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Ben,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get what you are saying but I\\\u0027m not using blender, thats lightwave 10 in the screenshot. and I spit out OBJ files not DAE which for everything else in the game seem to work (see my tardis and orion releases) but for this the canopy object behaves differently to the other parts of the object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my images you can see the I have the chute the right way round in game (even if its off in lightwave) but it rotates around its centre not its tip so the string waggles back and forth (and i found out recently that if I turn the ship the chute does some very bizarre things!). its all to do with the object origin i know but I don\\\u0027t see how to change it with what I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhats the cheat in blender BTW?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Technical Ben","CreatedById":10512,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-11-29T22:09:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I missed that somehow. As said. In Blender I make a new \u0027empty object\u0027 or an empty axis. I rotate the axis - 90 degrees on the x direction. Then add the chute to the axis as a child (this should turn your cute around as well). Then I rotate the chute back (but keep the empty axis at - 90 degrees). This should force the program to rotate the axis properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is Art programs use one set of co-ordinates and engineering programs use another. Guess what category games and programming come under?
