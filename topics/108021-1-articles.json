So while my girlfriend got to ride with my family in a car, I had to go with a tram. As luck would have it, about halfway between two cities, our tram hit a car on an intersection. No major destruction, but if it wasn\u0027t for that one random guy who happened to live nearby, recognized that I was in a hurry to the prom and was nice enough to offer me a ride, I wouldn\u0027t have made it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T20:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActuall6 in scotland we have high school prom, have another 3yrs till that horror.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe did have a Primary 7 leavers party, but that was more of, the girls dancing and the boys running around and our teacher telling us good luck in HS.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LABHOUSE","CreatedById":107761,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T22:18:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EB\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6a\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6p\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6t\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6i\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6s\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6t\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6 \u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6b\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6r\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6a\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6i\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6n\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6w\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6a\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6s\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6h\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6i\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6n\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6g\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6 \u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6i\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6n\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6s\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6t\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6i\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6t\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6u\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6t\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6e\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6s\u00C3\u0152\u00C2\u00B6 christian schools have no prom... kinda hard to when the largest graduating class was 12 people (smallest was 3)...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Newt","CreatedById":131025,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T00:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy highschool was small, but we had a prom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stayed up really late.
