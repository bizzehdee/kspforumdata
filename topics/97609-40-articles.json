Instead, I will have to scratch my head over delta-V measurements, transfer window planning (so that I know how much life support to pack) and construction schedules.

I just take it as a given, that when something like meaningful time is to be implemented, it would come with things like a calendar with events-to-come-soon would auto-inserted and entries can be made by the player to plan stuff. Or (actually: and) an auto-pause function that would warp you to the next event at highest possible (even beyond cuttent max speed - as fast as your machine can handle it) warp, if you want it to. Possibly individual schedules for each flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a convention, anything that has a date or time on it, should be added to the flight schedule (if flight related)/calendar (if program related) by simply clicking on said date/time.

Occasional failures should not result in instant game overs - there could be the option to acquire loans for example (which only makes sense with meaningful time). Limited periodic government payments, too, maybe - so that you can save \u0026amp; warp your way out. Which brings me to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere needs to be a some sort of timelimit or timescore to the game. Like in XX years from game start some catastrophe will have to be averted (meteor strike to be repelled / sun going nova and being able to leave the system with a colony ship...), after which your score is tallied. Or you get score for the SCI you collect based on how soon you collect it. So, save up\u0026amp;warp will let you keep playing, but your score will suffer.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-22T00:01:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had my fears about whether SQUAD could do this.

It means our departure from the Early Access program, to be counted as a pblished title. And this is worth stressing: it means nothing else \u003Cem\u003Ebut \u003C/em\u003Ethat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving out of Early Access should be good for both us and players. It helps define the extent of the game and manage expectations, and it also puts us in a more established category for games (many gaming \u0027hubs\u0027 still don\u0027t accept Early Access titles as eligible).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the future, post-1.0, I\u0027m looking forward for that quite a bit. For the first time in the game\u0027s history, we are looking at a phase of development where the pressure on us \u003Cem\u003Eisn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E an order of magnitude greater than the previous phase. Looking back:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore we went public, there was pressure from the uncertainty of how the game would be received.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 0.7.3, the pressure increased tenfold as players now expected more features and more quality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 0.14, the pressure increased even more, as the game was no longer free and we had to match the expectations \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E[of]\u003C/span\u003E a payware product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter 0.19, as we moved to Steam, the pressure increased tenfold yet again, as the number of players started to simply explode, and we were now being put up on a scale against multi-million AAA games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs we neared Beta (and entered it), pressure increases yet again, as everyone becomes frantic at the idea of the game reaching an end in development (which is untrue in our case, see the start of the post).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow with 1.0 looming ahead, the pressure is at an all-time peak. Even though we know full well 1.1 is going to follow jsut as 1.0 followed 0.90, this release is fraught with an impending sense of doom and dread, which stems from that same notion you wrote about, that once software reaches 1.0, it\u0027s burned to disks, wrapped in plastic and trucked to stores.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENeedless to say, that is an obsolete way of looking at things, especially with EA software like KSP. However, because like I said earlier, we are caught in the middle of this ongoing paradigm shift, we justcan\u0027t rid ourselves of the expectations and stress associated with going \u0027Gold\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that same token though, 1.1 promises to be a much deserved period of decompression. I am very much looking forward to it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fel","CreatedById":57121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T03:22:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022 data-cite=\u0022basic.syntax\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPost #1000!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou were waiting for that, weren\u0027t you?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T13:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E ...especially with EA software like KSP.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOMG, they did sell to EA! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
