I\u0027m new to KSP...haven\u0027t landed on the mun yet...but try\u0027in too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having extreme difficulty with construction however. I\u0027ve done some 3D modeling in other software but have major problems in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having 2 highly annoying problems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) If I have the camera facing at an angle and move my mouse left and right to move the part left and right...the camera moves it up and down....I have to rotate the camera level and then I can move it left and right, but now I loose depth placement, or have lost the exsact X-axis depth I wanted the part at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The second thing I\u0027m having problems with is trying to place a few rockets off center from another set symmetrical to the Y-axis, but not the X-axis...such as making a long wing, then trying to place a rocket at the top and bottom evenly. I cant use the \u0022Part Symmetrical Duplicator\u0022 button or it puts it waaaay on the other side of the ship relative to the X-axis, not the Y-axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIs there a way to:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1) Press and hold a key or something to lock the axis, such as if I\u0027m moving a part up and down, I can press and hold a key, move the camera any angle I want and move the part and it stills moves up and down on the same X-axis as long as I\u0027m holding that key?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Can I enable a \u0022snap-grid\u0022 so I can do single part placement at intervals that are easy to line up?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese 2 feature are in pretty much EVERY 3D modeling program that I have worked with and could really use them in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is not a way, whats the best area for a feature request?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vlk","CreatedById":57928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T09:40:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a suggestion forum in an other category (development i guess)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you build, you will notice more and more issues with the editor, but also, you get used to the limits slowly, or build in a way where it will not be a problem \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat you can try:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- rotate the whole ship, and try symmetry again - i noticed that is changes the symmetry axis. You can rotate back later.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- use the \u0022c\u0022 key to lock the parts to a place, or make smooth changes - the movement of the part will change too\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- put new parts on parts that were not rotated before with the wsad keys, and rotate the main subpart only after that. this way the editor works better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- sometimes its better if you use symmetry only after you finished one part of the symmetry. Like, you build the right side first, and when finished, you take the right side, turn symmetry on, and put it back. This way the symmetrical part can have further symmetrical parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eedit: i also suggested that they should have a key for orthographic view, to be able to balance the ship better. But later i found out that i can use the lines on the ground: i lower the ship/plane until they are on the ground, then compare the parts to the lines on the floor \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ugly method but works\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-16T09:44:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/16/2013 09:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vlk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T09:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1) if you hold shift it will change the way the camera works (For the VAB it changes to zoom, for the SPH it changes to translate) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) if you either a) click the circle next to the symmetry button at the bottom of the part list thing it should turn into a hexagon you are not in angle snap and part will snap at angles in 5 degree incriments. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E press the \u0027C\u0027 button on your keyboard, it toggles modes (So if you are in angle snap it will take you back to not angle snap)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
