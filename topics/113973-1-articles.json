This is very perplexing. This morning, I updated to 1.0.4. When I tried to launch a routine shuttle flight, when I was warping to my apogee, there was an explosion and my ship broke apart. During the buildup of disintegration, I saw the \u0027durability\u0027 bars on the front of my ship.. This is really confusing me, since I have aerodynamic heating set to 0 and was decelerating. After messing about a bit, if I DON\u0027T warp to my apogee, the ship is fine. However, when I try to separate my orbiter from the booster in orbit I see the same result.\n\nI\u0027ve just managed to get around this by using the debug toolbar to make joints indestructible and turn off crash damage. The durability bars still show up though, just no change. The only mod I have on my craft is Mechjeb- and is handling the warps.\n\nAs far as I know, Mechjeb hasn\u0027t been updated 1.0.4. Any ideas as to what\u0027s causing this? The toolbar workaround is working, but it\u0027s a pain having to remember to turn it on every time I load up KSP.\n\nWill post a video later, thanks. Hopefully this is just another stupid bug thrown up. Still very annoying though.\n\nNB- my different shuttles all worked perfectly before updating to .4.\n\nThanks ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"steve_v","CreatedById":69272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-24T11:40:31Z","Content":"Sure it\u0027s the 1.0.3 -\u003E 1.0.4 change that did it?
