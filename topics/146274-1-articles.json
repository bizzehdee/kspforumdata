I just want 1 shuttle that I can update constantly, instead of having over 30 uploads of the same ship with minor fixes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZooNamedGames","CreatedById":103726,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-21T13:38:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSadly, having run my Saturn Shuttle series (link in sig), that is sadly the route your going to have to take.
