I\u0027d rely on my tried-and-true strategy of using debug console to transfer the whole craft in moho orbit, see if it works properly, before reloading the game and launching it for real. well, i did just that, and i accelerated time, but i got no heating problems. without \u003Cu\u003Eany\u003C/u\u003E radiators. which i have a hard time believing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso, is it true that i can send a satellite around moho without any need for radiators? or is there some reason why the test did not work properly? how can i estimate how many radiators i may need without testing by random?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-06-20T22:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour craft can operate just fine while permanently glowing red. So no, you don\u0027t need radiators at Moho.

One is just general part heat - and for that, bewing already explained everything relevant. You can mount a radiator to lower part heat, but it\u0027s optional in most cases. Maybe see if you can incorporate a small panel or two in a visually pleasing manner? Remember that radiators only work correctly if the Sun is not shining on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other system is Core Heat. It is used for machines that require active cooling: mining drills, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E converters, and such. For that purpose, each such part has a \u0022cooling required\u0022 stat, and each radiator has a \u0022core transfer\u0022 stat.
