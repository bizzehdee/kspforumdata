And perhaps the more flares you launch, the better the chance? Obviously the detection cone would have to increase. This could also give value to each CM pod eventually carrying a limited number of flares. This solution was suggested and massively supported for flares in Planetside 2, but admittedly it is difficult to define.\u003Cp\u003EWhether you use my suggestion or not, I\u0027d say that if you want missile mechanics to be fully developed, it would definitely be a good idea to find a solution. IRL, as I\u0027m sure you know, the method for avoiding IR missiles generally is to maneuver in as many planes of movement as possible, i.e. start rolling, pitch hard, and dump flares around your turn. It wouldn\u0027t be very exciting if the avoidance method ingame is to fly away from or towards the missile while periodically tapping your CM button. That said, you\u0027ve already achieved far more than any other weapon mod developer has so far, and with a higher mod quality in general, so massive props for that.
