It says challenges... so I thought I would share the one I\u0027ve created and taken for myself: Create and deploy a self-sufficient base of operations on every single planet (stock planets only). I have the outer planets mod enabled later in the series (After recording episode 9, my save file became corrupted everywhere when KSP updated to 1.1.2 and I moved mods around... episode 10 explains the problem, and Episode 12 tells the solution).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsBoF66x4ZmAMbs-BAIYv6rjs5txolj6m\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESERIES PLAYLIST SO FAR\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0(YouTube)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe parameters of this challenge are pretty much explained in video 1, but due to the video\u0027s length, I\u0027ll summarize here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCAREER MODE, Unmanned before Manned.\u00A0TAC Life Support enabled. FAR enabled. Deadly Reentry Enabled. RemoteTech Enabled. ScanSat Enabled\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100% self-sustaining base must manage everything about itself autonomously without direct Kerbin assistance, and staff a minimum of one scientist and one engineer to be successful. Life Support systems must also be self-sustaining, meaning food, water, and oxygen must be replenished when consumed, and waste resources properly managed (without Jettison installed).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Gas Giants, an orbital station takes the place of a ground base, with almost all parameters the same. The only difference is that it must store fuel at all times, and it\u0027s allowed to take shipments of supplies on a regular basis, as long as the supplies come from an orbital body within its own SOI system, like one of its\u00A0moons* (*this is something not mentioned in the video and was amended/added after the video was recorded). I\u0027ve decided against (for now) installing Karbonite Plus for that \u0022gathering stuff in the air\u0022 mechanic, because I\u0027m also looking for realism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m new to this \u0022recording gaming play-through\u0022 stuff, but I\u0027ve got about 300\u002B hours in KSP now, and feel as though I can tackle this challenge over the next year or so of playing (hopefully).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is a \u003Cstrong\u003EHEAVILY MODDED\u003C/strong\u003E play-through, thanks to 64-bit KSP.
