I am very similar to you except for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patching. I got tired of waiting 10 minutes and watching 6000 patches load so I went in and fixed all the pathways in each config and moved across any needed textures. I never let a new version overwrite an old, instead I move it out first and then when I put in the new. I see what is missing and then overwrite it with my previous edits. Always keep backups of everything outside of the KSP folder structure. I also repair things I like to use when the new iterations of KSP break them. I can\u0027t code but I can see what new modules are being used and then use that information to repair older configs. I fixed some wheels this way that got borked by 1.12.1 Some really old mods require the model meshes to be stripped down and the latest colliders put in. I can do this by copying from new working meshes the bits I need to fix the old, but I don\u0027t expect the average player to be able to do that. Careful configing is just text editing so as long as you back it up first, most people should be able to look at a config and work out how things are done. That is how I learned myself, less than a year ago, and still learning new stuff all the time. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Araym","CreatedById":46343,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-17T10:33:50Z","Content":"I\u0027m not an actual \u0022super fan\u0022 of too many \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E patches, to the point that, probably, I will do an extensive rework of any file I\u0027m using in an \u0022hardcore\u0022 mode alike yours, in the future.\n\nI\u0027m back to KSP after a long absence (I was basically bored to have, mostly, the need to contiously change/update mods to the latest version, as I was doing more \u0022coding and patching\u0022 than actually playing, to the point that I\u0027m relived that 1.12 will be the \u0022final version\u0022: aside minimal, future, patches, the game is finally finished and mods will settle) and I\u0027m just making a list/check of all the thing that I want in my own version.\n\n... but on my end, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-patches are the last of my problems: yes... they take \u0022some time\u0022 to load, but done it once, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is generally going to loads the parts from its own cache...  \n\n... the problem is after then: I have so many mods installed that (even if my pc is not a super-latest pc gaming, it is not a bad one for sure: I made it for be sure to be above any KSP mod needs I will ever have) is the UNITY needs to keep EVERYTHING pre-loaded that keep my startup time infinite... and that is not so much different if the game has to read the filse from dozen of single cfg, or from the bigger, single, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E-cached list.\n\nJust for your reference (counting not only part mods, but also visuals, planetary systems, and all the\u0022extras\u0022 that I like) up to now, my GameData folder is 21.8 GB... that is A LOT of bytes to pre-load...  \n\n... hardcoding most of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E patches in actual, final, cfg versions could eventually save me one minute or two, of the dozen that my KSP version need, anyway, to pre-load.![:blush2:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/blush2.png \u0022:blush2:\u0022)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-09-17T10:38:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/17/2021 10:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 17, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Araym**"},{"CreatedByName":"ColdJ","CreatedById":211123,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-17T10:39:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 minutes ago, Araym said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E GameData folder is 21.8 GB...\n\u003E \n\nYikes.\n\nI have been building mods and model meshes so even though I read a few chapters of a good book while my game loads I still like to be able to test things more than once a day. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif \u0022:D\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"xD-FireStriker","CreatedById":137214,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-09-17T10:46:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, Araym said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Sadly, even if more than capable to \u0022fiddle with KSP\u0022 in its own \u0022cfg - sort of software\u0022 language, I\u0027m not capable to write a single, real, line of coding for script alike the one made for STX.
