However, when I opened the launcher, the box at the bottom that usually had the \u0022Play\u0022 and \u0022Update\u0022 buttons now just had \u0022Checking for updates...\u0022 fading in and out. I seriously sat on that screen for about 30 minutes while I waited for it to give me the option to update, but it never did. Am I doing something wrong?"}]}
