In ribbons (where the field is limited it is used to add extra fine details or act as a device by reproducing in miniature a design that may be a feature of the full medal. In a sash award or breast badge (more common in honors which bestow an Order) they can be used in tassels or embroidery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The gilt frames on some ribbons of the American military denote Unit Citations. The closest in KSP would be if a mission goes somewhere, does something , and returns, if the Kerbal Space Administration had Mission Citations awards for achievement, merit or outstanding contributions, then the ribbon would be awarded to all on the mission and have a gilt frame around it to denote it from an award for individual acts. It would not be awarded for any particular event or action on the mission but for the overall sum total significance of the entire mission. The Grand Tour ribbon would be a good example. The frame is needed because in a general theory of Phaleristics, medals are divided between Decorations and Service Awards. The concept gets lost in the KSP world because in the ribbon generator the ribbon denotes area while some of the devices would be a Decoration (actions of an individual, e.g. First to EVA: specific act to specific kerbal,) and some more like a Service Award (e.g. Orbit planet X: Act that would apply to all in the spacecraft). Final Frontier has a little bit better separation of ribbons into three camps, Individual acts, group acts and All mission Achievement awards but also gets muddled in having ribbons that in our world would be denoted as Badges, Sleeve Insignia or Collar devices. Having everything in a \u0027Ribbon Rack\u0027 is nifty but in some instances make a corresponding example from Earth difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I am not really sure what the OP was looking for now. Most devices are used to show multiple awards. The ribbon creator takes a different approach to that. I cannot tell if the outside stripes of the posted pic is a vertical tri color (white/yellow/gold ?) which is rare in ribbons because of the manufacturing process or if it is supposed to be a shadow effect on the top. Also yellow and white in medals/ribbons is supposed to denote gold/silver in higher awards. Often a horizontal stripe will bisect a vertical stripe to produce a bi-color verticle stripe but the top and bottom colors are usually the same. To have an yellow (if my monitor pic is correct) next to a deeper gold color would be uncommon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But hey, it\u0027s a Kerbal world, where we break the rules and still look good.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T22:22:47Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 10:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by jpkerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nosirrbro","CreatedById":69814,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-01T06:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a complaint - Kerbol does not have a flight pin available, but there IS an atmosphere on Kerbol and I HAVE flown in it (With a rocket engine, of course), and I demand recognition!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut in all seriousness, it is technically possible to fly in the atmosphere of Kerbol in vanilla KSP.
