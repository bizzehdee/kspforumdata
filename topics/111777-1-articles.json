Haven\u0027t played since 0.22. Installed MechJeb and built my first rocket. The mission. Get into orbit and then land on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo launch has no issues. Get into orbit and then I bring up the landing guidance. Set target and go. Everything works well until at about 10,000 feet in which instead of going burner first, my craft flips and starts going nose first into the ground. It get close, deploys the landing gear then smashes face first into the ground at around 200 m/s. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried lowering my center of gravity of the landing portion but no luck.
