To get a gravity assist, you need to fly past another object that\u0027s orbiting the same parent body- so if you\u0027re in a solar orbit you need to aim for a planet, or if orbiting a planet like Jool then aim for a moon.\u00A0A gravity assist from Jupiter will fling you right out of the solar system, as it did for the Voyager spacecraft, while gravity assists from the moons of Jool are a great way of capturing into, or escaping from, Jool orbit without needing to use your engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGravity assists work by changing your relative velocity: you enter and leave the planet/moon\u0027s gravity well at exactly the same speed thanks to conservation of momentum, but the\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edirection\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0relative to the parent body (i.e. the sun for a planetary gravity assist) is altered. I could try to explain it, but I think I\u0027ll let someone who knows what they\u0027re talking about do it instead:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/16jr7WWGSxo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dci","CreatedById":106864,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-05-24T12:18:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimply no, you can not, there is no parent body to change your velocity vector direction.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut what you can, is perform Oberth maneuver close to Sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
