Should a player not be able to purchase a part that have been tested once until he completes a certain amount of test contracts for this part? Don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea at all. Or maybe you suggest to give player a bonus to purchase the part without researching corresponding technology? Can\u0027t agree with that too. I think a better solution would be to give experimental parts a very high chance of failure, say 70% and gradually decrease it with every test contract completed to approach a still high failure chance, say 30-40%, thus preserving the idea that experimental prototypes are suitable for experiments only until you properly invent them by researching a corresponding technology.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T12:58:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nits always nice to be asked to test the 48-7S early\u00A0as its an perfect satellite\u00A0engine but I think it has been moved down the tree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-08T14:22:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI mooted a similar idea myself back when part tests were new.
