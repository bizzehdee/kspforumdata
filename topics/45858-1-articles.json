Launch communication satellites orbiting kerbin and mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Build a space station\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Land on the mun and get back\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.

I first figured out SRB-only rockets, then realized you only had to throttle up to use liquid fuel. After that was figuring out staging so my \u0022max altitude\u0022 kept getting higher and higher until I could reach Kerbin escape velocity. Once my delta-v was good enough I had to figure out a gravity turn technique to get into orbit (*and figure it out again after downloading FAR lol). Etc. for every little tidbit of gameplay learned and mastered; most recently I achieved docking for my 100km fueling station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I were to restart, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d repeat the progression of space travel history. The only reason the first flight of the real space race wasn\u0027t Apollo 11 was because we had to discover and practice all that advanced methodology first. Now that we have it, we can build on THAT and set our sights on Mars. And now that I\u0027m halfway decent at Kerbal, I can look farther out as well. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manatee321","CreatedById":57529,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T22:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyup, i do similar things my list was:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESAT\u0027s in orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst orbit manned\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eprobe to mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 sats around mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eland on mun\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epractice first manned docking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enext is minimus or interplanetary probes\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T23:00:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the beginning it\u0027s very useful for learning the ropes, but at this point in my gameplay it\u0027s terribly boring to do the same launches over and over during every save.
