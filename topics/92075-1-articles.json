It is as if the springs push all the way out and a hydraulic pump produces enough internal pressure to maintain the fully-extended status until I hit a join between terrain polygons. The weight of the vehicle in not sufficient on the Mun (the only planet I have tested rovers on so far) to re-compress the suspension and allow for normal driving; instead I am skittering along with my vehicle yawing insistently uphill and the wheels behave as though they are barely touching. Time does not allow the suspension to settle out (as it should on any gravitational body) and so I am left with a skittering bug-rover that wants to turn sideways and flip over unless I hit a concavity in the terrain, thereby forcing the suspension to compress, and the vehicle can now behave sensibly for a short while.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thrust for Squad: Can the stock rover wheels get fixed so that I\u0027m not driving on ice skates after cresting a polygonal convexity? Can you get the inherent weight of the vehicle to squash those springs back down (mitigated by the hydraulic tubes) over time, causing the vehicle to properly react with the planet beneath it? \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECan the suspension please stop permanently winning the fight against gravity?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
