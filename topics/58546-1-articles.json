Inter here. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been playing KSP for almost 11 months now but this is my first whack at the forums. I\u0027ve also just begun working on some videos and machinima of my KSP gameplay. I\u0027d really appreciate some feedback on my designs and maybe some ideas for a cinematic series. Please check out my YT channel and come back from time to time for future episodes. I\u0027ll start having links to craft files once I can figure out how/where to do that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/user/ArchaicAlibi/videos\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.youtube.com/user/ArchaicAlibi/videos\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt present I am working on expanding my catalog of aquatic/amphibious/amphibi-aer-ous(??) craft and trying to assemble in the background a thematic adventure for Laythe. I am rather proud of my seaplanes but I think there is a lot of untapped potential. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if anyone is interested, my brother Wolfos and I are working on a co-op game (we email a zipped version of the game save back and forth to each other) involving Duna and Jool with a moderate emphasis on realism. It\u0027s his brainchild, but expect to see some postings about that in the near future! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
