But new fuel flow feature in KSP 1.2 allows radial fuel flow, which makes the 5 fuel tanks for each engines exhaust equally, which makes my lifters impractical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...

You could also manually disable the Skipper when it\u0027s no longer needed (not quite as automatic as relying on fuel flow but a similar effect).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"purpletarget","CreatedById":57317,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-22T05:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe radial decouplers which used to restrict fuel crossfeed, should have toggles in 1.2 to disable the crossfeed, putting it back to the older behavior that you seek.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-09-22T06:35:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say disabling the Skipper when it\u0027s no longer needed is the easiest solution, like RIC suggested.
