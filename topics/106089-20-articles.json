The idea for a reallife application would be to have full reusability without the insane mass ratios of an SSTO.  \n\nIm using this on a x3,2 rescaled Kerbin with FAR, so i need about 5500m/s delta-v (otherwise the rockets are to small for my taste), its designed for a ~85t payload to LKO, as a part of a Duna colony mission architecture.\n\nThe upper stage:\n\n![jsyf38A.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jsyf38A.jpg)![KobgNha.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KobgNha.jpg)![LmkCh66.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/LmkCh66.jpg)\n\nIm using lots of Tweakscale on this, also i had to cheat a bit (reducing the mass of some tanks and the large cargobays), otherwise it wouldnt fly that well on landing. Now its about 88t empty, it would be about 115t without those teaks. That higher dry wheight wouldnt be a problem on launch, i have reserves, but sadly parts have an extreme density in KSP compared to reallife. It comes with an OMS that yields about 400m/s delta-v.\n\nThe lower stage:\n\n![Ia8XCOV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Ia8XCOV.jpg)![rOPV7RN.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/rOPV7RN.jpg)\n\nIts currently expendable, but im testing a new, larger lower stage that is supposed to fly back to the launchsite:\n\n![aMh82rU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/aMh82rU.jpg) (hard to see, but i added a 5. SSME between the 4 allready used. That should make landing a lot easier due to lower TWR if only the center ones are running.\n\nNow with the tweaked stats of the Yucatan a reusable first stage should be easier, since the upper stage has a bit more Delta-V.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-13T11:22:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/13/2016 11:22  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 13, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Elthy**"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-14T22:24:01Z","Content":"Hey ... problem with the cryo tanks.\n\n1) Start with a single fuel tank in the VAB.
