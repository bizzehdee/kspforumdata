Something large was happening, the South Returian president, Pascilla Vohannes, was having a meeting, about the future of the South Returian Celestial Exploration Division.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Listen up.\u0022 Pascilla said, clearing his throat. \u0022We have alot of work to do, and don\u0027t expect it to be easy. But in the end, it\u0027s going to be a milestone for our country, and that we can fly the bird to those Plutonic bastards. I don\u0027t care if they were the first country to put a satellite in orbit, third country to put a Kerbal into orbit, or even first on the Mun and Minmus.\u0022 Pascilla sighed as he activated the projector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/ztd5xz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ztd5xz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is the Flatwoods spacecraft, and it\u0027s launch abort system. Can hold two South Returian kerbonauts, and a fistful of snacks.\u0022 Pascilla said. The rest, will be left to the South Returian administer of spaceflight, Millfrey Burgundy.\u0022 Pascilla Vohannes said, leaving the situation to Millfrey Burgundy. \u0022O-oh! Right.\u0022 Millfrey said, bolting awake and shuffling his papers. \u0022Mr. President, sir, why did you have to call this meeting after lunch? Anyway; the spacecraft will be launch aboard a South Returian Air Force orbital launch vehicle, because Himmelilandic-born rocket scientist Verinherr Karmacc couldn\u0027t make it here, and he couldn\u0027t design the launch vehicle, anyway. \u0022 Millfrey sighed, and took a breath. \u0022Plus, Verinherr is currently designing the Wexx 1b rocket that\u0027ll be used to launch the Lupa spacecraft, but we\u0027ll cross that bridge when we get there.\u0022 Millfrey sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe meeting lasted a good half-hour after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETHE NEXT MONTH\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a cold, dry, March morning, yet at the Gornallesville Space Center, a newly-constructed Flatwoods Spacecraft was on the launchpad, awaiting the abort sequence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i60.tinypic.com/2yyta2d.png\u0022 alt=\u00222yyta2d.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Mission Control, flight director Jermona Orwell was at his desk. \u0022Twenty seconds until abort procedure, and counting; \u0022 He said, as he nervously fidgeted at his keyboard. \u0022Fifteen and counting.\u0022 Jermona said. \u0022All systems are active;\u0022 One of the flight directors, Bobak Kermonn said, with a thick Plutonic accent. Ten seconds. Nine seconds. Eight seconds. Seven seconds. Six seconds. Five seconds. Four seconds. Three seconds. Two seconds. One second. The escape tower on the capsule activated, and the command module quickly separated from the main spacecraft body, within seconds, the tower exhausted it\u0027s aluminum oxide solid fuel supply, and it jettisoned away from the command module and it\u0027s parachutes deployed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i58.tinypic.com/2wgt35j.png\u0022 alt=\u00222wgt35j.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo minutes passed, the capsule gently maintained contact with the sand, and it was recovered.

Various members of the South Returian ministry of spaceflight were half-asleep or bored out of their minds. \u0022Yes, yes. I know a meeting straight after your break may be boring, but you have to deal with it. \u0022 Pascilla said, as a Kerbal moaned. Pascilla activated a projector, showing a jerry-rigged space station. \u0022This, my friends!\u0022 He said, his voice as proud as he can. \u0022I know that it isn\u0027t much, a fuel tank converted to a science laboratory and habitat, but to me.
