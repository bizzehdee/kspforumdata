(I started it because my previous saves were glitched out from the previous game versions;.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea. So its been freezing randomly every half hour. The last time came only 10 min after the previous. Some of them report errors, some not, but they all end the same, and it does not matter what I am doing. They have been increasing in frequency and although it seems to save the moment it crashes its becoming so frequent its unplayable; not even enough time to land my craft from a low orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI run windows 8.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8gb ram\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei5 4690k OC watercooled to 4.25mhz\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2gb 6950 AMD GPU\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my persistence save; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/n09fmnup907fbxx/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/n09fmnup907fbxx/persistent.sfs?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand some crash reports, most recent first\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4unrri6ari35kiw/AAAApY1-RsI0LOznZ82ULa_ca?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/4unrri6ari35kiw/AAAApY1-RsI0LOznZ82ULa_ca?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2ga8n52kz9okb4z/AAASaWNJnjRtlwxhwke0rgm3a?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/2ga8n52kz9okb4z/AAASaWNJnjRtlwxhwke0rgm3a?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a0jybjqn1vcpfdc/AAB0MMk3MGbglBJ1cmF4suVHa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/a0jybjqn1vcpfdc/AAB0MMk3MGbglBJ1cmF4suVHa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0z4grjdydhkusrx/AABMvot9MinngwFQokDfiMkTa?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/0z4grjdydhkusrx/AABMvot9MinngwFQokDfiMkTa?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fr6zrg728j1uf7g/AABpjnz2tFIuHSPw70G6JZ8Ma?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/fr6zrg728j1uf7g/AABpjnz2tFIuHSPw70G6JZ8Ma?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me know if anymore info is needed.
