Military representatives don\u0027t get there to check what is going on. It was quite sad to see the very first serial Su-27 decaying on the backyard, already without paint, bare yellow. There were plans to put there an Tu-160, but it is impossible, since the Monino Training Center was closed and there are no runways were you can land this kind of planes nearby.
