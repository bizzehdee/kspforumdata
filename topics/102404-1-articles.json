Military representatives don\u0027t get there to check what is going on. It was quite sad to see the very first serial Su-27 decaying on the backyard, already without paint, bare yellow. There were plans to put there an Tu-160, but it is impossible, since the Monino Training Center was closed and there are no runways were you can land this kind of planes nearby. Let\u0027s hope volunteers will raise more money during the May vacations."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T17:46:58Z","Content":"Thanks for those pictures. I\u0027ve seen it before, but never in so much detail. The MiG-105 prototype didn\u0027t go to space but was used for drop tests, as you can see from the fake heatshield and the pitot tube. It was the equivalent of the Americal X-24 and M2-Fx.\n\nThat landing skid arrangement is amazing. You can see that they really went to great lengths to avoid hatches in the heat shield.\n\nThe other pictures in your flickr are fantastic too, especially the T-4 Sotka and the Mi-18 !\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-21T17:53:19Z\u0022 title=\u002203/21/2015 05:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nibb31**"},{"CreatedByName":"Niemand303","CreatedById":119422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-21T18:50:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for those pictures.

Cool, I love old aircraft. I see the runway is indeed useless, although there is another airport not far to the north and east. My friend tells me she visits her friends in Mytishchi, and knows of Monino but never knew there was an air museum there. Looks like they now have something to do on their next visit lol.\n\nI should dig up my pictures from the airshow I worked in 2001 at Lakehurst NAB, Blue Angels and a lot of other stuff ... plus something extra special from WWII Pacific theater, the real deal."},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T00:45:10Z","Content":"Wow that thing sure is beautiful."},{"CreatedByName":"Djolox","CreatedById":80379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-06T09:12:14Z","Content":"I am envious.
