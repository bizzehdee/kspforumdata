Everything in KSP and Unity is running in a single threaded loop and there are zero thread-safe functions in the Unity/KSP API. Maybe there is a bit of parallelism in a few low-level Unity/Physics functions but the performance improvement should be very small. People need to understand that parallelized algorithms are many orders of magnitude more complex and time consuming to implement than single-thread ones, this is especially true with real-time applications like physics. This is why only triple-A million dollars budget games are multithreaded and why games like KSP or Minecraft that were initially developed with few resources and saw an incremental development would need to be rewritten from scratch to take advantage of multi-core processors.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-21T19:58:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222952611\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156273\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221486901957\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157505\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022something\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/12/2017 at 4:19 AM, something said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing kubuntu as well.
