You can see I am going fast by the red glow of entry burn over the front of the plane.\n\nI can see why they are very efficient as a bomber once building one. Two things, the lack of a tail and focus on epic amounts of lift, makes them have an amazing glide angle with crap loads of lift.

Which is why they are very suitable as a bomber.\n\nI wonder if anyone on here managed to make a B2 style plane get into space and successfully re enter and land on the runway. ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif \u0022:P\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"SirusKing","CreatedById":98303,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-21T22:27:09Z","Content":"Inspired by one of ferrams posts...

The most kerbal way is probably to add drag on the tail (like a chute), but that kind of limits your speed. Wing sweep also increases yaw stability, although not usually to an extend that allows you to remove a tail fin. Probably the easiest way is to add an di-/anhedral angle to your wingtips, when using wing sweep - they\u0027ll work similar to a tail fin, but aren\u0027t technically tail fins.

It\u0027s quite fascinating trying to figure out why this happens.\n\u003E \n\nYou almost nailed it.\n\nWhat happens is that the point where the Cl drops is the point where you stall and the moment you stall the wings lose lift and gain a lot of drag.\n\nDepending on the design this can generate a lot of pitch down torque, your craft quickly goes back to an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E where it stops stalling, but the deflection brings it back up and that happens again.\n\nOn the worst case it will gain so much momentum that it stalls pitching down too, and keeps doing that without any input.\n\nBe careful though, as applying what I suggested does not guarantee you won\u0027t stall, if you have enough pitch up momentum and little damping you will slingshot past the stall point and bounce back (or die).\n\nIt is actually possible to balance your airplane in such a way that the stall effects are neutral, the airplane does not bounce back nor flips backwards, you maintain stupid high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E, only losing effectiveness on your control surfaces and bleeding a lot of energy.\n\nI made airplanes which behaved like that a few times, it\u0027s fun, if you throw some artificial stability on it you get top notch control over your aircraft when dogfighting, as long as you don\u0027t overstress it.\n\nI can share an airplane that does this later ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)"},{"CreatedByName":"Gordon Fecyk","CreatedById":157121,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-01T04:22:09Z","Content":"**Low-Tech Space Planes by Thrimm Aerospace, modified for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E**\n\n(Note: KSP 1.2.2 with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E dev build.

Some folks asked about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E compatibility, so I thought I\u0027d give it a shot. This is the end result of on-and-off play and even experimenting with the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E dev build for KSP 1.2.2. ~~Here are the~~ [~~craft files~~](http://www.antiwindowscatalog.com/media/ksp/ThrimmLTS-F.zip)~~. (79 KB, KSP 1.2.2)~~ That is the wrong link; [Here\u0027s the right one](http://www.antiwindowscatalog.com/media/ksp/lts-far-for-122.zip).\n\n**LTS Dove-F:**\n\n![lts-dove-f.png](http://www.antiwindowscatalog.com/media/ksp/lts-dove-f.png)\n\nRequired Tech: Aviation (T3), Advanced Rocketry (T3), Landing (T4), Engineering 101 (T1).\n\nOptional Tech: Survivability (T2), Electrics (T4)\n\nPower Plant: 8 x J-20 Juno, 2 x LV-909 Terrier, 1 x LV-T45 Swivel\n\nCapacity: 1 x Crew, optionally 1 x OKTO, Batteries, Science\n\nThrimm built the Dove as a proof-of-concept for a low-tech space plane, but with an OKTO as auto-pilot it works as a rescue craft early in Career mode. With stock aerodynamics, this craft could only reach about 5500 m before needing to light the main engines, and even then in KSP 1.1.3 we didn\u0027t have fuel lines at this low tech level so the original Reliant would burn out too soon. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E lets us take these Junos over 8000 m up, and in 1.2.2 with default fuel flow enabled we can use the Swivel and Terriers all the way up to a 75 km apoapsis, shut off the Swivel, then use the Terriers to close orbit. More tail planes help with yaw stability on take-off.\n\nInstructions: Enable DPCR in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Climb to about 8 km to 10 km, point 20 degrees, stage main engines. Throttle off and shut off Swivel after achieving 75 km apoapsis, then close your orbit with the Terriers. You\u0027ll need to start closing pretty early with the low thrust but you\u0027ll save a lot of fuel. On re-entry, point radial-out and shut off Terriers. You\u0027ll likely lose control at 20-25 km altitude, but your Junos should light back up shortly after. Find prograde, then pull up to level flight. Stage drogues no higher than 100 m altitude when over runway.\n\n**LTS Sparrow-FC:**\n\n![lts-sparrow-fc.png](http://www.antiwindowscatalog.com/media/ksp/lts-sparrow-fc.png) \n\nRequired Tech: Basic Rocketry (T1), Supersonic Flight (T5), Landing (T4), Fuel Systems (T4), Engineering 101 (T1), Aerodynamics (T4)\n\nOptional Tech: Survivability (T2), Electrics (T4)\n\nPower Plant: 2 x J-404 Panther, 2 x LV-T45 Swivel\n\nCapacity: 3 Crew, 1.1 tonne cargo\n\nThrimm tells us this is for crew training and tourism, but the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E drag model lets us use less fuel on ascent. I replaced the Mk2 liquid fuel fuselage with the Mk2 short cargo bay from his LTS Kestrel. The Sparrow-FC can fill the original Kestrel\u0027s role as a small satellite launcher. This example launches a 1.13 t FT-L200 fuel tank.\n\nInstructions: Enable DPCR in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Launch with Panthers in Wet mode (Abort action group) and point up 35-40 degrees. High dynamic pressure will give you maneuverability problems at too low an altitude, so climb quickly. Stage Swivels at 16 km up or higher, and try to avoid exceeding 10-12 degrees angle of attack. Cut thrust when hitting 75 km apoapsis and point prograde in Surface mode to reduce drag. Use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E action group to open cargo doors once in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. On re-entry it may help to balance fuel between the rear and forward fuel tanks, otherwise descend and land similar to the Dove-F using the drogues. You might have trouble leveling off due to high dynamic pressure and (I think) [Mach Tuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_tuck); if so, shift fuel more to the rearmost tanks or try turning DPCR off and pitch up *gently!* \n\n**LTS Kestrel-FC**\n\n![lts-kestrel-fc.png](http://www.antiwindowscatalog.com/media/ksp/lts-kestrel-fc.png) \n\nRequired Tech: Basic Rocketry (T1), Supersonic Flight (T5), Landing (T4), Fuel Systems (T4), Engineering 101 (T1), Aerodynamics (T4)\n\nPower Plant: 4 x J-404 Panther, 2 x LV-T45 Swivel\n\nCapacity: 2 Crew, 4.5 tonne cargo\n\nSimilar to how the Sparrow-FC can serve the Kestrel\u0027s original role, I thought with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s drag model I could get away with more cargo capacity. First I had to replace those really narrow wings though, since \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E laughed at them as this craft turned into a lawn dart. Swiping the wings from the Dove and Sparrow seemed to do the job. Everyone uses the Rockomax Jumbo-64 \u0022Orange Tank\u0022 as the benchmark for Mk3 single-stage-to-orbit craft, but I wondered if the largest Mk1 tank, the FL-T800, could be a benchmark for Mk2 craft. It seems to work as long as I expanded the fuel capacity of the original craft as well; note the extra FL-T100s at the rear.\n\nInstructions: Enable DPCR in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E. Launch with Panthers in Dry mode. Aim 40-45 degrees up, and switch to Wet mode (Abort action group). Ironically, higher dynamic pressure seems to keep this craft stable on ascent. Stage the Swivels at 19-20 km up, and avoid an angle-of-attack greater than 10-12 degrees. Cut thrust at about 75 km apoapsis and point prograde in Surface mode to reduce drag. Use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E action group to open doors once in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Re-enter, descend and land similarly to Sparrow-FC, but its larger mass will mean greater momentum and possibly a more difficult time leveling off and avoiding Mach Tuck.\n\nI tried using the elevons as air brakes once, and it didn\u0027t end well for the wings. Fortunately, the drogues still worked if I adjusted the deploy altitude, and an almost-empty craft will survive a nose-first impact at around 22 m/s.\n\nI\u0027ll make corrections if needed, for instance if I got the tech tiers wrong.\n\n--\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-02-01T22:35:50Z\u0022 title=\u002202/01/2017 10:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 1, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Gordon Fecyk**\n  \nFixed wrong download link"},{"CreatedByName":"Nixod321","CreatedById":58279,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-01T07:25:43Z","Content":"Here\u0027s a couple designs that make use of procedural wings:\n\n*B-900C (Cargo variant of the Kercel K-900):*\n\n![6U1Fa1Q.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/6U1Fa1Q.png?1)\n\n![nBp4hDH.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/nBp4hDH.png?1)\n\nEquipped with retrorockets because something about my install means there is practically no drag on aircraft.\n\n*X-33b:*\n\n![Q7ro24w.png?1](http://i.imgur.com/Q7ro24w.png?1)\n\n![lmN1bXC.png?3](http://i.imgur.com/lmN1bXC.png?3)\n\nA small scale flying wing test with airbrakes as yaw control (so it is a true flying wing).
