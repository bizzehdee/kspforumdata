Either new hitboxes or hitbox mask which prevents collisions from preflight clipping parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaterial bending is what real life rocket engineers have to take on account, not material ghosting trought other material. If self collision isnt automatically on, it won\u0027t be realistic, ever. And i think simulation game should aim for realism.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-05T13:32:39Z\u0022 title=\u002210/05/2023 01:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 5\u0022\u003EOctober 5, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Jeq\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-05T16:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do realize the effect it would have on performance? 150 parts, each one calculating collision with others next to it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
