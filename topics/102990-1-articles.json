This will be \u0022eyeballed\u0022 from a well-positioned screenshot!\n\n3 - Hold steady level flight for 2 in-game minutes without altitude changing by \u002B/- 500metres.\n\n4 - Return to normal flight wing-sweep and return to KSC runway for a safe landing. No damage is permitted to the aircraft.\n\n5 - The plane needs to have at least a passing resemblance to the NASA AD-1 experimental aircraft. Scale is not important.\n\n**Bonus points for:**\n\nBEHEMOTH - heaviest plane to complete the challenge gets **100 pts** bonus. (marked in leaderboards with \u0022**MASS**\u0022).\n\nSONIC BOOMERANG - reach 1000m/s at any altitude while wings are pivoted at least 45 degrees from normal. **100 pts**. (marked in leaderboards with \u0022**BOOM**\u0022).\n\nPARTS BIN SPECIAL - plane with fewest parts to complete the challenge gets **100 pts**. (marked in leaderboards with \u0022**RUSTBUCKET**\u0022).\n\nLOW AND SLOW - plane with lowest horizontal (surface) speed at touchdown at KSC runway after mission. **100 pts**. (marked in leaderboards with \u0022**CHILLIN**\u0022).\n\nLeaderboards:\n\nNon-FAR Mode\n\n1 - \n\n2 - \n\n3 - \n\nFAR Mode\n\n1 - hoioh - 300 points - At the moment ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) Behemoth, Parts Bin Special, Low and Slow\n\n2 - \n\n3 - \n\nNotes:\n\nThis is my first challenge, I hope it is amusing to someone. I had fun with this one. My first attempt was actually surprisingly stable, perhaps BECAUSE of KSP\u0027s aero limitations rather than in spite of them. This should be regarded as an \u0022easy\u0022 challenge, at least for the basic requirements. I hope it has some scope for larger constructions.\n\nThose aiming for the \u0022BEHEMOTH\u0022 challenge can waive the \u0022passing resemblance\u0022 constraint if they declare \u0022BEHEMOTH\u0022 in their posting. e.g., if you want to have 8 sets of pivoting tri-plane wings - then you win the internet for a day.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-06T10:29:22Z\u0022 title=\u002204/06/2015 10:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by wossname**"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T10:32:32Z","Content":"Is infernal robotics allowed?"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T15:58:22Z","Content":"Yeah, actually I think that\u0027s what I meant when I wrote the above post.

(There\u0027s no strict stock requirement in the rules as far as I can see.)\n\nIn the stock souposphere it flies like a brick the moment you start sweeping those wings, it tumbles towards the side where the wing is swept backward. So I filmed what happens to the center of lift inside the SPH where you can clearly see the center of lift remains in the middle of the plane, except according to KSP it moves backward. This is really what we want in order to gain balance at higher speeds, except I couldn\u0027t manage a speed above 160m/s with the current design. Oh and I botched the landing, so this isn\u0027t really a worthy entry, just wanted to share my experience, maybe someone else has a good idea on how to fix these problems without adding a whole pile of SAS modules to the craft (which would be wasteful).\n\nFirst I\u0027m going to try it in FAR and see if it responds any better that way and if that doesn\u0027t work a rebuild will be required.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Not nice, but manageable.\n\nIt only handles in any way pleasant at high speeds, low speeds just suck no matter what you do with the wing.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/KlQmERi5ojU?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nVidoe upload takes a while, I set it to publish as soon as it\u0027s done.\n\nAnd here\u0027s the craft if you\u0027re interested in trying, required Infernal robotics, B9, and FAR mods to work.\n\n[Craft file](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2935674/Kerbal/NASA%20AD-1.craft)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-05T09:18:15Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2015 09:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hoioh**"},{"CreatedByName":"wossname","CreatedById":118005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T13:23:33Z","Content":"I\u0027m happy to add this to the scoreboards if you can provide me with the stats. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) My broadband speed isn\u0027t good enough to read your airspeed from the video."},{"CreatedByName":"hoioh","CreatedById":118116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-05T19:50:49Z","Content":"Stats, well, mods used: IR, FAR \u0026 B9\n\nTop speed before freaking out completely: 541.6m/s\n\nWidth: 32\n\nLength: 32.3\n\nHeight: 8.1\n\nParts: 62\n\nWeight: 23.1t (Includes 990 units of fuel)\n\nDry mass: 18.2t"}]}
