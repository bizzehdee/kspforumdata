This nuclear thermal rocket runs best on LH2, with a specific impulse of a whopping 810 seconds, but you can also feed it LOX (at a much lower volumetric flow rate for the same thrust, even) and get a respectable 215 seconds out of it.

There\u0027s food, a heater so you can breathe LOX in each command pod, water, waste recycling and hydrogen fuel cells (using the ioncross model and stock rtg model for now). Anyone like the idea/have any thoughts and feedback?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI based everything as well as I could on reality and a rough estimation of solar panel size and insolation equivalent to earth\u0027s. Batteries needed to be upgraded significantly (they now have the energy density by mass of lead acid batteries, although I think they\u0027re somewhat denser).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ioncross tanks are also now configurable using the modular fuel tanks interface, I added a new tank type of logistics (which I haven\u0027t tweaked and balanced yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?cp1c11l8aodh2ya\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?cp1c11l8aodh2ya\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThoughts so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd my own models.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA bigger fuel cell, a bigger RTG, maybe a liquidfuel/intakeair generator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMake it play nice with kethane\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdd cfgs for things like fustek and the ISS pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think power requirements are reasonably realistic, but a large amount of the power would be thermal and there are lots of things on the ship that would produce heat that I\u0027m not taking into account so I may need to change it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIon drives now make even less sense in the context of the edited batteries\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings power values for command pods and batteries way out of balance with everything else;
