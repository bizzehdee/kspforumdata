What is happening is somewhere something is not symmetrical. It looks like you built it in the space plane hangar, which means something could be on the top and not the bottom. Even this slight perturbation in the center of mass can cause it to not burn straight. I suggest going into your save folder and finding the ship, then transfer it to the VAB and redo all the struts and small things with the radial symmetry in the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESave file: KSP\\Saves\\\u0026lt;your_save\u0026gt;\\SPH move to KSP\\Saves\\\u0026lt;your_save\u0026gt;\\VAB\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I see what KSP X parts you used \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Benie","CreatedById":70327,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-23T03:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI found out when the tiny ship docks with this, it causes a weight inbalance.
