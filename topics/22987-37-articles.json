I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the MODEL. Using a Stayputnik pod, a stock 1.25 engine (the LV-T30? Whichever one is non-steerable), and URM lower stage fuel tanks with two launch clamps near the top of the tank:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL05 - works just fine. A bit of wobble, nothing else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL07 - falls off half the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EL09 - falls off every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it falls off, it\u0027s a structural failure between the tank and one or more clamps. If I look at the debug window, *every* time I start a launch, there\u0027s a \u0022Ground Contact! error 0.141m\u0022 message. I tried raising the breakingTorque and breakingForce on the L09 tank, no effect. If I try changing the breakingForce and breakingTorque on the launch clamps to 1500 (just adding a zero), the problem goes away. I verified on my 0.21 installation, and the ground contact error was 0.006m. It looks like the correction for the error is applied while physics is on, and the clamps aren\u0027t strong enough to handle it. I can hack my way around it with the CFG edit on the launch clamp, but I\u0027ll go complain in the bugs page of the forum, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe a future iteration of KOSMOS can include replacement launch clamps to go with the replacement structs and fuel lines (just kidding).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CardBoardBoxProcessor","CreatedById":10179,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T14:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou know an easy fix would be to simply put Kosmos strut connectors between the clamps and the rocket before launch. you would only need one or two.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MOARdV","CreatedById":60950,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-17T14:22:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CardBoardBoxProcessor\u0022 data-cite=\u0022CardBoardBoxProcessor\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eyou know an easy fix would be to simply put Kosmos strut connectors between the clamps and the rocket before launch. you would only need one or two.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried that last night, but it did not work.
