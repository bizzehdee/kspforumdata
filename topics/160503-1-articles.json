for instance, I have used the Duna probe design for Moho and Eve probes, and have already sent the Moho probes on their way, and I have done a set of landings on Mun as well as Minmus. \u00A0 But I find the project-management-oriented approach is keeping me on track.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GarrisonChisholm","CreatedById":146403,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-15T15:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is exactly the type of thing I enjoy chatting about, so I\u0027ll chime in.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy goal is exploration, so I will never attempt anything so grandiose as colonizing anything.\u00A0 I have yet to have a Kerbal more than dip its toes into interplanetary space, and am testing a Duna landing mission unmanned, though given what I\u0027ve learned already I am pretty sure it will be back to the drawing board before I have even completed aerobraking.\u00A0 I generally try to let the contracts steer me, and suppose that various govt agencies and private enterprise are collaborating on the tasks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the game \u0022as-is\u0022, despite the fact that I am still playing the version that doesn\u0027t allow planes to taxi straight. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also simply ignore contracts that are foolish.\u00A0 I generally let the \u0022search for life\u0022 be my guide, or rather in KSP the search for a \u0022benign life environment\u0022.\u00A0 Ultimately I imagine a manned mission to Laythe may be considered, but I am going so slow and cautiously that that is decades away from consideration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeNapalm","CreatedById":67032,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-15T16:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile I see the point of Career mode, every time I start a new one (most recently this weekend) I rapidly realize that the reason I play this game is not compatible with it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Jn-\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-15T16:56:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s one of the great things about KSP-- it doesn\u0027t limit you to one \u0022correct\u0022 style of play. \u00A0I fall very naturally into spreadsheets and project-planning, for instance, so that feels comfortable to me. \u00A0But I know others would rather fly a plane (or a spaceplane) and would just as soon leave the project planning abstracted. \u00A0 KSP allows both approaches (and more)...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NISSKEPCSIM","CreatedById":173812,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-15T19:49:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnmanned before manned, with the Historical Progression Tech Tree.
