I might try setting it to 2250 m/s and seeing how it goes from there. Part of the issue is that once the ship leaves physics range (which is now 22.5km) it no longer has drag acting on it, so the reported speeds at actual deletion are higher than they should be (gravity still speeds them up, but the atmosphere doesn\u0027t slow them down at all).

With a heatshield, it removes a percent equal to the remaining heatshield ablator (so if it\u0027s unused, 100%). So at 3kms, normally it\u0027s 100% chance but the heatshield reduces that to 0%. At 2.5km/s there\u0027s a 50% chance, but a heatshield reduces that to -50% (which is just 0%). At 4km/s there\u0027s a 200% chance of burning up, and a heatshield reduces that to 100% (so, you\u0027re still screwed)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T15:32:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 03:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Squiggsy","CreatedById":139947,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:43:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having a problem that about 50% of the time my dropped stages are saying that they were destroyed despite having parachutes and saying they would be fine in the VAB, in the info window telling me they are destroyed it doesn\u0027t mention the existence of the parachute on the stages, don\u0027t know if this is a glitch or something I\u0027m doing wrong? strange because doign the exact same thing works some of the time, and they are only being dropped from about 10km\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gfurst","CreatedById":126201,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T15:47:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt might need to be turned up a bit by default since the stock heating isn\u0027t too dangerous and SR seems to overestimate. I might try setting it to 2250 m/s and seeing how it goes from there. Part of the issue is that once the ship leaves physics range (which is now 22.5km) it no longer has drag acting on it, so the reported speeds at actual deletion are higher than they should be (gravity still speeds them up, but the atmosphere doesn\u0027t slow them down at all). With Deadly Reentry the settings were about right, giving generally less than a 50% chance of a stage burning up if dropped from suborbital speeds.\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat acceleration without drag really is an issue, at first I thought it could be something to do with stages still being loaded in the physics range.
