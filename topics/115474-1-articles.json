The second I go back to the Space Center and look at the Science meter, it retains the value it had before entering Flight and altering the Science. As far as I can tell, the ResearchAndDevelopment scenario isn\u0027t saving the adjustment to Science when I switch the scene from Flight to Space Center. I\u0027m also seeing that the Science readout in Flight doesn\u0027t reflect the change I did. Is there a way to tell the ResearchAndDevelopment scenario to save its new values? Is there another place to set Science other than in the ResearchAndDevelopment scenario?\n\nThanks for the help. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nEdit: Nailed it! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) The problem is that I was adding science during the OnStart method.
