They have very different balance in place on them.\n\nDocking port - stock problem, not much I can do about it.  Also, as soon as the magnetics engage, you -should- be turning MJ/etc off completely, as it will only make things worse/fight against the docking ports own alignment code.  I canpossibly try making the collider a bit longer (right now it is a few CM short of the docking transform), but last time I did that, it made the ports not want to dock unless -perfectly- aligned.\n\nAlso, you can always try playing with the docking port config settings -- there are quite a few that determine distance/angle/etc.  I\u0027ve not touched any of them, so they use the stock values.
