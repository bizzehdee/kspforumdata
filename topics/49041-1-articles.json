It was chosen due to its small size and Eve being closed to Kerbin than Dres and Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far so good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe craft was launched in two parts. The transfer stage, and the Lander. The Lander also carried the crew, consisting only of Jeb. The transfer stage also contained a more comfortable quarter than the Mk1 command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander is launched first, aboard a Tikan 5 heavy carrier rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/JY4TPWC.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022JY4TPWC.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext follows the Lander, on a Kerbury III/S rocket:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/CDuKWge.png\u0022 alt=\u0022CDuKWge.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter meeting and docking in a low Kerbin orbit, the expedition begins, heading off into the purple unknown. A guidance failure caused the lander to crash into the transit stage, destroying one solar pannel on each craft, and crippling a landing leg. The damage was deemed non-critical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/KIFBDCm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022KIFBDCm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first injection burn was minimally miss-timed, so a correction burn was performed. And a third one on the way to Eve. This left the transit stage with too little fuel to reach Gilly, or to return to Kerbin for that matter. The decision was made to insert the ship into a medium orbit around Eve, to become the first space station around another planet. It looks like Jeb doesn\u0027t mind spending some time looking at this purple pearl in the sky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2QFPkGh.png\u0022 alt=\u00222QFPkGh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the spacecraft has entered a stable orbit, inclined by 75\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5qKFwks.png\u0022 alt=\u00225qKFwks.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDone in career mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-17T21:26:07Z\u0022 title=\u002210/17/2013 09:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SargeRho\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
