For example if the contract called for an 11 Kerbal base, one could dock a new hitchhiker with 2 existing ones and still satisfy the contract. This does not seem to be the case anymore. Mods need not apply.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Is there anyway to do this after 1.0?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Will this be implemented in another patch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf no \u0026amp; no, do we want this? I would think that adding a second type of base contract would be good. Say if you don\u0027t have any bases on a body, you\u0027re offered a contract to make a new one by, let\u0027s say, KWF. Then Rockomax comes along and wants a base for whatever backwards purpose they might have. A little while later, Rockomax might decide they need a bigger base and offer a contract to expand it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T15:33:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 03:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Pax Kerbana\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T14:40:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s true that Kerbals cost money to recruit, but,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. you can rescue plenty of \u0027em, for free (and in fact get paid for doing so)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. to complete a base contract, it doesn\u0027t have to be \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ecrewed\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/span\u003E.
