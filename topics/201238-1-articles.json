When playing the game, I am unable to use most of the features that are activated with the function keys, like the flight log or debug menu. The function keys on my laptop all have other uses (e.g. f7 lowers volume, f12 turns on airplane mode, etc) so you have to use the fn key to use it as a function key. In most other games, this works fine and pressing fn\u002Bf7 allows the key to work as normal. But for some reason, KSP is the only game where this doesn\u0027t work. The only key that actually works is f5 to quicksave, for some reason. Like I said, this isn\u0027t a problem in any other games so it doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem with my computer. I have also tried using a bluetooth keyboard with dedicated function keys and that did not work either. If anybody knows what\u0027s wrong or how to fix it, please let me know\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serenity","CreatedById":179192,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-03-26T10:24:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223944955\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201238\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221616701104\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210855\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dunalipa\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n14 hours ago, dunalipa said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn most other games, this works fine and pressing fn\u002Bf7 allows the key to work as normal.
