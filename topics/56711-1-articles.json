Having one less difference is fine in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.22, the difference between a manned and unmanned mission science-wise was the lack of EVA reports, crew reports, and surface samples. In 0.23, however, probe missions took a hit because you have to return now, repeated transmissions can\u0027t compete with actual returns. Furthermore, the ability to move results to the capsule via EVA means that even with a single thermometer, you can get full value return results from multiple locations for a manned mission, but the probe is still stuck with at most one return per thermometer. Manned missions can use the same thing to ditch the mat-sci and goo container parts, returning significantly less mass to Kerbin, but still get full return value for those experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
