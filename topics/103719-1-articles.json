I was going to play today and I had a problem that causes the game to load extremely slow (Happens regularly, but it\u0027s not that bad for me) so I did what I do everytime it happens, restart the pc. After that, I tried to open the game and a message appeared saying : \u0022failed to launch the game (unknown error)\u0022, so I went to the files and tried to find the issue, when I realized my KSP_x64.exe was missing \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I can\u0027t play on 32bit because of all the mods I have (Parts, gameplay mechanics, physics, visual enhancements, etc.) And I use and love all of the mods I have. Tried everything! checked for the game integrity, reinstalled completely (uninstalling from steam and erasing the extra folders from the game folder) but still no x64 executable. I don\u0027t know what to do now! Without the mods almost all my ships will dissapear, and without x64 I can\u0027t play it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your attention!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I just installed the game in another computer and the x64 executable is still missing... ?!?!?!
