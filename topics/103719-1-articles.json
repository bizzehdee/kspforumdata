I was going to play today and I had a problem that causes the game to load extremely slow (Happens regularly, but it\u0027s not that bad for me) so I did what I do everytime it happens, restart the pc. After that, I tried to open the game and a message appeared saying : \u0022failed to launch the game (unknown error)\u0022, so I went to the files and tried to find the issue, when I realized my KSP\\_x64.exe was missing ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif).\n\n I can\u0027t play on 32bit because of all the mods I have (Parts, gameplay mechanics, physics, visual enhancements, etc.) And I use and love all of the mods I have. Tried everything! checked for the game integrity, reinstalled completely (uninstalling from steam and erasing the extra folders from the game folder) but still no x64 executable. I don\u0027t know what to do now! Without the mods almost all my ships will dissapear, and without x64 I can\u0027t play it!\n\nThanks for your attention!\n\nEdit: I just installed the game in another computer and the x64 executable is still missing... ?!?!?! What is going on? Is x64 executable missing in an early update I didn\u0027t realized? I\u0027m seriously confused right now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-09T02:05:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2015 02:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Aristizabal95**"},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T02:37:43Z","Content":"They just updated it and removed the 64bit, take a peek in the general discussion board.
