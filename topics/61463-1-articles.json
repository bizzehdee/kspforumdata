I have installed MechJeb, RemoteTech, and Kerbal Engineer. Lately, however, I have started to run into issues. The best illustration of this issue is when I try to launch a 3 pack of comm sats into orbit around Mun. I need to click the command module of the satelite, then have it undock/decouple from the Box (aka the last state that got it where it is going). Once I\u0027ve done that, I can get it into orbit and everything. Once I swap back to the Box, it no longer works. It claims that there isn\u0027t a connection when A) There is plenty of power. With two of those commsats strapped to it, it has over 9k power, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E There are enough RTGs on each commsat to run each constantly (with the exception of the ion engine), and only one antenna is deployed and active per sat, leaving me with a ton of extra power, and C) The old commsats that I am replacing are still in orbit and functional.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m a bit confused here as to what could be going wrong.
