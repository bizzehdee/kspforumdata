Now, I don\u0027t think they only live 70 years on average like humans, considering they seemingly don\u0027t need food and can theoretically perform photosynthesis, are immune to space radiation, and can stay 70 years on a cramped space without mental or physical damage, so they seem to be a lot more \u0022durable\u0022 than humans, but if you had to attach a value to a Kerbal\u0027s average lifespan, if they even are mortal at all and can\u0027t die only from explosions, how long would you say they live? A \u0022\u0022little\u0022\u0022 bit more than humans, about 150 years? Thousands of years? Or have they discovered the secrets to anti-aging technology like humans hope to do in the future and are actually biologically immortal to diseases and aging, and can only die from serious life-threatening situations? Of course, all of this discussion is pointless, if I had to guess I\u0027d say Kerbals don\u0027t age because of game design, game difficulty (making it easier instead of old Kerbals dying on a mission) and maybe limitations, and perhaps this could change and theoretically an individual Kerbal could have a biological age in KSP2, but it is still fun to discuss and guess the reason why this could happen in-game on KSP1, so what do you guys think?

When this is taken in combination with the common fanon that Kerbals are biologically immortal plant-based beings that photosynthesize (although they also like Snacks,) and are perfectly happy with sitting still for centuries at a time; it raises some questions about their internal biology. Perhaps they\u0027re literally just green all the way down, and when exposed to extreme impacts, high temperatures, or apparently shock; the bonds holding them together break and they are reduced into a grey, ashy vapor?
