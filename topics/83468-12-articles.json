To go on with mission I tried to replace the hook with hyperedit. I can place it near my team, and it behaves normally at first. At some moment, however, I attach a hook to surface, and when I switch to the rover it either explodes or flies off upward and becomes fixed somewhere in the air, unresponsive to GUI commands. At this point, if I try to load a game, the hook may be attached where it was but KAS thinks nothing is attached and winch is fully retracted, or GUI buttons may be pushable, with sound playing but cable not extending or retracting. If I try to load game again, the planet will likely won\u0027t load at all, the rover will be stuck in motion, and time standing still. KSP.log is spammed with exceptions.
