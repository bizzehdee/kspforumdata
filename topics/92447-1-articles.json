Currently, progression in the game exists by researching new parts with science points, which you get by performing various experiments and completing contracts. However, once you fill out the tech tree (which really doesn\u0027t take a whole lot of time), all sense of progression is lost. Science points are obsolete, and so I no longer have a reason to go to Duna in the first place (you can easily fill out the tech tree within Kerbin\u0027s SOI).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good game needs to have a good progression system, as well as good gameplay. I know Squad has lots of plans for the future involving progression, like upgradable buildings, kerbal experience, etc. But I seriously hope they have plans for the way science works too, in order to vastly increase the game\u0027s longevity. I want to have a good reason to continue experimenting and exploring the solar system, even though the parts tech tree might already be filled out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s why I\u0027d like to start a discussion on progression in the future game. What sorts of features/changes would you like to see implemented in order to vastly increase the longevity of the game and give the player more motivation to explore and research? Perhaps using science points as a sort of currency, used for things like upgrading the KSC?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T08:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, I think. The game needs a science sink, something to spend science points in that never runs out. I don\u0027t count the admin policies as that - they cannot spend points you already earned, and converting science to money just to spend it does not feel, you know, like, doing sciencing? Tech tree and KSC upgrades run out eventually, you\u0027ll have everything researched and every building at top tier, but even if you extract every single science point from every single biome in the system, contracts are still there and they often pay out with science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, one would have to figure out what that science sink would be before it could be implemented. You have to pay for every ounce of fuel you burn, there\u0027s no recovery gain for that. But what would burn science? It would also have to give the player something they need, or at least can easily use for their advantage, without unbalancing the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T09:05:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProgression?
