I launched more ships that had that configuration and the problem did not affect them. It\u0027s just once an a while a certain VAB build of a ship gets the bugged SAS problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is another .craft of a vessel with the same command\u002Bunmanned modules and reaction wheel which is NOT affected by the bug: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://puu.sh/jehwx/e8a3a5b1d1.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://puu.sh/jehwx/e8a3a5b1d1.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: After loading the craft that had this problem in the VAB and fixing the position of some solar panels that inexplicably explode on the launchpad, I saved it as a different name. After launching the newly-renamed vessel, I soon realized that it did not experience the SAS problem. Any more information I find about this bug I\u0027ll try to update here for others. Here\u0027s the renamed vessel that is almost exactly the same that does not have the problem: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://puu.sh/jekz4/98b6ff1377.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://puu.sh/jekz4/98b6ff1377.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T04:33:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Meteo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T07:30:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you have more than one SAS wheel, they sometimes fight against each other and the ship never settles on assigned direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I have more than one wheel, I\u0027d deactivate all except the one closest to COG (Centre of Gravity), and disable RCS as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs KSP has an awful PID centering algorithm, I get around this by a single time acceleration step when the ship is on target, and step back to normal time again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meteo","CreatedById":116369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T12:24:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOh really ColKlonk?
