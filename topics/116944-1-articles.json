It has affected multiple launches of this ship: [http://i.imgur.com/gxCw355.png](http://i.imgur.com/gxCw355.png)\n\nThis is the .craft file: [http://puu.sh/jehpi/557fb28edb.craft](http://puu.sh/jehpi/557fb28edb.craft)\n\nThis does contain parts from the RemoteTech mod.\n\nNow just on a note, near the very top of this ship is a unmanned command pod in addition to manned command pods. I launched more ships that had that configuration and the problem did not affect them. It\u0027s just once an a while a certain VAB build of a ship gets the bugged SAS problem.\n\nHere is another .craft of a vessel with the same command\u002Bunmanned modules and reaction wheel which is NOT affected by the bug: [http://puu.sh/jehwx/e8a3a5b1d1.craft](http://puu.sh/jehwx/e8a3a5b1d1.craft)\n\nEdit: After loading the craft that had this problem in the VAB and fixing the position of some solar panels that inexplicably explode on the launchpad, I saved it as a different name. After launching the newly-renamed vessel, I soon realized that it did not experience the SAS problem. Any more information I find about this bug I\u0027ll try to update here for others. Here\u0027s the renamed vessel that is almost exactly the same that does not have the problem: [http://puu.sh/jekz4/98b6ff1377.craft](http://puu.sh/jekz4/98b6ff1377.craft)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-27T04:33:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2015 04:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Meteo**"},{"CreatedByName":"ColKlonk","CreatedById":137078,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T07:30:21Z","Content":"If you have more than one SAS wheel, they sometimes fight against each other and the ship never settles on assigned direction.\n\nIf I have more than one wheel, I\u0027d deactivate all except the one closest to COG (Centre of Gravity), and disable RCS as well.\n\nAs KSP has an awful PID centering algorithm, I get around this by a single time acceleration step when the ship is on target, and step back to normal time again.\n\n![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Meteo","CreatedById":116369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T12:24:37Z","Content":"Oh really ColKlonk? I never had a problem with reaction wheels fighting, but that\u0027s similar to my problem of the engine gimbals fighting them. I did try using time warp briefly after disengaging SAS and it did not help.
