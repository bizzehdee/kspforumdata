I have tried completing an entire orbit, leaving the ship in orbit overnight, and overwriting crew reports and in both modes it doesn\u0027t work it just says 0 science on the window where it gives you the option to keep or transmit. Also i should mention that the crew reports work just fine in the atmosphere and on land/sea, this is only a problem in space. This sucks cause i really wanted to setup a space station that can do multiple crew reports and transmit them, but now i can\u0027t.. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help will be greatly appreciated! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Master Tao","CreatedById":110410,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-19T18:40:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EScience returns decrease as you repeat the experiments in the same situation.

For crew reports, once you have done one under specific conditions it cannot be repeated. KSP defines it\u0027s specific conditions as BIOMES and a STATE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many different biomes (such as Kerbin\u0027s grasslands, or Kerbin\u0027s ocean) on Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus. The other planets, moons, and asteroids currently only have one biome each (which is slated to change in the next update).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach biome also has a variety of states, or conditions, or situations (whatever you like to call them) in which you can do science. For example, there\u0027s landed, splashed, low atmosphere above, low space above, and others. So for certain experiments, you can get science at, say, Landed on Kerbin\u0027s grasslands.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther experiments are more global (run across the biomes). So some experiments might run across all biomes, but be in low space (such as crew reports) while a similar event can be by biome and still in low space (like EVA reports).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then, on top of all that, some experiments can gather all the science there is in one run (like crew reports) where other science can be run a few times before collecting all the available science (like mystery goo). And not all experiments can be transmitted for full science (reports usually can though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that if you are fulfilling contracts, any \u0022transmit or recover science from XXX\u0022 doesn\u0027t require you to actually gain any science points. So you could still transmit those empty science reports to fulfill the contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not all of it, but hopefully gets you started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Claw\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
