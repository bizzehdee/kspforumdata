The K-Prize panel concluded that while this shows advanced pilot precision, landing twice in the same mission only counts if it is on different planet to the one it took off from and coffee is, in any case, its own reward! (The APPA 1st class requires orbital docking as well, but you do get a VTOL mention in brackets in the guest list / roll of honour, I hope that will suffice though it is a bit redundant since the name you gave includes VTOL anyway).\n\nHaha! Coffee is indeed its own reward. Thanks for adding me.

This is the current variant of my favorite design, newly rebuilt in 0.90.\n\nBecause it\u0027s so simple, I expect someone else has already created a similar design. Being new to the forums, I\u0027ve only seen a fairly small number of other designs so far.\n\nThe Sparrow Mk2 is a minimalist design. Only 6.1 tons with selected fuel amounts, and only 18 parts. 100% stock. Flies beautifully. Takes off horizontally, but can pitch right into vertical climb. Flatten out at 10k or so, use the sweet spot for as long as you can, and circularization. I\u0027ve previously made orbit in it using less than 30 m/s from the rockets.\n\nIt does, however, have no luxury features other than it\u0027s esthetic appeal. No solar panels, no RTG, no batteries, no RCS, and no docking ports. (Make sure you turn off SAS and lights once you make orbit! Those Rockomax 48-7S engines produce no juice.)\n\nBeing a two-seater makes it ideal for those \u0027rescue a Kerbal from Kerbin orbit\u0027 contracts.\n\nHere\u0027s a look\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Once in orbit all the remaining fuel can be moved to the central fuselage removing this issue altogether, still I believe KSP should integrate a fuel balancing mechanic as a standard or upgrade feature what with the new buildings and whatnot.
