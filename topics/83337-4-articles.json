I know there use to be one in game, however not everyone hit it when launching a craft. This would mean that a lot of newer players will crash into it more often than an experienced player would. I do not believe there is a mod out there that puts one down on the launch pad, although I could be completely wrong as well. I do like the fact that you have to research the node and do more than just buy it and more on, testing will make career mode be more career-ish. Better particles maybe means clouds (I hope)? The EVA pack switch should only apply to bodies where the pack would be uselss (ie Kerbin, Eve, Laythe) so there is still that option to have one, but I also like the crew transfer thing as moving in a base will be easier (and somewhat more realistic).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parkaboy","CreatedById":64208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-30T15:44:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe only \u0022Physics buff\u0022 that was mentioned in the stream, if the term applies, was a \u0022reduced drag\u0022 bonus. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of the system is that you can customize your play style.
