Turning left and right are a bit limited, due to my not wanting a vertical tailfin, but aside from that it\u0027s remarkably stable, I did check the com and col a couple times, but didn\u0027t really have to move anything to my surprise.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I thought I\u0027d get some opinions from you guys, and maybe someone who knows how to fly ssto\u0027s (I\u0027ve only ever gotten into orbit three times, in previous ksp versions, it\u0027s probably way worse now) could give it a whirl and see how she does.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, I\u0027d love to get some feedback on the design and the performance.
