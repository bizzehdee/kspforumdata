I added \u0022the\u0022 because many of the successful YouTubers have three-part names (Pewdipie, Jacksepticeye). Well, no, now that I think about it, it comes from a running joke I made a while ago (as in over three years ago). I was annoyed by all of the ways to do one math problem, and I made a convoluted way of doing a simple addition problem. I called it the \u0022Kosanian\u0022 method. I don\u0027t even remember how to do it, it was so complicated. Ever since then, when someone does something the hard way my freinds say, \u0022That\u0027s the Kosanian Method of doing that.\u0022 It stuck, and now I really like it.
