As like you and everyone else, I also use drop-tanks and vegetarian staging. But because this will be quite an undertaking which will require a lot of thought and time to get my head around, I have focused more on getting out something which works. Adding the bit-sized feature updates with every version along with the bug fixes and general improvements. When I do go ahead with sorting this out, I will have to be certain in my mind that the current version is stable. I\u0027ve only got a certain amount of free time available for working on this plugin, and all of that will be taken up by this one feature alone. In which time there will be no time spare for bug fixing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plugin at the moment on this last update seems to be fairly stable, although I have noticed a typo ;-). There\u0027s still a couple minor fixes and some feature polish which still needs to be done.

I know it sounds bad, but I do not have enough time to thoroughly test every update in all situations. So all the feedback possible helps me figure out what is broken and what is not. Along with the big game breaking bugs, if anything odd happens it will be helpful to know. Or if it runs perfectly as expected, that also helps me figure out what parts are working well so I can concentrate on others. As I always say.... Any and all feedback is welcome! No matter how small, it could help in more ways than you think.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample would be that you keep reading the Time to Apoapsis instead of Apoapsis Height, so I\u0027ll move it around to make it easier etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"willow","CreatedById":13072,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-18T07:10:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome you\u0027ve put in the folding of the information blocks.

I really like knowing how many delta-v\u0027s I have available on the rocket. I did note your mod makes a pessimistic guess, if mechjeb suggests I need 800 deltav for a munar transfer your mods before and after counts indicate it\u0027s only used 600. That could also be the effects of ksp\u0027s throttle bug, or mechjeb is wrong, I don\u0027t know.

Walk the graph and just assign each part a number based on the highest stage of the decouplers you passed in the graph to get there. It\u0027s absolutely possible to stage a decoupler in stage 1 when it\u0027s attached to a part that is attached to a decoupler that detaches in stage four. Wishful thinking aside, any parts under that stage 1 decoupler will \u003Cem\u003Estill\u003C/em\u003E be gone in stage four.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now you can get the stage where anything falls off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhat engines do I need to care about, right now?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHey - an easy one! Engines first fire in a designated stage and stop being important when they fall off the ship. We care about all the engines that have been staged, and haven\u0027t fallen off the ship. They may not be firing because they\u0027re out of fuel, but we have to figure out they\u0027re not firing to figure out delta v - so we still care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12px;\u0022\u003EWhere is the fuel coming from at any point in time?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming a graph you can follow around fuel using, providing, and transferring items...to determine where fuel is coming from for a particular engine, start with that engine as the first \u003Cem\u003Enode\u003C/em\u003E on the graph, and start walking.. Here\u0027s what my experimentation has shown me regarding fuel flow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf there something attached to this node using fuel line(s), then fuel will arrive via the fuel lines. All of them. If fuel arrives via fuel lines, it will not arrive via direct attachment. So for each part attached via fuel lines (that has fuel), go to that part, and follow this algorithm. Recursion! Yay!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf you\u0027re not receiving fuel via a fuel line, and there is something (with fuel) attached to an attach point, then fuel will arrive via the attach point. If you\u0027re using a mod that provides fuel-flow-capable objects with multiple attach points, then fuel will arrive via all of those attach points where there\u0027s fuel. Unmodded, this really only applies to fuel tanks, as far as I can see. Again, recursion and track where the fuel is coming from.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EIf nothing else is providing fuel, then \u003Cem\u003Ethis\u003C/em\u003E node is providing fuel.

If I attach two tanks to an engine using fuel lines, then half of the flow comes from each tank. If I attach two tanks to one of those tanks, then there are three tanks fuel is coming from, and equal flow comes from each. I do not split the flow in half from the first point where there are two lines, and then split it again from the second. There are three tanks providing fuel, so each provides one third of the fuel for that engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt doesn\u0027t matter whether a \u0022node\u0022 is an engine or a fuel tank - you can attach an engine directly to a fuel tank, and then run a fuel line from a different (unconnected) tank to the engine. The engine will feed through the fuel line first, and only use the direct-attached tank when the fuel line isn\u0027t providing fuel anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you use a fuel line to pull from the \u003Cem\u003Emiddle\u003C/em\u003E of a stack of fuel tanks, you will end up pulling fuel from \u003Cem\u003Eboth ends\u003C/em\u003E of the stack. Want a truly delightful experience? Stack three tanks on top of each other. Stick one tank off to the side. Put engines under both the stack and the single tank, and run a fuel line from the middle of the stack to the single tank. Light that sucker off, and look at the flow rates. Single tank? No flow - fuel is being piped in from the stack. Center of the stack? Again, no flow. Bottom of the stack? Half of the flow necessary to fuel the engine over to the side. \u003Cem\u003ETop\u003C/em\u003E of the stack? The \u003Cem\u003Eother\u003C/em\u003E half of the flow for the other engine, and the full flow for the engine directly beneath. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E Distance traveled seems to be completely unimportant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket surgery.

Fuel flow is calculated in litres, and part weight in kg in the VAB. \u003Cem\u003EThere is no direct relation between these two numbers.\u003C/em\u003E Stock parts all have 200 litres to a kg. Mod parts may not. Why is this important? Because the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E on the engine is calculated based on the assumption of 200 l/kg. Start using modded parts, and the weight of the fuel changes, and you end up with \u003Cem\u003Edifferent actual I\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cem\u003Esp\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can still calculate the \u003Cem\u003Eflow\u003C/em\u003E through an engine based on the provided I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, and the fuel flow rate remains unchanged despite the weight of the fuel in question. So it\u0027s better, for each engine we\u0027re playing with, to know the flow rate per second, instead of the I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E listed on the part. Oh - and we want to calculate this for both atmos and vacuum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat information do we have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E - measured in seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust (F) - measured in Newtons, or kilogram-meters-per-second-squared.

Eventually. Actually, I\u0027ve read hints that l/s is provided for the part; maybe I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E(s) is calculated? If so, that cuts out this little section. If not, though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E, we can get effective exhaust velocity - which is I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E*g. From effective exhaust velocity and force, we can get the burn rate in kg/s. From \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E, and the expected fuel density, we can get litres per second - even if the density of the actual fuel changes, the litres per second burn rate still holds true.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn example. If you take a 1.125 ton fuel tank and stick an aerospike on it, you\u0027ll last about 15 seconds at full burn.

Yes; remember that the VAB speaks of kg, not metric tons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have 200l/kg, so that little bitty number ends up with: 0.0654107796...kg/s * 200l/kg = 13.08l/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur aforementioned 1.25 ton fuel tank has 200 units of fuel. At 13 per second, 200l / 13l/s = 15.288s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the flow rate for any given engine in l/s is (200*F) / (I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E * 9.8).
