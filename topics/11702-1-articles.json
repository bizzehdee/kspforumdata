So I am asking the KSP community if anyone would donate their goto telescope. There are a few names for goto telescopes like computerised telescope and tracking telescope. If you have one and willing to donate please feel free to comment. Just a few problems though. I can pick it up but **only from places in England.** If you live in Wales or Scotland you may have to post it and unfortunately this is quite a lot of money.\n\nPlease post if you will be happy to give one away.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nBoyercam ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"popeter123","CreatedById":18410,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T15:55:00Z","Content":"what about weston-supermare or swansea?\n\ni dont have one but i know were to get one\n\nebay ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"boyercam","CreatedById":21178,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-30T15:59:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E what about weston-supermare or swansea?\n\u003E \n\u003E i dont have one but i know were to get one\n\u003E \n\u003E ebay ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nThank you for your help, but not much luck with eBay.
