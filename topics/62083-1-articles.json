As they are holding onto a ladder, and are clipping into a part, say a strut as they\u0027re light objects.. It pushes the strut away, but \u0027pulls\u0027 the ladder with it. I\u0027ve done this with 3 parts, a small ladder, octagonal strut, and the smallest strut piece.. Though I suspect you could do it in two as well..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe egg tends to push in one specific direction for a pretty random period of time, if the Kerbal is not moving around. Putting an Egg into orbit and using a probe core to rotate let me somewhat choose my trajectory, though as I said, the thing has a mind of its own and decides to start accelerating in some other direction.. I did once make a variation that could actually be controlled rather reliably, and had very few \u0027direction swaps\u0027 but unfortunately I have no idea where that craft is..\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-04T05:25:45Z\u0022 title=\u002202/04/2014 05:25  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by A Fat Pokemon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arq","CreatedById":71084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T06:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo NOT taunt the magic boulder!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Comrade Jenkens","CreatedById":59544,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T08:11:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I\u0027ve found is clipping landing gear into things can summon the kraken.

When the ship is on the way home, it will get eaten between 60-75% of the time with only about 1 week to go before entering Kerbin\u0027s SOI. And very occansionally, this ship will get eaten on the way out to Eve before passing Mun\u0027s orbit.\u003Cp\u003EI suspect there\u0027s a very bad pot hole in space just inside of Kerbin\u0027s orbit at the clock position where the ship always comes home from Eve at this point in the game. But the thing is, it always picks the one ship out of a large flotilla that has the Kerbal in it. All the probes always pass through safely, so it can\u0027t be a flaw in the fabric of space. But OTOH, it can\u0027t really be a problem with the crewed ship, either, because this ship invariably is only a slightly modified version of what I\u0027ve been sending to Mun and Minmus, and even Duna, with no problems, all through the game up to this point.
