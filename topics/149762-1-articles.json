Anybody know if there is any way to make that the default when starting a new game?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess a workaround is to start a new game, archive it, then just extract and rename it instead of using the \u0022New Game\u0022 dialog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCheers,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0- Micha.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
