Which ended up into making one for each size rocket. But with eight parachutes in the Utilities menu looking the same, I needed an easy way to identify them--I ended up with a retexture of the parachute parts and I messed with the configs a bit. I\u0027ll probably do the stock radial parachutes tomorrow in a similar color scheme to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s11.photobucket.com/user/Konraden/media/New_NC_Parachutes_zps302753de.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a184/Konraden/New_NC_Parachutes_zps302753de.png\u0022 alt=\u0022New_NC_Parachutes_zps302753de.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me, a .0625m parachute shouldn\u0027t create the same drag as the 1.25m parachute, which wouldn\u0027t create the same drag as a 3.75m parachute. Since the canopy scales with the part, I scaled the drag of each parachute. It\u0027s going to need some balancing, but it was a place to start.
