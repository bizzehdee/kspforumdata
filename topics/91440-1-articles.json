While I was impressed by the number of updates that were released for some of them, I also realised that the performance and overall number of bugs did not improve or suffered from that. Some games even stoped development to fix parts of the code cause many features of the game were not accesable due to fps drops. Ksp may be slow in development and at some point we all get impatient but tbh it has been pretty stable and improves constantly. This way we also have the time to discuss the things we dislike before they get released, which I think improves the quality. The amount of qa is rly impressive in my opinion. A faster and less structured work flow might also shorten the amount of time that the community has to discuss prereleased material. New stuff tends to be talked to death up to the point that we get some kind of consensus. That might also be one of many reasons why the ksp community doesn\u0027t explode in wild rage after each update like it\u0027s pretty common with other early access titles \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would still vote for a delay of 0.90 if that is required to include the mk3 cargo bays and I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ghe only one.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T19:07:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also wish they could just \u0022delay\u0022 the beta release to include the entire Mk3 set and I know other fan are ok with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if it break their workflow (which usually mean losing money while nobody is doing anything), I\u0027ll understand if they don\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-28T19:17:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have to admit it is weird they don\u0027t do those little updates as much as they used to....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-29T00:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe smaller updates are usually critical bugfixes (with a few notable exceptions).
