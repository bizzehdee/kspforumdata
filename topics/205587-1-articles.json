Even more recently than that I\u0027ve noticed Elacno Challenge missions being a thing around here so I decided to try it out in my cool rover. Why am I making a thread about it? Sunk cost fallacy. It\u0027s already happening. Hopefully it makes for an interesting read.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI chose Vall because it\u0027s gravitational situation is pretty similar to Duna, where I know that this rover is capable of high speed long haul driving, It\u0027s got mountains that I\u0027m pretty sure my rover can absolutely humiliate with it\u0027s climbing power, and it has an easter egg that I\u0027ve never actually seen in game before. Basically I wanted to know what I was getting myself into, but not so well that there would be no surprises. Except, surprise! I overestimated my vehicle, my computer and my patience quite severely.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI fixed a bunch of things with my rover and my PC and decided to move the whole operation to Moho for another try, I start setting up for this almost immediately upon reaching Vall, but actually start moving stuff in Update #4 and the mission on Moho begins in Update #6. Moho\u0027s gravity is even more similar to Duna and as far as I knew while planning this move, it\u0027s terrain was a little more reasonable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Journey to Vall:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s the star of the show, the Exoloper Mobile Colony. It\u0027s a 200 ton monster with a landing pad and a garage for storing a smaller rover inside. About as big a steakhouse and flies like a bistro. I\u0027ve previously flown this rig to Duna, so I know it can make orbit and all that, but the launcher for it is an absolute lagbomb. Getting this thing\u00A0 efficiently to orbit is a colossal pain in the ass, and I had to do it multiple times. Eventually I redesigned the launcher with Mammoth engines instead of Vectors in order to reduce the amount of fuel delivery calculations, I\u0027m not sure how much that helped frame rates, but I was able to get to orbit more efficiently with the better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022dNMB7IV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/dNMB7IV.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s my SP-9 Poleaxe with\u00A0 my SL3 lander tucked inside alongside some extra fueltanks.

Unfortunately TWP does not predict your phase angle at the time of the chosen transfer window but rather what it would be if you were to depart right now, so upon timewarping to the transfer window I found both my ships ready to escape kerbin in the wrong direction. I scrubbed the whole save and started again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second attempt failed because I tried out a mod that gives you higher levels of timewarp and accidentally warped way past the window. Of course this was after I launched everything again. Upon reflection I guess I could have kept warping to the next window, but it was pretty late at this point and I\u0027m just a generally unintelligent person to begin with, so I deleted that save too and started again the next day\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird attempt I resolved to fly one vehicle at a time. this is also when I re-tooled the Exoloper launcher for higher trust and lower(?) lag.

The transfer gets a little hairy when my periapsis dips into the upper atmosphere of Kerbin, and due to my wonky burn I ended up with a much more aggressive Jool encounter than I bargained for. While plotting my course correction I realized that I would have too much velocity to Tylo-assist into a Jool capture, and since the Poleaxe absolutely does not have enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to do it the old-fashioned way I decided to try using Laythe\u0027s upper atmosphere.

After landing everything and getting it all set up, how could I not drive it a little bit? I ran into some early problems, no total showstoppers, but I\u0027ll almost certainly be sending a new rover at some point to deal with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing was weird lag spikes. I had to fight a bit with the robotic gantry to get it to play nice with my lander and after that my game would become a slideshow whenever the rover was in motion. Keeping my mouse over the debug window brought my frame rate back to normal, but I can\u0027t control the rover like that. This is the problem that made me step away from the computer earlier in the day and it seems to be fixed by restarting the game. Unfortunately, reloading the scene causes the robotics to get all weird again, and occasionally brings back the lag. I decided to ditch the lander for now as a workaround. I might have to periodically fly the lander back to myself to keep it in comnet range until a new and improved Exoloper arrives.

I\u0027ve never noticed before and while it doesn\u0027t actually seem to matter that much in practice it sure gives me the willies. I\u0027m trying to isolate the cause so I can fix it, but I\u0027m presently completely stumped.

My mostly equatorial path will also bring me across what looks like an entire hemisphere of mild terrain, so that should speed things up in a big way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Thpyx3c.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/Thpyx3c.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe addition of reaction wheels to Exoloper has made if much more drivable in low gees. I\u0027ve already been in many situations which on Vall would have caused the rover to slide and flip over, but here the torque is able to keep it pointed true (mostly). Taking jumps is a less risky proposition now too, because I can plant my wheels flat upon landing. I\u0027m still finding that it wants to turn when I\u0027m braking downhill, not the end of the world, but annoying. I\u0027ll try messing with the friction on my wheels to resolve it in situ, and then probably try to bake a better solution into an updated craft file.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis next screenshot is after driving about 30km from the LZ. I\u0027m seeing some very rugged terrain ahead, so I stopped for a quicksave.

I used what remained of Rover Mini S to go and check out what happened. I was expecting to see one of those little rocks from Breaking Ground, but nothing. Maybe that null reference exception refers to a rock whose model didn\u0027t load in, but the collision did?

I\u0027m showing off Exoloper\u0027s novel steering mechanism here since I guess it\u0027s not really obvious how this rover works so I\u0027ll explain it. It has 16 wheels out of symmetry and with the steering direction of all the ones on (I think) the right side reversed. This means that when I try to steer Exoloper normally, all the wheels go to 100% in the same direction and stay that way allowing it to reach high speeds and climb steep terrain with ease. The obvious drawback here is that I can\u0027t steer it normally. Instead I steer it by bending it in the middle like a front-end loader or some other piece of heavy equipment. I have the rover controls, the steering servos, and yaw/pitch/roll all bound separately so Exoloper is a little more complicated to drive than your average rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022yzkEuJr.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/yzkEuJr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had to google to figure out how to deploy surface science equipment, those pieces off to the side I dropped using an engineer, but somehow lost the ability to pick them back up again after I realized what I was doing wrong. I ended up running them over with Exoloper to feed\u00A0 the seismic thing, but it didn\u0027t work! it looks like some of these things weren\u0027t close enough to the control station, or they weren\u0027t powered, or something. I was sure while packing that the solar panel would produce enough power, and if that were going to be true anywhere it would be Moho. Maybe I\u0027ll try again another time.
