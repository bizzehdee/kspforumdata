December 2023 was the highest revenue month ever for games. Bar none. And the Take Two CEO has recently increased his own salary to $43M/year as a pat on the back for that. I don\u0027t know how familiar you are with studio finances, but running the studio of the size of Intercept costs several times less than T2 CEO\u0027s salary.

I never even said anything about maximizing profits. I\u0027m talking about bog standard financial decisions that happen in every single industry on the planet in every single large corporation. Bad projects shut down all the time, even good projects shut down all the time due to sometimes incredibly stupid reasons and people are laid off all the time and most of them don\u0027t deserve it. It sucks a lot for the affected people and generally speaking nobody likes it and I\u0027m not defending the system at all which enables this. It\u0027s demotivating, soul crushing, all manners of wrong and burns people like me out very quickly, which happened to me too and I wasn\u0027t even in the big seats but just a highly specialised senior engineer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nReality is though, that IG is a company which secured funding but failed to deliver the product. Nobody else is responsible for their failure but themselves. You can be butt hurt over it as much as you want, but it\u0027s the publisher\u0027s money and they deemed IG not to be viable. Is it fair for us consumers? Not at all. Is it fair to the individual developers? Not at all. Is it fair to IG management? Well, they could\u0027ve certainly done a better job. I don\u0027t want anyone to lose their jobs, but this is where the failure sits. Is it fair to expect that T2 keeps pouring money down into a project that won\u0027t return a profit? I don\u0027t think so, they too bought something. The state of this game has been clear enough since launch and I very much doubt the people at T2 would be cutting off a profitable studio. It\u0027s possible since morons exist at every level, but typically there are also smart people who stop that from happening. Sometimes they fail. Sometimes they\u0027re too risk averse.
