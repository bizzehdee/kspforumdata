I started to put it in the CRP thread but it\u0027s not really related to that.\n\nI\u0027m kicking around the idea of some hydrogen fuel cells and I got to looking in the CRP resource cfg for conversion rates, and I\u0027m a touch confused now. PEMFC\u0027s create water as a result of the reaction taking place inside the cell, so naturally I want this cell to do the same, however I\u0027m unsure of what the proper converstion rate from Hydrogen \u002B Oxygen into Water would be. \n\nAssuming I\u0027m understanding the density correctly (the density listed equals one unit of the resource) would I simply add the density of the H\u003Csub\u003E2 \u003C/sub\u003Eto half the density of the Oxygen to get one unit of water vapor or should I be using some different rate since the water is obviously a liquid and not a gas?"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T05:03:13Z","Content":"Water is H\u003Csub\u003E2\u003C/sub\u003EO, so we need twice as many molecules of hydrogen as we do oxygen (hydrogen and Oxygen both typically form in pairs, so we can ignore that).
