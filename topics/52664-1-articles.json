If the center of mass when empty were displayed, it would be easy to place the center of lift between the full and empty centers of mass and made controlled descent much easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECenter of Drag Display:\u003C/strong\u003E I would give my right arm to be able to find the center of drag when I am building a space plane. Currently, I need to resort to trial and error to get the center of drag behind the center of mass, and a simple dot would make things much easier to deal with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I\u0027m not the only one who would like to see these additions to the game, as I think they would be very good to have and would make he game more enjoyable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-11T01:26:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHopefully Tweakables will allow full/empty CoM toggle in a roundabout way via setting tanks as empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI must agree with the centre of drag thing, although perhaps they\u0027re wanting to wait for better aerodynamics before adding it in?
