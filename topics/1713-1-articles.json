I thought I\u0027d get the ball rolling (so to speak) and start figuring out how to get there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to assume a starting point of a low circular orbit around Kerbin, with the orbital plane synchronzied to that of the moon. We already know how to do those steps (even if the instrumentation for the latter part is a bit lacking at the moment), it\u0027s the next step that\u0027s the interesting one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt some altitude above Kerbin, between the planet and the moon, will be a point at which the pull of Kerbin\u0027s gravity is equal to the pull of the moon\u0027s gravity. It seems reasonable to me to start a Hohmann transfer orbit and aim for this altitude at apoapsis. Since the transfer orbit calculation doesn\u0027t take the moon\u0027s pull into account, you should end up overshooting this altitude by some margin, meaning you will end up on a path where the moon\u0027s gravity has more influence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point, depending on the moon\u0027s size and mass, you will likely be in an escape trajectory heading around the moon, and using standard orbital maneuvers, you can make a retrograde burn at periapsis to place your craft into a lunar orbit, and you\u0027ll be all set. Alternatively, if you overshoot your trans-lunar injection too far, you may be on a collision course with the moon, \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E and may need to make a prograde or even a radial burn to increase your apoapsis to an altitude above the moon\u0027s surface before circularizing. Either way, you will have achieved lunar orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, backtracking a bit, we have a few more things to determine about the trans-lunar injection burn. Following normal orbital mechanics, in order to place the apoapsis of the transfer orbit closest to the moon, you would want to start your burn 180 degrees around Kerbin from the moon\u0027s location. However, the moon will be revolving around Kerbin, so rather than placing your apoapsis near where the moon \u003Cstrong\u003Eis,\u003C/strong\u003E you need to place it near where the moon \u003Cstrong\u003Ewill be\u003C/strong\u003E after you make your ascent. This requires finding the period of your transfer orbit, and determining how far the moon will travel during this time. Then you must travel the same number of degrees past 180 before making your injection burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne final note is that your orbit around Kerbin should be in the same direction as the moon\u0027s orbit. This sounds obvious, but the reason this is important is because it results in a lower velocity relative to the moon when you complete your transfer, since you and the moon are going in the same direction around Kerbin. It is certainly possible to do it the opposite way, but it will require more delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny comments?

You\u0027d think having multiple orbital objects to rendezvous with would be the logical next step...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, the standard way to get there is to boost into a low holding orbit and then perform a normal Hohmann Transfer to get there. That\u0027s not all, though... since you want to get there in one hop (rather than just get to the same altitude and then have to wait several agonizingly-long orbits to sync up), you have to time it right so that your apokee will be approximately where the moon will be \u003Cem\u003Ewhen you get there\u003C/em\u003E. The first time I did a lunar transfer in Orbiter, I just sorta wung it in terms of timing, and surprisingly enough I found myself on a collision course with the moon. I still don\u0027t know how much of it I can attribute to skill or just dumb luck. 8)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, if you manage to perform your burn at a reasonable moment, you will find yourself approaching the moon on a (relative) hyperbolic escape trajectory. Odds are, you\u0027ll need to make a mid-course correction so that your trajectory comes close to the moon without hitting it; this can be done by simply turning perpendicular to your (moon-relative) flight path and burning in that direction for the proper length of time. Orbiter has instrumentation that makes this easy; KSP does not at the moment. Thus, most of you will swing wide or crash until you get the hang of it (best to err on the side of swinging wide, unless you\u0027re just going for a direct descent). From there, you simply wait till perilune, then burn retrograde until you\u0027re in a nice, low lunar orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, I\u0027ll let you figure out the rest.
