I guess to quickly state, when I first found out about the mod, I liked the idea of Kethane allowing you to scan the surface with proper polar configured satellites and with the addition of RemoteTech2, such gave a purpose to the construction of satellite missions for me. (I personally have been playing KSP since grade 9 and after a good three years have never really got into career mode or any long term meaningful missions either due to concentration on other things or having some other ideals for additional gameplay mechanics.) Number one, the thought of ever being able to go far enough with a Kerbal civilization as to have completely depleted all remaining Kethane resources intrigued me and gave me the same \u0027literary fascination effect\u0027 when I first read about that Eternal War thread where someone managed to run a Civ 2 game for more than 10 years. I\u0027d guess that some people wouldn\u0027t like having to always move around so much, but maybe if each reservoir took a similar amount of time as it would take to exhaust a real world oil reserve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMy ideals on resource systems: \u003C/strong\u003EApart from that, the main concerns that made me look towards resource implementing mods on KSP was my endeavors on developing a large set of rules through which to manage the economy and resource extraction projects of a full fledged Kerbal Civilization. Basically one thing I felt that was hindering my creativity or drive in the production of KSP rocket designs was the lack of a meaningful purpose for myself. As in as always for the most part independent of actual rocket launches and the time spent during missions people don\u0027t really tend to seem to care so much about where the time goes for a \u0027virtual rocket design team\u0027 to produce plans. As in yes the emphasis is on immediate satisfaction for your Kerbal execution needs but what about that small niche of folks looking deeper into realism? So parts of my ideas were finding my own ways independent of me having to program my own mods (more due to laziness because I have indeed taken grade 11 and 12 computer science for Java) to implement things like the training of design personnel, enlistment of ground geologists and performances of ground surveys for securing logistical resource pathways necessary prior to even being able to launch your first satellite. As in what if aside from the desire to enjoy the harder parts of resource extraction were mixed with a set of game mechanics that didn\u0027t limit resource extraction to MKS TAC-LS survival and mere interplanetary refueling but also gave in the added challenge of actually having to spend all the money and Kerbal labour for mining/refining enough metal and going through all the stages to produce just one rocket? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELimitations on implementing it myself: \u003C/strong\u003ESo pretty much what I see in the present game and mod ideals is mostly the notion of a pure \u003Cem\u003Espace program\u003C/em\u003E that operates under a government and after that all things that happen behind the scenes like management of resource transportation routes and organization of various materials processing and manufacturing companies is \u0027intentionally\u0027 ignored for the sake of the more common niche and we merely slap onto these rockets fixed product costs excluding the ridiculous quantities of logistics operations that would actually be required under realistic circumstances. Of course I am aware of the whole notion of far fetched realism demands and the computational complexity of things like actually simulating cities as both abstract and physical models in KSP but this comes as introduction to my concerns associated with an idea whose realization as a \u0027separate full fledged mod\u0027 would otherwise be delayed as long as I continue postponing securing some better resources on KSP modding to give me the same degrees of freedom and design complexity I can happily achieve with Java.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow I was planning to do it (\u0027very condensed\u0027): \u003C/strong\u003ESooo, despite that little rant I merely used it to eventually introduce the basis for this whole idea of a gameplay I\u0027m trying to achieve where basically using stock mechanics and mods like MKS plus Kethane, RemoteTech2, TAC-LS, KAS and Ferram I would start off by setting up a colony of Kerbal individuals with extra stats and traits I will record and \u0027process\u0027 either on paper or on a separate Java application of my own implementation. And in this colony you would begin by setting up a self sustaining MKS ground base near KSC, some administration mediated by the Kerbal Civilizations gameplay rule set I am developing as well as a Kethane or mined fuel based currency system where you literally \u0027spend\u0027 money or conduct resource transactions limiting the construction of your next launch at a financial land-situated \u0027burning facility\u0027. We use free fuel to mine \u0027not so free\u0027 fuel, but what if in some alternative mode fuel was never free? Hence some of the stages a player wanting to experience a \u0027hard mode\u0027 for would have to go to is starting off running a surface colony and establishing funds to commence the first land solar powered resource surveys. Then after finding some close by but not so abundant resources using logistic chains they could fund fuel for faster spaceplane surveying that could eventually lead to have the resources for your first rocket launch. Imagine what pride a KSP masochist could muster up in having had had to have gone through all that abstracted administration, resource harvesting and logistics operations just to launch their civilization\u0027s first orbital survey satellite? So some extent as per my game mechanics ideals economy, resource logistics, administration and infrastructure should verily precede the launching of any space vessel. Land surveys and then satellite surveys for the sake of cartography or large scale geological resource survey. But I bet man was able to locate an oil well a good time before we were even able to hit the air.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat Kethane and stock resources both sacrifice: \u003C/strong\u003EPretty much as per that, my first attempt at testing some of these Kerbal Civilizations gameplay features involved flying for long periods of time a spaceplane equipped with a Kethane scanner hoping to find at least one deposit on the local continent. This is where I hit the first limitations of Kethanes on my \u0027niche gameplay\u0027 as it is: discreet and perhaps mostly randomized resource deposits. Or when the prospect of long term land surveying expeditions start becoming more irksome. From this I liked the idea of Karbonite or stock mechanics allowing you to mine virtually anywhere but with limited efficiency and concentration as if different areas all have the resource but in ways possessing varying difficulty and magnitude of extraction. But despite Karbonite and stock resource system for the most part giving me the resource mechanics I would have really hoped for, it basically ended up removing the features I wanted to keep from Kethane (this could be negated if an only if I were to find a way to use SCANsat appropriately for my \u0027realistic scanning\u0027 needs and if from what I\u0027ve heard surface scanners for people who just want to be useful geologists didn\u0027t depend on filling the space requirement.).

Once I realized polar scanning was instant I was a bit disappointed because there was less reward for the effort expended than I expected, but it made a certain kind of sense, because really, all you\u0027re doing is finding out what the general concentration is in a biome. What you are \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E doing with the high level orbital scanner is getting any sort of spatially accurate information. The overlay you get from this is essentially a starter kit at this point. If I\u0027d had my druthers, I\u0027d wish the requirement would be for the probe to complete one polar orbit, or at least an animation, but whatevs. Not a terribly big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I figured all that out, my next intuitive assumption was that since there was no sort of accurate map with the orbital scanner, that job would then fall to the narrow band scanner. Now that you got some extremely generalized information, you\u0027d narrow things down a bit, and your orbital overlay would turn more into a map, which would require you to get into a proper scanning orbit and do some very simplistic, but at least some sort of analogue to reality legwork. \u003Cstrong\u003EHere is where my biggest confusion and immersion break came from.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is there no usable, discoverable, viewable detailed map?

Get a narrow band scanner in a close realistic scanning orbit, and get a slowly revealing map. (Once you have the general and the specific, then you have the happy medium complete picture.

This is also why more advanced plkayers are still free to download a more sophisticated mod and either never use the stock parts again, or outright delete them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-15T00:43:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trogdor!\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trogdor!\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am very late to this party, but as a person who\u0027s both dumped 600 hours into this game \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E has yet to install a single mod (I like to play the game the devs intended), I did have some confusion on how mining, scanning, and resources worked.\u003Cp\u003EI understand roverdude\u0027s reasoning and explanation, and they make a certain amount of sense. Usually in this game I try and experiment with things as intuitively as possible, and the whole scanning process is a bit less intuitive than I\u0027d have liked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had assumed, starting out, that I\u0027d have to figure out some kind of scanning orbit, and eventually I\u0027d get a whole map of the planet. Once I realized polar scanning was instant I was a bit disappointed because there was less reward for the effort expended than I expected, but it made a certain kind of sense, because really, all you\u0027re doing is finding out what the general concentration is in a biome. What you are \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E doing with the high level orbital scanner is getting any sort of spatially accurate information. The overlay you get from this is essentially a starter kit at this point. If I\u0027d had my druthers, I\u0027d wish the requirement would be for the probe to complete one polar orbit, or at least an animation, but whatevs. Not a terribly big deal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I figured all that out, my next intuitive assumption was that since there was no sort of accurate map with the orbital scanner, that job would then fall to the narrow band scanner. Now that you got some extremely generalized information, you\u0027d narrow things down a bit, and your orbital overlay would turn more into a map, which would require you to get into a proper scanning orbit and do some very simplistic, but at least some sort of analogue to reality legwork. \u003Cstrong\u003EHere is where my biggest confusion and immersion break came from.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is there no usable, discoverable, viewable detailed map? Without it, finding the perfect mining spot is very frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter some searching at this point, I found out that in order to get some detail to the little gui window, you had to land and take samples. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis makes proper intuitive sense\u003C/strong\u003E once you realize what the surface scanner\u0027s job is. Getting more and more accurate information should take more and more work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat still bugs the crap out of me though, is after you do all this work to drill down to the most accurate information you can get, \u003Cstrong\u003Eyou have no way to save your work\u003C/strong\u003E. Which rewards all your effort with a slap in the face. This is worse than nothing.\u003Cem\u003E Your effort/reward ratio at this point is negative.\u003C/em\u003E Your GUI window is all you really have, and you just constantly throw that data away. No space program worth their salt would ever just trash useful data. It\u0027s not like storing data is hard. Just ask nasa.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe progression I would personally like to see with resource scanning goes something like this\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 1. Get into a polar orbit, run the scanner for exactly 1 orbit. (this gives you an extremely basic idea of what\u0027s out there because you\u0027re zoomed all the way out) (small reward for decent effort, but that\u0027s fine because it\u0027s the first step on the journey.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 2. Get a surface scanner on the ground to get biome information (this gives you a much better idea of where stuff is, but you still got work to do, because your zoom level is way too close,)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStep 3. Get a narrow band scanner in a close realistic scanning orbit, and get a slowly revealing map. (Once you have the general and the specific, then you have the happy medium complete picture. This also gives you the bonus of your polar satellite not being a single use craft with very small reward for all the effort it takes to get it there, \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E it teaches us plebs about actual satellite scanning mechanics in the real world. Most effort/Highest reward)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize roverdude wrote his own resource mod and wants people to use it, and as much poorly articulated crap as he\u0027s received in this thread he may have already made up his mind and dug his heels in on this, but this is a non-modder\u0027s take on stock game gameplay. I don\u0027t have all the preconceived notions of how a certain thing should be because it was like x in y mod. My preconceived notions are all based on what happens in real science, and I think my proposed progression would both make more intuitive sense, and be more rewarding gameplay wise. Half the fun of KSP is learning all the things you didn\u0027t know about rocket science. Yes, I realize this game oversimplifies \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E about space exploration, but it should at least not be the opposite of reality.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy take on the scanning system is that it\u0027s a great start, but it needs some tweaking to make it more fun/rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s rather crude, but you can just have a Kerbal plant a flag on all the richest deposits of ore you find. Still, it\u0027s kinda disappointing that the flag you use as a monument of your greatest achievements, are also used as mundane ore markers. Maybe just a simple flashing beacon that engineers can place would be more appropriate?
