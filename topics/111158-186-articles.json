After that I found that I could no longer just paste an image URL directly into a post (it now shows up as a clickable link rather than the image), as I\u0027d done in the past. Now I have to use the \u0022Insert image from URL\u0022 button, which takes an extra couple of clicks for each image.\n\nIt\u0027s a bit of a coincidence that the behaviour changed when I switch OS, but as I\u0027m using the same browser (Firefox), I\u0027d be surprised if that made the difference.
