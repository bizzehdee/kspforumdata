Of particular note in the guide is a set of tables that set practical guidelines for things like \u0022maximum take-off weight number of engines\u0022, \u0022kN SAS per tonne take-off weight\u0022 and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, with 0.25 there\u0027s a bunch of new fandangled features, including a bunch of new spaceplane parts. What I\u0027d like to know is how the new parts compare to the old ones. You know, something like \u0022how many Ram Air Intakes equal one Shock Air Intake\u0022, or \u0022how many Delta Wings can I replace on my old design with one of the new Swept Back wings\u0022, or \u0022are any of the elevon parts actually any better than Small Control Surfaces\u0022, that sort of thing. Is there an already existing guide like this that I\u0027ve simply missed in my searches? Does anybody have any experiences with these parts back when they were still part of the Spaceplane\u002B mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help here would be appreciated.

Generally you\u0027ll find yourself needing less wings than you normally would if you choose to use those parts.
