I don\u0027t see any errors caused by RemoteTech. There are a couple of errors in ISA MapSat and MechJeb, but nothing that should cause lag. I think it\u0027s an issue with your pc being a bit too slow to handle the amount of data it calculates when you have \u0022list comsats\u0022 open. As I previously said, it does a lot of computations to determine which satellites you can contact. That\u0027s going to be streamlined quite a bit in the next version of RemoteTech. I\u0027ve actually just implemented multithreaded relay network calculations, so I\u0027ll just merge the contact calculations into the same thread and throttle them down to only running once per second in stead of the ~60 times per second it is now, which in retrospect might be overdoing it a bit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022herzeleid22\u0022 data-cite=\u0022herzeleid22\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHi guys just a quick one, could be a bug or something wrong with my system.

If you want the satellite to have MechJeb you can just add the MechJeb PartModule. And the same thing is true for all stock sensors. I\u0027m unsure if ISA MapSat has converted to PartModules though and lights of course won\u0027t work unless the part has a light source, which it doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022dishycourier\u0022 data-cite=\u0022dishycourier\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESAS might be a bit too powerful, though.

All of the probes did lose contact, and any probe using dishes had them fold up (probably applies to extendable antennas too), however, I was able to use short range antennas to re-establish contact with those probes, since everything I launch has them anyway. Now, the one caveat I noticed is that even once you\u0027re in communication range, you still need to manually load/control the probe in order for it to restore its connection and show up in the RemoteTech comsat list. Once you do that, just go back to the tracking station and you should be set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain though. None of that is recommended by JDP, but since you\u0027re going to lose your save anyway, it may be worth a shot.
