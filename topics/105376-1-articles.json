Your launchers are toast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my brief testing, it made the launch of a vehicle that was ok getting into orbit more difficult. The vehicle\u0027s TWR of the core is very low and thus needs the SRBs to get going. Without VIspR, the core would burn off enough fuel to have a usable TWR when the SRBs burn out. With VIspR, even at full throttle, the core has not burned off enough fuel to have a good TWR when the SRBs burn out. The rocket flipped its way to 16km, stabilized then limped its way to 26km where the core was dropped for the next stage. It then struggled to (60 degree pitch) to maintain altitude while accelerating and lost 80% of its heatshield ablator on the way up. It did get to orbit, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shoe7ess","CreatedById":114974,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T22:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf this makes launching seemingly harder based on your description/testing, what are the pros besides restoring Vac ISP.
