Classical thermodynamics already prevents going to absolute zero. And the difference that QM makes is in what state it corresponds to. As mentioned above, 0K is minimal internal energy. Absolute ground state. Classically, it would mean zero kinetic energy. No motion. But in QM, Pauli Exclusion means that only a few particles can take such low energy state. This results in considerable kinetic energy still present in ground state. But temperature is still 0K, because it has more to do with energy distribution than amount.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECalling any of it a jitter is very imprecise. There is no randomness to it. 0K is a very well defined state.
