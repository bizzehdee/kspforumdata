If your rover has enough punch, it can return to the orbit as well.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stuff for the lander tends to make the rover topheavy. Rovers drive better when they\u0027re dedicated to just roving and therefore have a low profile without a lot of stuff up on top. A detachable/reattachable rover allows you to leave all the heavy fuel and engine for returning to orbit behind while the rover drives around without it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThreeMartiniLaunch","CreatedById":62595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T21:36:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my solution:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://misanthropia.com/images/KSP/Touch%20Down.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Touch%20Down.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://misanthropia.com/images/KSP/Getting%20to%20Work.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Getting%20to%20Work.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T21:53:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThreeMartiniLaunch\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThreeMartiniLaunch\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://misanthropia.com/images/KSP/Getting%20to%20Work.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Getting%20to%20Work.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow how on earth do you steer that thing without rolling it over. so narrow....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThreeMartiniLaunch","CreatedById":62595,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-06T22:10:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Steven Mading\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWow how on earth do you steer that thing without rolling it over. so narrow....\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELots of negative camber.
