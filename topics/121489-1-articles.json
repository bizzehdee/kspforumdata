Right now, Jool\u0027s atmosphere (among others) produces way too much heat way too early, resulting in parts exploding from skin temperature spikes - even heat shields cannot ablate fast enough to mitigate the high influx of thermal energy into a skin with nearly no thermal mass to receive it with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is being looked at for 1.1, but until then, you\u0027re better off finding ways to brake out of interplanetary transfers than aerobraking, as Red Iron Crown suggested.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T14:39:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the heatproof cheat or do a gravitational capture. To set up a gravitational capture place a manoeuvre on your way to Jool, and trade prograde/retrograde and radial/antiradial which lets you adjust your time of arrival at Jool while keeping your Jool periapsis the same. Cross the orbit of Tylo or Laythe when they\u0027re in the right place and there\u0027s your encounter for a potential capture. I always advise Precise Node for any gravity assist work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xebx","CreatedById":150598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T15:21:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELaythe aerobraking is the way to go, your velocity is lower (not the 9000 m/s).

I\u0027ve done it successfully, but you need a properly designed craft and you have to hit the correct periapsis altitude within a couple hundred meters. Being off just a little bit and you\u0027ll explode. The spacecraft needs a low ballistic coefficient, i.e. low mass per unit area of heat shield. I think it\u0027s virtually impossible to aerocapture a large massive vehicle, but it can be done with a small probe equipped with an oversized heat shield, such as a 2.5m shield on a small 1.25m probe. Finding the correct periapsis altitude will likely require experimentation, which means it will take a save and several reloads until you get it right. For the one time I did it successfully, the conditions were: spacecraft mass at entry = 2915 kg, heat shield size = 2.5m, entry velocity = 9783 m/s, and periapsis altitude = 196,200 m \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1200 m. It\u0027s probably easier just to use a different method as described above by others.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Farex","CreatedById":126838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T16:46:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@cantab\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo cheating\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@Topic\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell then, off we go to get a flyby with tylo and laythe.

Jool aerocapture is something I\u0027d been wanting to experiment in 1.04. So far, everything I\u0027ve tried has failed with explosiveness. Setting up the gravity assists I personally find to be tedious and boring sometimes unless I\u0027m just in the mood to experiment with them. Most of the time for most of my missions I\u0027d just rather use Jool for my brake to get me into position for the target moon. I like the idea of making Jool similar to Jupiter as far as how the aero-heating model should work, but the way things are now from what little I\u0027ve read about Jupiter, it seems that Jool aero-capture is way to difficult and the atmospheric model needs to be tweaked. That being said, I personally wouldn\u0027t consider it cheating or lazy if I have to adjust difficulty settings to offset a broken or flawed game mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JedTech","CreatedById":104003,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-23T21:47:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a good thing they made it harder to aerobreak at other planets.
