The issue what to and how to add in the stock game. Putting enough in the game without it requiring a high tier computer to run at medium settings. Even more so I hope that it leaves enough room for the possibility of a lot of mods, even providing its own \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E interface.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother random thought:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a lot of popular older mods that can only be revisited through beta versions due to the modder moving on with life, I hope Private Division offers monthly prizes for \u201CMod of the Month\u201D and higher prizes for \u201CMod of the Year.\u201D Modder\u2019s of KSP would receive very little other than recognition and fame from creating very popular mods, hopefully the game helps create a yearning to keep a mod compatible with updates.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xd the great","CreatedById":188222,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-04-25T13:47:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, mods are vital to the success of KSP, and will be very important in KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know about the details, but developers, please make KSP2 mod friendly.
