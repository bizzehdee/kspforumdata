Because in recent years we\u0027ve suddenly seen an explosion of many countries getting independent access ( space race much ) and the USAF having their own unmanned space drone for military use. I\u0027m starting to think that space will end up being weaponized, in my opinion space should be a place without military activity a place for exploration etc. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently India revealed their space program and stated that it was made by using money that England gives to the country ( was in the papers I was highly annoyed ). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what upsets me the most is my countries lack of activity to go into space ( apart from satellites but to me that doesn\u0027t count it\u0027s needed for communications tv etc ) I was watching a documentary about one mans passion for space travel where barely in his teens he created his first small scale rocket ( like the model rockets you can get but it wasn\u0027t a kit he made everything from scratch ) well anyway he came up with this idea in like the early 80s for a single stage to orbit engine well he got government funding for the whole vehicle but after awhile the UK government gave up funding then slapped the classified sticker on the side of it.
