Download a Unity 4 Version, I am using version 4.2.2f1. To make a collision mesh in Unity, just select your mesh in Unity, and on the right you will see an \u0022Add Component\u0022 Button, click that, go to Physics and add a mesh collider, in the mesh collider component you want to tick the \u0022convex\u0022 thing, so that the part can collide with others.
