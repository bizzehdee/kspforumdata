There\u0027s quite a bit of engine lighting on launch vehicles from the engines IRL, especially at night. It might even make night launches worth it. In conjunction with clouds, it could change the color of the clouds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, some engine FX have colors that aren\u0027t quite right. I\u0027d suggest you take a page from HotRockets and make the Mainsail, LV-T45, LV-T30 all have orange/yellow colored exhaust. Additionally, I think that the KR-1 x2 LFB\u0027s engine effects should be orange/yellow while the KS-25x4 Cluster\u0027s engines should produce a soft, clear, blue flame.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"King Arthur","CreatedById":73849,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T14:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure the color of rocket exhaust depends on what they\u0027re burning. I always presumed (and liked the idea of) that the LV-T30/T45/909 and the Poodle/Skipper/Mainsail burned a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen mix which produces that purple-bluish exhaust kind of similar to the SSMEs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelsteele3","CreatedById":127113,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T15:43:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESeems like it\u0027s easy to implant. \u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-03T18:41:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eas you say, this combined with clouds would be a great visual improvement. \u002B1 from me.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
