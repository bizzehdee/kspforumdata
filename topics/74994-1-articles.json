First of all, how does gimbal work for the stock parts? I\u0027ve tried adding my nozzle model to the thustTranform in unity, adding it sperately under the thrustTransform, having my nozzle be the thrustTransform, and keeping it under the model it originally was attached to, but all to no avail. With each of these models, I\u0027ve tried to mimic referencing the nozzle in the part.cfg file the same way that the game does it, but I have had no luck. Hopefully somebody on the forums can help me with this, or tell me \u0027m just being stupid. Also, i\u0027m happy to send screenshots or give more information as to my problem if that is required.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"blackheart612","CreatedById":42741,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-14T13:23:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGimbal is ranged in the part config (how far the engine gimbals) but to actually make the nozzle move if you are turning the rocket, the nozzle mesh should be under the thrustTransform and it should be pointed to the correct direction (was it the blue one on unity, iirc, it is).
