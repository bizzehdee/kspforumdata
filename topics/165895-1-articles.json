If you want to make changes to the plugin, you need to learn and use that language\u00A0in conjunction with a Unity install and compile yourself a custom version of the DLL.

Just hire a bunch of ponies and then go and rename them. If you absolutely have to have them show up in the astronaut complex with their proper names already, then you have to edit the plugin in order to tweak the crew name generator input.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTextures are shipped separately, and are not part of the plugin. You can find them in the folder structure of the mod download as simple .png files. If you overwrite those files with textures you painted yourself, then the mod will load them and it will just work. If you\u0027re unsure how to paint the textures, just take the existing ones and paint over them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-09-27T09:13:55Z\u0022 title=\u002209/27/2017 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krakatoa","CreatedById":175313,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-09-28T01:53:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe dll uses the names to reference the models and textures, which is why you can have any Kerbal and name it one of the supported\u00A0characters in the cfg and all the traits will automatically change to that\u00A0character. I think by the way it works that it would have trouble with custom names. happy_monk responded after a bit when I reached out with a bug, so if you wanted to help create new models, he may very well be up to adding them in.\u00A0 Running out of models is why others haven\u0027t been added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
