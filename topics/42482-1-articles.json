Maybe for the career mode have it to where you can\u0027t see any of the planets. You would then need to build a Telescope to search for the planets (Have a hot or cold feature showing if you\u0027re close to finding one and then show a black ball or the planets orbital path). You would then need to send a Probe/Satellite/Kerbal to map the planet and send back data to kerbal. That data would be used the map the surface/temp/weather/or any life. Maybe if a kerbal is out on Eeloo and wants to transmit data back to kerbal. He would be too far to transmit that data so he would have to relay that data to a satellite orbiting dres to get it back. Maybe i\u0027m asking to much....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boomerdog2000","CreatedById":57643,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T19:06:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemotetech does a fairly good job with transmitting information back to kerbin but it only affects probes. Manned mission don\u0027t need ground contact. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the concept of planet discovery maybe you would have to build a telescope either at ksp or in orbit and it would reveal the orbits of a few planets close to kerbin (maybe the inner planets and duna)but they would be the black balls like you said until you send a probe to them. Then you could build a stronger telescope to reveal the farther planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rckydog606","CreatedById":78917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T19:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve not played around with the probes or satellites that much (only one that\u0027s orbiting around kerbal) I figured they didn\u0027t do anything yet.

Also using probes to map the surfaces of planets would be nice. I\u0027ve also thought about having to discover the planets before you can see them on the map.

Let\u0027s just hope they add orbital telescope parts as well, to improve the knowledge-base before actually sending probes to those planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey also had shown some work in progress images of scanners that you\u0027d use to scan for resources from orbit.
