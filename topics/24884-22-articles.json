CO2 works, but it will run out like anything else as it\u0027s recycled and leaks from the system, etc. Maybe their\u0027s some carbon on Mun, but the best supply would be Duna.

However, for stock missions, the criticism that it\u0027s \u0027different air\u0027 is still valid because it\u0027s simply another extra item or recycler you have to carry even if the kill checks are different. A realistic life support mod is only interesting when it\u0027s combined with a supporting resource mod. If you have to mine each resource using different location and methods and convert it through different steps, now you have a supply chain.\u003Cp\u003EConsider what happens if you have food and water and oxygen requirements with recyclers to extend your supply, but still a real need for new supplies. Minmus should have plenty of water-ice, which can also make oxygen. However, for food, you need carbon. CO2 works, but it will run out like anything else as it\u0027s recycled and leaks from the system, etc. Maybe their\u0027s some carbon on Mun, but the best supply would be Duna. So now you have a need for an interplanetary supply network.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s the concept for my current mod. I\u0027m going to add the resources to Kethane as well as Ioncross. I\u0027ve worked out real-world consumption, masses, and densities and translated that into KSP equivalents. I\u0027ve even worked out real-world/KSP numbers for the hydroponics bay. If you interested in exchanging resource calculations or merging projects, send me a private message. I actually started alpha testing the Ioncross portion last night.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hadn\u0027t realized it before, but that pretty much sums up why I haven\u0027t been overly keen on actually implementing food and water requirements as an option. If though as Morden96 suggests, there was a way to separate the resources so they are handled differently it might be worthwhile. At this point what I would really like is a way to collect ice from polar craters where there is no sunlight and to produce food where there is sunlight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fraz86\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Fraz86\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t think time is the issue.

All I do is call the crew\u0027s Die() functions to kill them, and what should happens is their pictures get replaced by static with \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CK.I.A.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 over top. This only stays until you leave the vessel and then come back when the picture is removed.
