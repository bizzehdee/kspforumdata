I know I immediately thought of the community the minute these came back into my vision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAkin\u0027s Laws of Spacecraft Design*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it\u0027s a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. (Miller\u0027s Law) Three points determine a curve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. (Mar\u0027s Law) Everything is linear if plotted log-log with a fat magic marker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12. There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13. Design is based on requirements. There\u0027s no justification for designing something one bit \u0022better\u0022 than the requirements dictate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14. (Edison\u0027s Law) \u0022Better\u0022 is the enemy of \u0022good\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15. (Shea\u0027s Law) The ability to improve a design occurs primarily at the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present their analysis as yours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to the likelihood of its being correct.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E18. Past experience is excellent for providing a reality check. Too much reality can doom an otherwise worthwhile design, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E19. The odds are greatly against you being immensely smarter than everyone else in the field. If your analysis says your terminal velocity is twice the speed of light, you may have invented warp drive, but the chances are a lot better that you\u0027ve screwed up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E21. (Larrabee\u0027s Law) Half of everything you hear in a classroom is crap. Education is figuring out which half is which.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E22. When in doubt, document. (Documentation requirements will reach a maximum shortly after the termination of a program.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E24. It\u0027s called a \u0022Work Breakdown Structure\u0022 because the Work remaining will grow until you have a Breakdown, unless you enforce some Structure on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E25. (Bowden\u0027s Law) Following a testing failure, it\u0027s always possible to refine the analysis to show that you really had negative margins all along.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E26. (Montemerlo\u0027s Law) Don\u0027t do nuthin\u0027 dumb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E27. (Varsi\u0027s Law) Schedules only move in one direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E28. (Ranger\u0027s Law) There ain\u0027t no such thing as a free launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E29. (von Tiesenhausen\u0027s Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E30. (von Tiesenhausen\u0027s Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial artist\u0027s concept.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E31. (Mo\u0027s Law of Evolutionary Development) You can\u0027t get to the moon by climbing successively taller trees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E32. (Atkin\u0027s Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working perfectly, the really important visitors don\u0027t show up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E33. Space is a completely unforgiving environment. If you screw up the engineering, somebody dies (and there\u0027s no partial credit because most of the analysis was right...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I\u0027ve been involved in spacecraft and space systems design and development for my entire career, including teaching the senior-level capstone spacecraft design course, for ten years at MIT and now at the University of Maryland for more than a decade. These are some bits of wisdom that I have gleaned during that time, some by picking up on the experience of others, but mostly by screwing up myself. I originally wrote these up and handed them out to my senior design class, as a strong hint on how best to survive my design experience. Months later, I get a phone call from a friend in California complimenting me on the Laws, which he saw on a \u0022joke-of-the-day\u0022 listserve. Since then, I\u0027m aware of half a dozen sites around the world that present various editions of the Laws, and even one site which has converted them to the Laws of Certified Public Accounting. (Don\u0027t ask...) Anyone is welcome to link to these, use them, post them, send me suggestions of additional laws, but I do maintain that this is the canonical set of Akin\u0027s Laws...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T22:05:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you for sharing!

I prefer the 1982 edition, which was written for military-aerospace engineers, over the one currently in print which is dumbed down and pointed at a more generalist business-layman sort of audience. It\u0027s freaking hilarious yet utterly serious at the same time, because every rule is backed up by actual statistics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E3. Law of Apocalyptic Costing\u003C/strong\u003E: \u0022Ninety percent of the time things will turn out worse than you expect. The other ten percent of the time you had no right to expect so much.\u0022 (Demonstrates the percentage of programs that overrun their budgets, and produces a formula for determining how much more budget you need to avoid an overrun -- in general, multiply your budget by two and a half).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E7. Law of Insatiable Appetites:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022The last 10 percent of the performance sought generates one third of the cost and two-thirds of the problems.\u0022 (This holds for baseball players, optical lenses, airplanes, diamonds and machined parts.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E9. Final Law of Economic Disarmament AKA First Law of Impending Doom: \u003C/strong\u003E\u0022In the year 2054, the entire [uS] defense budget will purchase just one tactical aircraft. This aircraft will have to be shared by the Air Force and Navy 3 1/2 days each per week except for leap year, when it will be made available to the Marines for the extra day.\u0022 (When trends for the national budget and the unit cost of aircraft are compared, they eventually intersect. Keep on going and the entire military might of the US, and then the planet will be concentrated into one vehicle by 2200 or so -- this is how we get that Death Star people were asking the White House for.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E10. Law of Undiminished Expectations:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022It is very expensive to achieve high degrees of unreliability. It is not uncommon to increase the cost of an item by a factor of ten for each factor of ten degradation accomplished.\u0022 (The cost of an item is inversely proportional to its reliablity -- the more expensive it is, the quicker it breaks and the longer it takes to repair. This leads to:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E11. Augustine-Morrison Law of Unidirectional Flight:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0022Aircraft flight in the 21st century will always be in a westerly direction, preferably supersonic, to provide the additional hours needed each day to maintain all the broken parts.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOthers point out that the trend of adding electronics is so high that eventually there will be no airplane crashes OR takeoffs because the entire aircraft will be electronic. Cost will continue to rise, however, because of the trend of adding software, which is expensive yet weighs nothing. The cheaper and simpler the system, the more testing it requires, and this is directly proportional -- The amount of money spent on one or two spaceflights, after which the craft is declared operational, is pretty close to the thousands and thousands of shoulder-fired rockets that have to be fired before \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E system is declared operational. Technical manuals and government contracts are getting longer and longer, to the point where the paperwork for some aircraft exceeds their takeoff weight. The weapons that have the greatest impact on the enemy are the simplest and lowest-costing. And so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention that the more expensive the overall vehicle, the cheaper the element at the initial point of failure -- like the anti-radiation missile that kept going off course when a tiny warning sticker was peeled off by the windshear and fell into the radar fuse.
