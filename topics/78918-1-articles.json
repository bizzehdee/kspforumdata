If you do this, you must ensure the destruction of the first lander. We suspect that whatever is on Mun has the ability to transmute inert compounds into fuel, although nobody has yet witnessed this (and lived to tell about it). Therefore, we cannot leave anything behind on the surface that is likely to be used to leave by anything other than a Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(\u003Cem\u003EChallengers\u0027 Note: I\u0027ll be running through this on my .23.5 installation since I have a 7-man capsule there which I\u0027ll be using.
