I tried to deliver one of the radiator trusses via Buran using the shuttle arm and it was impossible, the whole rig just shook itself to pieces, even if I used slow movements. I think the issue is the spring in the joints of the arms as well as the attachment point. heavy masses, when manipulated just caus the arm to stretch and warp around from it\u0027s normal position rather than moving the payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking the payload maneuverable via null physics is one option that would work. you could effectively make the payload massless, so moving it creates no torque, until the arm id detached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know when working with payloads in space this kind of thing has to be accounted for but I think the limitation is in the simulation engine not the parts themselves.

I\u0027m really impressed by this project, and I\u0027m wondering if I could be a part of it. I have some pretty good Blender skills, but I\u0027m not a programmer. I had downloaded this mod along with the robot arms and soviet pack and I found that it had some issues, so I figured I would see what I can do to help. It\u0027s funny, since I had the exact same idea for fixing the arm (it really is quite useless) that involved disabling physics on grabbed objects. So, yeah. I\u0027m a huge ISS fanatic so I am pretty knowledgable about it, and since I can use blender I was thinking I might help. If anything, I could work on modeling the interiors, although I\u0027m not so good at texturing. I\u0027m not experienced with modding, so it would be great if someone could help me with the scaling/model detail stuff. I really look forward to being able to complete this thing in orbit! Let me know if there is anything I can do. By the way, I don\u0027t know if anyone had mentioned this, but NASA has published an EXTREMELY detailed model of the ISS online. It\u0027s in a proprietary format (lightwave I think) so there are some conversion issues with blender, but if nothing else they could make great 3d reference.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T22:32:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you think you could make a version of CANADARM2 running on Infernal Robotics? It could also power the MBS, since it\u0027s a pretty flexible mod. This and the lack of Rassvet is the most pressing issue with the ISS right now. The other missing modules are under construction by Yogui and will soon be finished, so there\u0027s no point doubling his work. I suppose we could also use an S5/P5 truss section, it\u0027s an adapter for S6. Currently, the only way to attach S6/P6 is via a \u0022floating\u0022 docking port, which looks out of place.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-16T01:43:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Razorcane\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Razorcane\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI just thought of something. Even if we make a new Canadarm, it will still have the same problems that romfarer\u0027s do. KSP physics don\u0027t account for RPM, so any non-linear movement causes the spacecraft to turn. It\u0027s really quite problematic.
