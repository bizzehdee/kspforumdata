Yes, this is possible - I\u0027ll use here an example of Paradox Development, who are using this solution for a long time. According to the game dev:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EEvery time you start making a new game, you begin with a design where you try to imagine the best game you can make. Then you make a plan and start working on it, making tweaks and changes to the plan as you go along (first contact with the enemy and all that). As you get nearer to completion, the number and scale of the changes you can make gets smaller; it all becomes about making sure the features you actually put in the game work, so you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t risk doing anything too large.\u003Cp\u003EHowever, as you get nearer and nearer a complete game, you get more and more time to play something that is actually the complete game. As you get better at the game, you start to come up with ideas - new ideas that will completely change the balance of the game, ideas that would probable break everything if you put them in on the week of release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis has made it so that it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s actually more fun to work on a released game. \u003Cstrong\u003EIf used to be more fun at the start of the project, when everything was possible, but when you can continuously play the game, you can come up with things you want to improve and then do them. Some of the new stuff ends up in a paid-for expansion and some of the stuff comes in free patches (often the patch that accompanies a major expansion could be a mini-expansion in itself\u003C/strong\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes the lines between what should be a paid feature and what should be a free feature becomes a little blurred, but \u003Cstrong\u003Ewe try to operate on the principle that as long as people keep having more and more fun with the game without expansions they will keep playing and hopefully buy enough expansions so that we can keep working on our games for years to come.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESource: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?746634-Europa-Universalis-IV-Conquest-of-Paradise-Dev-Diary-%96-Random-free-stuff\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?746634-Europa-Universalis-IV-Conquest-of-Paradise-Dev-Diary-%96-Random-free-stuff\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last sentence is the most important one. Basically this approach in KSP would look more or less like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Squad finishes KSP (let\u0027s say it\u0027s 1.00 version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Some patches are released (1.00 -\u0026gt; let\u0027s say 1.06)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meantime, Squad is working on a, for example, Interstellar DLC. But not all of the new features will be included in the next DLC - in fact a good chunk of them will be realeasd for free. So the day of the release comes and:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Interstellar DLC is released with the patch 1.10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u0026gt; content from the patch is free: for instance some new parts, new animations, more tweakables, bugfixes and one new capsule\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u0026gt; contet from the DLC is paid and includes bigger featurs like another solar system and antimatter drive than enables to reach it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EIn the en Squad is happy because they earn more money (DLC) and community is happy too, because devs care about us and not only continue to fix the game but also give us some goodies for free (patch)\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is just an example and the proportions between patch and DLC may be different - for instance it\u0027s easy to imagine that free patch adds new solar system but only DLC enables higher time warps and new engine which makes it easy to get there. So even only with patch you\u0027ll be able to go there but it\u0027ll take A LOT of time and truly gigantic rockets - it would be much easier to just buy the DLC and enjoy all the goodies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see, the DLCs aren\u0027t anything bad by themselves. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis solution (DLC\u002Bpatch) works for Paradox for years and I see no reason why it couldn\u0027t work for the Squad and for us, players.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you wish to discuss this topic, please be rational and don\u0027t turn it into a flamewar.
