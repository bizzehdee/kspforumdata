Still KSP 1.0 has got a pleasant atmosphere. XCOM 2 has mostly got growling prey and a nasty atmosphere of danger to it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Daddy\u0027s here ...\u0022: In the XCOM 2 story a character appears in \u0022intel\u0022 with darkened face and slow voice saying \u0022Heelloooo ... Commander!\u0022 like a daddy figure you have to please/show what you can do! The story of KSP is more like a historical based re-simulation of the US space-program from the first step and then travelling to the moon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP would probably not be so exciting if there weren\u0027t the high probabilities\u00A0of explosions and crashing to puzzle with. And in XCOM 2 it is probably neither the logic of defeating enemies that excites, but more the sounds to it; because the characters can shoot through roofs and throw grenades with 100% accuracy while guns are less accurate and dependant on \u0022perks\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill KSP tries to simulate real gravity and atmosphere mechanics, which can be wonders until discovered that\u0027s what makes the game. XCOM 2 simulates troubling aliens in ugly forms. Perhaps ugliness is the game developers way of telling those aliens are no more than animal vermin. But ugliness would not exist at all if humans didn\u0027t have need for food and procreation, because the looks of things is how the human body tells/gets a taste - good/bad, want/dangerous. It is subjective and it changes that way, because as soon as the body is feed up of a certain food item or person, it grows a dislike, which is illogic since the same target previously was defined otherwise and really hasn\u0027t changed. So objectively \u0022ugliness\u0022 doesn\u0027t exists!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is no conclusion to XCOM 2 vs KSP 1.0 because that is also a subjective matter, something which is really true to some \u0022brains\u0022 but not to others. So if you happen to very much like XCOM 2 \u0022intel daddy\u0022 figure, don\u0027t let it trouble you if somebody gets a big laugh of it, since it is purely a subjective matter!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketBlam","CreatedById":103420,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-20T12:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI own \u0022XCOM: Enemy Unknown\u0022 and the Kerbal Space Program, both on Steam.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have 37 hours playing XCOM.

Define does, in this context, mean to state the meaning of a word. In this case the word is wave, as in sound waves, and a reasonable definition would be the one you linked; \u0022a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through medium\u0022. In the specific case of sound waves we are talking about compression waves travelling through a medium like the air. In space there is no medium in which sound waves could travel. It doesn\u0027t matter if you are travelling quickly or slowly. Sure, many movies are silly and unrealistic and you can hear a Tie fighter as it whooshes by but that\u0027s just Hollywood nonsense. \u0022In space, no one can hear you scream.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, there would be sound \u003Cem\u003Ewithin your space vehicle\u003C/em\u003E. The structure of and atmosphere in the vehicle would conduct sound just fine. It is just that it still wouldn\u0027t matter how quickly or slowly you were going, the compression waves would be travelling within the moving vehicle. Short version; you\u0027d hear the engines because they\u0027re shaking the ship and the air in the ship \u003Cem\u003Ejust like sitting in a car and hearing the engine\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I still don\u0027t understand is why you put \u0022waves\u0022 in quotes, repeatedly. Quotes like that suggest an ironic usage or dubiousness, like if I were to call it rap \u0022music\u0022 I would be suggesting that it\u0027s not actually music. See also modern \u0022art\u0022, etc. So I don\u0027t see how or why you felt that sound waves should be scare-quoted like that.
