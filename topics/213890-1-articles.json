I had a fair amount of fun with it as well as a couple of headaches, which is understandable during early access period. However, just as a lot of other players, I have a feeling that this is a bit of\u00A0\u003Cem\u003EToo\u003C/em\u003E-Early-Access Release considering the amount of problems troubling the game right now (as of 28.02.2023).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere has been a lot of complaints over the state of the game, some more fair than others. Combined with a very high price tag for EA (240 PLN ~ $54 !!! here in Poland) it doesn\u0027t surprise that a very low number of copies have been sold during the first days. It does raise some sad concerns whether the game\u0027s development will continue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my opinion, the first update will be the most crucial step towards either forging KSP 2 into an ultimate-space-simulator or... let\u0027s stay positive for now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe that, provided the update fixes at least 1/3 of the current problems, the game will attract more KSP 1 veterans, and with following updates adding newer features even some new players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFingers crossed for the first update!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T13:01:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything hinges on the first year.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe publicity will turn around when the game turns around.
