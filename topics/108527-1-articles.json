I think the final stage, attached with a very small item (48-7S?) / node to the stack decoupler and FL-800 tank below it, could be too small / too weak to remain solid, against for the forces being applied to it. As soon as you drift off prograde, drag is probably causing the top part to bend at that small node connection. If you have access to struts, it needs those. If you don\u0027t, see what other engine or part you can use to keep all center stack nodes the same size / strength.

I tuned the thrust on the boosters down to 50.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - The center of mass shifts quite close to the center of lift as the boosters approach empty (easier to flip!).

You could double the length of the central column (add another FLT800) and still have a plenty-good-enough TWR. This will also move your payload further away from the stabilizers, keeping the CoM closer to the front. You could also swap in SRB\u0027s for booster columns to save some cash. You\u0027d probably need to thrust limit them somewhat, and you\u0027d still be launching with only ~25% throttle or less, then ramp it up to 100 when the boosters stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks like sewerbird ninja\u0027d most of this while I was typing my post.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T03:18:14Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 03:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by allmhuran\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T03:15:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI tip my hat to sewerbird - nice work.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
