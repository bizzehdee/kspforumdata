However, this variant uses the aircraft engines now available since 0.15 to reduce weight and fuel consumption - no longer do we need to light the rocket engines until around 10-12k. Unfortunately doing this has made the rocket slightly more complicated to fly - it is suggested that you disable the auto staging feature of mechjeb when using this ship, and instead, manually stage it. Specifically, it is important that around 12k when you start losing velocity that you ignite the rocket engines, and wait until the efficiency level of the jet engines has reached 0.00 before decoupling them. Otherwise they will most likely crash into the ship, or otherwise cause an explosion that will most likely destroy the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother important note, I\\\u0027ve noticed in 0.15.1 and .2 so far, that loading a ship which has landing legs deployed from persistence will tend to cause that ship to be damaged, destroyed, flipped over, or otherwise. So I redesigned this ship to support landing on its legs, and then retracting them so it could be placed on engines for saving to the persistence file. The quad tiny engines have the same thrust/weight/efficiency ratio of the larger engine I used on previous designs, while having about an eighth more thrust available total. Another advantage is that it\\\u0027s much more easy to tell how much fuel remains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing I forgot to mention, I\\\u0027m interested to hear from anyone how the legs perform. I rejiggered their placement on this ship so that they\\\u0027re less likely to rub against eachother, but I haven\\\u0027t done much testing. I\\\u0027d appreciate any feedback on how they perform, and suggestions on placement assuming they need to be moved again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
