I don\u0027t know quite yet why it\u0027s happening, but I\u0027m rewriting how/when vessels get removed from the list. The new way makes a bit more sense, assuming it works properly. It\u0027s currently untested and may not add the vessel back to the list upon reverting now that I think about it. (just tested, that is in fact true. I may have to not do it that way then)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe null reference occurs with the old versions in 0.23.5, so I\u0027m inclined to think that is unrelated and is due to the fact that you can timewarp in the space center now. Still no clue what the cause of it is though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk. Fixed the issue. It was due to an if statement I had to include in order to do the timewarping in the space center and tracking station. The following \u0022else if\u0022 statements were detached from the if statement I had meant them to go with. Had to do a little bit of rearranging. Derp. I\u0027ll upload a fix in a minute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Fix should be available now. 0.23.5 also adds the ability to display the date in Kerbin days/years. I may try to tie into that for my day display in the future so if you use Kerbin days then it will list times with 6 hour days and if you use 24 hour days this will display with 24 hour days. I\u0027m not sure how to access that yet, but I figured I\u0027d mention it in case anyone was interested \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: Ok, apparently accessing the game settings is really easy. I don\u0027t know if you guys have preference of how to implement the time thing but I currently see two predominant ways:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I just use the setting that the game uses. If you use 6 hour days, so do I. If you don\u0027t I don\u0027t either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The default of the Use6HourDays setting is whatever you have it set to when the config file is generated. If you change the KSP setting later, you will have to change the setting in this too. This allows you to have \u0022mixed mode\u0022 though where you can have one using 6 hours and one using 24.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-02T03:50:48Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2014 03:50  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by magico13\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T05:42:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magico13\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magico13\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn honor of the release of the ARM pack, aka 23.5, here is an updated release!

Booster recovery happens whenever the booster (or anything actually) is sub-orbital and gets destroyed by being on rails in atmosphere with enough parachutes to land safely (less than 10 m/s). Anything recovered this way or through normal recovery gets added to the inventory and when used has an effective cost of 1/100 when calculating the total time. As a result, reusable craft have minimal time. The more you reuse, the better. For the case of a shuttle with some parts not recovered, the first time will take a while, the second time will take much less (though still over a day most likely). The more parts get used, the faster they are in the future, EXCEPT when being used from the inventory. Then they always have an effective cost of 1/100. I may make a change later to include the part tracker in the part inventory calculation so that it isn\u0027t fixed. I also need to rework the timing eventually to find something more balanced. The next version has much finer time controls for the user (allowing the user to alter the overall time, the part tracker effect, and the inventory effect. Including disabling these features)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for reentry heating, I am considering adding a condition if deadly reentry is installed so that they can\u0027t be recovered if they would have burned up. It will be really hand wavy though, since the actual heating won\u0027t have been calculated. It\u0027ll be like, if it\u0027s moving more than 1 km/s when destroyed and doesn\u0027t have shielding, it isn\u0027t recovered, or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also planning on reorganizing the part inventory so you can browse it by category, like Propulsion or Utility or Science, just like the KSP categories.

I moved build time controls to a new file, KCT_TimeSettings.txt, which currently contains three settings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverallMultiplier = 1 : The same functionality as BuildTimeModifier. All it does is take the calculated time and multiply it by this number\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBuildEffect = 1 : This controls the effect that subsequent builds has on a part\u0027s effective cost. Setting it higher than 1 means that subsequent builds will reduce the cost more, setting it less will lessen the effect (it could take multiple builds before a time decrease is noticed). Setting it to 0 will disable subsequent builds having an effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInventoryEffect = 100 : This alters the effect of using inventory parts on a part\u0027s effective cost. Setting it above 100 will decrease the cost more, setting it below 100 will decrease the effect. Setting it to 1 will cause the inventory to have no effect at all.
