Id be more inclined to make a group with a few friends than join a massive group effort, because then you get more playtime with good buddies.

The group creator (moderator) can require you to add mission details before you are able to download the game save, and then when you submit the new game save you can post a mission debriefing which will get saved forever. So as a group goes through the queue an ongoing mission log will build up, serving as a history of accomplishments for the entire group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it\u0027s your turn you will have (x hours, set by the moderator) to download the file before you get bumped by the next person in the queue, and you will have (x hours) to submit the new game save before you get skipped. If that happens, you will not be able to upload your game save as the next person is already playing the game save. The group creator/moderator can grant extension requests so if you need more time you can ask for more time and avoid being skipped and having to throw out your hard work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of you should know this, but the file to be uploaded will have to be the entire game save directory. If you upload just the persistence file then the next person to play the game save will have the game auto-deleting all the ships.
