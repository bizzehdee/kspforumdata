It\u0027s a VTOL! It\u0027s small! It\u0027s cute! It\u0027s... well... it\u0027s... see for yourself. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n~~~\n\nCute Mecha Dinosaur!\n\n~~~\n\nThis tiny mechanical creature has loads of gimmicks. It can stand on its two hind feet, which was difficult enough to achieve. It has solar-panel \u0027wings\u0027 for a bit extra power (though the tail, made of RTGs, provides plenty of power as-is). It can VTOL and land safely with the help of some parachutes. Best of all, it looks nice and is rather part-light (79 parts).\n\nI\u0027m sure you want to see some pictures... so here we go.\n\n**Pictures!**\n\n![zFzcjyS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/zFzcjyS.jpg)\n\n*Here\u0027s the creature on the ground. Note the big eyes and the solar-panel wings.*\n\n![NP8IvZD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/NP8IvZD.jpg)\n\n*Taking to the skies! RCS tanks give this craft close to a minute of flight time - not too impressive for a regular VTOL, but pretty neat for a dinosaur.*\n\n![jvSgGVd.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/jvSgGVd.jpg)\n\n*...and it\u0027s landed on the SPH after an uneventful journey.*\n\n~~~\n\n**Video!**\n\nGive it a watch!\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRCeGJ_wcCs?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n~~~\n\n**Specs and Features!** \n\nPart Count: **79** (reasonable)\n\nMass: **2.3t** (also reasonable)\n\nSize: **4.7x4.5x4.4m** (can fit within a Mk3 cargo bay)\n\nElectric Charge: **605** (very high)\n\nMonopropellant: **240** (reasonable)\n\nFlight Time at Full Throttle: **0:29** (low-ish)\n\nFlight Time at ~1 TWR: **0:50** (a bit better)\n\n~~~\n\nDocking Port: Check!\n\nEmergency Safety Parachutes: Check!\n\nReasonable Handling: Check!\n\nLight-Up Eyes: Check!\n\nSolar Panel Wings: Check!\n\nAdorableness: Well, I don\u0027t even have to answer this one.\n\n~~~\n\n.craft file:\n\n[HERE!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/a792v8wf27b1jn2/Cute%20Widdle%20Dino.craft?dl=0)\n\nIt *only* costs 183,420 roots.
