As a result, I started using Robin Kerman for everything and Bill/Bob/Jeb for nothing.

He was the pilot of the successful manned flights of Icarus program, a series of spaceships designed to try to get \u0022in space near\u0022 Kerbol. It finished after he brought a manned spaceship which had the heavier (Goo, science Jr) science equipment near Kerbol and then back to Kerbin, but I have used him occasionally since then.

He and Bilory always man the science lab in non-test flights. Also works for NSA and is always watching you.

First Kerbal to leave Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Ran out of electricity. 30 years later (During which I did tons of other stuff), I sent up a probe with a klaw to bring him back. Next, he gets sent on a mission to Jool (Along with Neillie, Bilory, and Lomy. Also Robin, but Robin\u0027s ship was separate). While I was focusing on another ship, Laythe (I think) gravity assisted his ship and shot it out of Kerbolar Orbit. It took 50 years (During which I max-timewarped and left KSP running in the background) but ultimately he and the others made it back to Kerbin unharmed. (Robin, the one who was flying around to all the moons, made it back to Kerbin in a much shorter time).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther Kerbals I occasionally use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other scientists whose names I forget - Several Kerbals with no stupidity, they accompany Jeb on test flights with a science lab.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJengan Kerman - I used him once on a flight where one ship broke up into 9, because I needed 9 pilots.
