Heck, Minmus\u0027 gravity is so low that if Fersen got out of the rocket and used his EVA pack to fly upwards, it could get him home without a ship. (Landing on Kerbin might be a problem, of course, but you could always meet him in orbit with another ship.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne question: where\u0027s your RCS? You\u0027ve got a monoprop fuel tank, but I don\u0027t see any jets. The easy way to get home from someplace like this is to use the rocket to get away from Minmus, then separate to where your final stage is just the capsule, RCS, and parachute, then use RCS to fly home with the H key. But even without that, you\u0027ve definitely got more than enough capacity to get back to Kerbin easily. The re-entry might be a bit rough, since you don\u0027t have any separators to remove the weight of the fuel tank from your parachute, but that\u0027ll likely just break the link between the capsule and the things below it once the chute deploys.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SoldierHair","CreatedById":62167,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T22:30:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell i had some small tanks on sides that had mounted nuclear engines.When i reached 1500m they runned out of fuel (i didn\u0027t used the middle engine untill i got under 10 000m).I didn\u0027t thinked too much when i mounted the RCS , they where on THAT tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spatzimaus","CreatedById":57215,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-08T22:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SoldierHair\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SoldierHair\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E they where on THAT tanks.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured it was something like that. If you\u0027d had some RCS on the monoprop tank, and a separator below that tank, then it\u0027d be trivial to get back to Kerbin. Heck, if you had that, you could probably get this thing back to Kerbin from DUNA at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut regardless, you should have no problem returning from Minmus with the vessel you have. It\u0027s an extremely low-gravity moon, so it takes very little energy to escape. Not quite Gilly levels of low gravity, but still really easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ComradeGoat","CreatedById":59041,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T00:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is making me nostalgic for Minmus.
