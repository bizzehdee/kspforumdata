I\u0027ve been playing it for over a week and it\u0027s been fine. Today I launched the same save file and the icons for different mods and stats are working weirdly. When clicking the icons/buttons, that are in the right bottom corner of the screen when you\u0027re on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E screen, the whole game just minimizes. It happens both with mod icons, such as TAC LS, Remotetech, Alarm Clock and others (happens to all of them), and non-mod icons such as active contracts, messages and informational icons in the tracking station screen that show the information about a planet for example. The game is in 1920x1080 fullscreen and switching to windowed mode fixes the issue, but obviously I\u0027d really like to keep playing in fullscreen, so I\u0027d really appreciate your help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI already tried verifying integrity of game files through steam. It says around 43 files are corrupted and restores them but the issue still remains after this and running the verification again\u00A0and gives the same \u002243 files are corrupted\u0022 message.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
