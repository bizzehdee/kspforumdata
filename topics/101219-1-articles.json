It chose not to maintain the folder structure in the zip file, ignoring the top-level NehemiahInc folder and instead installing all of the sub folders directly into Gamedata. When KSP tried loading the experiments, it was attempting to clone a model with a absolute path of /NehemiahInc/... which of course, failed.\n\nI can only assume it did so to support it\u0027s conflict resolution; If you have multiple part.cfg files, for instance, how else could you tell if they conflicted other that by the path, which would need to assume that they would all have roughly the same depth. (Well, I guess you could look inside the .cfgs for various keys. would be easier if there was versioning info in there. I guess that\u0027s what CKAN is doing with metadata. Now I\u0027m way off on a tangent)\n\nRegardless, I was able to override this behavior in KSP MOD Admin by overriding the automatic destination of the NehemiahInc folder (right click, set destination, Gamedata).
