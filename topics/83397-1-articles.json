Vehicles use a centralized physics system, so you do not have to be a genius to build something that will fly, but it can certainly help when designing a specialized vehicle meant for more than moving from point A to point B.

While most things do not require a large base, several things are required to allow a player to build vehicles, turn resources into parts, and create life support.

This will mainly be done by launching a station core into orbit, and then sending up supplies to build with in orbit. Stations in orbit work differently then piloted ships in orbit. Piloted ships and any other floating junk orbits freely with physics. Players however can put their station on \u0022soft rails\u0022 which is a system that keeps a station on a fixed orbit so long as nothing messes with it. Imagine if the ISS had a very fancy autopilot system that would fire thrusters to keep that station on a very specific orbit. So long as it has the fuel, does not receive damage to the systems that keep it on track, or does not get pushed off its orbit, then it will stay there. This system can also be used to keep stations in orbit at less than orbital velocities, it will use a lot more fuel, but is possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Greenfire32\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Greenfire32\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI absolutely love the look of this.\u003Cp\u003EThread=subscribed\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to hear you like it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Franklin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Franklin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs an [obvious] KSP fan the game clearly draws a lot of design influence from it, so I\u0027m interested, but I \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E hope the game weighs more heavily on the trials and tribulations of design nuance, rather than resource grinding and repetitive battle.\u003Cp\u003ESo many of these kinds of games focus on quick-building, easy-piloting building elements to try and rush you into the meat of the game which is invariably combat that, once you\u0027ve got a few hours under your belt, starts feeling repetitive (*cough* Robocraft).
