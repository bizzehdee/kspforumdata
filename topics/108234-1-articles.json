You have to repair this in Blender\n\nIn the Edit/Object mode, edit window (right panel), under shanding, with multitexture set, there is a box called \n\n[ ] backface culling\n\nClick this and you and see the facings. Once this is set the faces that are suppose to be facing out on the surface will disappear.\n\nOnce you identify these on the right side panel select Shanding/UV under Normals, you can flip the direction.\n\nIt is a good idea to identify the mis-faced faces early in the construction process, because expanding mis-faces by \n\n-Extruding\n\n-Subdividing\n\n-Duplicating\n\n-Loop cut and slide\n\nWill also duplicate the misdirections."},{"CreatedByName":"touzenesmy","CreatedById":119464,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T18:54:38Z","Content":"Thanks a LOT man !!\n\nDidn\u0027t find right side panel select Shanding/UV under Normals but I did a \u0022rotate\u0022 by 180\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 on each face at it worked\n\nEDIT: didn\u0027t work well, googled flip normal, found it, and really, THANK YOU MAN ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T19:12:38Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 07:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by touzenesmy**"}]}
