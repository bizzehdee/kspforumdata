You will have to extend your stages radially rather than vertically. You can add at most one LFE\u002B one LFT from the bottom of radially coupled SRBs. You can extend the rocket by sticking more SRBs to the new LFTs or radially to existing SRBs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnly stock parts are allowed for either version 0.8.5 or 0.9 experimental.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExample: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/m00qC.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/m00qC.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwcaster","CreatedById":3248,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-08-16T01:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s my attempt. It\u0027s a slideshow until the last two stages, so there\u0027s enough SAS on it to ensure that it tracks true vertically until I can have a chance to control it.
