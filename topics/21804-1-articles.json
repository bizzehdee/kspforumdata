(all my parts look funky) and it looks just like the texture but in a colored scale, is it done with a design software? :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell as you can see , i have no idea what the normal map is, how it works, or how to do one, so any help would be nice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"orson","CreatedById":31453,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T19:42:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell a few ways you can do it , if its quite a basic pattern your doing then its easy enough to do manually .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout going too far into into it , lots of tutorials about .. it works by greyscale images initially , white is the highest and scaling down to black as lowest , then you can use either the Gimp plugin (i dont know if it is still supported , looks legit)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://registry.gimp.org/node/69\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://registry.gimp.org/node/69\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe photoshop/nvidia one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://developer.nvidia.com/content/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://developer.nvidia.com/content/nvidia-texture-tools-adobe-photoshop\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sava","CreatedById":45826,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T20:47:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince you\u0027re just starting modeling I wouldn\u0027t worry about normal maps too much because they are non-essential to make and ksp has a bug related to normal maps anyways. As simple as I can put it if you\u0027re into physics a \u0022normal vector\u0022 is a line perpendicular to a surface. What a normal map does is trick the computer into thinking that the normals of a model are more complex then they really are making the lighting react differently then if it did not have a normal map. If you\u0027re completely new to computer graphics i wouldn\u0027t worry about this at all as you pick this stuff up as you go.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Martonaut","CreatedById":26366,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-09T23:08:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ety for the replays, Now I understand them a bit more \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E and the tools are nice aswell, I probably will let them for the last, since my textures and models need more work before trying to figure out better lightning for them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
