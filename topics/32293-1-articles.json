When they inevitably intercepted some old episodes of I Love Lucy coming across the interstellar medium while having a fish in their ear (it\u0027s more likely than you think with Kerbals), they were immediately enamored and developed the ability to decode the video and audio signals. Kerbals never had a written language before that, having not needed one, but seeing the old serials changed all that.
