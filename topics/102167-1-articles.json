One newton of thrust will change the velocity of a one kilogram object by one m/s in one second. One kilonewton (kN) of thrust changes the velocity of a one ton object by one m/s in one second.\n\nSo: if you have a 300t ship with a single LV-N engine (60kN thrust), it takes 5 seconds (300t/60kN) to add 1 m/s to your velocity. If your burn requires a change in velocity (delta V) of about 900 m/s, then (ignoring the change in mass as fuel depletes), this burn will take 900m/s \\* 5s/(m/s) = 4500s, or 75 minutes. \n\nSo-- how much delta V do you need for your burn, and how much does your ship mass?"},{"CreatedByName":"seyss","CreatedById":137952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T21:48:49Z","Content":"Info from Kerbal Flight Engineer:\n\nDelta-V needed: 2069.86 m/s\n\nShip mass: 38,708 / 74,683 kg (why there are 2 values?)\n\nEdit: I have 2 LV-N engines.\n\nI\u0027m sure the calculation will give me a very long burn, so it means I\u0027ll have to start my burn earlier than 112.04\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA ?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T21:52:03Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 09:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by seyss**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryxal","CreatedById":102688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T22:09:45Z","Content":"I\u0027d suggest at least dropping a node to plan the burn, and likely splitting the burn.
