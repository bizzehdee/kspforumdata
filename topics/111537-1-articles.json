The supplied ship has enough fuel on board to do the burn to get you to Mun, and also to burn retrograde when you get there to establish an orbit.

I found that with a correctly positioned manoeuvre node, with the prograde handle pulled out far enough to get a good Mun intercept, the indicated burn was less than 800 m/s. If yours is showing a lot more than that, then you need to juggle the manoeuvre node to give you a more favourable burn.
