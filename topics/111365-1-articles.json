I have some panels on the top of a deployable blimp part, but I cant get the raycast object to orient itself properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that when using an object as the suncatcher, it will use its Z\u002B axis to search out the sun, and that normally wouldnt be a problem. I orientated the suncatcher object so the Z\u002B axis faces the same direction as the solar panels in Unity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, when I bring it into the game, it keeps its orientation in the VAB/SPH, but resets itself when launching. I have tried this with objects created within Unity, and within Maya. In all cases the object just resets itself to 0,0,0 rotation, and I only ever get solar charge from the front of the part instead of the top. Rotating the entire object doesnt seem to work either. If anyone can tell me why this happens, and any way to fix it I would be very grateful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dgvVpW7BtEw/VWmfSEr_PdI/AAAAAAAAD1c/QAB0gvOc_hI/s1600/111.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022111.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"raidernick","CreatedById":97711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:17:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESet the rotation in Unity for the part, not your 3d modeler. Also even though you may think it takes the rotation of the suncatcher transform for what part catches the sun, you\u0027d be wrong. It takes whatever you have the pivot set as for which part needs to face the sun. Make sure you have the pivot object/transform facing the same way the suncatcher is.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
