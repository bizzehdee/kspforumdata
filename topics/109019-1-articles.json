Used a heatshield but it was 1.25m whereas that thing was 2.5m. Tried very hard to catch it exact center with the klaw. Done several aerobraking passes (starting with Pe = 50 km) diving deeper with each pass. Finally I decided not to drop the engine with the remaining fuel but burn it retrograde on the final pass. Worked surprisingly well (considering the 1.0.2 reentry heating is laughable). When the fuel burnt out I dropped the engine and exposed the heat shield (apparently there was no need for it whatsoever). The only bad thing that happened is that I landed on the mountain slope and broke the \u0027prototype\u0027. Luckily F9 helped and I decided to splashdown instead.
