See picture below.\n\nthe backshields are for balancing, i think they can be replaced by air brakes although, like this, is more robust.\n\nNote. The Tortuga shield consists of 2 vessels, one in front with a claw and a shield and one in back, for stabilization, with a claw and a cluster of shields. The back part of it attaches to one end of the cargo to be recovered, while the front part attaches to the other. The back part holds the engine for reentry burn and the parachutes.\n\n![?view=att\u0026th=14d57e15db7ad600\u0026attid=0.1\u0026disp=emb\u0026realattid=ii_14d57e039004fbfa\u0026zw\u0026atsh=1](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/s/?view=att\u0026th=14d57e15db7ad600\u0026attid=0.1\u0026disp=emb\u0026realattid=ii_14d57e039004fbfa\u0026zw\u0026atsh=1)\n\nDuring reentry, with big rocket attached and back shields stabilizing\n\n![?view=att\u0026th=14d57e15db7ad600\u0026attid=0.2\u0026disp=emb\u0026realattid=ii_14d57e10f7998924\u0026zw\u0026atsh=1](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/s/?view=att\u0026th=14d57e15db7ad600\u0026attid=0.2\u0026disp=emb\u0026realattid=ii_14d57e10f7998924\u0026zw\u0026atsh=1)\n\nOnly issue with this design...

Used a heatshield but it was 1.25m whereas that thing was 2.5m. Tried very hard to catch it exact center with the klaw. Done several aerobraking passes (starting with Pe = 50 km) diving deeper with each pass. Finally I decided not to drop the engine with the remaining fuel but burn it retrograde on the final pass. Worked surprisingly well (considering the 1.0.2 reentry heating is laughable). When the fuel burnt out I dropped the engine and exposed the heat shield (apparently there was no need for it whatsoever). The only bad thing that happened is that I landed on the mountain slope and broke the \u0027prototype\u0027. Luckily F9 helped and I decided to splashdown instead. Contract complete."}]}
