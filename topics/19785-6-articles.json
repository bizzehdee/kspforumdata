I have been working on the next update to the module in preparation for MrPwner\u0027s contribution to the project but I don\u0027t have an ETA for its release yet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have also added a \u0022hard-core\u0022 mode that will allow command pods with the heat shield attached to behave as a lifting body, like the Apollo capsules did. The mode can be enabled by setting a flag to \u0022true\u0022 in the heat shield\u0027s part.cfg file. Doing so gives the capsule a 10-15 degree angle of attack and a lift-to-drag ratio of about 0.3 during the supersonic phase of re-entry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried a few re-entries with the \u0022hard-core\u0022 mode\u0027s lift effect enabled and it is kind of neat. I\u0027ve found that it tends to reduce re-entry g\u0027s but increases heating due to longer term exposure to high temperatures. I even managed to get a slight skip during one re-entry! That result will probably require that slightly steeper trajectories be used when the \u0022hard-core\u0022 mode is active.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally, I tested the current version (v1.0.17.03) of the re-entry heat module in Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/B1rmT.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B1rmT.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt worked as I expected it would but the entry was actually pretty benign\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 Even though I flew a hyperbolic trajectory to entry, the atmosphere relative entry velocity was only about 1500 m/s. The peak shock temperature wasn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t much to write home about as a result of Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s cold atmosphere and the low entry speed. As a result, I now tend to agree with Togfox that I should leave the physics model alone and not set custom constants specific to Duna\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s atmosphere. I would have to set the heat transfer coefficient and gamma significantly higher before Duna atmospheric entry would even approach the severity of Kerbin atmospheric entry.
