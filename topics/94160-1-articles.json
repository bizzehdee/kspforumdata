Landers are built light and boxy with an emphasis on low COG\u0027s, lightweight parts, and plenty of good places to attach the gizmos they\u0027ll need on the surface. Nasa doesn\u0027t like trying to keep a 2.5m round, 12 m high lander from tipping over anymore than we do. These parts don\u0027t match the stock parts in terms of volume of fuel in volume of space... justify it by saying that lander parts are built lighter than launcher tanks and such... or... just don\u0027t worry about it! KSP is a game and the scale of things doesn\u0027t work out perfectly in it, but I think these parts are a good balance of realism/fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s what\u0027s currently in the pack:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 2.5m, 3 man lander can .

Maybe not! There are a lot of good rocket parts out there and that\u0027s sort of scope creep from the idea of LANDER parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I say ascent and descent stages in the part descriptions... there\u0027s no reason they can\u0027t be combined in a lot of other ways or used as single stages, etc. It\u0027s just easier to describe them in Apollo lander style stacks. Ascent stages are a little smaller than descent stages. Ascent stages will have built in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. Descent stages will make certain to have places to attach landing gear.

I\u0027ll eventually release a docking port for the top of the pod that allows you to see through the top windows for visual approach to docking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese images are from the first development version.

I like the worn industrial yellow look for an established colony. It makes a good contrast to the surface of the Mun or Minmus so if a ship goes down it\u0027s easier to spot. I do see the apeal of a stock like color scheme though. Most spacecraft are white or shades of gray to reflect sunlight (heat) and because it shows damage. If you did want an alternate texture pack it shouldn\u0027t involve much more than loading the color channel into an image editor, selecting all the yellow hue stuff and turning down the saturation to make it gray. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did have a couple of issues with the download linked in the first post though. It\u0027s refering to an IVA that wasn\u0027t in mine. This was causing problems for activating engines and going EVA would cause the space center to go all black and leave just the HUD intact. (navball, windows ect. By editing the 2.5m lander config to look for the stock 3 crew IVA (mk1-2) I got it working properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to fly pretty well around the spaceport, but the pod torque is a bit high. I find it a bit twitchy at the default of 9. It seems better tweaked down to about 5 on each axis. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a couple of design points that I\u0027d like to mention. First is the windows on the 2.5 m lander pod. They seem gigantic for a kerbal spacecraft. They\u0027re far larger than what you\u0027d see on a tour bus. It seems like the sort of thing you\u0027d see on the command tower overlooking a Mun base not on a light weight lander. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would think on a research lander with 3 crew the pilot would be watching the ground below and ahead, the co-pilot would be watching flight instruments and calling speed and altitude and the commander/flight engineer would be watching system status and navigation. Mostly they don\u0027t have time to look out these huge panoramic windows. Also, upward visibility wouldn\u0027t be a big deal since there\u0027s no other overhead traffic to watch for and most of docking with the command module is done with instruments. You might want to seriously think about shrinking or eliminating the overhead and side windows. They seem like a luxury for a research craft and they\u0027d cost a lot of mass and wall space that could be packed with science instruments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hate to criticize your work because I\u0027ve seen the work that goes into making something like this, but that\u0027s my opinion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other thing that seems a bit off is the landing gear. They function great and give a wide enough base to deal with some decent horizontal velcocity in testing. But in the raised position they seem to hang down a long ways. The engine of the lower stage is tucked into the base nice and tight. The entire lander is a small compact unit exceot for those 4 legs sticking out the bottom a half meter. What if you were to have them stow 180\u0027 from their current retracted position like the large stock gear. That way they\u0027d tuck in along the lander when retracted and still extend to the current postion. When landed they also seem to give a lot of ground clearance. This is great if you\u0027re mounting RCS tanks or GOO canisters on the bottom of the lander. You still have lots of ground clearance. If you don\u0027t mount stuff on the bottom it just looks like they tucked the engine into the lower stage for no real reason. You might want to consider a ring that attaches below the lower stage with lights, batteries KAS storage, ect to fill some of the ground clearance. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way, a great addition to your lander pack is the Universal storage mod and Dmagic Orbital Science that adds science modules in a universal storage format. The US octicore give plenty of room for science experiments and when they\u0027re all used you can either EVA and take the datapacks and take off in the upper stage to dock with the command module or transfer all fuel to the lower stage and return the entire lander to the orbiting station to refuel and reset experiment bays for another biome landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future addons to your pack how about landing lights? The stock lights seem so huge. Do you really need a spotlight the size of your pilots head? How about some nice trim little LED lights. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also wanted to mention your skycrane. A probe core with engines and fuel in one package is brilliant. It looks like it would be a perfect match for MKS. The same specs as the LV 909 split into a 4 engine package. And if you need more thrust you can always just rotate them 45\u0027 and stack them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you be willing to do another variation of it focused on orbital construction? It would be exactly the same but with a second set of engines facing the other way. You\u0027d select which group of engines are active with action groups and use it to move station modules into position. The module with the tug attached would be launched into orbit with a booster. Once in orbit the booster would seperate and the tug would use it\u0027s engines to rendezvous with the station and dock the module. Having engines facing in both directions means you don\u0027t need to keep turning end for end as you match velocity and you can save your RCS for final docking. The tug would then seperate and parachute to the surface for recovery. If you\u0027re using Extraplanetary Launchpads the tug could drive into a recycle bin and it\u0027s parts would be saved for future building.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there was any way to use an emmissive texture to indicate which engines were active that would be really cool. I normally use lights tied to the action groups I switch the engines with, but lights don\u0027t have on/off switching with action groups. You can toggle them, but that depends on them starting in the correct state when used as an indicator.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, as I said at the start, really nice mod pack you\u0027ve started here.

I should have several things ready for an update by tomorrow night, and I\u0027ll try to remember all the pieces then!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re very correct... the windows on the 2.5m pod are gratuitous... The smaller pod I\u0027m working on is much more \u0027real world\u0027 accurate. I think I\u0027m going to push ahead with it and then look at it all together and decide if the 2.5m pod needs to be more like the smaller pod... or if I like providing a slightly more \u0027sci-fi\u0027 pod as an option. For me, when I play in IVA, I still like a nice field of view. But you\u0027re very correct that landing a bunch of glass is unnecessary and expensive and unrealistic. I\u0027ll give it some thought. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn attachment ring underneath the lander is a great idea! I\u0027m already working on a full undercarriage with integrated legs... but WITHOUT the legs, it\u0027s just a lightweight truss ring with 4 attach nodes and extra room for surface attachments. It might be perfect for what you\u0027re suggesting, with a bit of scale tweaking. And I\u0027m eventually planning to include legs of both flavors - the ones that are in the download now, and some that fold up and away to stay clear of stack attachments below the engines. I\u0027m also working on some surface mount, almost fully retractable gear that could attach to the bottom of a lower stage instead of the sides, so they\u0027d be hidden by the bottom fairing during launch instead of sticking out the sides. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll look at Universal Storage tomorrow! That sounds like a great way to open up more gameplay options without me having to reinvent everything! I think US ties in with TAC life support as well, which was one of the other requests I want to try to get to... so it may be a two birds with one stone situation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELights are definitely in the plans for soon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a quick image of me playing with the still in progress Materials Bay, Goo Canister, Sample Return Crate, and Battery Unit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zN7ng9B.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022zN7ng9B.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not opposed to playing with a space tug, though it will be a while before I get around to it, as I want to focus on the landing parts for now. Have you looked at nli2work\u0027s tug in progress? The engines are mounted on arms that look articulated, but I don\u0027t know if they actually flip around or not? I\u0027ll post a question thread tomorrow trying to figure out if there\u0027s a way to use emissives to indicate an active engine without adding a plugin... it seems like something in the FX setup might be able to make this work... but I honestly haven\u0027t played with tweaking these much yet, so I\u0027ll have to dig in. Making engines with an \u0027active\u0027 light would be really useful in a lot of situations, it seems to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can\u0027t make it work that way, it might be easier to do animated engines that rotate based on an action group... which accomplishes the same goal functionally... Actually you could just animate the thrust transform... so you could make a \u0027double ended\u0027 engine bit where an action group would let you flip the thrust to come out the other nozzle... and that animation COULD also include an emissive bit! So that might be the way to do it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELong way of saying... I\u0027ll look into it... but I\u0027m guessing it will be next month before I get a chance to look at it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for so much feedback!

Sounds pretty cool and I\u0027ll keep watching for upgrades. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith respect to Tommygun\u0027s suggestion, the windows do look pretty clean compared to the rest of the texture and could stand a bit of grime. You\u0027d want to keep it subtle though. A spacecraft is a major asset and the windows not going to get too dirty before somebody takes a clean rag to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wouldn\u0027t change the color of them though. While transparent windows can be done in KSP, most people don\u0027t use them when they make models. They make the window a light bluish color like you did. If you were to change the window to shiny gold or black it would look less like glass and more like metal plates. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the same with lit windows. If people see a glowing square or circle and it\u0027s white or yellowish white they assume it\u0027s a window. If you make a glowey red or green shape people don\u0027t think it\u0027s a window with different interior lights, they think it\u0027s something else entirely. I\u0027d stick with accepted colors for any glass on the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI meant to mention a couple of things about your skycrane. It\u0027s not displaying the fuel bar or any icon in the staging. When used as a standalone ship there\u0027s no staging bar. If you right click on it to activate the engine it seems to fly well and with your landing legs it makes a nice little lander for science instruments. It\u0027s probably some minor config thing since all of your other engines seem to work well enough in staging. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering about an RCS pack for it though. I\u0027m thinking of a matching part about half the thickness as the 1.25m monopropellant tank with 4 linear thrusters built in. My reasoning is that if you put your skycrane on top of a tall base module like one of the MKS modules your COM will be quite a ways below your COT. Your payload acts as a pendulem preventing your from pitching or rolling enough to control your horizontal speed. Adding RCS thrusters gives you fine control of your horzontal speed while the main engines keep you airborn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA couple of mods that really help with skycrane flying are: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50736\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/50736\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85838\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/85838\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the tug, I am familiar with nli2work\u0027s tug and have downloaded it. I\u0027m getting pretty close to the limit of what my install can handle though so it hasn\u0027t made the trip from the download directory to the KSP install directory. Hopefully soon though. It makes me sad that there are so many cool mods I want to try and the 64 bit version that should free us from these memory issues doesn\u0027t work properly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe nice thing about yours is that it would only be one more part in the inventory. I was thinking that switchable fixed engines might be simpler and more future proof. As long as KSP doesn\u0027t change the way you activate engines with action groups future patches shouldn\u0027t affect your part. I was also thinking that rather than making a seperate robot tug with bidirectional engines you could just have a stripped down version of your engine mount. No fuel or probe core, just a 1.25m quad engine package. If you rotate it 45\u0027 and mount it on top of your skycrane it goes from being a quadcopter to an octacopter with twice the lift for heavy payloads. If you face the engine package the other way it goes from a skycrane to a robot tug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, something to keep in mind for the future. One question for you: Making this stuff takes quite a bit of time. Between the modeler and Unity and config files and testing in KSP, then having to fix problems, do you actually have time left to play KSP any more? Or is it just a big developer nightmare where all your game time is spent on it and the fans just keep asking for more? :^) (like me)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"artwhaley","CreatedById":118388,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-06T05:27:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that\u0027s the running joke between mod-makers.
