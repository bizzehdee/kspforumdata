Today I started KSP 1.1 and was quite irritated that it refused to start as usual but on my second monitor instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlaying around with some windows settings (that I did not touch beforehand) did not change that behavior. Testing other games told me its a KSP issue only. Starting KSP 1.2 again I was quite surprised that it started on the primary monitor. Finally I searched the registry,\u00A0having some hidden windows settings in mind, but instead I found\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022HKCU\\Software\\Squad\\Kerbal Space Program\\UnitySelectMonitor_somenumber = 0\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI then changed the value from 0 to 1. And that did the trick and switched KSP 1.1 back to primary monitor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then I noticed KSP 1.2 is now running on second monitor... How funny, both have exact opposite monitor preferences \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo clean things up I just renamed that registry key and tested again. Conclusion is KSP 1.1 did not have that registry property at all, it appears when KSP 1.2 is started first time. But when it is there also KSP 1.1 does his thing with it, which is just the opposite thing you\u0027d expect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust telling you in case someone else encounters this problem as well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
