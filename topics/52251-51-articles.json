I\u0027ve got what looks like plenty of delta-V for my main craft, and I\u0027m planning to add some extra fuel in the form of droptanks as well..but I\u0027ve never really made a multi-shot lander before except for Mun/minmus missions. And I\u0027m running the game stock, so I can\u0027t rely on engineering plugins to tell me if I\u0027ve got enough delta-V/TWR. Is there any sort of test I could do around the Kerbin system to ensure my designs are up to scratch?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4915761/KSPSCIENCE/screenshot476.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot476.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I\u0027ve got set up in orbit so far: ginormous transfer module (two of the biggest tanks in the game \u002B 6 NERVAs \u002B 6 SRBs for leaving kerbin SOI. The original no-SRB model failed due to an upside-down docking port), not so ginormous crew module (2 hitchhiker containers, 1 lab, bunch of RTGs, some RCS fuel \u002B parachutes for the lab module), 5 science modules (RTGs, all the science stuff except the nosecone and goo, which I\u0027ll launch up next time and dock to the existing modules. 4 modules are docked to the crew module, and the fifth is attached to the reserve docking port behind the engine array. Each module has a probe body and some RCS fuel so it can move between craft.), and the orbital tug for the crew module (since de-orbited). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn top that lot, I\u0027m planning a reserve fuel stage, with some drop tanks with seperatron-spam to let me eject tanks without them clipping the RTG arrays. Then the lander(s) will go at the front of the ship, so that the higher thrust engines can be used for an emergency braking burn if necessary. Partcount is starting to become a problem, but using the ultra-massive tanks has helped a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy flightplan is to do a direct burn to Jool from LKO, using the SRBs to punch out of the gravity well. At this point I will discover whether the seperatrons on the SRBs can be fired without killing the main transfer stage. Assuming that they can, I\u0027ll aerobrake at Jool, probably into Tylo orbit. Then I\u0027ll land one kerbal on each moon using either 1 or 2 landers (depending how much mass each one takes). The mothership will mostly avoid SOI changes where possible, since warping around the Jool system has historically caused my ships to get flung out into interstellar space. I\u0027ll use it to gather orbital science though. I\u0027ll probably go for a Tylo or Laythe landing first, then work my way out to the others in turn. Depending on fuel (since I don\u0027t know how much delta-V I\u0027ve actually got) I\u0027ll either burn straight out of Jool orbit, wait for a fuel tanker, or use a bunch of gravity-assists off Tylo, Laythe and Val to fling me out of the SOI and return to Kerbin. At that point, I\u0027ll see if I can get it into a nice stable orbit so I can extract the crew and science modules for return to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe science gear is redundant: I can either run with the \u0022store it in the lab\u0022 plan, or take each individual package back to Kerbin. I\u0027m also thinking about an addon to my lander that would allow me to swap out command pods for extra science points.

In order to get \u0022flying at Jool\u0022 reports, you need to have a \u0022sea-level\u0022 altitude of 120 Km or lower, and you need to be on a suborbital trajectory (a periapsis that is below 0 meters \u0022sea-level\u0022). Likewise, you also need a suborbital trajectory for \u0022upper atmosphere\u0022 reports as well. This means that the most efficient way to get both sets of reports is to dive down to 120 Km, wait until your trajectory is sub-orbital, gather the science, then fire up the engines and get the heck out of there. However, this isn\u0027t always the case as Jool\u0027s atmosphere does a pretty good job of slowing you down into a suborbital trajectory before you even get to 120 Km.

One with science, or one without? In the case of doing it without science, your main vessel only needs to make three transfers: Kerbin-\u0026gt;Eve-\u0026gt;Duna-\u0026gt;Laythe. From these planets, you can send out a small lander to perform landings on the planet, its moons and even other planets before returning back to the main vessel for refueling. By using this lander/supply ship combo, you can effectively give the lander tens of thousands of Delta V to perform all the landings you need it to (except Eve, you need a dedicated lander for that one). For example, for the Jool system, just park your main vessel at Laythe, and send your lander down to Laythe, then liftoff and return to the main vessel, then refuel, and send your lander to Vall and return, rinse and repeat. Its more complicated if you want to bring heavy science equipment along.
