{"TopicId":101498,"ForumId":34,"TopicTitle":"FirstPersonEVA [0.90]","CreatedByName":"codefox","CreatedById":139153,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:20:59Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"codefox","CreatedById":139153,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T02:20:59Z","Content":"This mod is deprecated as [Hullcam VDS](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-1-0-2-Hullcam-VDS-added-First-Person-EVA-DDS-textures-Updated-29-Apr) has it already implemented now. A re-code with better maneuvering abilities is planned though.\n\nContinuing [FlaccidUnicorn\u0027s FirstPersonEVA](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/73799-0-23-FirstPersonEVA)\n\n[![5NytDpq.png](http://i.imgur.com/5NytDpq.png)](http://imgur.com/jnpYWiV)\n\nI\u0027ve compiled FlaccidUnicorn\u0027s FirstPersonEVA mod for KSP 0.90, using the [Hullcam VDS 0.90 update](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/46365-0-90-Hullcam-VDS-0-90-update-Updated-16-Dec).\n\nFirstPersonEVA is released under the LGPLv3, Hullcam VDS under the GPL. I\u0027ve included both in the binary package, including the source code for FirstPersonEVA (HullCam.dll is distributed unmodified).\n\nSource Code: [https://github.com/flurreh/FirstPersonEVA](https://github.com/flurreh/FirstPersonEVA)\n\nBinary Releases: [https://github.com/flurreh/FirstPersonEVA/releases](https://github.com/flurreh/FirstPersonEVA/releases)\n\nUsage\n\nTo enable/disable the EVA camera, press \u0022-\u0022 or \u0022=\u0022 on your keyboard or choose \u0022Activate Camera\u0022/\u0022Deactivate Camera\u0022 from the Kerbal right-click menu.\n\nThis mod adds a camera inside the Kerbal\u0027s EVA helmet. Sometimes it bugs out while using in an environment with gravity (i.e. on Kerbin), I\u0027ll look into that later tho.\n\nInstallation\n\nJust download the binary (.tar.gz) archive and move the \u0022FirstPersonEVA\u0022 folder inside into your KSP/GameData directory.\n\nWhat\u0027s coming next?\n\nTo be honest - I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll keep it update for future KSP versions (as long as it will still be needed) and I\u0027ll probably enhance it a bit. (i.e. better textures)\n\nHowever, I\u0027ll fix bugs which I (or you) encounter, as long as they\u0027re not related to KSP itself or the Unity engine. Please report issues either [here](https://github.com/flurreh/FirstPersonEVA/issues/new) (I favor this) or as PM here on the forum. Additionally, you might send me a [PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=flurreeh) on reddit, although it\u0027s not sure whether or not I\u0027ll see it, so don\u0027t wonder when I don\u0027t reply or when I take some time to do so.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-10T11:13:16Z\u0022 title=\u002205/10/2015 11:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by codefox**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nhawks17","CreatedById":32999,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T03:26:54Z","Content":"Doesn\u0027t Astronomer (Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack guy) already have an updated version for this?"},{"CreatedByName":"codefox","CreatedById":139153,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T03:33:12Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Doesn\u0027t Astronomer (Astronomer\u0027s Visual Pack guy) already have an updated version for this?\n\nWell, the post was last updated on 1st December 2014, also Astronomer said he\u0027ll be away for quite a while.
