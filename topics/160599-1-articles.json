So boats and other sea craft actually have to adjust for the water conditions and boats can actually be impacted negatively by this if they enter a stormy area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe in conjunction with a pre-existing wind mod maybe?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thought, especially since I know a friend who\u0027s going to be working on a project in KSP that\u0027ll utilize it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know the water isn\u0027t an easy thing to mess around with and when something hits the water it plays a splash particle.(just like when something hits the ground it either plays the explosion or smoke-puff particles/effects)\u00A0Scatterer (\u002BSVE?) adds somewhat of a wave/current thing, but that\u0027s\u00A0only due\u00A0to texture animations, and\u00A0I know this would need an event to trigger the water effect texture animations\u00A0from the storms which would probably from a pre-existing mod?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StahnAileron","CreatedById":139783,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T21:48:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you would need to completely rewrite how water is implemented. As far as I know, water is just a secondary\u00A0planetary body superimposed on the primary body. (or something approximating that.) As this is a space-oriented game, I imagine this was done to save on processing power since real water effects tend to be somewhat processing intensive. (Both graphically and computationally if you want believable behavior.) Seeing KSP can choke on physics calculations for a large, complex vessel, I can only imagine the slideshow if that entire craft was under perpetual acceleration due to water waves. And that\u0027s on top of calculating the waves in the first place. And then you need to do the water calculation for a large area to boot. (About everything within the standard 2.5km\u00A0or so physics\u00A0range of the game.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can\u0027t see this being simple or easy to do without a fundamental change to KSP. Water is not it\u0027s forte (for good reason: Kerbal \u003Cem\u003ESpace\u003C/em\u003E Program.) I get that KSP is a fun physic sim sandbox for people, but it can only do so much given its intended purpose/design as a space sim. (Aircraft only got added since flying through air is something rockets need to do. \u0022Flying\u0022 though water? Not so much. I think we\u0027re luck enough to even have functional buoyancy and therefore submarines and boats.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot to shoot you down or \u0022hate on you\u0022. It\u0027s just I don\u0027t think KSP as it currently stands is the right platform for what you\u0027re asking for. I think it would be more effort to shoehorn in real water effects into KSP than it would be to just make a Kerbal Marine Program from scratch with that as the basic premise and goal from the start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SparkyFox","CreatedById":107288,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-13T22:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been tinkering around with the game code in the past and seeing how stuff works, so I know how a lot of things work, and personally; I\u0027m a fan of making boats or submarines, and like I said, this was only a thought for a good friend of mine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past- water was literally a ground with an\u00A0animated texture, but\u00A0I have seen quite a lot of potential with mods.

The issue with this is that it doesn\u0027t interpolate the forces correctly between frames, so that for every part, the water level doesn\u0027t appear to go up and down smoothly so that they bob along with it, instead it disappears instantly and reappears at a different level, parts just fall down and slam into the water surface and ships break.
