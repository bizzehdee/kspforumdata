There are no shadows generated on the \u0022near\u0022 camera on water. Anyone have any ideas why this might be? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI couldn\u0027t find any answers on the Unity forums or anywhere else for that matter. They show up fine on the \u0022far\u0022 camera though, and on land. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also tried to alter the rendering path to forward, but it looks like it was already set to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
