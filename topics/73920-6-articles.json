The issue really is that MTBF is calculated for each part individually instead if all parts at once. This means everything could feasibly fail at once since failures are totally independant of each other (= no fun). What *I* think should happen--at least for probes--is that MTBF is calculated for the entire craft, then once the system decides to roll a failure on the craft, it draws from all the fail-able elements on the craft with each part\u0027s MTBF increasing or decreasing its likelihood of being drawn. Imagine having a bowl of tags, and each part has a tag. The lower the part\u0027s MTBF, the more \u0027tags\u0027 it has in the bowl. Find a method to determine a random drawing cycle (average of all MTBFs? Increasing freq with increase in parts/low tech parts?) .\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-15T06:12:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/15/2014 06:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Cleric2145\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ippo","CreatedById":107018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-15T09:48:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cleric2145\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cleric2145\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe issue really is that MTBF is calculated for each part individually instead if all parts at once.

Instead of linking all repairs to EVAs, allow locked thrusters/engines to be forcibly shutdown by closing all of the fuel valves and/or draining all of the fuel from the connected or nearest tank. This might even qualify more as a tank failure (pumps in the tank lock open and fail.) Potentially add more \u0027temporary\u0027 failures, such as a throttle sticking open, fixed by restarting the engines or cutting the throttle to zero and then back up. Engine ignition failures that simply require a remote restart. Just as in real life, not all failures should be critical and permanent.
