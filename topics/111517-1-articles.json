I can get into orbit around Kerbin, but I can\u0027t seem to get anywhere else. I started in career and left it on easy, but I am still stuck. Its been a long time since I have played any KSP. I have been streaming on Twitch and have had one person join that helped and that\u0027s how I got to where orbiting Kerbin became easy. So any tips here would be awesome, and if you guys want to join me while I am streaming I will put my Twitch channel below. Thanks for any advice ahead of time and if you do follow.\n\n[http://www.twitch.tv/boomsp00n](http://www.twitch.tv/boomsp00n)\n\nI am planning on a giveaway at **25** and **50** followers so let your friends know as well!! It will be a game code of some sort! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\nBoomSp00n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T17:54:39Z","Content":"Having a few problems with gameplay?

But you can check out some of the YouTube channels that are popular to get lots of help, too.\n\nI\u0027ll start by shamelessly plugging my own channel which has video tutorials, and Let\u0027s Plays through Career Mode (My latest show has me on the way to Mun) and I try to spend some time each episode explaining any new concepts I\u0027m doing.\n\nAlso, look up Scott Manley, he has lots of great tutorials, but they are getting harder to find - buried in his other shows and episodes."}]}
