The results turned into the Jak-109 Driad. This craft is modular, so it can be sent up to orbit much easier. It is quite large, close to half again bigger then the VAB. Has a crew capacity of 104. And when fully fueled, can weigh more then 1,500 Tons. The starship has no capacity to enter atmosphere and survive so it\u0027s to remain in orbit or in trans planetary space once assembled. It\u0027s fuel capacity is immense, giving it a total Delta-V of well over 8,000 while still having a respectable TWR of around 1.3. It has 21 docking ports for bringing along nearly all the equipment, landers, probes, and satellites it could possibly need for exploring a different planetary system. Loads of solar panels so even if things go bad, you have power generation to spare, and quite a sizable reserve of mono propellant for maneuvering it\u0027s hefty bulk. As well as the ability to relink the segments if the kraken tries to pull them apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Driad in all it\u0027s lengthy beauty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/driadfront1_zpsn6uchq75.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022driadfront1_zpsn6uchq75.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELets take it from the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Driadtop1_zpslj4kcitz.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Driadtop1_zpslj4kcitz.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the Key to it\u0027s ability to stay intact while maneuvering: The reinforced docking ports, aka: docking port senior with 4 standard docking ports on outriggers, to give the docking system the rigidity it needs to hold together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Driadreinforceddocking_zpsqdtax2qc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Driadreinforceddocking_zpsqdtax2qc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sections require nearly perfect alignment so that all 5 ports link up correctly. Luckily, the fuel and engine segments are designed to be the same on all 4 sides so it only requires being aligned to the closest 90 deg. Also, each section has it\u0027s own core for maneuvering and plenty of RCS authority to allow for the maneuvers needed for docking. Only the crew section is single sided and has just one side up. But luckily, the rest do not so once linkage is achieved, the craft only needs to be rolled until it\u0027s facing the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManeuvering this craft is very slow. Even with the massive amount of RCS authority it has, and the added reaction wheels in the crew and engine segments, it is a slow process. But changing orbit, once it is pointing the right way, goes quickly thanks to the 5 \u0022Mammoth\u0022 engines and their combined 20,000 units of thrust. So no 12 minute burns for this starship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith it being modular, it is entirely possible to add a second or even third fuel segment to the craft, increasing it\u0027s range even further. The possibilities are great. But the ability to maneuver, and it\u0027s great TWR, will drop dramatically with each added segment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew and fuel sections are best sent up empty with their own launch vehicles to bring them into orbit. But the engine section has enough delta-v to launch its self into orbit fully loaded with no need for any boosters. Although adding boosters can be fun. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoyed taking a look at this craft.

I delayed releasing the craft files until I had fixed a few things with the segment launchers. The Driad comes in 3 segments, crew, fuel, and engines. Each segment has it\u0027s own way to get up into orbit. Once there, they snap together to make the mother ship. In Kerbal Orbit the Driad will need to be refueled, stocked with satellites, probes, and landers for it\u0027s mission, and have the rest of it\u0027s crew brought up. Details of each segment will be stated separately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/wmbdpvzdbns43uw/Jak-109_Driad_crew_segment.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Crew segment:\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Driadcrewsegment1_zpsmhybsde9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Driadcrewsegment1_zpsmhybsde9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis segment houses the life support systems, crew quarters, and snack dispensers every Kerbal needs for a successful mission. It comes with minimal solar collectors, enough to keep it powered on it\u0027s own, but a good supply of fuel for the RCS system it has for orbital maneuvering. The nose mounted docking port is for ease of crew transfers and for the ever important snack restocking. The crew segment has an ultra high gain communications tower equipped with a high gain antenna, 2 medium range folding antenna, and a pair of EVA communications antennas. This segment also houses the planetary survey equipment needed to scan a planet from orbit and any moons you might find nearby, no matter what side of the craft the planet might be on(yes even upside down for when Jeb does his show boating). The launch profile of this segment is a bit rough and requires keeping the craft basically vertical until it is over 12Km up. At this point a very shallow gravity turn can be started with the turn being inched slowly over further as you continue to climb. This means it does not allow for a truly efficient orbital burn. But its lifter has plenty of fuel to make up for this. Once in orbit, the lifter will need to be manually undocked from the docking port. Price for this segment and lifter: ~613,000 Kredits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/bm2s2to84jhkbkq/Jak-109_Driad_fuel_section.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Fuel segment:\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Driadfuelsegment1_zpsmpd4aj0l.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Driadfuelsegment1_zpsmpd4aj0l.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis segment\u0027s main purpose is to house fuel for the engines and generate power with it\u0027s array of solar panels. This segment is also equipped with 12 docking ports for attaching many of the various probes, satellites, and landers needed to complete the various missions the Driad is capable of performing. It has room for nearly half the fuel the Driad carries on a normal mission, and a good amount of fuel for it\u0027s onboard RCS system. Just to be on the safe side, the fuel segment has an auxiliary monopropellant tank on it\u0027s tail end for extra maneuvering fuel for docking. It needs to be noted that the top of the fuel segment(the end with the nose cone) connects to the crew segment, and the bottom(the end with the lifter and extra monopropellant) connects to the engine segment only. It will not link up properly if attached the other way around. The launch profile of this segment is the same as the crew segment, but it tends to be a little more sensitive to leaning during the gravity turn, meaning it has to take an even less efficient orbital path. There is a separator to blow off the lift engine once it is in orbit and closing in on docking with the other segments. It is advisable to leave the extra monopropellant tank in place untill all it\u0027s monopropellant can be transfered into the onboard tanks. It is also advisable to leave the nose cone in place until you are ready to connect it with the other segments so that it is easier to tell which end is which. The winglets on the front of the segment should be jettisoned as well, once in orbit, to free up docking space. Price for this segment and lifter: ~450,000 Kredits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/h5raicbi5hotq9i/Jak-109_Driad_engine_section.zip\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThe Engine segment:\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1346.photobucket.com/albums/p685/Jakalth/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/Driadenginesegment1_zpsfqffffeb.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Driadenginesegment1_zpsfqffffeb.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis segment is the main propulsion for the Driad. It houses the 5 Mammoth engines and has 8 docking ports and 4 large cargo holds for carrying equipment for your mission. This segment only has minimal power generation in the form of a few solar panel arrays, two of which are hidden under the control fins during launch. This segment has extra fuel tanks on it\u0027s nose to give it a little extra breathing room during orbital flight due to it having only just enough fuel to reach orbit. The fuel segment can launch it\u0027s self too orbit, not needing any other form of propulsion to aid it. It\u0027s flight profile is about the same as the crew segment, but it is a little more forgiving during it\u0027s gravity turn, allowing slightly more tilt then the other two segments, but you should hold off on starting your gravity turn untill over 12Km with this segment as well. Once in orbit, the fins should be jettisoned to make room for the solar panel deployment and to free up space for the docking ports to be used. Also, draining fuel from the nose mounted tanks and undocking them will be needed before this segment can be connected to the others. Also note, this segment has a LOT of TWR. Too much in fact. You will want to run the engines lower then normal to keep the segment from accelerating too quickly. Like all other segments, this one is equipped with plenty of fuel for it\u0027s RCS system to aid in orbital maneuvers and docking. Price for this segment: ~406,000 Kredits\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETotal price for launching the whole Driad: ~1,469,000 Kredits, not counting the cost of refueling, equipment loading, and crew delivery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking segments can only connect to certain others due to their being two different docking port arrays, one for the back of a segment, and one for the front. This means that two fuel segments can connect to each other as long as they connect front to back, and it means that the engine and crew segments can be connected together directly if wanted. It\u0027s only an issue with the fuel segment having two docking port ends and the fact that a front docking port array can not connect properly to another front array, while a back array also can not connect properly to another back array.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you all enjoy this craft as much as I had at making it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlextheBodacious","CreatedById":139447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T06:28:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esfs sfs fssf sffsffs sfs pllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssssssssssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-23T06:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat ship is just crazy - I love it!

Then you start with a ~800m/s free kick by dropping down to kerbin from Munar altitude, and the transfer will be less than 2 km/s. Once you are getting close to the Jool system, fiddle with the trajectory so Tylo or Layhte captures you into a stable orbit with a gravity assist for free, and from then on you are on your own, but you have a whole system of moons to play with gravity assists and aerobrakes that should make things cheap is you know your stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA few tricks to save on mass launched to Jool would be to have a propulsion section that doubles as miner, and to have the landers do multiple duty (a Tylo lander upper stage can be a great lander for Pol, Bop, or Val).

Also made them completely amphibious with a 70m/s landing speed on water and jettison-able floats for easier to-orbit burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe tug only needs to shrug around a max of 30 tons while de-orbiting the ssto\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGlad to be of help! It\u0027s the reason we are here after all, learn from one another. Hope to see the new one soon! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, Ore is denser, especially much denser than liquid fuel. Consider a single big ore tank holds about 15mT of ore that can be 100% converted into liquid fuel! As comparison, a Big Red holds 32mT of LFO mix, so you can have almost the same mass in half the space, even for LFO. The trouble is lugging the refinery along, that\u0027s 4mT extra, of course, and unless you want truly awful TWR, a buffer \u0022holding tank\u0022 to make the burns in a reasonable time (a single refinery will only allow a single nuke to run at ~2/3rds thrust indefinitely on its output). In my case, since the refineries were part of the payload... it would have been a shame to launch with the tanks empty, considering the effort I made setting up mining bases.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune. I haven\u0027t looked at tankage ratios, because I \u003Cem\u003Edon\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E want to find out at which point ore tanks with a refinery get a better fraction than fuel tanks. So cheaty... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
