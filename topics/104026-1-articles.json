I\u0027ve been playing the game regularily for over a year and always got pissed off whenever I accidentally switched focus to something else and then had to mash the tab key to cycle through every celestial body until I got back to my craft. I read a forum post a couple months ago that mentioned using backspace to return focus to your craft and wept for joy when I tried it out and it worked. I guess that\u0027s my own fault for not going through all the key bindings in the settings.

I\u0027m sure this line is something the KSP devs have in mind when thinking about adding extra monoliths as well as tutorials. - That bring said, I still wish there where more stock easter eggs.
