So I could see why it would sometimes make sense to post there instead of like KSP discussion. But even if it does belong somewhere else, you\u0027re still gonna get those off-forum topics from people not being sure, so not much point in specifying imo. I think it\u0027s fine for what it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
