So I thought, would it be possible to tie an action group to a stage, ie: my fairings, so that my solar panels extend at the same time my fairings are jetissoned. This could also be applied to a two stage lander, so that your ladder retracts automatically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DoToH","CreatedById":68428,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T22:31:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlready suggested four days ago:\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79193-Staging-and-action-groups\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E this thread\u003C/a\u003E (and probably before then too)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-12T23:00:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2014 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by DoToH\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
