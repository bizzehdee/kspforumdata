E.g., you need functionality to enumerate ships and get their \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoI\u003C/abbr\u003E and orbital elements to display them on the map. Expose the same exact functionality to the modding API, and somebody can write a quick little plugin to show these ships on a separate map, just like in the image above.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd scripting would be nice, but I hope it\u0027s a sort of thing we get as an option. As discussed elsewhere, a visual programming language would be a great way to get custom parts onto Steam Workshop without having to do a lot of extra work to make it safe. Plus, it might be more accessible to some people to start making mods. But at the same time, I hope it\u0027s not a replacement for plugin system. There is a lot you can do with plugins that would be difficult or impossible with a script. A plugin can talk to additional hardware, grab from or post things to internet, etc. That\u0027s what makes plugins less secure, but also so much more powerful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, it\u0027s still a unity game. Even if all we get is a simple VPL scripting and no other mod support, you can hack in plugin support with a custom loader. It\u0027s just going to be more work for the community to figure it all out and maintain it for version changes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
