The Hitchhiker, with 4 crew and 21 months hab time configured, shows as having 25 months. The cupola, with 1 crew and 0 months hab time configured, shows as having 1 months. This is *a visual issue in the editor* only. The life support calculation window properly uses only the configured hab time months, and does not add the crew capacity value.\n\nQuestion: ModuleHabitation lets you configure how many Kerbals it affects. This works for the habitation multiplier. The more Kerbals are on board that exceed the configured maximum of, say, the cupola, the lower the overall ship-wide multiplier will end up. However, I\u0027m seeing no effect for basic hab time. If I build a vessel with a probe core, a battery and a Hitchhiker, the habitation timer always ends up being exactly the same for a four-person crew... regardless of whether ModuleHabitation is set to support a crew of 4, or only a crew of 1.\n\nIs this intended behavior, or did I find a bug?"},{"CreatedByName":"Odonian","CreatedById":170403,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-07T03:30:49Z","Content":"Has anyone else experienced a bug where kerbals cease to produce mulch?

Her predecessor the Jool III is very similar but on a shorter-duration mission to Duna and Ike. The Jool-IV is intended to travel to Moho and park there while it milks all the science from the planet.
