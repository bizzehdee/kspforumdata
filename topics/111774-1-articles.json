It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a great adventure working on this huge and amazing project. \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As one of the initial core members of the team, I remember the early days working with Felipe and trying to build the first rocket made of cylinders in Unity.

I really want to thank you for being there since the beginning and for being part of those crazy fans out there that love the game and spent a lot of time playing it.

It\u0027s been nice having you around, and best of luck in your future endeavors. I think this leaves just Felipe for devs who have been with us since the beginning, unless I\u0027m missing something.
