However, it is most likely that 1.0.3 won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t see public \n\u003E \n\u003E release for the next two weeks. While Felipe, Mike and Jim will be \n\u003E \n\u003E checking progress and doing minor changes, they are officially on a two \n\u003E \n\u003E week vacation as of this Monday. This is due to the fact that the studio\n\u003E \n\u003E  worked nonstop from the release of 0.90 to 1.0, including several \n\u003E \n\u003E weekends and overtime being put into it. Even after the release, we dove\n\u003E \n\u003E  face first into the Unity 5 upgrade, and several milestones have been \n\u003E \n\u003E accomplished in it.\n\u003E \n\u003E We figured this was the best moment for a \n\u003E \n\u003E break for them as there is a lull in their abilities being required \n\u003E \n\u003E while we find the perfect balance for 1.0.3, and the rest of us at Squad\n\u003E \n\u003E  will do our best to make sure this is accomplished while they rest.\n\u003E \n\u003E On\n\u003E \n\u003E  my personal devnote, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been finalizing deals several of our business\n\u003E \n\u003E  partners. I would love to share more on those, but due to agreements \n\u003E \n\u003E with said partners, they will remain pretty big (and cool!) surprises \n\u003E \n\u003E for just a little longer. \n\n**Alex (aLeXmOrA)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E My last devnote post, guys. Yesterday, I helped TeacherGaming with the launch of KerbalEDU including KSP 1.0 features. All schools that have purchased this version should be enjoying it. This was my last contribution to the KSP Team since from now on I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m no longer working at Squad anymore. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a great adventure working on this huge and amazing project.   \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E As one of the initial core members of the team, I remember the early days working with Felipe and trying to build the first rocket made of cylinders in Unity. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve seen it grow and become the game it is now, but none of this could have happened without all the support from you, the KSP community. I really want to thank you for being there since the beginning and for being part of those crazy fans out there that love the game and spent a lot of time playing it. All your feedback and comments let us know how to direct and create a great game.   \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a pleasure and honor working with the team, they\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re excellent people and I hope their \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctrip\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 to take Kerbal Space Program beyond what it is already right now, will be extraordinary. Thank you Squad and Kerbal Space Program for everything. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m leaving, but taking a lot of experiences with me.   \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Hope to see you soon again! Good bye.\n\n**Marco (Samssonart)**   \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Last week I was feeling ill and couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t make it my devnotes in time, sorry about that. These last few weeks I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been learning my way around the new Unity GUI system, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s awesome, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s very flexible, modular and more efficient than anything we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve tried before, this alone will mean a performance boost for KSP. Aside from that I am learning how to give maintenance to the older build servers, the ones in Mexico HQ. And I am resuming improvements and testing for the patcher, so as soon as we have access to the new server\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s Rsync the patcher will be pretty much ready to go.\n\n**Daniel (danRosas)**  \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been gathering some promotional images, videos, etc for Max and Kasper. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve done a list of tweaks I want to do to the Kerbals, now that everything is looking better on Unity 5. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also making good use of time, now that everything is moving at a better pace than before the release, to learn new tricks.\n\n**Ted (Ted)** \n\n\u003E \n\u003E It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a rather uneventful past week. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve got 1.0.3 in Experimentals, getting tested away by the Experimental Team. Though activity is a tad low due to the significant effort put in by so many for 1.0, it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll hopefully pick up soon! I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been doing production-type tasks and sorting out our internal documentation, making things as seamless as possible for all involved when it comes to designing and developing updates.\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld)**\n\n\u003E \n\u003E  It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been a rather quiet week, mostly because HarvesteR, Mu and Romfarer are now enjoying some well deserved time off. We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve seen some changes in the studio, and even though Rogelio and Alejandro will of course be missed, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m sure that both them and us will be able to move forward.\n\u003E \n\u003E To me, one thing stood out in the community this week: DK returned to streaming and after moving to another state he was struggling to make rent. Within minutes a few very generous people in the community bonded together to help him out. I think that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s something that\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s rarely seen in the gaming world, and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m very proud it happened in this community.\n\u003E \n\u003E A final (very cool) note is that KSP is going to be part of a display in a German museum from August until April next year!
