I recently completed a contract to do a \u00A0fly by the mun, I ended up doing orbit on mun and I am not sure if this is the caused of it. I find it really odd that I get the land on Duna contract and it seems to skip the Mun contract and shows up Minimus instead. When will this land on mun contract show up? Will it ever show up? Do I have to skip contracts that will lead straight to this? Is there a way I can bring this back if it did happen to be a bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really wanted the contract and I am afraid I will have to move on without it? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u00A0Is there a way I can bring it back or am I forever done?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T09:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing with KSP is, almost all contracts are optional. IIRC the only ones you \u003Cem\u003Emust\u003C/em\u003E complete are the starter ones - launch your first vessel, escape the atmosphere, achieve orbit. And even then, the \u0027must\u0027 applies only if you actually want to unlock the other contract types. But as long as you somehow had sufficient money, you could pretty much ignore the mission control building entirely and fly wherever you want. The game will neither reward nor punish you for doing so. However, if you are a new player and you are not quite sure what you are supposed to do next, the mission control building is a fairly useful resource, because it sometimes offers contracts that mimic a progression, in order to gently guide you to a new goal.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, the game tracks your progress in the save file, and will attempt to give you contracts for things you\u0027ve recently proven yourself capable of, and the next step beyond that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, contracts are assigned to you randomly - \u003Cem\u003Eall\u003C/em\u003E contracts, including progression related ones, which are 100% optional and exist only to guide new players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result of these things, it\u0027s fairly easy to encounter \u0022skipped\u0022 contracts - because the more you do, the more likely it is that one of your actions accidentally rendered a contract redundant. Since all contracts are optional, all contracts can be rendered redundant without any long-term negative effects, apart from the gut feeling of somehow \u0022missing out\u0022. You\u0027d therefore do well to learn to ignore that feeling \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe specific contract you mention, \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022, comes from a template that procedurally generates \u0022Explore \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022 contracts based on two conditions: 1.) you have not entered that body\u0027s SoI yet, and 2.) the game judges you as capable of entering that body\u0027s SoI, based on the parts you have researched and the previous tasks you have completed. Now you instantly see why you are not receiving this contract type for the Mun: you no longer qualify for it, because you already entered the Mun\u0027s SoI in the pursuit of a different, unrelated contract. You have, however, not entered the SoI\u0027s of Minmus and Duna, and thus you are eligible to receive this contract type for them. Since both Minmus and Duna are reachable with the same parts and only 10%-25% more fuel than you need for the Mun (which you have already reached), the game also judges you capable of taking those next steps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd why did you never receive the \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022 contract before you entered its SoI? Because all contracts are assigned randomly. It simply didn\u0027t show up in time. This actually happens to a lot of players, because building rockets takes zero time and most players spend barely one or two Kerbin days (barely 6-12 hours) between first achieving orbit and first entering the Mun\u0027s SoI. That\u0027s sometimes not even enough to generate any new contracts at all, because they usually take 3-4 Kerbin days to expire. And if no new contract is generated during the short window where you qualify for \u0022Explore the Mun\u0022, then well, it has a grand total of 0% chance to show up for you \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E If, however, you were faffing around in low Kerbin orbit for weeks on end, you\u0027d be almost guaranteed to see this contract at some point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-02-02T09:35:27Z\u0022 title=\u002202/02/2016 09:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T18:54:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBasically, ti\u0027s like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. \u00A0Whether or not the \u0022explore\u0022 \u00A0contracts appear is totally luck of the draw\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0The only thing that affects the chance is if you go to the planet before the \u0022explore\u0022 contract appears. \u00A0In that case, then you\u0027ll certainly never get the contract. \u00A0IOW, \u0022explore\u0022 contracts only appear for places you\u0027ve never been to before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u00A0But because of #1, waiting to go somewhere until an \u0022explore\u0022 contract comes up is usually pointless. \u00A0It probably wasn\u0027t going to appear anyway. \u00A0In general, if you start seeing other contracts for a planet (science data, build a station, etc.) but haven\u0027t seen \u0022explore\u0022 yet, odds are it\u0027s not gonna happen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-02T18:58:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not random, I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s tied to reputation.
