An artificially induced retrograde Kessler cloud was effective in denying access to precisely one orbital track - effective in that anything hitting anything with a mutual closing speed of 5km/sec is going to vapourise both things. A gun or rack of guided missiles should have better luck guarding a larger area)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pds314","CreatedById":70014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T03:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe problem here is that, without another AI mod, BDarmory AI performs extremely poorly in space.

Missiles? Forget it, the platform just tumbles when you put AP on. Unless you can figure out a way for the platform to not have a tizzy fit when you put it in hunter mode, I\u0027d say stick with movable gun turrets.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zixor","CreatedById":149186,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-24T17:45:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ihtoit\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ihtoit\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...I\u0027d say stick with movable gun turrets.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave the laser turrets been horribly nerfed recently?
