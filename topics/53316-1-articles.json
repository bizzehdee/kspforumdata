Especially since we don\u0027t have a complete solar system. But I was thinking something like this could be used: You have to go to all of the planets and moons in the game, even in other solar systems, and find 2 monoliths on each except gas giants, so don\u0027t look for monoliths on them. Then, a secret node in the tech tree could be revealed. The node would be like, \u0022Stargates\u0022 and the description would say, \u0022And by stargates, we mean wormholes taking us to other galaxies,\u0022 which you would have to discover by having a space telescope in orbit around the farthest planet from the farthest star from Kerbol.
