This will presumably work in oceans too, making stock submarines on Eve a reality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say the game will be pretty complete, as far as what I desire to be stock... but there are some major features I think could still be added, and some minor things as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA minor thing that I\u0027ll overlook is the need for larger steerable landing gear... we can just attach them to a serve/joint. We\u0027re only looking at a partcount increase of 1-2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMajor features/changes:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Stock life support, it adds depth to the game, meshes well with surface bases (the current expansion\u0027s focus?), and can be made to be largely irrelevant for quick trips to the Mun, not heavily impacting newer players, even if they choose not to disable it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2)... um I think that\u0027s it for major features...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinor features/ part/planet packs:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) stock electric fan *engines*. While a rotor and a 4 blade prop will work, that\u0027s 5 parts, when an engine can be a single part. Keeping part count down is good (as long as creativity isn\u0027t restricted), it allows for larger designs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA 4 engine design would use 20 parts with the current system, that is less\u00A0 than ideal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) larger size atmospheric engines, larger \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E only cylindrical tanks: Some of my SSTOs have used 40 rapiers... spamming the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E only cylindrical fusalages increases part count too much. Spamming 1.25m engines for larger mk3/3.75m/5meter diameter based space planes increases part count too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love more 2.5m sized engines to drop that part count by 30 (with a 2.5m engine the equivalent of 4x 1.25m engines)... something like this for a rapier would be great:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222ztHLce.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022682\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2ztHLce.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(as the 2.5m engine would be larger, it needs more detail, as you\u0027ll be looking at it relatively closer)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Nuclear reactors and larger Ion engines. Nuclear reactors would also work well with submarines: it beats spamming the tiny RTGs (again, anything that stops part count from ballooning is a good thing)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Rotors that rotate their center section, but not the ends: would be very useful for having inline rotating parts (such as artificial gravity on stations, or contra rotating props), while allowing a main non rotating stack... it seems like to do that now will be more complicated, and it will inflate part count.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5) Part rebalancing:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI still think the wolfhound is \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027d, and I now think the skiff has been over nerfed. The wolfound and poodle simply overlap in role too much. The skiff is too weak for its size... but it seems like it should be overlapping in role with the skipper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rapier is based on an engine with an altitude compensating nozzle, and its closed cycle is basically meant for use in vacuum and near vacuum conditions. Its closed cycle Isp sucks too much. It should be at least 315s like a vector, preferably with an Isp curve more like the Rhino\u0027s, or at least the skipper\u0027s.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think KSP needs after making history?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-29T10:51:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223606871\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022184836\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221559124758\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLWhat do you think KSP needs after making history?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, and foremost, we\u2019ll need bug fixes after BG is released.
