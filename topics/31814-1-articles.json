One thing I encountered is that the satellite is socked on top of the rocket. But it looks pretty terrible as there is no cover on the satellite. Is there any mod or possibility to get the satellite covered like in real? Or is this a planned feature for the future? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s your opinion so far?
