Shockingly, I know.\n\nHere\u0027s one way I decided to test the glider phase of them before tackling the objectives of actually getting them to space with some out-of-control yawing at transonic speeds and other v104 erratic behavior. \n\nAnyway... do any of you STS builders out there test gliding in similar methods?\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

My problem with that is I like to have a shuttle with a much shorter front landing gear so it\u0027s pitched forward quite a lot when on the tarmac, but that means it has about as much inclination to leave the ground as my aunt\u0027s obese cat.\n\nThat\u0027s also a very nice approach benjee10. Did you land both craft one after the other? (props if you did).\n\nThere comes a point though when testing and testing and testing some more that the time taken to lift a craft to the right point to test it becomes rather tedious. And those approaches (even though they are good) don\u0027t test the \u0022does it tumble on re-entry\u0022 aspect which I find is one of the main issues. So (and dear community, please don\u0027t hit me) I use hyper-edit to perform tests. We don\u0027t have a simulator or wind-tunnel (or an army of physicists), so instead I use HE to put a test craft into orbit, adjust its fuel levels to what it might have on re-entry and try it out at re-entry speeds. If I don\u0027t crash I can quickly chuck it back into orbit without even reloading the craft, adjust fuel again to something different and test it again. It just saves time (which is not something I have much of these days). After HE tests I always revert the flight so it\u0027s only used as a simulation tool."},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T00:27:26Z","Content":"That Hyper Edit is pretty ideal for this kind of testing is logical, given the lack of other means to test. Though for low altitude testing, I find rocket pods on radial decouplers for lift off and gaining some initial speed work just as well."},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T01:11:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Anyway... do any of you STS builders out there test gliding in similar methods?\n\nWhether drunk (usually) or sober, I just tweak the tanks to about what they\u0027d have when it\u0027s time to land. Then I slap a small de-orbit stage on the thing somewhere using a decoupler/separator that leaves no \u0022residue\u0022 on the ship. Then I HyperEdit this into a typical orbit, use the new stage to knock me down, get rid of it, and fly it in from there."},{"CreatedByName":"Zephram Kerman","CreatedById":15270,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T06:34:16Z","Content":"I just activate the SMEs and use infinite fuel cheat to blast off down the runway.
