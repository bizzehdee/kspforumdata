My problem with that is I like to have a shuttle with a much shorter front landing gear so it\u0027s pitched forward quite a lot when on the tarmac, but that means it has about as much inclination to leave the ground as my aunt\u0027s obese cat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s also a very nice approach benjee10. Did you land both craft one after the other? (props if you did).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere comes a point though when testing and testing and testing some more that the time taken to lift a craft to the right point to test it becomes rather tedious. And those approaches (even though they are good) don\u0027t test the \u0022does it tumble on re-entry\u0022 aspect which I find is one of the main issues. So (and dear community, please don\u0027t hit me) I use hyper-edit to perform tests. We don\u0027t have a simulator or wind-tunnel (or an army of physicists), so instead I use HE to put a test craft into orbit, adjust its fuel levels to what it might have on re-entry and try it out at re-entry speeds. If I don\u0027t crash I can quickly chuck it back into orbit without even reloading the craft, adjust fuel again to something different and test it again. It just saves time (which is not something I have much of these days). After HE tests I always revert the flight so it\u0027s only used as a simulation tool.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Juicy","CreatedById":142505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T00:27:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat Hyper Edit is pretty ideal for this kind of testing is logical, given the lack of other means to test.
