Space contracts as in it gets shorter in the direction you are travelling (Lorentz contraction). This is closely related to time dilation, which is the phenomenon that time goes slower the faster you go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy both of these things? They are direct logical consequences required for consistency with c being constant in every frame of reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf something like a train is moving near the speed of light, and it emits a beam of light, then it has to travel with the speed of light for both observers outside standing still, and for observers on the train. If time and space would not change, then from the observer on the train the beam of light would travel at c but for an outside observer it would be faster than c. This can\u0027t happen. So, time goes slower the faster you go, or in other words an outside observer will see time pass more slowly for the train. Now, since time passes more slowly, that means the light is travelling more slowly too and thus not faster than light any more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the lorentz contractions, someone less tired than me can probably explain that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. That is a good question. Historically, it was acknowledged that c has to be constant in all frames of reference for maxwell\u0027s equations to not break down. Special relativity is then a direct consequence of this, accessible via thought experiments only. As for why exactly is c always c in every frame of reference - why is any physical law just the way it is? It\u0027s a question that has no answer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Well they are not exactly the same (otherwise why would we have different names?), but they are part of the same: space-time. Every bending of space results in a bending of time and vice versa, they interact like one entity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also has implications for velocities. In fact, you are always moving at the speed of light - but through space-time. If you don\u0027t move in space, you move in time with c. It\u0027s a 4D-velocity vector in space-time. This also explains why the faster you move through space, the slower time passes because a larger portion of c is going in spacial velocity, rather than in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. What do you mean \u0022it\u0022? And in fact, gravity also has effects on time (and obviously space). This is the field of general relativity though, whereas until now it was all special relativity. Special relativity is the \u0022easy\u0022 part, concerning itself with non-accelerating objects not in gravitational fields that is accessible via thought experiments alone. General relativity is, as the name suggests, more general, and much much more complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-15T05:15:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kertherina\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kertherina\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for why exactly is c always c in every frame of reference - why is any physical law just the way it is?

I mean, sure, ultimately, any science question will run into an unanswered, or indeed, unanswerable why question. But the point is to take it a few layers deeper every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the speed of light is just a conversion constant. It\u0027s how many meters there are in a second. This has no reason to change any more than there should ever be a different number of feet in a mile. So the more correct way to state the question is why it\u0027s the fastest speed there is and why light travels at that speed regardless of frame of reference.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the real answer to this is that \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E travels at the speed of light \u003Cem\u003Eall the time\u003C/em\u003E. Or more precisely, 4-velocity always has magnitude c. Stationary things propagate purely in the time direction, and so they appear stationary. Things that cut at a bit of an angle appear to move, as they are in a different place in space at a later moment in time. The angle at which something propagates through space and time is determined by momentum and energy. And the relationship between momentum and energy determines mass. Hence more massive objects require more energy and momentum to be accelerated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELight is massless, and so it has a linear relationship between energy and momentum, E = pc. That means that light always cuts at a 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle, always traveling same amount through space and time. Change of coordinate system changes energy and momentum, but preserves linear relationship. So you get light that\u0027s red or blue shifted, but still traveling at c.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis brings up the question of a) Why is light massless? and \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Why does relationship between energy and momentum is what we call mass? Unfortunately, this is starting to get complicated. The answers to both of these questions come from Quantum Field Theory. Light is massless because Higgs Mechanism allows for a single massless electroweak boson, and that\u0027s light. Behavior of mass as actual mass has to do with mass shell and a singularity in the propagators, and that\u0027s getting \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe ultimate answer to all of the thread questions, as far as we know, is \u0022Because Lagrangian is invariant under a continuous group of local transformations which includes Poincare subgroup.\u0022 That actually gives you the entirety of General Relativity as a consequence.

Depends if you are asking about special or general relativity. In special relativity, space only contracts from the point of view of an observer moving at relativistic speeds. The general theory explains why the planet Mecury measurably processes (the Aposis and Perapsis rotate around the Sun). The gravitational field of the Sun is contracting space enough around it enough that the circumferous around the Sun near Mercury divided by its diameter isn\u0027t pi.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. It just is (or as Newton would say, \u0022I fain no hypothesis\u0022). Relativity tends to hang on the idea that C is somehow the definition of time, and that this is fundamental to the universe. Einstein appeared to believe that since the the speed of light could be derived from the Maxwell Equations without requring a reference state, so should C. Michealson and Morely essentially answerd an old [but a hundred years after M\u0026amp;M] Steven Wright joke \u0022if you are going the speed of light and turned your headlight on, what would happen\u0022 to point out that no matter how fast you go (it would take Einstein to show that accelerating an object with mass to C was impossible), you always measure light moving at C with respect to you (by experimental result.

You are usually moving through this universe in some combination of a high speed along the time axis and a low speed along the 3 spatial dimensions. It turns out that if you treat time as a dimension, stick the appropriate constants in front, and add it quadrature to your 3 spatial dimensions like you would for any vector sum... everything\u0027s speed through spacetime is the same. If you move faster through space then your travel through time slows down to accommodate and vice versa. The relationships are obviously not linear but this is a good way of verbalizing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) This one defies logic for low-speed, low energy, mass based critters like us. It turns out that if you have no rest mass, the rules are different. Actually, they aren\u0027t. All the relativistic effects fall out at low velocities. At speeds closer to c, the universe preserves the cosmic speed limit in different reference frames. This means that if we are flying towards eachother at 0.6 C, we won\u0027t see the other ship approaching at 1.2C. Velocity transformations from SR prevent that and we end up seeing the other ship approach at a subluminal velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELight is just a special case of these maths where it has no rest mass and subsequently sits on the light speed asymptote.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Once you accept that space-time is four dimensional and light moves at C for any reference frame, the consequences of time dilation and length contraction fall out quite naturally in order to preserve these relationships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) We don\u0027t understand gravity.

You can compare these factors between different planets to figure out the difference in time flow between different ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-16T14:03:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGravity\u0027s coupling constant is a free parameter of the theory, just like every other coupling constant.

You are going to have to give this argument up, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, as long as gravity cannot be defined precisely (and there are ongoing arguments in the literature about what is causing variation in very cold effects), then there is not perfect understanding of how it works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
