Basicaly, he was very angry that he could not use programs like Nexus Mod Manager to apply mods to KSP.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWow, I did not expect an example to to fall into my lap but YES. Here we have your average end user. They are used to modding games with tools like the Nexas Mod Manager or the Steam Workshop.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, to you all, I know this is not your concern. You make mods for you. You make them because you want to and you share them because you can (or, the other way around as it might be). And I am not asking you to be concerned with southernrock\u0027s plight. I am asking you to do what you always do, but let me in on it. Let me find a way to get mods to users like southrenrock while letting you guys do as you do. That is the end game everyone. Learn from the modders, create a system that works for the users. As I pointed out upthread, we got the start of something if we can combine those two projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESouthrenrock, thank you for your input. I have definitely been there. Check out the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55401\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECommunity Mods and Plugins Library\u003C/a\u003E. Definitely helps until we can come up with a better solution. Also, many of the Authors here post to more than one location. If curse is down then there is a good bet the mod is hosted elsewhere. Check that Community Mods list. It has links to the mod thread on this forum and those will have all the up to date links from github, dropbox, mediafire, curse, kerbal stuff, google drive etc\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYea sorry, my reply was a bit to strong and got deleted...Fact is, Im extremely frustrated by the way KSP handles mods. Im use to messing around with files, editing .ini\u0027s, editing configs etc etc, so getting into the core of games isnt a big deal to me or new, so please dont consider me an \u0027outsider just tuning in\u0027 because I honestly feel like Im not. Ive been playing and modding games for nearly 10 years, I may be new to this forum, but not new to KSP or modding in general. But normally when I deal with mods for games, you have a few options, either you have a few great mods, you manually edit files and once tweaked, thats really about it because most games updates last more than a month or two, or you have a really awesome mod manager (NEXUS). I understand that KSP is new, but geez, it is incredibly frustrating how hard it is to maintain mods that break, then trying to find them. Yea, most mods break with updates, I get that, no biggy, but when I have 57 files in my game data, some called tree loader, resgen, us core, parts, open resource system, Im not going to remember each individual mod I downloaded a month ago. I only know of a few by heart, Mechjeb and KW. Others, I just DL on a whim because they look awesome and I want to play with them. Once mods break, I doubt I will find it again in the forums because posts do get buried so quickly. The mod libary does help, but is still a far cry from the sheer volume that is out their. And sorry, but with only using CURSE a handful of times and then not even being able to access it anymore on Chrome or firefox due to some glitch that I cant figure out...yea curse is a big pile, not only that, but half the community isnt even on it. NEXUS is by far the easiest, and my opioun the way that the community needs to move to. Most people who use mods, are comfortable with dropping files into their computer...the majority of users that will come in the future probably wont be and either A) not be comfortable doing so (I do know of these people) \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E want a simpler plug and play method or c) completely disregard mods because they are such a hassle. I can only say this from my experience, but mods for this game ARE AWESOME!!! the quality and sheer love for the work is like no other, so please come together and find a better solution so this wonderful work can be accessed by others easier. If I am frustrated, thats pretty bad. Love you guys\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003E\u0022TheAlmightyOS: That example cuts both ways.

Frankly, unless you\u0027ve tried to support a mod in the week after a new version of KSP comes out, you have \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eliterally no idea how much work, and how much user anger, you have to deal with.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut thats part of the big problem I have. After a month goes by, I have no clue what to even google. Hmm, awesome solar panel mod... best one is near future technologies, but that isnt the one Im looking for...because its gotten buried, after about 2 days I finally found the one I wanted, deleted the parts that didnt work and just kept the parts I wanted and have a previous non working mod working just fine(Kosmos). I cannot speak for other users who swamp you with problems, I for one have never submitted a problem ticket. I accept that their will be bugs and that things are being worked on. I move on, read threads, play other games and come back later when things work a little better. Mods are finicky and things happen. I want modders to spend their time making the mod, not reading a list of false reports. And you are right, I do not know how much work you have to deal with, all I can do is post in forums when others feel the same way and hope things can change. And unzipping a single zip file also isnt a problem, but it is when I have 50\u002B that I have to spend a day searching for those zip files because they are buried in the forum posts. A few dont have good links in their first page and you have to hunt through 100 pages in for a updated link. Oh, 2 days later half break due to a hot fix \u0026gt;X..... The problem isnt your single zip file, its the sheer volume of zip files that is the problem. I want to support ALL THE MODS and see all the hard work EVERYONE has done....but as of now, its nearly impossible to do so. We need the forums not to be the main source for DL links, we need one place where outside people can access peoples mods....Some may say Curse, but I firmly believe in Nexus.

They are producing a product, that product is highly modifiable, much like a JK Jeep Wrangler, or a EG6 Honda Civic. Once the customer has purchased their product, they no longer have control over what that customer does with it as long as they don\u0027t try and rebrand it and sell it as their own. So right now the company SQUAD can say at anytime, we no longer support mods to our product, and shut that section of the forums down. That is their right as the copyright holder. But what they cannot do is stop people from modifing the game code on their own and continue to play the game however they want, as long as no one is making a profit on these mods it is completely legal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the same with cars. You can take a Jeep Wrangler, throw a 4 inch lift on it, some 35 inch BFG tires, and a massive winch on the front, and Chrysler can\u0027t say a thing to you. But if you take that vehicle and try and sell it as your own work and as a new car, Chrysler can stop you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheAlmightyOS","CreatedById":105590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-05T06:09:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022 data-cite=\u0022HoneyFox\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell I would suggest the author of OP to change the title to: Mod Repository Divided... that\u0027s the case the author is talking about If i get the point...\u003Cp\u003EModding community?

I saw the SpacePort all but twice. Did not own the game back then, just looking and wishing and dreaming.But then I did finally get KSP and immediately started looking for mods so I could build the spaceplane I had in my head. What I found was utter chaos. Squad had changed their modding site to Curse, mod authors resisted this change even going as far as creating their own hosting site, Kerbal Stuff. But for most, the KSP Forum was their showcase and the cloud was their host. No easy way to browse, search or even check for updates. Not being new to this sort of thing (I work with developers, after all) I decided I wanted to help. I found many that thought like I did, trying to make tools and meta-repositories that could bring order to chaos. But there are so many, which was the problem in the first place. Too many options. I had my own idea, a dev tool for modders that would package their mod in a standardized way and send it to all current hosting locations. That went over so well that no one posted to that thread. So did my idea of picking a single host point. The mod authors complained so badly for a \u0022don\u0027t care\u0022 option that one of the Moderators had to add it to the poll. I have been over this so many times in my head, thinking of a standardized way to get mod from author to user without trying to force the authors to do anything out of their normal process. And then I think back to the \u0022I don\u0027t care\u0022 attitude and get just a tad pissedAll of the Mod Authors here. You. I am angry at you. YOU ARE GEN 1. You are the masters. You are the originals that all KSP modders will emulate years from now. Your actions now will have a drastic impact on the KSP mod community of the future! And right now you are doing NOTHING* to put this community together. Everyone has got their own way of doing things and they don\u0027t care about what others do. BUT YOU SHOULD CARE! When KSP goes 1.00.0 is THIS how you want YOUR modding community to work?! Just a bunch of announcements on a forum pointing to github or dropbox or mediafire or [putyourhosthere]? Right now the Add-on Releases and Projects Showcase has 1100\u002B threads. Do you think the forum could handle 2000 more and still be the slightest bit useful? How would someone find your mod? How would someone even browse though all that if they are just looking at what you guys have to offer? Especially those of you that do not update often cause there is no need to. Your mod would be all the way back on page 40-something. Is this what you want? No? THEN TALK ABOUT IT!No one wants to tell you guys what to do. You guys do an awesome job making mods. But you all need to come together as the leaders of this community and have a nice long chat about the direction you all want to take moving into the future. You don\u0027t have to pick a single hosting site or even package your mods a specific way. Just start a dialog!

Although this thread has not gone to plan I have already learned a few things. The most important thus far, the blowback of supporting your mods. I could see why some modders might want to keep the pool of potential users small. It was something I did not realize mod authors would have to deal with though I go though that sort of thing every day. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is more I want to learn. I want to learn about your processes, how you deal with KSP updates and how you handle support requests when you do get them. I want to know your difficulties and what works (which sounds like almost everything) and what doesn\u0027t\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not claim to have a grand plan. I have no fix all. Hell, all I got is a few fragments of various ideas, mostly borrowed from projects all over KSP\u0027s forum and a few from other modding communities. My goal is to talk to you all and maybe, hopefully, walk away with an idea. That\u0027s all there is here. Because everyone has been telling you guys how to fix \u0022your\u0022 problem (you guys don\u0027t have the problem). I am comming here, asking the mod authors questions so that I can fix the user problems. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope I am being more clear now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The user issues: I am going to use my own experience. I consider myself an advanced user being that I can mod myself just not in this game yet (I will find time to figure out unity soon). I can *install* (unzip and drop in a folder) mods and for the most part troubleshoot them myself. *IF* I know the name of the mod I want I can find it easily via the forum or google but I mostly use the Community Library. Though it doesn\u0027t list them all. Checking my MODS folder (I keep a zip of all my mods pre-install so I can find them again if I need to update) shows 34 mods. That is 34 Mods that may or may not have dependencies, are dependencies themselves. These are all the latest versions, compiled for 0.24.1. It has taken me a week to collect and cultivate this collection of mods. I have not played not a single hour of KSP this week other than to test mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf 0.25 came out tonight, it would start all over again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is the users issue. I know it is not the Mod authors problem and I am not asking you guys to make it your problem. It\u0027s my problem. It is the one I have chosen to fix. And I would like to talk to you all, learn, think, put pieces together. Come up with ideas on the fly (like post 16. Won\u0027t someone talk about post 16?). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat you think guys? Can we be civil and talk?
