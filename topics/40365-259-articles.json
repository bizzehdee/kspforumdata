First, you jump to a position at a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 phase angle from your start. Then you wait for the sun\u0027s gravity to slow you down to near 0m/s (this will be faster the closer you are to the sun, I believe) before you jump again, this time to -90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 from your destination.

If you\u0027re at ~0 or ~180 relative phase, this is just a matter of skipping one of the stops above. Otherwise, if you\u0027re not inclined to do the maths, you have to look at the \u0022map\u0022 of the solar system, visualize the velocity vector of your origin and destination and in particular the difference, go to the place where the sun will accelerate you along that difference, and then jump to the destination.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lightwarrior","CreatedById":93585,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T01:12:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022xfrankie\u0022 data-cite=\u0022xfrankie\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlright, microwave power once again... \u003Cp\u003E2x 3.75m Fusion reactor, each with their own pair of generators (one direct conversion \u002B one thermal), Transmitter on the top. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow it manages to drain 150% of produced power is beyond me, however that doesn\u0027t concern me as much as the fact that the Transmitter will actually shutdown the Reactors, because it drains simply everything and that causes loss of power to heat the reactor plasma...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter I set up my first powerplant (in the pic is 2nd, 1st one was recovered) I flew a 500 days mission to Dres.

As it currently stands, the reaction appears to consume Hydrogen Peroxide and Ammonia, and produce only Monopropellant. But the actual NET reaction is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2 H2O2 \u002B 4 NH3 --\u0026gt; 4 H2O \u002B 2 N2H4\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote the production of TWICE as much water as there is Hydrogen Peroxide consumed in the reaction (the Ammonia acts as a hydrogen-donor to the Hydrogen Peroxide) or Hydrazine produced. Since water is a useful resource, and Water Electrolysis has already given us the ability to turn it into LFO mix, the reaction should be *FIXED* to yield the proper products (Hydrazine *AND* Water).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee the following thread I started for a more in-depth discussion of all the equations I mentioned here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68797-In-Situ-Resource-Utilization-Useful-Reactions\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/68797-In-Situ-Resource-Utilization-Useful-Reactions\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S. It seems to me, you currently have all the right resources implemented- Water, Ammonia, Hydrogen/LF, Oxygen/Oxidizer, Methane, and Monopropellant. You just need more of the reactions that allow these resources to be dynamically inter-converted, and fully utilized WITHOUT waste (such as producing twice as much Methane as you can burn) in the real world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.P.S. What are the chances you could allow a back-conversion of Methane into Kethane? This would at least allow SOME recycling of Methane for Hydrogen (LiquidFuel), without needing to throw out half our Methane stockpiles until you implement Methane pyrolysis- and would also allow it to be fed into other mods already utilizing Kethane- such as Orbital Contruction Re-Redux mod\u0027s 3D printer- which turns Kethane into RocketParts. Useful and semi-realistic since, with a couple more steps processing (don\u0027t make me show you the reactions necessary) you can turn Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Gas into long-chain hydrocarbons (or hydrocarbons of any desired length) via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction, and then turn the long-chain hydrocarbons into structural plastics...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-02-08T03:18:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/08/2014 03:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xfrankie","CreatedById":93378,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-08T03:43:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lightwarrior\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis may be called \u0022known bug\u0022, transmitter will try to transmit power based on both generators maximum power which will cause it to transfer more than is produced.
