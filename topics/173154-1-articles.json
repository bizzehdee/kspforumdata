The vessel can easily go up through suborbital trajectory first, and then circularizing and making it orbital at an AP/PE height between 90 and 110km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t understand why I\u0027m not able to achieve the green flags of tourists and vips mission that want to go suborbital and then orbital. I\u0027m trying to bring up to space 2 tourists and 1 VIP right now but I can\u0027t complete the mission. I feel like they don\u0027t \u0022see\u0022 I\u0027m passing through a parabolic flying trajectory to reach a suborbital trajectory. And I don\u0027t understand why they don\u0027t see it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have read several topics about the suborbital flight on KSP, so I understood I have to:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Bring AP above 70km\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Keep PE below 70km\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf these are the only two requirements, I don\u0027t understand why I can\u0027t have green flags for the suborbital flight in the tourist and vip missions, because I fulfill these 2 requirements very easily with my vessel. So I kept reading around in some threads and I also understood:\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Maybe having no acceleration while passing 70km of height with the vessel? I mean, keeping a constant speed adjysting it with an engine like the LV-45?\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) Maybe having a particular eccentricity (not too high or too low, so keeping the trajectory not too straight up in the sky or not too flat)?\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) Maybe passing the 70km height with a speed not too fast (I did dozens of tests with a velocity between the 500 and 1200 m/s)?\u003Cbr\u003E\n6) Maybe passing the 70km height with engines shut down?\u003Cbr\u003E\n7) Maybe passing the 70km height with the vessel lined up parallel to the terrain (pointed at the border between the blue and brown parts of the navball?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried for some days with little changes of these variables, reaching different speeds, or AP altitudes, or circularizing the suborbital trajectory, or keeping a specific heading while flying, etc etc... but only 1 time, and I don\u0027t know how I did it, I took the green flags for the suborbital flight, now I can\u0027t have it anymore. I think maybe I\u0027m flying my vessel in the wrong way, but playing around with the variables I can manipulate (velocity, heading, acceleration, AP, PE, etc) doesn\u0027t give me any result. What I\u0027m missing? What really are all the requirements for this missions to reach? What are their ranges to make someone achieve the green flag easily?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you to everyone for their help...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElWanderer","CreatedById":114015,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-28T22:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBased on the v1.4.2 changelog I\u0027ve just read, it sounds like this was a bug that they\u0027ve now fixed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt; * Fix tourist contracts not completing correctly and messages for tourist contracts causing NRE and infinite rewards when failing\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-28T22:23:22Z\u0022 title=\u002203/28/2018 10:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 28, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by ElWanderer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bewing","CreatedById":154251,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-29T00:20:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bug that people were seeing involved getting the \u0022orbital\u0022 checkmark.
