However for those of us who don\u0027t want career mode completely gutted and rebuilt, but rather made better (like myself), then I have a few ideas for what could be added to better take advantage of KSP\u0027s mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOriginally I was going to package these ideas with the KSP story concept I\u0027ve been threatening but after some discussion with others a few months back it was decided that the attempt would likely be at best a \u0022Fan Works\u0022 idea and too overly debated for it to be enjoyed as a real suggestion. So I dropped work on it. These mechanics I\u0027m suggesting were to be utilized in this \u0027story mode\u0027, but seeing as it likely won\u0027t be, I can at least not let the ideas and concepts die with my story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Ci\u003EFirstly;\u003C/i\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EBuild payloads to fit within operational margins.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhether it be to fit within a set fairing shape or even making sure the payload can be lifted by a set lifter; being restrained by the launch vehicle is a real life situation which many payload developers must work with.

Now this never went anywhere as with the introduction of science it was more important to see if the base game worked without extra difficulties such as part limiters. Now that we\u0027re far beyond the olden days of .21, I\u0027d like to see that aspect return.\u00A0We can assume that the parts are naturally built overtime but you\u0027d also be capable of gather parts and whatever parts you reuse could return in this \u0027amount in stock counter\u0027 (an additional bonus for reusing hardware!). Aspects like this would give even more separation of career mode from sandbox whereas career mode is simply sandbox with a budget and a limitation of what parts you can access. Course this could be a game setting that for those who don\u0027t want to bother, can be disabled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ci\u003EFinally; \u003C/i\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I mentioned before, and in conjunction with reason 3; you should be able to collect scraps and \u0027parts found on the side of the road\u0027 and be able to use them despite them not being in the players tech tree. They\u0027d likely get no description on the part aside from information on it\u0027s mass. Like missing Kerbals, these parts wouldn\u0027t be locatable via map or long distance but rather after closing in past a set range. With things like this, it would encourage players to go on sight seeing flights hoping for locating things as well as give players something to do during those long flights to destinations. These parts would generate randomly every game and continue to as the game goes on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIn Conclusion\u003C/em\u003E...\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP has many aspects which are bland as far as career mode however unlike others, I\u0027m not entirely convinced it\u0027s a lost cause. There\u0027s still lots of room for improvement or change before I want to give it my final opinion. The game just needs more content as far as science mode. I feel it\u0027s bland because it\u0027s tasks are simple with nothing to do in the time leading up to it. With more tasks and more to do while waiting to complete them, they should become not only more bearable, but also more enjoyable as a whole. Granted again, the majority of this was to implemented alongside of a story so I hope you understand where these concepts were coming from and they initially weren\u0027t intended to just be added to KSP\u0027s career mode as is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, that said, thanks for reading and let me know your thoughts.
