Whats the flight profile of an reusable Falcon 9 that launches to LEO and lands on land? Im especialy interested about the point of separation (remaining fuel in the first stage, Delta-V of the second stage).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

Are there other reentry vehicles with a reusable heat shield? What materials do they use?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. How much servicing did the RS-25 need until it could fly again. Which parts did need to be replaced how often? How often did they have to replace the whole engine and why?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. What kind of serving did the other spaceshuttle propulsion components (RCS/OMS) need?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOther questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. Are there non-toxic propelants for RCS/orbital maneuvering (with higher thrust, usable for stuff like docking)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Are there numbers of reentry temperature of low desity objects like the orange tank of the space shuttle?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Is an aerospike usefull if its only used in more than 50km of height? Any advantage other than the good ISP scaling from groundlevel to space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout electrical propulsion:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9. If i understand that correctly for a given electrical power you can choose between higher ISP or higher thrust of an ion thruster or VASIMR. How does that relation look like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n10. Are there Ion engines powered by Argon instead of Xenon or highly corosive elements like Mercury? How does the performance change?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n11. Whats the best power/mass we currently have for solar panels?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n12. How fast do solar cells degenerate in interplanetary space?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n13. How would a low thrust transfer to mars look like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n14. How long would it take to achive earth escape velocity with electrical propulsion?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore other questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n15. Are there regular free return trajectorys for mars? How much delta-v do they need at earth, whats the relative velocity to mars on flyby, whats the relative velocity when back at earth?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n16. How harsh is areocapture on mars when coming on a hohmann trasfer orbit? Does it require an ablative heatshield? How bad is it on the way back to earth?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm sure there will be more...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-05T22:24:32Z\u0022 title=\u002212/05/2015 10:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Elthy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kunok","CreatedById":147982,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-05T19:28:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the only I know without need for research:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6- Buran used a kerosene and oxygen based OMS, turbine-fed with a relatively good isp.
