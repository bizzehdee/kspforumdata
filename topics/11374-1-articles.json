The AIAA BDF is the coolest thing I have done in my life. The challenges are interesting I learn tons about aerospace. Because I love the AIAA DBF so much, I have modified the rules from each year to work for KSP. Learn more about the AIAA DBF at [http://www.aiaadbf.org/](http://www.aiaadbf.org/)\n\n-1997 Contest \n\nFor the 1996/97 contest year aircraft will be designed to provide the maximum range for a given fuel weight. Range will be determined from the maximum number of complete laps made over the specified flight course (see below).\n\n![course.gif](http://www.aiaadbf.org/1997_files/images/course.gif)\n\nEach aircraft must\n\nComplete a take-off before the runway ends\n\nComplete as many laps of the flight course as possible with the available fuel.\n\nLand on the runway.\n\nPartial laps do not count.\n\nTo encourage people to accurately predict the available range of their entry, a one lap penalty will be added for aircraft which land on the runway but not within the 90 meter landing zone. Aircraft which land off of the resized runway will receive no score for that flight.\n\nYou only get one jet fuel tank. \n\nYou must carry 4 kg of dead mass. This mass can\\\u0027t do anything. Can\\\u0027t provide structure, can\\\u0027t provide crew, can\\\u0027t provide lift.\n\nNo components may be dropped from the aircraft at any time during the flight.\n\nStock Parts are only allowed\n\n-1998 Contest\n\nAircraft will be judged on the maximum number of complete laps over the specified flight course completed within the 7 minute period. The course consists of:\n\n![course.gif](http://www.aiaadbf.org/1998_files/images/course.gif)\n\nThe craft must make an un-assisted takeoff, your plane must be higher then 20 meters before the end of the runway. \n\nNo components may be dropped from the aircraft at any time during the flight.\n\nThe craft will then complete one pace lap before timing begins. The pace lap ends at the beginning of the runway. \n\nAfter completing as many laps as passible in 7 mins the aircraft must land on the runway. Any run that fails to make the runway will not count. \n\nIf the craft suffers any damage during a run it will be invalid. \n\nYou must carry 4 kg of dead mass. This mass can\\\u0027t do anything. Can\\\u0027t provide structure, can\\\u0027t provide crew, can\\\u0027t provide lift. \n\nStock parts only. \n\nI\\\u0027ll add the other years if you guys like these."},{"CreatedByName":"zombiphylax","CreatedById":5471,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-26T01:28:42Z","Content":"What kind of dead weight will you accept?
