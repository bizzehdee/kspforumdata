The AIAA BDF is the coolest thing I have done in my life. The challenges are interesting I learn tons about aerospace. Because I love the AIAA DBF so much, I have modified the rules from each year to work for KSP.

Range will be determined from the maximum number of complete laps made over the specified flight course (see below).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.aiaadbf.org/1997_files/images/course.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022course.gif\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach aircraft must\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplete a take-off before the runway ends\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComplete as many laps of the flight course as possible with the available fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartial laps do not count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo encourage people to accurately predict the available range of their entry, a one lap penalty will be added for aircraft which land on the runway but not within the 90 meter landing zone.
