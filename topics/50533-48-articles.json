However doing so fixed a number of what I suspect were conflict related issues associated with multiple mods having been installed (likely in the wrong order, cuz that\u0027s just how I roll) and has my game running fine. However, between KAS, MKS and TAC I had something like 90 or so individual little boxes to click. Anything to make that faster would be good but I\u0027ll put up with it if it means after I do so all my stuff WORKS. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESarbian has you covered on making the researching faster, too: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78067\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78067\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mischief","CreatedById":105311,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T04:55:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022undercoveryankee\u0022 data-cite=\u0022undercoveryankee\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESarbian has you covered on making the researching faster, too: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78067\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/78067\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is forged in the fires of Orodruin out of solid AWESOME. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dielos","CreatedById":28547,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T09:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, I\u0027m getting this error on the debug toolbar on game start:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E[Exception]: InvalidProgramException: Assembly: ModuleManager.2.2.1 at location: D:\\Alpha Games\\KSP_win64\\GameData\\ModuleManager.2.2.1.dll is not in the expected assembly.
