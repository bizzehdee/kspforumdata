to control the blades when you assign them different control authority. I have found it to be frustrating at times as I would like to manually assign the collective and cyclic control. Even changing the pitch of the craft will cause the game to change how the rotors are controlled. The easiest way is to just use the powerful reaction wheels in the game to help orient the helicopter. It is possible to create your own systems for controlling the blades and/or yaw, pitch, roll control (which it sounds like you have already done). The tutorial I made was just to demonstrate a simple, beginner friendly\u00A0 helicopter. I did make a Chinook style helicopter tutorial as well. I was also frustrated with getting the controls to work right. In testing, I did come up with a system similar to yours using the torque limiter, but it did not lend itself to a beginner friendly tutorial. In the end I went the simple rout and relied on the reaction wheels for Yaw control.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022113\u0022 width=\u0022200\u0022 data-embed-src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/vicF-eNTcz0?feature=oembed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"asap1","CreatedById":209758,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-24T00:25:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor some reason on console I cant find a setting for deploy angle on blades\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echo__3","CreatedById":204997,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-04-24T00:58:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223959812\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022201891\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221619223939\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022209758\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022asap1\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n32 minutes ago, asap1 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nfor some reason on console I cant find a setting for deploy angle on blades\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think console uses some different terminology.
