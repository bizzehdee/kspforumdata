If i say downloaded the FASA Mercury to Apollo pack and say i just wanted the Gemini lander legs (the gold ones) only. Is it possible to drag and drop those into the KSP GameData folder and then use them? Or would that not work?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is possible, would some one be kind enough to explain to me in simple terms how i would go about getting those legs into kerbals without installing the whole pack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks all.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-05T10:06:10Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2014 10:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by sumghai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EEdited thread title for clarity\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Razgriz1","CreatedById":88541,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T00:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere happens to be a very handy little text file included in the FASA folder that is titled \u0022How to Delete Parts.txt\u0022 There is even a pretty handy example that Frizzank gives that tells how to do so. Read this file and you should be able to figure it out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, since the landing legs are pretty simple parts with no complicated modules that aren\u0027t in the stock game, you can pretty much ignore the warnings at the end of the text file that warns you against deleting the folders that he lists. None of these apply to the landing legs file and can be safely deleted without fear of breaking the part. That being said, if I got something wrong and it turns out that deleting these does break something, you can always just put them back in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr: Just delete every folder besides the folder FASA_Gemini_Lander_Leg_Part and you should be good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT:\u003C/strong\u003E After testing by following exactly what I said at the end, this works perfectly.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-05T00:21:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/05/2014 12:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Razgriz1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jabbashouse","CreatedById":119643,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-05T07:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Razgriz1,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help and support, it works very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: If i double posted this, it was because the \u0022Reply to Thread\u0022 messed up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
