Basically each plugin has it\u0027s own folder under GameData, in the KSP directory. For example, In your GameData folder, you will see Squad. This is the folder where the default game items are. You don\u0027t have to worry about what\u0027s inside the Squad folder. For plugin install purposes, you can ignore that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis plugin will have a Kethane folder. The Kethane folder has subfolders too, but you don\u0027t have to worry about those, just drop the Kethane folder, along with all the subfolders and files, into Gamedata. Now you have Squad \u0026amp; Kethane. If you get KAS, the Kerbal Attachement System, it\u0027s the same process. Just drop the KAS folder in to GameData, and now the GameData folder contains Squad, Kethane, \u0026amp; Kas. Make sure you don\u0027t end up with this path:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWrong: Kerbal Space Program/GameData/GameData/Kethane/*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrect: Kerbal Space Program/GameData/Kethane/*\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost mods install this way. Others sometimes include ship\u0027s as well, and these get dropped into your Kerbal Space Program/Ships folder. Either Ships/SPH (hanger - Planes) or Ships/VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building - Rockets). Occasionally a Mod will need to put a file in the root GameData folder, such as ModuleManager, but that should be evident in the zip file structure of the Mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWolfschadowe\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KhaosCorp","CreatedById":61149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-22T18:15:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ludsoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ludsoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan we get some way to harvest kethane from water?\u003Cp\u003EId love to see kethane rig designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.alaska-in-pictures.com/data/media/17/monopod-oil-platform_3221.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022monopod-oil-platform_3221.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing modified KAS winches I have mined Kethane on Kerbin to depths of 1.2km.

It was more of a pain than manually configuring my mods, and actually caused a bunch of problems that were only fixed by clearing out all mods and reinstalling them manually. It\u0027s possible that all those problems were my fault but frankly I\u0027m not willing to try again to find out.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust to be clear here, in this context ModuleManager is a DLL written by Ialdaboth and maintained by Sarbian which allows you to use a simple configuration file to modify the part definitions of anything in your game without having to hand-edit the parts, so the tweaks can safely persist across installations of updates to the mods that you are tweaking. It also means that several mods can make changed that they wish to, to stock parts for example, without there being any clashes or over-writes to the parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is NOT an application that manages what mods you have installed, which I believe is what you are referring to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majiir","CreatedById":7550,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-23T12:24:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00225thHorseman\u0022 data-cite=\u00225thHorseman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs there a reason you\u0027re not releasing an official tech-tree-ready version of the parts.cfg?\u003Cp\u003E...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m just curious and knowing would affect whether or not I wait or just throw everything in tier 0 and be done with it.

I encourage people to post MM configs. I\u0027m working on a number of things for KSP and I\u0027m relatively busy otherwise, so career mode support is a low priority. (Why? Career mode has no endgame. Mods are all about endgame.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I can get to working on Kethane in the next few days, my first priority will be solving the performance issues with the map screen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
