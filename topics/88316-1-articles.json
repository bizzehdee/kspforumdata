I don\u0027t mean FTL ships, but physics. You know, the light from our Sun reaches Earth in eight minutes, so the Sun we see now is actually Sun eight minutes ago. That kind of stuff. Nothing too fancy, ofc, to keep PCs from melting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo when you look at, lets say Eeloo, from Kerbin (Distance roughly 4,25 light minutes (calculated from Eeloo\u0027s Semi-major axis and when the planets are on same side of the sun)), Eeloo is actually 4,25 minutes ahead than you see on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T20:08:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would make sense if we were actually observing the various objects from kerbin\u0027s surface. However the only time you can really see the other planetary bodies from distances that would invoke meaningful FLT lag is in map view. Map view is already either a simulated map or a gods\u0027eye view. I just think it would be kinda pointless and not add much value to gameplay. for example if you invoked FLT lag on the map view it would throw off intercept planing unless you mathed things out by hand. However even in RL we plan interplanetary travel off where our simulations and models of the solar system says the planets are, not where the apparent, time laged visual is so its more logical to consider map mode a simulated solar system anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout the only time I could see this simulation as makeing any meaningful change is if you were runing the distant objects enhancement pack so you could see the distant planets easier. even then all it would do is shift them a fraction of a degree one way or another on the starfield. Sounds like alot of effort for an effect you\u0027d never notice without a side by side comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Las-pen","CreatedById":121174,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T21:15:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the location of planets could be calculated from where the ship is, not where the camera is (which would be pretty trippy to scroll in and/or out really fast). You leave Kerbin in FTL speeds and watch the planet go backwards in its orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s stirr the soup a little bit and take Einstein\u0027s Relativity theory in consideration. The faster thing goes and the closer they are to a massive object the slower they age. Don\u0027t know what the game would gain, since kerbals don\u0027t age, but maybe it would affect missions running on background somehow. You launch a mission, set a course to Jool and return to space centre to do a quick M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnlanding while the first one reaches its destination and then notice that time goes at different speed to the deep space mission than the m\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HorusKol","CreatedById":117326,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T22:14:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think the fastest I\u0027ve been in KSP (admittedly, only to get to Eve and Duna) is on the order of 10,000 m/s (give or take 10,000 m/s)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpeed of light is \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E299\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E792458 m/s\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:sans-serif;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESo, I\u0027ve travelled at about 0.003% of the speed of light\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_speed\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_speed\u003C/a\u003E - \u003Cstrong\u003Erelativistic speed is a speed which is a significant proportion of the \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Espeed of light\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt then states that this is at about 10% of the speed of light - which is 30,000 time faster than \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re not going to see much in the way of relativistic effect unless you burn a long, long time...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aegrim","CreatedById":2155,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-23T22:47:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn my phone so can\u0027t link, but have you looked at the satellite network mod?

This isn\u0027t for modeling/programming reasons, it\u0027s because of time dilation. Time passes differently for the ship moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light than it does for a station orbiting Kerbin or at KSC. The kerbolar system would also appear flattened to the fast vessel, and that would probably be pretty tough to get right. It would all pass by in the blink of an eye moving at relativistic speeds, anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, as much as I like for things to have realistic physics, I think KSP is much better without.
