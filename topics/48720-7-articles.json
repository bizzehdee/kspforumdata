Ranges on your equipment are labelled. Unlike stock KSP where you can kinda just stick whatever antennae you think look good on a ship, these antennae all have unique characteristics. Also, one of the fluff paragraphs points out the antenna the comes already turned on. It\u0027s the one I described earlier. (And I think you mentioned it) Looks like a small block with two antennae sticking out each end. Mounts radially. Put one of those on EVERYTHING that isn\u0027t operated by a kerbal. That way, you can send a command to IT to turn on the other antennae.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn Commsats: When you build your longer range stuff, I suggest a hub-sat with multiple dishes and antennae. It\u0027ll pretty much be a ship in its own right. So plenty of power, batteries, and make ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that you dedicate one specific dish to always pointing at kerbin. If you break the connection with kerbin, and you\u0027re out of range of omnis, the sat\u0027s dead for a long time. (At least until you can get a vessel up that either gets it a new link, or you send up a six-kerb mission control vessel and get it into range of an omni.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlan accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, a tip for you from me thanks to math.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a commsat array in orbit at 742 km. This is the minimum orbital altitude for a single satellite to see the entirety of the kerbin hemisphere. You\u0027ll be able to use the commutron 16 and not require any dishes for ground or inter-satellite communications in this ring. (Maximum distance between sats would be 2,684 km. Give or take a few km for how accurately you can get the orbits to 742... Well inside the 3,000 km range of the commutron 16.) This will act as a good starting array and allow you to operate remote vessels around kerbin without blackouts. 4 is the minimum needed, but I suggest six or so to have overlaps in surface coverage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Daisai","CreatedById":78873,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T22:56:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust wondering though , this does work in sandbox mode or is this for career since you talked about sending science data back to ksc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made a commsat now with 4 5 dishes 4 facing each side and one facing to the top also gave it every single antenne i could find, however so far i have not been able to get a connection between 2 of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso when i read the part labels when making the sattelites it doesnt show any ranges only a text which gives a hint as to what the range is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso with the remote control of vessels, isnt that already possible ? because that kinda makes me wonder whats the point of this mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cpdv.home.xs4all.nl/KSP%202013-11-14%2000-04-23-16.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202013-11-14%2000-04-23-16.jpg\u0022\u003E Thats the one i made, do those dishes work aswell ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-13T23:05:33Z\u0022 title=\u002211/13/2013 11:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Daisai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Demon_82","CreatedById":81626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-13T23:23:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt works both in career and in sandbox, in both modes not getting signal to KSC prevents you to control your ships, in career also prevents you to send science data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s four omni antennas in the latest RT2 download from 7 days ago:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERTShortAntenna1......Reflectron DP10 (dipole)......automatically activated.........500.000Km range.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERTLongAntenna1.......Communotron 16................manually activated............2.500.000Km range.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERTLongAntenna2.......Communotron 32................manually activated............5.000.000Km range.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERTLongAntenna3.......ComTech EXP-VR-2T............manually activated............3.000.000Km range.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a matter of activating antennas as son as you get over that 70Km atmospheric limit to not see them self destroying due to pressure, and calculating at a glance the spread and height of your satellites belt around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso dishes have a range from 40Mm to 400Gm, and in my game I can see it in every one, the two stock dishes and the four or five included with the plugin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you need to have line of sight between satellites, and at least with KSC from one of them.
