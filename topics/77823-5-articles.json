So allowing people to get back into career after failing is most important for the early versions of this mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else can be changed in the options, carrer is supposed to be very customizable, so everyone gets the experience he want. There are already a lot of options allowing you to go full iron-man mode on your missions, in the \u003Cem\u003Efirst carrer update\u003C/em\u003E. On this basis it\u0027s absurd to argue SQUAD tries to make the game easy for everyone. And if it\u0027s not hardcore enough? Let them know, they e.g. included the 64 bit version early just because of community feedback!

Perhaps its just me but I thought the game was doing quite well already. It seems to have been selling well on steam, there are countless people putting effort into designing stock craft and mods, and plenty of folks on Youtube and Twitch taking time out of their lives to make videos of something they find cool.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd these folks are all playing .23.5, which doesn\u0027t even have a contracts system implemented.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, .24 is apparently going to include a science mode for those that want the current game system to stay as it is. The devs at SQUAD I believe are well aware that different folks like to play KSP different ways, and they\u0027d like to cater to as many as they can. .24 isn\u0027t the end of development, I can see contracts getting more love in the future, and eventually a failure state will make it into the game. And before then, I\u0027m quite sure someone will manage to mod one in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPoint being, I think this thread really is making a mountain out of a molehill, and at a guess, I\u0027d say its being fueled by boredom at not having .24 yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goldenpsp","CreatedById":113874,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-17T15:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sandworm\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Sandworm\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, I\u0027d say they added win64 because the community \u0022feedback\u0022 was along the lines of \u0022You said it wasn\u0027t possible, but we just did it.\u0022 I\u0027m not sure we could guilt Squad into including a game over state.
