Every rocket in vacuum has this same sort of expansion(varying with the layout of the engines... the octopus pattern of the F9v1.1 is unique to that vehicle, Soyuz has its own expansion pattern, but the principle is the same) , so just going by simple observation I\u0027d say it\u0027s reasonable to conclude that it doesn\u0027t present enough of a hindrance to be worth attempting to change. edit: Mostly right, see below...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Laval_nozzle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Laval_nozzle\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERocket engines, ideally, use this shape - to\u003Cem\u003E \u0022shape the exhaust flow so that the heat energy propelling the flow is maximally converted into directed kinetic energy.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for more reading: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzles\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine_nozzles\u003C/a\u003E It helps (and is interesting in its own right!) to read about how rocket engines work, too... they\u0027re wonderful products of science, mathematics and engineering all working together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably the most relevant bit: \u003Cem\u003E\u0022There is also a theoretical optimum nozzle shape for maximum exhaust speed, however, a shorter bell shape is typically used which gives better overall performance due to its much lower weight, shorter length, lower drag losses, and only very marginally lower exhaust speed.[9]\u0022\u003C/em\u003E So, there\u0027s some loss of efficiency but making a massive nozzle in order to counteract the effects of gas expansion would end up being less efficient than simply disregarding it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-13T11:17:25Z\u0022 title=\u002201/13/2014 11:17  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 13, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-13T11:11:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey do attempt to mitigate it by designing nozzles specifically for vacuum.
