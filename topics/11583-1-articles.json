I changed it, but it had no effect. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was able to clear the error by moving the buttons to the bottom of BeginVertical, but it re-emerged. I can also wrap them Horizontal, and it will \u0027work\u0027 by playing sounds, but having no interactive properties until the part is destroyed. It seems that this occurs after a random time, and the position of the button code appears immaterial, but I am unsure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERandomly, when MET hit 2:00m, I could drag the window; soon as I hit one of the buttons, the plugin and game crashed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAppreciate any help or direction.
