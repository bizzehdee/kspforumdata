The first probe, which was actually a rover with a long arm, made it. It then used it\u0027s rocket engine to self destruct after they realized that the rover was contaminated with Kerbin bacteria. If you want proof, you can see the second probe we sent there to experiment on it. It\u0027s readings said that it was composed of dirt, rock, and space spray paint. To organic matter found in the center was from the first probes drill, the contaminated one.
