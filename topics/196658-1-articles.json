The 64-bit version of Unity engine really open the way of mods according to me. I\u0027m playing with an i7-4771 and a GTX560Ti and 16GB DDR3 for almost 6 years now. Recently I experience some crash due to \u0022out of memory\u0022 exceptions, my 16GB were all used by KSP, so I upgraded to 32GB DDR3 and I was back to the game \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EBut still my config is pretty old and I could have the opportunity to test an RTX2080Ti in place of my 560Ti. It helps quite a bit to be honest. But this week I had another opportunity\u00A0to test a monster: AMD Ryzen ThreadRipper 2990WX (32 cores/64 threads), 128 GB DDR4, 2 SSDs Samsung 860 Pro 2TB in RAID0 and 2 RTX2080Ti. I was very curious to test KSP on it and I was expecting some smooth gaming experience. But it was a HUGE\u00A0\u003C/span\u003Edisappointment: with all my mods installed I run at only 20 FPS, so a tiny bit more compared to my i7 4th gen config. I play in 1920x1080 with no V-sync or FPS limit enabled, but still the CPU is running at 30% of it\u0027s max, RAM is 12% used and GPU is on holidays with only 10% usage. I check the per-thread usage, and at max one core is reaching 85% usage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo first my question is, it that normal that even at per-thread perspective, I\u0027m not running at 100% ? On my i7, all my 8 threads are usually running at 100%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI suspected the mod to limit the performances, so I did a clean install of KSP without any mod using the portable edition available on KSP website (I have 2 KSP licence : the first one bought years ago on KSP official store, and the second one bought on Steam while there was sales on the 2 DLC, it was cheaper to \u0022rebuy\u0022 KSP\u002B2 DLCs on steam that purchasing the 2 DLC on KSP store). Then I set all settings to absolute minimum : graphics at lowest possible settings and max physics deltaT to minimum as well. Then I placed a Kerbal X on the launch pad in a 1024x768 windowed game to hardly reach 60 FPS only ! This is very surprising, I expected 100\u002B FPS at least as I read on the forum that some people reached 120 FPS on a 4K resolution laptop!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo here is my second question: is there something I\u0027m missing to max out the FPS? A setting in the game or in Windows? Because clearly 60FPS is not a decent framerate for a 1024x768 without any mods and a small vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn settings I disabled V-sync, I have a fresh Windows 10 install with latest NVIDIA drivers, and Windows Power option set to \u0022High Performance\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough I know that KSP is mainly (if not solely) based on single-thread performance due to the lack of GPU computed physics or multi-thread physics in Unity engine, do you thing this is a normal situation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI see a lot of people playing with large ships in KSP. It\u0027s something I could never do before due to lack of performance (on my old config a 300-400ish parts vessel drop to 10 FPS or even lower), I hoped I could play large ship with this config, but reaching 20 FPS with my \u0022regular\u0022 size ship make me think this won\u0027t work with larger ones as well. Please help me reaching my dream of building larger ships !!! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo conclude, I apologize if my english is not perfect, I\u0027m not a native speaker \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EAll the best\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
