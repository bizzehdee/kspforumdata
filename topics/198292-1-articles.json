Inside the dome there will be a hidden primitive mesh/transform so I can use to swap with objects I want in the dome.\u00A0 This swapping will be done via EVA interaction using the parts \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m looking to code\u00A0 a mod\u00A0that will programmatically take meshes / materials already loaded into the game and have them displayed\u00A0inside the dome. Those object doesn\u0027t\u00A0 require a collider as nothing can be mounted the the mesh in the dome. The dome with have the collider,\u00A0so I\u0027m not worried about any interaction with the object in the dome as it\u00A0\u00A0would just be a visual change.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: Only\u00A0the dome model will be mentioned in the part file. The swappable materials/meshes will\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Enot \u003C/strong\u003Ebe loaded / referenced within the part, so I\u0027m\u00A0not looking at a part variant here. During gameplay, what goes in the dome will be directed by the dll and it will reference meshes loaded separately, but it will all be done in the flight scene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo...with that context, I\u0027ve been looking at the forums and read a lot about how it doesn\u0027t seem possible / hard to swap meshes in the flight scene. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022138730\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Shadowmage\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0had a few threads mentioning the difficulties\u00A0due to not being able to reinitialise the part in the flight scene.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0Is this still the case?
