And if you are more satisfied with better atmo\u0027s clouds, then use better atmo\u0027s clouds, but I do not suggest having both mods installed, as I don\u0027t think the clashing cloud layers would look good.

Here\u0027s why you can\u0027t do an overlay:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-In basics, no matter the camera angle, the rain would always look like it\u0027s moving \u0022down\u0022 relative to your camera, so if your camera is above the ship, rain is now moving sideways. A way around that would be to adjust the overlay depending on camera angle relative to ship, which would get overly complex, require several overlays, and would ultimately use more resources than reasonably wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-To the above, it would be \u0022better\u0022 to replace the overlay with a particle emitter above the camera, so you have the particle effect actually moving along a plane instead of textures, and there\u0027s a good chunk more I can do with particles than textures. But problem with this, is that you have the camera angle problem again, and to get around that would be overly complex and would end up wasting time to code when easier methods are available. Another problem would be that the rain should stop when it hits the ship, which if you have an overlay, or particle system above the camera, would require unnecessary ray-casting to see if the particle is supposed to be dead or not. A better idea than the overlay, but still not the best option so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-The option I\u0027m taking, and what I see as best fit, easiest to implement based on current systems, and functionality and the vast things that it can provide, is to have the particles that make up the clouds, emit the rain particles, through a sub-emitter system. The cloud particles give me the inherited velocity that would be imposed on the rain particle, the location for the rain to spawn from, the actual effect of the rain coming from the clouds, make the rain look like it does IRL sorta, and it can affect the surrounding terrain and vehicles, even buildings. Using this method also allows way for other weather stuff to happen, such as snow, lightning, tornadoes, and anything else I come to think of that can utilize it. Since I\u0027d using the cloud particles to obtain the inherited properties from (horizontal speed from the cloud\u0027s momentum imposed on the raindrop, height of the cloud particle, and location of the rain to spawn from, as well as a few good other properties), this makes it all the much easier to pass information on to the raindrops, and even give way to having splashing effects when the particles hit terrain or other objects. The rain could also affected by wind in this scenario, which would be simulated as an external force via the wind at the particles altitude as it falls, which wouldn\u0027t be simulated in the first two methods. This method however, would most likely be the most tasking, resource wise, but that all comes with playing around with values and the such. It\u0027d be similar to how Minecraft\u0027s framerate drops when it starts to rain, just because of all those particles being spawned. It\u0027s a different situation with the snow however, as it falls slower (do to it\u0027s flat surface imposing drag on it) and there can be less of it to cause the same effect, with lasting longer, there are less calls made to draw new particles, and this shows vast performance increases when compared to rain. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR Overlay would be too stupidly complex to implement, particles above camera can\u0027t orient properly, Rain comes from clouds, period.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tofox","CreatedById":128742,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-10T23:23:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk thanks ya that what i was wondering, btw this is so very cool and it has so much potential i can\u0027t wait to see what happens.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spacepetscompany","CreatedById":119734,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-12T03:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmmmm........

And yes, this mod has tons of potential, which is something that might end up killing the mod some day, simply because it will be too overwhelming to handle when you have so many feature requests and things to try and keep track of, not to mention when you try and implement features that aren\u0027t really given the best options available (Like how I don\u0027t see any way to set the temperature at a specific location, so I\u0027ll have to do lots of magic to try and get that to work) that can be very hard to work with and implement. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I\u0027d like it if we all kept our dreams and inspirations to a time where the mod shows that it can move that way. Yes, I have a hopes and dreams section, but it\u0027s there for hopes and dreams, something to aspire to, not to be accomplished right away. I know how ansy you guys are to have all these cool weather features, but even with the bare \u0022basics\u0022 I have now over 4 thousand lines of code, that\u0027s 4000\u002B lines of code to make it work, and it\u0027s only doing so very little.

I really appreciate all of your support, suggestions, downloads, even donations if you were so kind as to donate so I can offset some of the electrical bills and time this takes up to do.
