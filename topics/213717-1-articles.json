Some of us are Mac KSP players because, well, the M1 chip can perform better than the minimun or recommend system requirements. Sure, the graphics card is a little worse but it\u0027s great. So I think KSP2 should be available on Geforce NOW for a little while until Mac support rolls around. Because Parrellels is $99 and some of that money might be better spent on a better PC. So, I wonder if this is feasible. My YouTube channel has been kinda dying after I posted no KSP2 content, and I think all us mac users would be happy with KSP2 on Nvidia Geforce NOW\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-12T05:46:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP was on GFN but was removed a long long time ago, and there has been no indication of ever going back(legal hiccup maybe?). \u00A0 \u00A0Perhaps when KSP2 hits 1.0 they\u2019ll reconsider it \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMerged with overlapping thread \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
