Traditionally, I have played KSP using the 64 bit binary on Windows 7 Professional. Recently I switched over to the 64 bit client on Ubuntu 14.04 due to the horrid stability problems, only to run into other issues. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently I run a Xeon E3-1230 processor with an ATI HD 7950 graphics card and 16 GB of RAM; the system has traditionally been a powerhouse playing literally every game on maxed out settings (you should see Crysis 2 with the DX11 extensions on this thing!). Initially I installed Ubuntu 14.04 and used the default graphics driver just as a test run. Mostly, it runs well and the game is stable, although for some reason the system monitor crashes every time I run KSP. But I have two gripes: I\u0027m not satisfied with the performance and the game flickers when Astronomer\u0027s Pack - Interstellar v2 is installed. Plus I\u0027m kinda irked at the fact that the built in driver does not have hardware acceleration. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the next thing that I did is go to the \u0022additional drivers\u0022 section and install the fglrx driver from AMD, which I am learning is a humongous piece of junk (actually forum rules prohibit me from exactly expressing my opinions on the fglrx driver). The game will load and the flickering goes away, but the entire computer hard locks directly after loading the VAB, SPH, or an in-flight craft. This issues doesn\u0027t resolve itself unless I revert back to the open source drivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, right now I\u0027m at a loss as to what to do.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T01:58:58Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 01:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Raven.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-07T09:24:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m running the game under 14.04 as well but with a nvidia graphics card at reasonable peformance.
