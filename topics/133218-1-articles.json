But i think i have an idea that could work. The game currently has 3 dimensions to behavior: Scaledspace, Localspace, And Interiorspace. This together makes the Kerbol solar system. But scaledspace has its limits, Especially in extrasolar distances. So my suggestion would be a 4th Dimension added, Called Galaxyspace. Galaxyspace would be similar to scaled in that it consists of small scale objects magnified and used as a background for objects in local. Except Galaxyspace would be the background for scaled, It would replace the skybox, And make it possible to view distant stars.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo how would this make travel easier?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022scale_of_the_universe.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.pmylund.com/blog/content/scale_of_the_universe.jpg\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIgnore the bottom line on that picture for now, Focus on the top, You can see metaphorically that every planet has its own local region in space as any kopernicus coder will tell you, Its called an SOI but its really a separate unity scene that the spacecraft transitions into upon arrival. Then you have the solar system, Or scaledspace as we currently know it, Its a separate unity scene containing small scale models of the planets, Scaled up 6000x and\u00A0used as a background, But current scaledspace is local to kerbol, Imagine if every separate star had its own scaledspace for its system, This scaledspace would be unloaded from memory until needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother worry is that the game might not be able to do the extreme travel times due to floating point error and time warp levels, You fix this by not bothering to actually have scaled space between systems, Instead you render the distances in galaxyspace, And upon exiting a system, The scaledspace will unload and the ship will remain in a\u00A0bubble of local space to allow maneuvers along the way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next problem would be time, The simple solution to that would be to add a new level of time warp, As well as a new engine, With far higher efficiency than even ion engines, This thruster would have a very small thrust amount but would continue the function even on time warp allowing acceleration for the whole journey. The acceleration would work not by accelerating the ship itself but by speeding the movement of the local bubble within galaxy space\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe final worry would be RAM restrictions on universe size, This could be fixed by keep all planets and moons of each system unloaded until arrival into the system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RA3236","CreatedById":150734,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-01T20:56:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh...
