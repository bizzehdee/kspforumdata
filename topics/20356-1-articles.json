If you have already done this or know someone who has, please let me know. Until then I will bask in the partial glory of being the first to acheive orbit from Eve using stock parts. I did use the engineer mod, but that doesen\u0027t help with the ascent to orbit, it just displays information, which is handy for showing things such as orbital altitude in the screenshots.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I only got to orbit, I didn\u0027t do the whole round trip back to kerbin.

Now I\u0027m going to work on a rocket to take this lander out to Eve.

I am pretty sure you can shave some fuel load out of that with the same performance by using smaller tanks and jetissoning them as they get empty ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy TWR at liftoff is 1.5 (well 1.47 but I aim for 1.5), and I\u0027m also sure this design can be improved, I just liked that all the tanks were the same size. But of course in this case performance is more important.

He landed on a 11km mountain. I did some tests with my rocket, and it took the first five stages of my rocket to reach an apoapsis of 10km. This means that if I were to start on a 10km mountain on Eve, the ascent rocket would only need to weigh 30 tons, instead of the 130 tons if I launched from sea level. I think we can safely say that launching from a high mountain on Eve helps significantly.
