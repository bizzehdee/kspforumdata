Use it to get rocket orbit earth (you should be around 50k km height or something when first stage is done, just start orbiting as there should be enough vertical velocity to make it above 70k km) Also correct the orbit so that its on level with the moon orbit if it is in an angle due to the rocket tilting at the end of dem take off stage\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4.Once orbiting earth, you should have a bit of fuel left. Use that in the apopopapsos (the lower one of em -.-) to get the other one higher. For me it runs out of fuel soon, so just start the next stage and use that to lift the higher apopopsispapsis so that you can get to moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5.Orbit for 5 years until you get in moons SoI\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6.Orbit moon i guess? So that the lower thing is lower than 100k km (not sure how low it can be before problems)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7.When at lower thing, stop the ship completely so it falls straight (as straight as possible, because you dont want any horizontal velocity \u0026gt;.\u0026gt; RCS wont help much)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8.Wait until near ground\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9.Apply some thrust to slow the descending and reduce amount of horizontal velocity if you feel like it\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10.Land normally (this is where i failed in my last try, ran out of fuel at like 10 meters from ground -.- Thats why i added 3 moar fuel tanks)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11.Sit there for a week\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E12.start next stage (the first solid boosters) so that you get off the moon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E13.Start next stage of solid boosters for moar velocity\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E14.Separate the booster stacks\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15.Use remaining fuel of liquid engine to get orbit go to earth\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E16.Separate from liquid engine thing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E17.land using parachoote. You might want to save RCS fuel to slow down at the very end of parachuting to make sure you dont explode with the extra weight of the RCS tank on the command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOr just do whatever you want. Note that RCS shouldnt be usen much at all, since theres not much of it and you might want the RCS fuel at the last meters of landing to mun or kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it doesnt work because of the extra 3 fuel tanks i added, just take them off and try to optimize the flight so that you have enough fuel for landing to mun and returning (dont slow down when landing to mun until you absolutely need to?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt might lag, it looks pretty big \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
