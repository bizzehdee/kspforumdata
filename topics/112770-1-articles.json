For instance, lets say I have a fuel tank attached to another part and I want to rotate that fuel tank by exactly 91.75 degrees (don\u0027t ask why, just an example), no more, no less. Now, to my knowledge, it is impossible to get this level of precision in stock or with the editor extensions mod. So, is there any mod that can do this? If not, is there anyone interested in making such a mod?\n\nThanks in advance"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T22:59:41Z","Content":"Take a look at [Part Angle Display](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81390)"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:45:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Take a look at [Part Angle Display](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81390)\n\nThanks, that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m looking for."}]}
