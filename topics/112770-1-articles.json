For instance, lets say I have a fuel tank attached to another part and I want to rotate that fuel tank by exactly 91.75 degrees (don\u0027t ask why, just an example), no more, no less. Now, to my knowledge, it is impossible to get this level of precision in stock or with the editor extensions mod. So, is there any mod that can do this? If not, is there anyone interested in making such a mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hab136","CreatedById":75997,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T22:59:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETake a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81390\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPart Angle Display\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stratzenblitz75","CreatedById":108287,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T23:45:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022hab136\u0022 data-cite=\u0022hab136\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETake a look at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/81390\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPart Angle Display\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, that\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
