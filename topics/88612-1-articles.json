This light is produced by hot ejected material, heated by radioactive decay of heavy nuclei and/or kinetic energy from the blast depending on the type of supernova. At shorter wavelengths the peak is much narrower and corresponding more closely to the actual supernova explosion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs long as you\u0027re far enough to be outside the expanding hot ejecta, I expect you\u0027ll see more or less the same thing.
