That, again, will change the calculated orbit. This will cause small manoeuvres to jump around, but how much of an effect there will be depends how small they are compared to your orbital velocity (which is where Minmus is more trouble than other bodies), how far the centre of mass is from the root part and the ratio of SAS torque/RCS thrust to ship mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing really fine burns manually is probably easier than using automation - hit caps lock to enable fine control, enable RCS, turn off SAS and gently tap the translation keys until you\u0027re happy with the orbit.

The joys of RCS with fine control are that it shouldn\u0027t cause any rotation unless the RCS thrusters are badly placed.

For small burns I now find out where the node is currently pointing then store that vector as the aim point. Because this is fixed, that allows it to consider itself pointing in the right direction and so fire the engines... but not for very long. The burn ends when the current manoeuvre node is deemed to be pointed away from the original node, which can happen very quickly if the node is dancing around.

(with the caveat that there are lots of approaches to this... this is just my way, I don\u0027t claim it to be the best, but it works well for me).\u00A0 Since this is kinda off-topic, I\u0027ll stick the following lengthy explanation in a \u0022spoiler\u0022 section to avoid visual clutter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv

and experience.\u00A0 For a given situation (i.e. what planet or moon am I on, and how high an orbit is the target in), I just go with my \u0022gut\u0022 for deciding when the target\u0027s in the right spot for me to launch.\u00A0 I usually do pretty well.\u00A0 Partly that\u0027s because I\u0027ve done a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elot\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E of launches (which doesn\u0027t help you), and partly that\u0027s because I try to minimize the variables involved (which \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecan\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E help you) to make the visual estimation job easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example:\u00A0 Your ship\u0027s TWR has a big effect on the right position of the target when you launch.\u00A0 I control for this by keeping TWR very, very consistent.\u00A0 When launching from Kerbin, my launchpad TWR is always exactly 1.5.\u00A0 Doesn\u0027t matter whether it\u0027s a behemoth Jool mission or a tiny probe, I always use a launchpad TWR of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eexactly\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E 1.5.\u00A0 That gives me a very consistent experience on launch.\u00A0 It makes it easier for me to judge my gravity turn (I do all my flying manually, never use MechJeb or the like).\u00A0 And it makes it easy to estimate launch time to direct-intercept an orbital target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor taking off from the Mun or wherever, I have less control over that, because the TWR on takeoff will depend a lot on the specifics of ship design, how much fuel is remaining, etc.\u00A0 However, in practice that rarely matters.\u00A0 Reason:\u00A0 For most places other than Kerbin (i.e. basically everywhere but Eve, Tylo, and Laythe), the local gravity is much lower than Kerbin\u0027s, and therefore the ship\u0027s \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Elocal\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E TWR (i.e. relative to local gravity) tends to be very high.\u00A0 And for purposes of launch, gravity turn, orbital intercept, etc.:\u00A0 in practical terms, any TWR higher than 4 or so is effective infinity.\u00A0 So as long as my TWR is \u0022high\u0022 there, it doesn\u0027t make much difference whether it\u0027s 5 or 8; it works out to be the same timing on the intercept.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt also helps if there\u0027s some consistency to the altitude of the target you\u0027re aiming for.\u00A0 There are two scenarios where I want to do a direct-launch-to-intercept:\u00A0 1. rescue a kerbal in LKO (I do this a lot, it\u0027s how I populate my space program).\u00A0 2. Launch my ship to an orbiting station (e.g. space station on Kerbin, mothership in orbit around some moon).\u00A0 Keeping those altitudes consistent helps, too:\u00A0 the LKO kerbals are always about the same altitude (70-90 km), and I make a point of parking my space stations consistently at the same altitudes all the time (e.g. slightly over 120 km, for Kerbin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo:\u00A0 for any given planet or moon, I\u0027ve controlled for TWR, and I\u0027ve controlled for target altitude, which means all I need to do is remember one \u0022setting\u0022 per world.\u00A0 For example:\u00A0 \u0022Okay, this is Kerbin, and I\u0027m targeting an LKO kerbal, so that means I launch when the target is riiiiiight.... \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ethere\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u0022\u00A0 To make it visually obvious, I always switch to map view, rotate the camera so it\u0027s over the south pole and I\u0027m looking at the orbit from the side.\u00A0 In the case of LKO kerbals, my launch point is when the target is about 10 degrees above KSC\u0027s western horizon, for example.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing to do is flight technique.\u00A0 This is where I can correct any small mistakes I may have made in launch timing.\u00A0 As my ship accelerates into its suborbital arc, eventually its Ap rises close enough to the target\u0027s orbit that the game starts showing intercept markers.\u00A0 Ideally, I want the \u0022my ship\u0022 marker to be located directly underneath the \u0022target ship\u0022 marker (i.e. not ahead or behind) at the point where my Ap finally kisses the target orbit.\u00A0 So, after the markers are displayed:\u00A0 if I see that the \u0022my ship\u0022 marker is leading or lagging the \u0022target ship\u0022 marker, I can adjust my pitch to compensate.\u00A0 If the \u0022my ship\u0022 marker is lagging, I pitch down some, which makes my Ap marker move \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eforward\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E as it rises.\u00A0 If the \u0022my ship\u0022 marker is too far ahead, I pitch up some.\u00A0 The former correction is preferable to the latter, for reasons of fuel efficiency, so when I launch, it\u0027s better if I err on the side of waiting too long than launching too early.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s about it.\u00A0 \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Loren Pechtel","CreatedById":157006,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-25T16:21:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222428797\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022132886\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221456380108\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mikegarrison\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, mikegarrison said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6) Switch to the target with the [ key.
