Inspired by Temstar and his family of launch vehicles, I took some time to design and test a couple of launch vehicles of my own and came up with the Sigma I, pictured below with its dummy payload:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/riWeRzA.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022riWeRzA.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Sigma-I has a maximum lift capacity of 14.9 tons, and I\u0027ve successfully used it to launch solar arrays for the station as well as Kerballed missions into orbit. The vessel is pretty easy to control, and I\u0027ve even gotten my gravity turns to the point that I can almost reach orbit without further tweaking on ascent (total delta-V needed to attain stable orbit has ranged from 200 m/s to 500 m/s, a huge improvement over the 1000-1500 m/s delta-V I\u0027ve needed with earlier, cruder designs). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus emboldened, I then decided to add a cupola pod to my station. The resulting vehicle is pictured below: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DXhb9w4.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DXhb9w4.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe launch vehicle remains the same, but the dummy payload has now been replaced with a 2-stage spacecraft; the lower stage is to get the module close to the station, while the module itself has been fitted with RCS jets and a monoprop tank for final docking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the problem: When I launch the craft, so long as it\u0027s headed straight up, it remains on course with ASAS activated. But when I begin my gravity turn (after 4 of the 6 boosters have been jettisoned), the spacecraft turns end-over-end and ASAS will not stabilize it. I\u0027m forced to control it manually with SAS disengaged to stop the spin, wasting precious fuel. Ultimately, the spacecraft never reaches orbit, and I\u0027m forced to either hit End Flight or kill a Kerbal. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m at a loss. The cupola pod is the only new element to the mix, and I don\u0027t think it should be doing this. I know others have successfully brought cupolas up to their stations or built stations around the cupola and have orbited them successfully, so I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s something I\u0027m doing - or not doing.

I did think of flipping the cupola at first and found that, when I launched my spacecraft two additional problems surfaced:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Control shifted to the Cupola module and I found my navball inverted (minor - I just had to remember which way the spacecraft was pointed to compensate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.

This made control impossible, so I ditched the upended cupola for the design you see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswering the other questions last: First, I do have a cluster of 3 engines (2 LV-T30s for lift and 1 LV-T45 for control) at the bottom of the core, arranged in a line. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond: I have kept the staging of the motors and clamps separate for my own reasons; the .5 to 1 second between ignition and liftoff does not use enough fuel to affect the flight profile. Further; unless I\u0027m planning to launch a thousand-part monstrosity, saving 2 or 3 parts by ditching a few launch clamps hardly seems worth it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEveryone: you seem to be looking at the launch vehicle as the source of my problem, despite what I\u0027ve written in the original post.
