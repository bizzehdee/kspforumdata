It\u0027s not entirely necessary, but I thought it would look great on large interplanetary cruisers and such. \n\nI have no modding experience of my own (besides a terrible attempt at making my own command pod), but I think the screw animation could use rotation mechanics like those in Infernal Robotics (rotating the docking port (and thus the attached craft) while also retracting the whole assembly back into the station). If anyone wants to have a go at making something unique like this then that\u0027d be awesome ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Tontow","CreatedById":64552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T08:47:01Z","Content":"If they ended up being stiffer than normal docking ports so that I didn\u0027t have to use quantum struts, then I would use something like this.\n\nWho else wants to see docking ports screw?
