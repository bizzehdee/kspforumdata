It\u0027s not entirely necessary, but I thought it would look great on large interplanetary cruisers and such. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no modding experience of my own (besides a terrible attempt at making my own command pod), but I think the screw animation could use rotation mechanics like those in Infernal Robotics (rotating the docking port (and thus the attached craft) while also retracting the whole assembly back into the station).
