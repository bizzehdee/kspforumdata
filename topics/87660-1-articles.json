Then it crashes at launch. Okay, mut be some problem with the number of mods. I added a few new ones! So I trim my mod list and start up again. I grudgingly go back and trim even more mods, only getting mods I think are crucial; MKS and OKS and KWRocketry for instance. So I try this again, and it crashes. I get frustrated, delete KSP, and reinstall, returning and doing a fresh install of all the mods.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd another crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m getting frustrated out of my skull.

I can\u0027t exit to main menu, I can\u0027t reenter the garage... yet, oddly, I can open other things. I went into the contracts building, and it worked fine... then when I left it glitched to all hell, only making the space center fast forward bar appear at the bottom when I was still in the contracts building.
