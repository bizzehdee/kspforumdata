Main engine flamed out on the way back (no crossfeed back then and no fuel ducts installed on the craft) and I had to rely on four\u00A0Ant engines I had attached on the peripheral tanks.

Until one of my Kerbals didn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back from the Mun. Either I\u0027d launch a rescue, or it\u0027d be stuck there. I suppose doing this around the Mun, which is a lot more forgiving than Kerbin when it comes to relative velocities between craft, helped a lot and gave me enough confidence to do orbital rendezvous around Kerbin and later on, pretty much anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first time I got into solar orbit, while en route to Eve.
