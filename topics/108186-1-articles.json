But try to plan ahead. Could this also be a refuelling depot? Can you use the lab to convert data to science points? Can it be an outpost for stranded herbals? \n\nI think you could break even achieving this contract, but it will help with future missions."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T13:04:47Z","Content":"Hmmm, until you have a asteroid in orbit to mine, I don\u0027t see the need of a refueling space station around Kerbin. The price of sending tanks to the station will be the same as sending this fuel at it\u0027s destination.

I tend to get those contracts turn up every now and then - accept them - switch to the station - perform them - get the contract and go back to see what else I have.
