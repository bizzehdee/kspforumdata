And you gave them *numbers*?!?!\u0022(\\*)\n\nThat still chills me a little bit. I have unfortunately no memory of who wrote this, what kind of book or magazin this was in, nor what the characters were named, etc... It had to be written earlier than 1990, probably in the \u002770s/\u002780s?\n\nMy google-fu left me, any help?\n\n-- \n\n(\\*) in all likelihood not verbatim\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-09T13:55:48Z\u0022 title=\u002207/09/2015 01:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by heng**\n  \ntypo"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T14:28:09Z","Content":"I recall the line, but I cannot place it."}]}
