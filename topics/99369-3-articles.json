That includes the freedom to not be spied upon or advertised at. GNU/Linux is just the current poster-child for the free software philosophy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy main beef with Microsoft, among others, is that it\u0027s part of the buisiness model to keep consumers from understanding the gadgets they buy, or modifying them to work as they actually want them to work. If you could fix the bugs yourself, why would you fork-out for the upgrade?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy must we all buy new gadgets every year, simply because we can\u0027t replace the parts that wear out or improve the code to do new things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you bought the hardware you should be free to do \u003Cem\u003Ewhatever you want\u003C/em\u003E with it, without a by-your-leave from MS or anyone else, and without telling them where you buy your bog-roll.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s insidious - big technology companies are training a generation of people who have no idea how the devices they rely on actually work, and filling our homes with machines that work for the manufacturer more than they work for us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInformation is power, every time you are forced to give away your information you are effectively paying to use your own equipment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWindows 10 sure ain\u0027t free if you pay in information, GNU/Linux is free because \u003Cem\u003Epeople\u003C/em\u003E want to be free, and enough of those people can code \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFree sharing of designs and code fosters innovation, and it\u0027s how this whole IT revolution got started in the first place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFar too many devices already come with remote-brick backdoors, restrictive DRM or built-in spyware.

At least linux is not peeking at me.\u003Cp\u003EFrom the ongoing trends I observe, I can speculate that being offline is soon going to become a privilege you would have to pay for. You MUST consume in order to keep the economy going, you must buy new gadgets and throw away your year-old ones to keep the industry afloat, nobody is interested in reliability and prolonged operation. You MUST watch advertisements and click \u0027like\u0027 buttons. If you refuse - you are a paranoid, maybe a criminal even.

Basic economics tells you that you must \u003Cem\u003Eproduce\u003C/em\u003E to keep the economy going ... you cannot all just \u003Cem\u003Econsume. \u003C/em\u003EThat means: Industry... and not outsourced industry either. If you have no industry, you produce nothing... there will be no gain, just slow eventual loss. Services and Beyonce\u0027 as a part of your GDP are not a substitute for industry, try as you might. Industry is the cornerstone of a successful economic system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, people ARE interested in reliability and prolonged operation ... one only need to look at the concept of \u0027planned obsolescence\u0027 with the automotive industry to see the truth in that, to see where that went. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find the privacy issue interesting. I discuss it with a lot of people I know, from all walks of life. My general impression is that people live with a jaded view, that they\u0027re only bothered with such when it affects them personally. Well, I believe that time will come soon, and it will come as a rude awakening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
