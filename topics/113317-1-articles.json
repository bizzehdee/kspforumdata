I finally decided to do them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built 4 \u0022grabbers\u0022 (7 tons each) : I\u0027ve no pictures but their design is quite straight forward. A claw, a probe core (the best 1.25m), battery, fix solar, a 2.5m heat shield. Then an engine ministage with RCS, encounter and return fuel and a Terrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 4 grabbers were stitched to a rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decoupled each grabber manually (not using staging) because I wanted to handle them properly. Recoverable parts where on very different orbits and sometimes clockwise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore grabing the parts, there was something strange (Minmus encounter, rendez-vous...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Most of sounds except musique (including engines) were absent. Even Chatterer background sounds was mute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- MechJeb wasn\u0027t able to warp and execute any node but was able to orient to nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 of the 4 recoverables had a command unit (cuploa, cockpit). Sound and MechJeb control came back as I grabbed them., even when I reset the \u0022control from here\u0022 to the probe core.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last part was a tank. Sound didn\u0027t come back on that one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did launch quite some probes and didn\u0027t got that. It\u0027s the first time I used the Claw, though...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHave you exeperienced that ?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T11:35:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 11:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Warzouz\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
