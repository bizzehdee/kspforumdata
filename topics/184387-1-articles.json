should have went to the school i went to. it was the dumping ground for sociopaths and other failed attempts at humans. everyone was a bully so it made an interesting dynamic. sometimes it was their turn and sometime it was ours. students bet on the fights.\u00A0i hung out with two of the crazier students. one was a crazy russian with a blackbelt in tae kwon do, and the other was fond of self mutilation and bb guns, he killed himself about a dozen years ago. it was the 90s but we all listened to 70s and 80s metal and we all wore black trench coats (columbine had just happened and we had more in common with the slayers than the slain) while everyone else just wore flannel.\u00A0\u00A0its ok because the school had metal detectors and a security guard for every 10 students,\u00A0a couple of them were former nfl football\u00A0players. because of all the hostility it was common for students to get tackled and dragged off to an isolation room (much like the ones you find in mental institutions). kids who got floored by they one day would often be talking sports with them the next day.\u00A0\u00A0we mostly got graded on behavior and academics were practically non existent, we were doing fractions on our senior year, they called it review, but we never moved on\u00A0to anything beyond that. you could pass just showing up for class. later few years of high shcool they would bus us off to another school that did vocational training, i took computer science and then an electronics class. the electronics class had me doing math i didnt even know existed. all the time on the school buses led to other interesting shenanigans. the junkie thrash metal crowd (kind of an extension to our 3 man group though not completely comprising shared interests) used the interchange as a chance to smoke dope, i joined them once or twice. i ended up staying an extra semester after my senior year to finish my electronics class, and because my buddies were a grade year below me. on my graduation (being mid year there were only 2 students) my russian buddie thought it would be interesting to poke me in the buttocks with the american flag. the teachers weren\u0027t bad, many of them meant well, but they were shoehorned into a dumping ground for social rejects thought up by some politician who just wanted us out of the way.\u00A0 they were told they could do some good and help at risk students, and then got no budget to do it. the average low iq of the students allowed me to sweep all the engineering contests held by my science and math teachers. rocketry, egg drops, bridge building, marble floats, etc. i won em all. this was before participation trophies too. for winning they gave me a certificate printed off of an old dot matrix printer and was most certainly made on a mac se (one of the higher end computers we got to use). they were the dumping ground for the old apple 2s the school district\u00A0was phasing out. because of my oddball schedule i had a whole 45 minutes of free time every day. and so for fun i slapped apple 2 parts together until i got working machines, i set up a computer lab with a stack of pirated apple2 games (the school certainly didnt buy them. i honestly dont know where most of them came from, the apple 2 was certainly well beyond its usefulness by then so it wasn\u0027t any of the current students at the time. but i made sure every class room had a copy of all the disks. except on thursdays when the weight room was open. we did more screwing around that actually pumping iron. if there wasnt a fight or unrelenting pranks, or students smoking, or doing a number of other things that were technically against the rules, then we would just sit around and chit chat and let the weights crash. the ta only looked in a couple times if we got too loud. the whole thing was in a converted storage closet and so there was no visibility to the rest of the gym. we didnt even have showers which is why no one took gym class seriously.\u00A0\u00A0the smart kids would have social studies first and gym last. the social studies teacher was an old hippy lady that ran class like a game show, with prizes. i won many. she always brought snacks and if you got there early you would get the lions share. all in all it was a lot of fun, despite the fact that it was a half step up from juvie.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kernel Kraken","CreatedById":181383,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-05-12T22:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022
