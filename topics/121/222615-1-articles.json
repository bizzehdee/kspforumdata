I\u0027ve been immersed in the incredible universe of Kerbal Space Program and wanted to share an idea that I believe could add a thrilling new dimension to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow about introducing a dynamic Space Race mode where players, whether against AI or each other, start on an equal footing with identical resources in different regions of Kerbin (Earth)? This could simulate a competitive space exploration race, evolving as both AI and players progress through the game. The essence would be to create a real race for space dominance, injecting a sense of urgency and strategy into the gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s a breakdown of the proposed features:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEqual Starting Ground:\u003C/strong\u003E All players, including AI opponents, begin with the same resources and capabilities in their chosen regions on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERace Development:\u003C/strong\u003E As players and AI advance, the competition intensifies.
