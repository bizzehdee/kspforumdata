You can have only one wing (can be made up of multiple wing parts but they all have to be part of the same wing), and the flying wing must be able to take off from the runway, make it to orbit, and then return to land on the runway again.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo canards, No tailplane, No clipping a bunch of rudders inside the wing, though any other part clipping is allowed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
