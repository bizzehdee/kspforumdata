I\u0027ve only launched and landed a spaceplane was with boosters attached) have been asking this question: How do I launch a plane on top of a rocket? The trick is: don\u0027t do it. The easiest solution to this is: (there are many other ways, like adding fairings, putting giant fins etc.) to built out rather than up. The functional spaceplane that i built that follows this design is the lightning albatross (large wings, handles reentry very well) has boosters attached to the side.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe this way looks sort of like the space shuttle, except with boosters attached to both sides of the fuel tanks for stabillity.
