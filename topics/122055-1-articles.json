How are you going to explain something scientific if your wording leaves room for ambiguity, and would not receive a passing grade from a school teacher due to the number of misspellings and grammar mistakes? This counts double if your hypothesis (it\u0027s not a theory until it\u0027s peer reviewed and proven to work) attempts to overthrow established models entirely. It is the responsibility of the author to deliver credible proof, and bad language destroys credibility because it can be used to intentionally obfuscate logical inconsistencies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two ways the author could have gone down:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Publish the paper in his native language. There\u0027s no reason it needs to be in English to start with. If it is considered interesting, it will be translated by the scientific community.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Or, get assistance from a native English speaker for proofreading and writing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ensea2004","CreatedById":151768,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-01T08:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree with you, the paper wrote in bad english.

Apart from the already mentioned bad English it is also stylistically bad. A lot of functions and terms are complicated for no reason. An example: he introduces \u0022charges\u0022 Q_{-1},Q_{0},Q_{\u002B1}, and then defines a function c that turns them into the respective numbers -1,0,1; a much more concise approach would be to simply use those numbers as charges. If you improve the notation his way in all places, the formulas should shrink by a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
