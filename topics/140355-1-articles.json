It now appears to be directly related to UI scale setting. I normally play with a 110% UI scale because I play the game in 1900x1220 rez and its just hard to see at 100% UI scale. After going into settings on a hunch and altering the UI scale back to 100% the load screen is magically back to normal. Strangely at 120% scale it doesn\u0027t have the problem....\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI updated the bug tracker to reflect this discovery but wanted to share with everyone so if you are having\u00A0this problem and want a work around to it until it is fixed in a future release.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-23T15:06:29Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2016 03:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Brian444444\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gamax19","CreatedById":157766,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T15:19:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have noticed that to it is strange.
