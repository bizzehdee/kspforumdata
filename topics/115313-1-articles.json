I\u0027ve got two recommendations that have helped me immensely in pre-planning for all missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Know how much Delta-V your craft has. Unfortunately, the stock game doesn\u0027t provide this information. Fortunately, there are a couple of mods that \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E provide this critical information.

I generally take the figures from that chart, figure out the amount of Delta-V I\u0027m going to need in order to get where I\u0027m going, and then increase it by 10% because I\u0027m not an expert pilot by any stretch and assume I\u0027m going to waste some fuel, especially getting into orbit around Kerbin. Don\u0027t forget to also account for Delta-V you\u0027re going to need to get back to Kerbin! (If, in fact, you\u0027re coming back to Kerbin...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EArming yourself with that information should go a long way towards helping solve your \u0022get where you\u0027re going\u0022 problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, once you get to the Mun, you still need to land on it intact. Getting used to how the craft needs to be oriented for this can be tricky, so I recommend at least your first landing including a Pilot (if you\u0027re in career mode, at least a 1-Star Pilot), or a probe core that has the \u0022Hold Prograde/Retrograde\u0022 ability. Turning on SAS and Hold Retrograde for the landing helps a \u003Cem\u003Eton\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, Scott Manley has an excellent\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEkUeJRCh083UT-Lq5ZIKI75\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E series on Youtube.
