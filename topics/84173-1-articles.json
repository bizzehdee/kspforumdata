I am a longtime sci-fi fan thanks to my grandfather \u0026amp; father getting me hooked on some rather great books when I was quite young. Huge fan of space exploration, development and (hopefully one day) colonization. I have played many space-related games over the years (sims, 4x-style strategy, etc) and I think the oldest space-related games I ever played were Orbiter (1986) and Rendezvous with Rama way back in the day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlas the original hype for Kerbal (kickstarter et-al) passed me buy somehow. Lucky for me I stumbled upon the quite wonderful Interplanetary Quest videos on YouTube done by Scott Manley. Watched a bunch, tried the demo... and lo and behold a Humble store sale popped up. Time to go see what hijinks I can get up to with the Strange Goo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd now a seemingly appropriate quote: \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CThe gods do not protect fools.
