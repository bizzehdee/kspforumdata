I just wonder one thing: if they\u0027re splitting uranium, then they\u0027re getting extremely radioactive decay products. Maybe the engine isn\u0027t exhausting them (can Boeing guarantee that?), but that doesn\u0027t stop the engine itself from becoming strongly radioactive over time. Also, time between service? Modern turbofans can run 20,000 hours and more between major overhauls, massively lowering the cost of operation. Does the uranium liner in this last anywhere near that long?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to mention that D-T fusion releases strong radiation itself (even if the are no radioactive products). Part of it is used to trigger the fission, but the engine will need substantial shielding, and operating it on the ground at the airport may be problematic. Which in turn is an issue because the engine needs assisted startup - it is self-sustaining but it can\u0027t start itself. Those lasers eat a lot of power, and one fusion event alone won\u0027t spool up the turbine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m really curious if they can make it work, but from my amateur eyes, it looks rather impractical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T11:47:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Camacha\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Camacha\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis is why I am for a \u003Cem\u003Euse it or lose it\u003C/em\u003E patent system.
