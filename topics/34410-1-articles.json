The version I believe is there are an infinite amount of universes. Imagine a blank piece of paper. Then draw 20 circles on it with different sizes. Each circle represents a universe each with it\u0027s own rules of physics. All the space in between the universes allows another universe to be able to pop into existence. Each universe grows but never actually collides with another because the space in between grows as well. There are only a certain amount of possible outcomes for the rules physics could have, so I believe there would be more universes with the same physics as ours. They would be nearly identical with very slight differences.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETraveling to another universe in this hypothesis would be impossible. You could never travel in the space between universes as no rules of physics exist. Connecting 2 universe with different physics would probably cause physics to go nuts in both universes. Black holes and worm holes are out of the question, and besides they only bend time and space with in a universe, not outside of it. This is actually why many scientists do not like this hypothesis.

Despite up quarks being slightly heavier than the down quarks, and despite the fact that separating two charges takes energy, it turns out that the neutron is just slightly heavier than a hydrogen atom. A lone neutron left to itself will decay into a proton and an electron. This is why the most common element in the universe is hydrogen. Now, imagine that, as common sense would dictate, hydrogen was heavier. Every atom of hydrogen in this universe would decay to neutrons. There would be no clouds of hydrogen plasma to make stars.
