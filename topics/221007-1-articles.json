At first I thought this was just a UI error in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, but it does seem like it\u0027s actually setting that as the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E in flight, as subsequent flights immediately spin out of control. The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is properly located for the first flight and everything works fine during that first simulation, but after I revert back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to end the simulation it just sticks to the probe core. I tried removing and re-adding all fins but no matter what I do the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E stays pinned. The issue seems to be related to the game itself, as once it begins occurring it occurs even on newly created crafts and if I restart the game the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E goes back to normal even on an unmodified craft that was previously broken, until the first test flight is over that is. I also tested with a completely different craft from the first one I flew, and the issue occurred for that rocket after the first flight as well. When the issue occurs, it happens for all crafts -- upon switching to another craft after the issue has started, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E is also pinned to the probe core, but after restarting the game both crafts have correct \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Lift\u0022\u003ECoL\u003C/abbr\u003E locations until the first test flight is over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve tried reinstalling \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E, which I assume is part of the problem, but even after reinstalling both through \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E and manually the issue still occurs. My best guess is it\u0027s some sort of conflict between \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E and some other mod, of which I have probably too many (GameData folder contains 255 subfolders).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the sheer number of mods that are installed I\u0027m not expecting a quick resolution, but I figured I\u0027d make a post to see if anyone else has experienced this issue and found a solution before I resort to playing whack-a-mole with the mods to see which one is breaking things. I\u0027ve checked the player.log file but wasn\u0027t able to find anything there that seems relevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
