The idea is that the radiators are reflective in the visible spectrum while opaque in the infrared spectrum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe color only matters for the wavelengths the radiator is emitting. So it doesn\u0027t really matter for the radiation efficiency what color your paint them in the visible spectrum, since they\u0027ll never get so hot that they\u0027ll start to glow. Since they\u0027re still exposed to visible light from the sun and the earth you might as well paint them white or metallic so they reflect as much as possible. Else you have to deal with that energy in addition to the heat you\u0027re trying to radiate away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis means that the color of the radiator depends on how much heat it is designed to radiate. So normal every day radiators should be colored white. But radiators for high energy applications (Like in the interstellar mod, or the near future mod) should be blueish. That way they\u0027ll radiate efficiently in red wavelengths while reflecting incoming blue radiation.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T10:01:55Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 10:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ralathon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Shpaget","CreatedById":45577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T09:58:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Brotoro\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Brotoro\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would think radiators should be dark when viewed at infrared wavelengths (to be efficient radiators of heat), while being a light as possible at visible wavelengths (to absorb as little sunlight as possible).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis, but since we are seeing the world aound us in visible, and not IR, my suggestion would be mirror finish in visible light.

Actuall mirrors, for example. Glass is opaque in IR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is that glass is also a pretty poor heat conductor. The surface exposed to space would cool off, but it wouldn\u0027t conduct heat off the metal frame all that great. I suspect, real space radiators are made out of aluminum and are coated with a paint that is not entirely unlike thermal paste in composition to give them IR opaqueness without restricting the heat flow. That would be consistent with white or silvery appearance as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, what you are looking for is not a gloss finish, however, but an albedo. As close to 100% of visible light should be reflected as possible. But direction you reflect it into is irrelevant. You can have light scattered evenly in all directions, and that will make finish look snow-white. You can have tiny clusters with fine finish which will reflect lighti n random directions. That will make it look silvery-gray. Or you can go with fine gloss finish, which will make it look like a mirror. Either way works, but the first two are far more practical to implement, so that\u0027s what you see in space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
