I have a few core layouts ive deemed effective, and i essentially pick one of them when creating a new ship (if i actually care about the armor protection for said ship). Then ofc i develop new core layouts once in a while when i deem old ones have gotten to the point of useless, or i just want to try a completely new hull style for a new ship, ill try to make a core to support that style.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"8bitgammers","CreatedById":108555,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T21:34:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022panzer1b\u0022 data-cite=\u0022panzer1b\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow the hell does 700 \u002B 300 = 1100?\u003Cp\u003EI know it was prolly a typo, but obvious math errors really annoy me for some reason \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, the vast majority of my fighters are below 50 parts including weapons.

That thing is no great armor, but compared to the majority of stuff ive seen its quite resistant, and can actually take hits from all but competitive weapons (if you can split a drek with it, you can split this too with good aim and some luck). Im still happy with the basic hull layout, since its really tough to make something better while limiting yourself to so few parts. My frigate is better, way better, but im still not happy with a 250 part hull, doesnt leave much for guns and fighters (all AKS frigates double up as carrier hybrids).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only fighter ive actually bothered with thats above 100 parts is the HK-201 and 202, since they are SSTOs that can get to laythe (the 201 can do a roundtrip, the 202 not yet but its upwards of 3.5K dV atm). Anything with that much range is going to have a stacked fuel tank in the weapons bay made of ~20-30 FLT-100s as its the only tank that can fit in there 100% and still let me use missiles (1 missile per side, and a sideways facing FLT-100 between, then ofc more FLTs clipped in front/behind the 1st one), i dont like thsi solution, would prefer clipping say MK1 LF tanks or something, but there isnt much option when i insist on air intake\u002Bmk1 adaptor\u002Bshort mk2 bay\u002Banother adaptor\u002Bmk1 inline pit\u002Brapier\u002Bnuke, there is just no room to fit any other tank in such a design anywhere in the bay such that drag on it is disabled as i cant exactly have all those tanks exposed to teh airflow or outside at all since i insist upon a very particular look and extra tanks externally ruin it. At least these craft are very specialized and tend to operate solo anyways as scouts or strike fighters behind enemy lines, luckily they are too big, heavy, and bulky to work with carriers, and having 1 or 2 in a squadron isnt that bad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh and 8bit, i think ive found a flaw with ur new fighter, a single good hit to the rear and its toast. Also, no idea what u wanna name it, but the name Hex-Fighter is already taken by AKS, it was a heavy fighter that served alongside the Tri-Fighter line for a short time, although it was retired as it was deemed too complex and overkill back in 0.90 (30 tons pushed by 3 rapiers and 3 turbojets as well as the usual 1 nuke in the center, in atmo that thing would go 2km/s reliably though, owing to its 50 or so ram intakes).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyes, that was a typo.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethe fact that you can make a capitol ship with so little parts is not very surprising. it all depends on the size, complexity, armor, and definition of a capitol ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elately i have been using a ton of armor on my ships, and this has yielded great success. in all the tests i have preformed i have found armor to be the best way to defend a ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas for that small fighter... it was a very rushed design. i do not plan on making it a \u0022important\u0022 part of my up to date fleet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alphasus","CreatedById":147173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-29T22:01:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust finished my first lightweight ship. 40 tons, wing armored,and under 220 parts!
