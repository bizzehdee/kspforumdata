For this application, the orbital mechanics are quite accurate. Sure, it\u0027s not n-body but the difference that makes is insignificant in most cases. And the \u0022on rails\u0022 thing is fine from a playability standpoint, so you actually have stable orbits you don\u0027t have to tweak periodically due to tiny n-body effects adding up over the long term.

So all that\u0027s fine and dandy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main place where KSP\u0027s system noticeably differs from reality is that it has no true Lagrange points because those rely on n-body forces being significant. However, the Lagrange points along the same orbit as 1 of the bodies might as well exist--KSP fakes them quite well. It\u0027s the ones where both bodies and the ship are all on the same line that can\u0027t be done in KSP, and those happen to be the ones that are most interesting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ford_Prefect","CreatedById":57909,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T12:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you guys, that\u0027s all I needed.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-14T13:54:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPatched conics approximation\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence_(astrodynamics)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Espheres of influence\u003C/a\u003E are actually used in real space programs for initial estimates of trajectory and required delta-v.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow accurate they are?
