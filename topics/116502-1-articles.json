I\u0027ve wondered if they were a great alternative to centrifuges. I mean, think about it. Sticky surfaces on the bottom of the shoe hold you down, and you walk like you would on Earth. Making sticky shoes would be a ton cheaper then centrifuges, as you don\u0027t have a spin mechanism and the centrifuge and millions of dollars spent on 1 thing. With these shoes, you could have almost no problems with low or micro gravity, as they feel like you\u0027re walking on Earth. They could be mass produced for colonies on the Moon or Mars, and even space. They can be used anywhere, including Earth. Think about this. Even with NASA\u0027s shoestring budget, this thing could be used as a future substitute for a centrifuge. So what do you think? \n\nHere\u0027s a Picture: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/blile59/4911288105](https://www.flickr.com/photos/blile59/4911288105)"},{"CreatedByName":"_Augustus_","CreatedById":115084,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T17:12:08Z","Content":"Great idea!"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T17:14:24Z","Content":"?? you know that those shoes does not remplace the need for centrifuges, right??\n\nCentrifuges are not just to keep your feets on the ground.."},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T17:16:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E ?? you know that those shoes does not remplace the need for centrifuges, right??\n\u003E Centrifuges are not just to keep your feets on the ground..\n\nThey are for gravity, I know that.

Imagine all the cumulative stress in the feet. Grab a long pole (5 m at least), hold it vertically and try to translate it without tilting. Your hands will suffer a lot.\n\nGravity coupled with friction force helps us with that by shedding our kinetic energy while we\u0027re walking, and when you want to start walking, you lean forward a bit, shift the center of mass and your legs follow the movement of your body that\u0027s \u0022trying\u0022 to fall down.\n\nWalking is a complex thing and our brain does it \u0022in the background\u0022."},{"CreatedByName":"Dkmdlb","CreatedById":70275,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T18:32:08Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E With these shoes, you could have almost no problems with low or micro gravity\n\nWhat?

Tops of feet become, by contrast, raw and painfully sensitive. Tears cannot be shed while crying, as they stick together into a ball. In microgravity odors quickly permeate the environment, and NASA found in a test that the smell of cream sherry triggered the gag reflex. Various other physical discomforts such as back and abdominal pain are common because of the readjustment to gravity, where in space there was no gravity and these muscles could freely stretch. These may be part of the asthenization syndrome reported by cosmonauts living in space over an extended period of time, but regarded as anecdotal by astronauts. Fatigue, listlessness, and psychosomatic worries are also part of the syndrome. The data is inconclusive; however the syndrome does appear to exist as a manifestation of all the internal and external stress crews in space must face.\n\nThe only thing sticky shoes does is reduce slightly the loss of bone and muscle mass, and it introduces lots of other problems, which have already been mentioned in this thread.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-21T19:49:00Z\u0022 title=\u002207/21/2015 07:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 21, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Dkmdlb**\n  \na word"},{"CreatedByName":"YNM","CreatedById":98447,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-21T22:33:33Z","Content":"It\u0027s going to be uncomfortable I guess.

If it is too small, people will get motion sickness and such, and possible some worse long term effects.

They introduce vibrations, rotational torque that needs to be countered, and structural stress. They are also big, heavy, expensive, and because they need many moving parts with motors, seals, lubricants, etc... they also introduce failure modes that could be catastrophic.
