I\u0027ve wondered if they were a great alternative to centrifuges. I mean, think about it. Sticky surfaces on the bottom of the shoe hold you down, and you walk like you would on Earth. Making sticky shoes would be a ton cheaper then centrifuges, as you don\u0027t have a spin mechanism and the centrifuge and millions of dollars spent on 1 thing. With these shoes, you could have almost no problems with low or micro gravity, as they feel like you\u0027re walking on Earth. They could be mass produced for colonies on the Moon or Mars, and even space. They can be used anywhere, including Earth. Think about this. Even with NASA\u0027s shoestring budget, this thing could be used as a future substitute for a centrifuge.
