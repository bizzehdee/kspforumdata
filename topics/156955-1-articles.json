To minimize the weight I like to keep my probes and craft to a minimum with proper weight distribution. However the atmosphere\u0027s and gravitational pulls on other planets make testing things sometimes hard. I cannot develop something, send it to eve, only to discover that once there it cannot make the liftoff, of that my angle of re-entry is either too high, or too low. Especially spaceplanes really need the ability to model/simulate in a windtunnel to see how they will behave. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d say that a good and realistic addition to Kerbal would be a wind-tunnel, alike actual aerospace uses all the time. It would be a new building which can simulate physics depending on size of the craft and atmosphere\u0027s etc. Maybe some manual constraints, but preferably pre-set conditions of atmosphere\u0027s. An additional function could be that you would need to have atmospheric data and temperature first before you can simulate a planet (from a probe or something)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nEither way, it would be a great help to my missions.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T14:47:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/150426-wind-tunnelaerodynamics-analysis/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-25T14:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA wind tunnel to simulate missions in a game where you can create as many saves as you want, some of which with unlimited resources, have a cheats menu available, the ability to teleport wherever you want and can literally revert time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say it\u0027s not necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"p1t1o","CreatedById":74091,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-27T09:49:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222967326\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022156955\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221488034109\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022126740\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gaarst\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 2/25/2017 at 2:48 PM, Gaarst said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA wind tunnel to simulate missions in a game where you can create as many saves as you want, some of which with unlimited resources, have a cheats menu available, the ability to teleport wherever you want and can literally revert time?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d say it\u0027s not necessary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo neither are the map, manouvre nodes, colour, 3d graphics etc. KSP could entirely be played by watching numbers change on a spreadsheet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNone of this is *necessary* \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis isn\u0027t the \u0022Suggest only the absolute necessities\u0022 thread!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n***\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would take time and many, many clicks to first leave your career save, load up another save (sandbox, unlimited resources, cheat mods/modes enabled) build your craft, cheat it over to your target, design/re-design your craft, exit sandbox save, load career save, import the craft file you just finished, and then fly the mission only to fail and require another round of all of that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFar better\u00A0(quicker, more intuitively useful to the design process,\u00A0more immersive, and potentially more educational) to be able to click a button in the editor to load your current craft into some sim environment that will show you what will happen when you do different stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the very least, it will simulate a real part of an aerospace design process.
