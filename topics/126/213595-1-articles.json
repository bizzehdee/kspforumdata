I\u0027m a bit confused by the question as AFAIK this isn\u0027t possible in KSP2 without a workaround. The best solution I\u0027ve found is to use engine mounts flipped over inside the faring, along with decouplers and docking ports to facilitate jettisoning the engine mounts and releasing the payloads.
