I just started playing KSP a little under a week ago, and I have been enjoying it a lot! The only issue, is that I launched a mobile processing lab orbiting the mun (it has a connection dw), but I have over 200 science but only 800 battery. I\u0027m only able to transmit about half the science before it says \u0022aborting transmittion.\u0022 I can\u0027t send a portion like half of the science either, the require complete and allow incomplete settings on the antenna don\u0027t matter, it still won\u0027t let me send ANY of the science!!! This is maddening and I don\u0027t know how to fix it. If there\u0027s a simple button or something I\u0027m missing, please help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-17T17:01:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can transmit individual science reports and pause transmission to get more power, look down the list of science you store.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nSome reports has the transmit button, click it and you start to transmit, it also has an pause button, press this to charge up the batteries before continuing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
