By the time I get to 15-20km and 400m/s, i see the temp warnings. I try multiple launches, dialing back thrust till its barely gaining speed. Others i try to punch straight up further before beginning my gravity turn. I\u0027ve tried bumping out the fairing to better protect its contents. Ive tried the protected docting port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the end, once it gets to 450 m/s the part explodes. Anyone else have any workarounds? Its tough cause i don\u0027t consistently see this, even though most of my crafts have docking ports at the top, you know, in case of emergency.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny tips are appreciated!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PASSthe40","CreatedById":232507,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-05T04:31:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI solved my issue. I had a regular size docking port on a large probe. I am guessing the size mismatch was creating an issue during launch. Once I replaced the probe with a small one in-line with the docking port, all the heating issues went away during launch.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fourfa","CreatedById":151713,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-05T06:46:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u2019ve been putting nose cones on the docking ports, even when inside a fairing, and jettisoning before circularization.
