What are you landing? The 3 man capsule does not maintain that speed.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nDrogue parachute will probably help a lot. have them open high to slow you down to 220 m/s who I found is safe for parachutes, also don\u0027t time warp from activated until you are falling at an pretty constant and low velocity.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nParachutes is a bit buggy think mostly that they don\u0027t respect save opening. Most people have problems in that they break before they inflate fully,\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
