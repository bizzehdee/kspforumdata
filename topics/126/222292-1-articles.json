They both went up as one and separated once I entered Mun orbit.\u00A0 One stayed in orbit whilst the other went down the surface, took some samples, and now has returned to orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter much fighting I managed to get the two docked, but now the game is only acting like I have one probe (it does show two up in the g-force window).\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem is, the probe the game has decided is the \u0022lead\u0022 probe is the one with the small engine with no fuel left (the Mun lander). The opposite end has plenty of fuel and an engine to get me home with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe engine in question that I want to use is also no longer showing down the right hand side either. I assume it\u0027s something to do with how the damn thing was originally staged, but still, I should be able to control either engine right?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
