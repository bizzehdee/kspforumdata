I think this isn\u0027t a bug, but rather because I can\u0027t figure out the controls.\u00A0 I am completely unable to rotate the camera in flight or in map view, without rotating the craft, or without toggling between camera settings.\u00A0 In KSP1 this was easily accomplished with the arrow keys, but now they just seem to pan the camera?\u00A0 I really don\u0027t understand the logic behind this, the old controls were super intuitive and useful.\u00A0 I\u0027m having a hard time coming up with good use-cases for in-flight panning...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom what I have read, it seems that the Click and drag with right mouse button seems to be the solution?\u00A0 The problem is that I play with touchpad, and while I am theoretically right clicking and dragging, this input doesn\u0027t seem to be translating to KSP2.\u00A0 Before you ask me how I could possibly paly a PC game without a mouse, I\u0027ve played over 600 hours of KSP1 on the touchpad without any issues.\u00A0 I could buy a mouse, but this will really limit where and when I can play.\u00A0 I really hope that there is some easy work around that I am missing, or that the devs will allow us to customize the controls and reassign these functions to the arrow keys in a future update.\u00A0 I can play without the pan, no rotate is pretty tough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BTaj","CreatedById":227584,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T00:13:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I figured out how to right mouse drag on my touchpad - basically I need to click in just the very lower right corner of the touchpad, then I can rotate with a second finger \u003Cstrong\u003E(hopefully this info will be useful to others who find a similar problems)\u003C/strong\u003E.\u00A0 If I played other games more often I might have noticed this faster, because right click drag is in some other games too, but at this point of my life I don\u0027t have much time and pretty much only play KSP.\u00A0 Now that I\u0027ve found the right click drag, the game is much better to play, but it\u0027s still very awkward compared to the arrow keys.\u00A0 Maybe I\u0027ll get used to it, but in the meantime, I\u0027m hoping that in the future we can map these camera controls to the keys of our choosing, instead of being stuck with right click drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thewhitemetroid","CreatedById":202561,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T02:12:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn flight mode pressing TAB will switch to a mouse rotate mode so that, without even clicking, whatever position you move your mouse to the camera rotates. Should work great for a track pad user.
