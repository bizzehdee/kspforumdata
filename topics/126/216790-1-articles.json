If you\u2019re starting from a 100km x 100km circular orbit with a typical small return stage then something around 35 or 40 is good. If you\u2019re coming back from the Mun and you\u2019re too low on fuel to get into some sort of closer orbit before die orbiting you might want to aim for 50 or 55 and aero break your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E down to where you\u2019re coming back in safely after multiple passes. That\u2019s an extreme example just to set a point on the other side of things, but this also applies for return stages that have a higher ballistic coefficient where you don\u2019t want them to pancake in the denser atmo down low.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
