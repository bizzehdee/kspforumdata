So I have been struggling with a issue lately where my planes always turn hard right or left when picking up speed on the runway. It does not seem to matter what my landing gear settings are or the configuration of my plane, it just jerks hard right or left without reason. I also tried with and without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E enabled.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother thing I noticed is that my planes are really bouncy in that they constantly bounce up and down like they are on springs when idle on the ground.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAm I just doing something wrong here or is this a case of this version not having quite worked out how air physics works yet?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEdit: So for some reason the moderators decided to move this to KSP 1 when I was talking about KSP 2.
