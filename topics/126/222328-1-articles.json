Additionally, the\u00A0 biomes don\u0027t seem to give new science when doing anything besides a surface sample (And possibly a crew observation). I can\u0027t find any lists of biomes for KSP2, but honestly, it\u0027s not really worth it unless you want to absolutely maximize science. Il just say that if it looks a lot different, it\u0027s probably a different biome. It\u0027s much harder to science spam in KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TechieV","CreatedById":229200,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-16T10:45:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP Wiki has a list of KSP2 biomes, but it is massively underdeveloped.
