Sending an rocket there is an good idea, for me it was the first mission using the nuclear engine but you could go on chemical engines. On an re-play I would probably go manned.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nEach atmospheric sample on Eve give 600 science transmitted and you can skim the upper atmosphere, an heatshield is strongly recommended here. This has the benefit that you can have the front part have its own probe core, power and an science jr jr you get 1000 extra science if you land on land. Have an docking port on the part left in orbit so you can collect the science, an rover seat also work.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote window is sub optimal as in 3-4 km/s but very profitable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-02-14T10:56:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/14/2024 10:56  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Feb 14\u0022\u003EFebruary 14\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jantee","CreatedById":232627,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-15T20:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission was a success!\u00A0 Thanks for the help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
