Not sure why, but although you\u0027ll find all the craft files from the base Workspaces this way, you will not be able to save craft files to the base workspaces folder. It will seem like it works, but the files don\u0027t get updated. You\u0027d be able to find them anyway if you\u0027ve copied the ones you want to that folder, so replacing your campaign\u0027s Workspaces with a shortcut to the base Workspaces folder doesn\u0027t add value and may break other things...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-12T17:03:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/12/2023 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 12, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by schlosrat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
