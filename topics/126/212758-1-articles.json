If so, then it should project an interstage node below your engines and you can have a normal fairing around the cluster of engines. Just attach the next decoupler to the interstage node and the straight fairing should appear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T23:04:26Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 11:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by schlosrat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
