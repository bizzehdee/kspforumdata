Think Pluto and Charon, except much closer together. It will be located in one of the other star systems, and will use special tech to allow the player spacecraft to be affected by both gravity sources at the same time, creating unique challenges not found anywhere else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTheoretically this tech could be used to create barycenters elsewhere, but at least for planets orbiting stars this would not apply.\u00A0 Planets in KSP are \u0022on rails\u0022; they follow preprogrammed trajectories while ignoring any and all forces that might affect them. It would be extremely difficult to build a binary star system in which planets have their trajectories preprogrammed for an effectively infinite period of time while remaining even halfway realistic and believable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-11T20:59:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWould not surprise me, it would probably work like the Kerbol system but with Jool as the second smaller star, farther out and no Eeloo as the star has to be heavier.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou would get an cutout point for stable orbits but you could have planets in the L3 and L4 points.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aNERVASman","CreatedById":211629,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T12:35:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmodders found data of stars that suggested that there will be a binary star system\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
