The success condition is: \u0022Transmit or return an atmospheric survey from Jool.\u0022 It\u0027s worth 3000 science points, so quite worthwhile, especially since you should be able to combine it with the primary mission of orbiting Jool with a probe and 86Gm antenna.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI set my probe to dip into the atmosphere to 172km.
