I figured if I pressed the maneuver control and burned when it said everything would line up perfectly. I always get thrown completely off course. Idk what the red means. If it means I can\u0027t do it then shouldn\u0027t it say something like that just like how it\u0027ll say no fuel?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-27T19:12:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould you share a screenshot of this red line thing?
