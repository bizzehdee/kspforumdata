This means that I can\u0027t change the throttle or do maneuvers, which makes the game impossible. I\u0027ve tried multiple solutions but it seems like the only thing that can fix it is by resetting to a save previous to the bug, which means I would lose hours of progress, which is very frustrating!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheSandboxMaster","CreatedById":231569,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-29T03:29:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m still new to these forums, so I\u0027m not exactly sure how to link a video capture, but there have been other reports of this bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-29T03:39:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to Gameplay Questions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
