To do that, i am first practising my docking and how to effectively rendezvous at all. And the game is different from the tutorial videos i have seen. I am undocking switching control to the lander, wait till i am 100 meters away and then try to dock back up. What i understand i need to do to succeed is this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) set the docking clamp as a a target.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) switch to docking mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Switch to target mode for\u00A0velocity\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4.) point towards target and burn a little.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.) once i am close, burn retrograde to kill off velocity\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6.) use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E to do the last steps by going normal and then do just simpy x y z axis manoevery with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E until i dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem however starts when i am doing step 4 and 5. even without \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003Ercs\u003C/abbr\u003E on and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E only on stabilize the target speed and direction of it\u0027s speed is wobbling, so the direction is circling around as if one of the capsules was rolling somehow, but both are stable with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E. also, apparently the relative speed is also varying between 1.5 and 4. So the game is clearly having a stroke, but at some point it will stabilize. Trying to do any of that stuff with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E seems like the worst idea ever, because \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to not be able at all to keep anything stable. When it\u0027s on together with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, the vehicle will always start to become unstable in relation to the target.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond, going normal does not do what has been advertised. It doesn\u0027t put the two vessels in parallel mode. i have a very very small relative velocity but i am gliding next to the other vessel and there is no easy way to set me up. prograde is just spinning me for some reason with the prograde indicator always being really far away from the nose, retrograde is wobbling again normal puts me, it could be orthagonal, i would say it\u0027s not, but i can\u0027s really see a real direction as well, anti normal is the opposite direction, radial is the center of the red\u00A0 half and the degrees are just floating as if i was spinning and anti radial is the opposite. And target of course puts me directly at the target. What i probably could to is cheat, switch to the other vessel, and set the target there as well to point at it, but there has to be a real way to do it. Why does normal not work for me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-22T21:23:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you are orbiting close to another object, the two of you will seem to be circling each other.

So, i undock, i set the target to the other docking ring, i switch to relative velocity and to docking mode, everyhting is fine and stable. As soon as i turn my vessel towards target, the speed starts to quickly cycle from, \u002B2 to what the actual relative velocity is to -2 of that and then rinse repeat forever. I did it at 100m, it stayed that way until 1100m . Then i started to burn towards it and the speed alternated between 5 and 20 m/s, and everyhting in between. I knew i was closing in, because the distance got smaller, but apart from that, no clue. When i got closer, the relative speed went to 3-6 m/s, with no change in velocity.\u00A0 But then it was pretty quickly back up again. All this is done just with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E corrections and main thrust towards target and then retrograde to get closer.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt the end, i was at 12 meter disctance and had killed most of my velocity towards the target and now the velocity at the navbal was switching between 0 and ~1 m/s and the retrograte marker on the navball is moving around like it has a spasm, and as a consequence the active \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E is moving the shhip all the time to keep retrograde. If i switch to stability of docking mode for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E, the vessel keeps twitching, only when it is really close, and you actually managed to kill almost alle of relative velocity, both the orietation of the vessel udner \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and the display of relative speed calms down and remains stable enough to do precision manoevers.
