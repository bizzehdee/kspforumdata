The target craft I left in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E stopped updating when I launched my second craft.

I\u0027ve been telling people that the game is in Early Access and that it needs loads of bugfixes... but missing essential funtions is kind of strange. But like I said to others who are hammering the game atm... Early Access Launch doesnt actually mean playable. It just means you get to watch a product (hopefully) improve over time and even get the option to influence its development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T14:34:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTarget options are where hold and maneuver \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E buttons are.
