This guide is intended to help both askers and answerers make the best use of the new features\u00A0and, more generally, ask good questions and provide good answers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen asking a question:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBe descriptive in the title of your thread. A title like \u0022Why doesn\u0027t this work?\u0022 is not helpful in describing your question, but something like \u0022Why do my parachutes keep burning up?\u0022 gives a better idea of what the thread is about.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBe descriptive in your question, too. Are you making a rocket, a plane, or something else? What are you trying to do with it? What is going wrong? People will have an easier time helping you if they understand exactly what is happening.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA picture is worth a thousand words. If you are having trouble with a particular craft, it is incredibly helpful for those trying to diagnose the problem to see a picture of the vessel. Ideally the pic would be in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E with the engineer\u0027s report open, with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E windows open (if you use them) and for planes, with the Center of Mass and Center of Lift indicators showing. You will not be able to post pictures directly from your PC/console to the forum. Rather, you will need to upload the screenshot to a file sharing site and copy the link they provide into your posts here. \u00A0Make sure the link is to a image file (jpg, gif, png, etc) and not to a webpage or album containing the picture. \u00A0 Just paste the link directly into your post, don\u2019t use the Insert Image button in the editor. \u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nUsing mods in your game? Be sure to mention which ones you are using, sometimes mods have effects in places that aren\u0027t expected.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf more information is requested, be sure to edit that new information into the original post. That way it is easily seen by new readers and at the top of each page. As a courtesy you can reply to such requests to let the person know you\u0027ve added the information to the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the question has been resolved to your satisfaction, please mark the best answer by clicking the round checkbox to the left of the post. This will show the thread as \u0022answered\u0022 and will help other people with the same question in the future. (Moderators can also mark best answers, but it is better if you do this yourself.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhen answering a question:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nQuote the post to which you\u0027re replying, especially if it\u0027s not the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E. Since the default sort is by rating it is easy for things to get out of order, so this will reduce confusion.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf someone has already given the answer you were about to give, upvote that answer (and like it, too, if you\u0027re so inclined). This will help make good answers prominent to future readers of the thread. Do\u00A0so by clicking the up arrow to the left of the post.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTry to gauge the skill level/experience of the asker. A simple, basic question is best answered with a simple, basic answer; it is usually not helpful to barrage an inexperienced player with complex details when they\u0027re looking for a basic overview. By all means point people in the right direction to learn more, but make sure the basics are conveyed well first.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf your answer turns out to need clarification, it is better to edit that into your original answer rather than making another post. The idea is to get as complete and correct an answer as possible in a single post.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf the question spurs an interesting side discussion, consider making a new thread for it in General Discussion. If some posts need to be copied or moved out, let a moderator know and we\u0027ll help as best we can.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFor everyone:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSorting the thread by date (button to the upper right of the first reply) can be helpful for following a thread in progress.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs always, be patient and civil with each other. We were all newbies once, and what seems like a trivial or elementary question can be quite baffling for an inexperienced player. Similarly, people asking the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.
