You need to make sure that your antenna has enough range. Now also keep in mind, that the distance between Duna and Kerbin will depend on where those planets are in their orbits as well. If Duna is on the opposite side of Kerbol from Kerbin, you probably won\u0027t be able to transmit without the longer(est) range antennas. You might also need to set up a communication network in orbit around other planets in order to relay your signals. And of course, you need electrical power to transmit as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-08T06:55:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/08/2024 06:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 8\u0022\u003EApril 8\u003C/time\u003E by EndeavourCmdr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
