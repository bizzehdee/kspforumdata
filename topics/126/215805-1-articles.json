Because I\u0027m lazy.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 2. Because I like the realism there in that there is a massive debris field around kerbin. )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways, this helped me, but it might help some others, cheers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-24T02:02:58Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2023 02:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Little 908\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
