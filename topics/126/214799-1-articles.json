How do I make the decoupler decouple on the other side so my rocket doesnt have the remains of the decoupler sticking out?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T21:29:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re attaching the rocket to the pylon, do the opposite. Attach pylon to the rocket and then attach all that to the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr just rotate the pylon so that it\u0027s backwards, but I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027ll work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
