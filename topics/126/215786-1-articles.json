I did the tutorials for building and specifically for this issues the subassembly tutorial. I have a successful spacecraft that will orbit so naturally I want to build a space station. So I built a cargo \u0022pod\u0022 to attach to my spacecraft (it\u0027s just cargo space with a small fuel tank, engine, and 2 SRBs.) When I attempt to attach it to my main spacecraft the only snap it has is in the cargobay. So now my Spacecraft is stored inside the cargo area. How do I attach the cargocraft to the outside of my spacecraft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-24T06:51:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome pictures would be nice to see the problem. Normally there should be no problems with adding to the stack, although you may want to change the root/anchor part on the vessel you\u0027re trying to attach so that you\u0027re holding it by the part that connects to the other subassembly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
