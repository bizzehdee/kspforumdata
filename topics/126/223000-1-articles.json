I most recently tried to add Vernier thrusters to it, but it mostly has the same issues.

It will be way more delicate due to the couplers, so slowly ramp up the thrust. I initially turn my thrust limiters down so I don\u0027t put too much strain on the couplers. Then I save and experiment to find out how hard I can push it. Finally, assembled craft are more stable if they\u0027re pulling rather than pushing. Put the drive engines at the top and have them pull the rest of the craft along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
