Although I like many of the new UI features some things were just not obvious for me and maybe someone can help me?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI like the fact that in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E I can aim the camera to a specific part with a click with the middle mouse button. \u003Cu\u003EBut how do I aim the camera to a part in flight mode?\u003C/u\u003E Middle mouse button does not work and right click context menue option like in KSP1 seems not available. I some times end up with some kind of confusing free camera but somehoe the aim seems always to be on center of gravity for me.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI did not find small/medium engine plates. \u003Cu\u003EAre engine plates named differently and are small engine plates even available\u003C/u\u003E? There seems to be one for very large rockets and for large spaceplanes but nor for small rockets\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs I did not find\u00A0engine plates I tried to use inline fairings as shrouds (I want to use the XS \u0022Spark\u0022 on a small fuel tank). \u003Cu\u003EHow can I porperly connect/close an inline fairing?\u003C/u\u003E Pulling with the arrow never achieves a good fit and gives errors all the time wheras when I disable \u0022snap\u0022 I can get a good fit but there is no inidcation if the part is properly closed. Is there any indication if the inside is considered \u0022protected\u0022 for drag, heat etc?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDelta V readout in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E seems to be in vacuum, \u003Cu\u003Ehow can I toggle/slide between atmosphere/vacuum delta v read out ind \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E?\u003C/u\u003E At the moment I have to hit the launch button because on the launchpad delta V is current athmosphere level.

It confused me that delta ground measures in relation to ocean floor and not water surface, It is probably technically correct as water is not ground but I nearly crashed. \u003Cu\u003EHow are you using the the altimeter to get always the correct altitude above surface (water or land)? Am I supposed to switch from ground to sea level mode when flying above water for a landing?\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ECan someone explain to me the new center of pressure indicator?\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0The lift arrow (or whatever it is) seems very odd and off centre even on rockets with radial symetric fins\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-27T22:06:54Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2023 10:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Alioth81\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
