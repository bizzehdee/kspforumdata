I use the small beam in symmetry mode to create additional clipping points to attach items including engines to wings/ landing gear etc. These can be pulled into the craft so are hidden. The Goliath engine can clip straight to the wing but usually are at a angle that you can adjust to the right position. What issues are you having with landing gear? If you would like you could add a pic or a video and I can see the best way to resolve the issues you are having\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimera Industries","CreatedById":216952,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-13T15:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as landing gear, a neat trick is to not attach it to the wing but to the fuselage. They can then be rotated and offset as needed to appear as though they are on the wing. If you are looking to attach pieces radially to others, like engines on wings, it\u0027s easier to do the same: Attach it to the body of the plane, then move it where you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf your issues are with stability, make sure that the center of lift is slightly behind the center of mass, that your brakes are full in the rear landing gear and zero in front, and that your center of thrust matches your center of mass.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
