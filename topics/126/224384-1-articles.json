Let me explain my set-up, and hopefully one of you veterans will know how to accomplish this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a main carrier (dropship) aircraft that I built, which is piloted by a Kerbal. This is one workspace.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a second workspace, which is a small lander communication probe that I want to drop somewhere on the planet, via my carrier aircraft.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have merged the probe workspace into the dropship workspace, and attached it to the dropship via a decoupler.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEverything seems to go fine, up until I stage away the lander. The lander chutes come out just after decoupling, but a few moments later, the craft is just...\u00A0 gone, nowhere to be seen, not even in the tracking station.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, if I change focus to the lander just after I stage, I can follow that ship all the way to touchdown, safe and sound, but then my carrier aircraft is \u0022gone\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIsn\u0027t there some way to stage a lander, have it persist, and still fly back my main dropship for landing at a runway or something without losing either vessel?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust a thought...\u00A0 would this be better accomplished with docking ports rather than decouplers?\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe more I think about this, I wonder if decoupler stages get interpreted as \u0022I want to separate this part and then discard it\u0022, where docking ports are \u0022I want to separate this part, but keep it\u0022.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI haven\u0027t unlocked docking ports in my tech tree, so I haven\u0027t tested this yet....\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-09T08:45:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts an known issue, mothership will still be there, you find it going to tracking station.
