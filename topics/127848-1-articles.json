That\u0027s will be represented by the blue line (Your current orbit) going right into the Mun. That is an issue. Set up a node not to far from your vessel, but not too close where you miss it while still adjusting it, and just kinda mess around with the prograde marker and the blue markers. If you get a periapsis, that\u0027s good, but make sure it\u0027s above 6,000m, or it\u0027s very likely that you will crash and not land on the Mun today. Now, congratulations! You know have a flyby of the Mun. To get into orbit, just warp to Periapsis and burn retrograde, and that will bring down you orbit. When you see the apoapsis sign, you\u0027re in orbit. You can keep burning retrograde until periapsis and apoapsis switch sides, which will mean you are in a circular orbit.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, don\u0027t freak out when you switch SOIs.

However, I\u0027m going to enter into the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence (so I\u0027ll be moved by Mun\u0027s gravity, not by Kerbin\u0027s). Therefore the green dotted line is what will happen AFTER leaving the Mun\u0027s influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext pic is after making the burn. I\u0027ve made the potential orange dotted line into a real blue line:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022PIGGE2T.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/PIGGE2T.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve switched focus to the Mun, because I want to plan the fly-by better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause I haven\u0027t entered the Mun\u0027s SOI yet, the path is solid orange. I\u0027m still right at the start of the solid blue line, just leaving low Kerbin orbit (LKO).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo orange is what happens when I enter the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence. However I\u0027m just going to fly right past in a curve, so I\u0027ll return to Kerbin\u0027s SOI on a slightly different orbit. This post-SOI-change orbit is in solid purple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso important to note is that the solid orange line is at an odd angle to the Mun compared to my blue trajectory, because this is my flyby trajectory in the future, and the Mun won\u0027t be in the same place. When I reach the Mun it\u0027ll be a quarter of the way around Kerbin. If you transplant this picture of the Mun and my orange trajectory to where the blue line shows the encounter will happen, you can see that the Mun is going to come up behind me and I\u0027ll whizz past it on Kerbin\u0027s side (or rather, the Mun will whizz past me on the opposite side from Kerbin, since I\u0027m the one going slowly with respect to Kerbin just after my blue Ap), and the Mun\u0027s gravity will pull me back up and away from Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was quite proud of this one because it put me exactly where I wanted it to be: return into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at just the right height to re-enter without burning up. I had hardly any fuel and this gave me a free return to splashdown without using any more fuel at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, rounding errors can add up and in reality, the purple line wasn\u0027t quite where I ended up being. I had to correct to bring my reentry altitude lower. But it was close.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime
