Yes, those little green guys will have to actually do some work soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow you can look at it is you are mission control, able to take over flight operations. Otherwise it will be left up to the kerbals to fly the craft per a mission plan.

Complete failures would most likely mean the kerbals would be killed and therefore out of the picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look at it at how nice it will be when those bulky ASAS and SAS modules are no longer necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-09T05:40:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blank\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Blank\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m sure you all know that the SAS can be pretty jittery.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EThe jitter can be reduced by messing with the Ki/Kp/Kd values in the part\\\u0027s CFG file.
