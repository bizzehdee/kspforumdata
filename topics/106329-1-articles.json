For occlusion essentially the 1st part in a stack takes full drag, the middle pats take occluded drag (its actually near 0 if you arent flying at an angle), and the rear part has like 50% drag or something like that. This means occlusion doesnt do much if anything when you have just 2 parts, it lowers drag on the rear part by some, but not by much. Occlusion ONLY kicks in when you have 3 or more items stacked. One way to exploit this is to make a stack of stuff, and place a cubic strut on the front and back. this gives the entire middle FULL occlusion, AND cubic struts have basically 0 drag anyways, so im pretty sure you can guess what that means when it comes to drag for the whole stack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, if you havent already figured it out, occlusion DOES NOT CARE about relative size of parts that are behind/in front. This means that a cubic strut will occlude anything including a 3.5m tank FULLY!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/TrJTd\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

One tip that i have though (if u want to cut down drag) is to place a cubic strut behind a rapier, itll take the rear drag and rapier gets full occlusion from it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T02:24:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENope, it\u0027s by entirely by mesh, does nothing with bounding box or colliders.
