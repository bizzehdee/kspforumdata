Likewise, the greater distance from Earth compared to the Moon would not be any great obstacle with the technology available at the time. I\u0027m figuring things off the top of my head here, so expect inaccuracies, but it strikes me that a \u0022real equivilent\u0022 to Minmus might see a similar increase in travel time with respect to travelling to the Moon. In KSP, going to the Mun (one-way) takes less than a day, and going to Minmus takes between 6 and 8 days. In reality, going to the Moon (one way) takes three days, so travel to a \u0022real Minmus\u0022 would take around 18 to 24 days, with a round trip on the order of 40-50 days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s a long time to be cooped up in the same Apollo capsule, even with a lander to serve as a \u0022second room\u0022, so the big change I would see would be the need for extra living space. Essentially, imagine Skylab with an engine and a lander module attached, and you have a spacecraft capable of reaching \u0022rMinmus\u0022. In reality, Skylab held people comfortably for up to 60 days at a time, so such a voyage would certainly be within its capabilities. Thus, such a voyage would neither need nor spur developments in life-support technology beyond what was already present in the 1970s. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only thing I can imagine such a voyage would do might be to get some extra life out of the Saturn-V launch vehicle, as Skylab is still a fairly hefty spacecraft even if only to put in orbit, and sending it on a voyage to the Moon or \u0022rMinmus\u0022 would require more fuel and engine power than the Apollo missions needed. There would be as much of a price tag of sending humans to \u0022rMinmus\u0022 as sending them to the moon, so the final question becomes: would we bother? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming the political situation in our alternate history is unchanged, then by the time humans land on the Moon, the Russians would already have given up their lunar dreams, and perforce would have given up dreams of landing cosmonauts on \u0022rMinmus\u0022 as well. So without the impetus of \u0022Beat the Russians\u0022, I suspect that any proposals to send humans to \u0022rMinmus\u0022 would have gone the way of later Apollo mission proposals: precisely nowhere. We would probably send probes, but we were already launching interplanetary probes successfully in the 1960s, so again, no great technological breakthroughs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, no, I don\u0027t think an \u0022rMinmus\u0022 would have let us be more advanced or more established in space than we are already. We might have learned more about near-Earth asteroids sooner, but I expect that we wouldn\u0027t turn our attention to \u0022rMinmus\u0022 again until the time comes for us to start sending humans to the planets in earnest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"peadar1987","CreatedById":81207,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-16T20:58:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt might have led to a more interesting space race. rMinmus would have a lower delta-V requirement than the moon, (for a landing and recovery, obviously not for a simple orbiter), but requires a significantly different mission profile.

I suspect that it would also have required Earth orbit rendezvous of two fairly complex Saturn V sized payloads, so might have led to better spacecraft designs to make the creation of a Really Large Spacecraft from its component chunks, as reliable as possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yes, potentially rMinmus could have driven the development of space technology, although most of it would have been incremental improvements on Apollo era technologies rather than anything truly revolutionary.
