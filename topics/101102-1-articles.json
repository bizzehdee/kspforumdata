Instead of working with Unity guys they have to report bugs and invent workarounds. Chris Roberts also hit a wall in the development of Star Citizen and was quick to find out that he needed to work with the Crytek together to overcome their engine limitations. As I see it, the only way KSP can pump up its performance is another inventive workaround or a tight work with Unity engine guys. The second option lies in the hands of the owners of Squad, because it is a financial decision. KSP is their first game and they certainly don\u0027t have experience in game development like Chris Roberts which makes them reluctant in funding things they don\u0027t understand. It usually takes an experienced, respected, eloquent and persistent developer / engineer to team up with the producer / project manager on a mission to crack the mind of the CEO and persuade him to make a financial decision.
