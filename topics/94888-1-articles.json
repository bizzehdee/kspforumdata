At 10% rewards, putting a satellite in orbit around Kerbin seems to be offering around $12k per contract. I have a minimal satellite for \u0022Keosynchronous orbit\u0022 that runs me around 3,420 to launch, AND be able to work with remote tech. Seeing as how the satellite launches are some of the least profitable contracts, compared to the \u0022infinite\u0022 temperature scans you can do with a single vessel, I think a reasonable payout, if you just use time acceleration to get in the target zones, would be $150-200k / hour, minimum. Depending on whether or not you\u0027ve upgrade \u0022Mission Control\u0022 so that you can have several temperature scan contracts to give you plenty of targets, you could be making more than that with no additional costs, if you don\u0027t mind the \u0022grindy\u0022 feel. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock hard seemed like I was building funds far too quickly compared to everything else, which is why, like \u0022Amahula\u0022, I went with the 10% rewards (along with no reverts, quicksaves, etc, 1000% penalties, 0 starting cash, -1000 starting reputation) to make things more challenging, just to see if I could do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for \u0022more interesting\u0022 contract options, I thought this contract was pretty interesting. I think it\u0027s a bit much to expect us mere mortals to position a satellite with an apoapsis and periapsis that vary by 2 meters. Well KSP, I accept this challenge, and will attempt to do so without the \u0022Flight computer\u0022 given to me by remote tech! While I try to avoid the parts test missions, I do agree that, at times, it did seem like I was cycling through 3 or 4 parts, over and over again, and would be nice if contracts like \u0022Test a communotron 16 in orbit of Kerbin\u0022 were offered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://s1.postimg.org/rsgy7e4r3/Stationary_Orbit.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Stationary_Orbit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-30T03:59:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/30/2014 03:59  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by ticalc2014\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Amahula","CreatedById":132959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-30T11:56:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Specialist290\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Specialist290\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust dropping a note in here to let y\u0027all know we\u0027ve moved this into Suggestions and Development Discussion, since it looks like OP is making a suggestion to alter an existing mechanic.
