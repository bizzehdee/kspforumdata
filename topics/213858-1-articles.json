I moved the camera below on accident because it isn\u0027t stopped by surfaces for some reason, and I saw a lot of these tiny scatters underground, out of sight.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002252.25\u0022 height=\u0022607\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895430697785905162/1080015428656566302/image.png\u0022\u003E\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnderground view, erroneous scatters circled, many more, but don\u0027t have the time to find em all\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002289.50\u0022 height=\u0022671\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895430697785905162/1080015609758232607/image.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nView from the surface, the little scatters are almost all hidden\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuicksave \u002B Quickload doesn\u0027t fix it, neither does going to map screen and back\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, Minmus is looking a bit bland and bleak, even for Minmus standards, and I hope that once this issue is resolved, it will make the minty moon a bit more interesting to visit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
