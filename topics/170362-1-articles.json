Steam version, downloaded and reinstalled multiple times over the years. Always worked fine, until recently. Game loads up just fine; no hangups on the load screen at all. Main menu works, in addition to the other settings and such. Loading up the Space Center works as well, with no issues until I enter the Hangar/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or the Launchpad/Runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EHangar/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E: Cannot see the vehicle being built, at all.

I can still launch the vehicle, and all the control are just as responsive, yet again: I cannot see the vehicle. It should be noted, that I can still view the orbital map mode, and the tracking station still works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have tried to validate files\u00A0and have reinstalled multiple times, but to no avail.
