I launched the entire thing in a fairing so I am assuming the fairing somehow destroyed those wheels when I opened it. I opened at like 45km altitude so could it have been the atmosphere? Wouldn\u0026#39;t make sense and only one set was broken.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nShould I feel bad about contemplating repairing the wheel via editing the vessel\u0026#39;s text file?
