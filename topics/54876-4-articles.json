However, I believe that the colors of xenon and argon should be switched - argon emits blue light when put in a vacuum tube and an electrical flow is directed through it, where xenon emits purple light. Argon should possibly also have a darker/more saturated blue, and hydrogen should take over the light blue. However, I fully agree on Kethan being green \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E.

I seem to be getting a ton of errors whenever I open the Alternative Resource Panel, and thought I\u0027d let you know. This is what I\u0027m getting when I open it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Exception]; ArgumentException: Getting control 0\u0027s position in a group with only 0 controls when doing Repaint\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAborting\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI get that error in the debug menu 13 times before I get this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[Log]: 12/6/2013 4:08:45 PM,KSPAlternateResourcePanel,Saving Config...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I have no idea whether that is relevant, needs fixing, or whatever, but I\u0027m trying to track down whats causing some massive lag, and this is one of the mods producing red errors. Anyway I love the mod, and I hope you\u0027ll continue to develop and maintain it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, and this is the second time i ask, so if you have answered it and I just can\u0027t find it, then I apologize.
