I would advise to use your current situation as an example of how not to go into space, and rather learn form this experience to plan for the maneuvers you need to perform until the end of a mission, therefore to keep fuel for those. I understand both your ships are orbiting Sun, so you spent quite a large amount of Delta-V to exit Kerbin\u0027s sphere of Influence: with the same amount of Delta-V, you could certainly go around Mun and back to Kerbin, and such a mission would be very useful to make clear what is required to get back.

As soon as you leave the ground, you\u0027re in orbit but that orbit initially crosses the land very soon again, returning you to the \u0022landed\u0022 state. You can change your orbit by running your engines. So there you are: the only way to get out of orbit is to change your orbit so it crosses land somewhere and then wait till your ship meets that land. Then you may of course want to take care that it does not meet that land too violently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy guess is, you built a powerful rocket and then flew straight up, eventually reaching escape velocity (the speed at which the planet can\u0027t pull you back again).
