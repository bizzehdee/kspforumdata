It\u0027s default value is 3.65 and affects how much heat gets through MLI when in a vacuum. Reducing it makes MLI more effective in atmosphere. Setting it to 0 would remove the convective term from the MLI equation entirely.

You will note that temperatures of 20.15 (boiling point of LH2) has an assigned efficiency of 20% - change that if you want the cooling system to be more effective at that temperature, but honestly 20% is probably pretty generous. Deleting the entire section (cryoCoolerEfficiency, brackets and everything in between) will make it default to 70% across the board. Even at 100% efficiency though, it\u0027s always going to be less efficient moving heat from cold temperatures to hotter temperatures.
