So with the phalanx you have a higher chance of a hit due to more rounds going towards the target so you have an increased chance of getting a kill."},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T05:54:59Z","Content":"Well im also making a Kashtan sans missiles so... good luck"},{"CreatedByName":"NuclearNut","CreatedById":143605,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T06:22:23Z","Content":"Well also the fact that the phalanx is easy to add to existing ships, whereas the goalkeeper must have the ship designed with it in it."},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T16:07:05Z","Content":"Yesterday I did no modding as I dedicated my day to sleep and relaxation.

Basically it is a turret that fires a cannon shell with no gravity that looks and sounds like a rocket. This id a workarohnd since there is no wire guidance. It wont be a missile model but I can make it look rocket esque. Once that and the last few turrets are done and I have compiled my aero fixes R-11 will be released this will likely be the last major content update before ksp 1.1 but I will continue maintaining and tweaking things up until then."},{"CreatedByName":"TMasterson5","CreatedById":144591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-20T17:00:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yesterday I did no modding as I dedicated my day to sleep and relaxation.
