(Probably with a resonance like Jupiter) The gas planet would probably be similar to Jupiter as well.The potentially habitable moon itself would be smaller than earth. 60-90 percent radius, but be roughly as massive. Simply having more iron and metals rather than rocky compounds within it. A cross section probably resembling that of the planet Mercury.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you\u0027ll need to increase the radius/take the high end of that range. 60% the radius of earth is 21.6% the volume... you would need to be nearly 5x as dense to be of the same mass. Mercury vs Earth composition wouldn\u0027t help much. The light volatiles that Earth retains but Mercury has lost (hydrogen, Nitrogen) don\u0027t account for much of Earth\u0027s bulk mass. Nearly 65% of Earth is Iron and Oxygen. With Iron being 1/3rd the total mass. Most of that Oxygen is not in the form of our atmosphere, or even water, but with metals as oxides. Mercury also has a lot of oxygen in the form of metal oxides. Oh, lets not forget silicon (15%) which is also similar in abundance on Mercury, magnesium (14%). Sulfur/Nickel/calcium/aluminum each make up 2.9/1.8/1.5/1.4 %. All other elements including hydrogen and nitrogen, make up less than 1.2% of Earth\u0027s mass. We may think that Earth has a lot of lighter volative elements compared to mercury... after all its covered in oceans of H2O! our atmosphere is mostly just nitrogen! That\u0027s only the surface.... and hydrogen is a small % of the mass of water. Earth is in fact the densest planet known.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would say that its bad sci-fi to postulate a planet 5x denser.... sure its not impossible... you could make a planet of mostly U-238, but it seems rather unlikely at this point in the universe\u0027s life. Maybe if it formed very close to where a star previously went supernova (where the heavier elements are made)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe planet would have a thicker atmosphere than earth, probably 2-5atm at sea level, and the planet would have a lower abundance of water, possibly only enough to allow for a few small seas on the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that can work if its farther out and thus the temperature at the top of the atmosphere is colder. Given the lower mass, if you want to hold on to lighter gasses (note: CO2 as on Venus is quite a bit heavier than water vapor and neon), it should be farther out. More volatiles in the atmosphere seems inconsistent with a denser composition. Why does it have all these volatiles around it, yet its surface and interior must be depleted in them to get the required densities. - not naturally formed? Why does it have all these volatiles, but very little water? even outgassing which will outgass water vapor... unless that vapor is being lost while CO2 is being retained. Its a mostly CO2 atmosphere? Its possibly habitable for some form of life but not humans?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, having few seas and a dense interior should mean something happened that depleted the volatiles...

If I were on an inner moon, I might find myself in a radiation belt. If I were just on my own, I might potentially have my own magnetic field. (My planet is basically a flying iron core as it is, though.) But being in the magnetic field to a gas giant, but far enough from the giant to avoid radiation belts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it orbits close enough to be protected by the magnetosphere of the gas giant, its definitely locked. If it orbits at a certain distance... its in the radiation belts (like Europa/Io/Ganymede of Jupiter). Jupiter\u0027s 4th large moon, Callisto, orbits mostly outside Jupiter\u0027s radiation belts. Radiation there isn\u0027t much worse than interplanetary space. A dense world like you suggest should generate its own magnetic field to protect itself anyway.
