Like the parts on the outsides are oriented? The darker section the the lettering is on opens and swings down so that the words can be read when the plane is on the runway, and I\u0027d like them to open symmetrically. Also it seems as though the attachment offset values aren\u0027t working either..\n\nEdit: Got the offset to work, still can\u0027t figure out the symmetry issue though.\n\n![PoyDOtQh.png](http://i.imgur.com/PoyDOtQh.png)\n\n![A0U3yJwh.png](http://i.imgur.com/A0U3yJwh.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-23T02:36:32Z\u0022 title=\u002202/23/2015 02:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Quiznos323**"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T20:15:36Z","Content":"The symmetry problem is a bug/feature.
