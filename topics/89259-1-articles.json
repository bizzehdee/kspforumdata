I basically added wheels, more lift, and more xenon to the Model 1 VTOL design, which I posted Here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98989-Herbaldyne-Type-4-SSTO-AKA-the-Flying-Death-Ray-Interplanetary-Kerbocycle\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98989-Herbaldyne-Type-4-SSTO-AKA-the-Flying-Death-Ray-Interplanetary-Kerbocycle\u003C/a\u003E. This thing can take a Kerbal to orbit with around 2000 deltV in bipropellant and another 3,000-5,900 deltaV in ion power, depending on when it is used. I actually updated it since this post to carry 14,000 units of xenon, which left me with more like 4500-7500 of ion deltaV. By my reckoning, that puts landing on and return from every body besides Eve and maybe Tylo within its reach. I will be putting that to the test over my next few KSP sessions...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-03T00:24:37Z\u0022 title=\u002211/03/2014 12:24  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by herbal space program\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Naten","CreatedById":70923,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-03T00:58:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice, I love the crazy designs people make in the crazy world of KSP.
