I am also a big fan of mods, having an entire separate KSP installation for them, including KAS, KJR, KWRocketry, B9Aerospace, Kethane, and a few others. Only one mod which I would never, \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E use: Mechjeb. I can fly my own damn ships just fine, thank you!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut don\u0027t let the mods ruin your experience. They are great and all, but the real fun of KSP is seeing something that you made entirely by yourself flying into the air and doing \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E what you wanted it do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, have fun on the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
