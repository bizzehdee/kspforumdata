The Lemur was designed to facilitate crew transport duty for my orbiting station around Kerbin and it works like a charm.\n\n![iubZe0P.png](http://i.imgur.com/iubZe0P.png)\n\nFlight profile: After rotation off the runway, bring the speed up to about 300 m/s and slowly bring the nose up to about 45 deg. Hold that position until you get to about 8k altitude then bring the nose down to 10 deg. Hold that attitude until you explode or your out of air and need to change to closed cycle on your rapiers. If you fly it perfectly you can hit 1500 m/s before the engines start starving for air.\n\n![awqqAaK.png](http://i.imgur.com/awqqAaK.png)\n\nAction Groups:\n\n1. Toggle engine mode (closed/Open cycle)\n\n2. Toggle elevator deploy (helps hold the nose up on reentry).\n\n3. Toggle docking port open and toggle engine on/off (it sucks to poke the wrong button and move your station out of circular orbit. So turn off the engine).\n\n4. Toggle fuel cell \n\nAbort: Toggle cabin lights.\n\n![gOx6DNA.png](http://i.imgur.com/gOx6DNA.png)\n\nRentry: Move fuel to the rear of the craft and hit action group 2 to deploy the elevators. Enter the atmosphere pointing straight up to present as much of the surface area of the craft as you can to assist in slowing down. Once you have dropped to about 1400 m/s, transfer all the fuel you can to the front of the craft. The craft will become unstable and is not capable of flight If you don\u0027t move the fuel or you are attempting to glide in without at least 80 units of liquid fuel in the nose cone.\n\nCurrently there is a bug that will cause sections of the craft to load out of alignment if the landing gear are retracted. When you release the docking port from the station you are attached to it will happen when the craft re-loads. The workaround is to un-dock with the landing gear deployed. Just retract them once you have detached from the station. \n\nSome pics:\n\n![7MaAB0L.png](http://i.imgur.com/7MaAB0L.png)\n\n![8Ls9nri.png](http://i.imgur.com/8Ls9nri.png)\n\n![I2HPqH2.png](http://i.imgur.com/I2HPqH2.png)\n\nThe Lemur can be easily changed from a crew transport to cargo by simply changing out the center section!\n\n![o6UOTX9.png](http://i.imgur.com/o6UOTX9.png)\n\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/AS5pZ/embed?background=ffffff\u0026text=1a1a1a\u0026link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nDownload Here:  [https://kerbalx.com/Dr_Farnsworth/Lemur](https://kerbalx.com/Dr_Farnsworth/Lemur)\n\n**OLD CRAFT THAT MAY NOT WORK NOW**\n\nGood news everyone!\n\nSpit polishing all of our spit-worthy designs has commenced and our dehydrated designers have reluctantly released many of our vehicles to the sales and swindeling dept (don\u0027t mind the dried spit, it rubs right off).\n\nFirst off is the Farnsworth Dragonfly lander. This craft was one of the first to roll off the assembly line, and over someones foot, and an unlucky engineers head. Unfortunately, the Kerbal relations dept has a strict \u0022you must be, this tall, not dead, and have two feet\u0022 policy so the unlucky employees had to be let go.\n\nCapable of carrying up to four Kerbals! Drone core comes free with each purchase! The perfect weekend getaway lander for the dreary Kerbal family. Don\u0027t even try to land it on a planet with atmosphere or lot\u0027s of that gravity stuff. Rubber toaster not included.\n\n27.4 tons fully fueled, 11.4 empty. 3010 Delta V\n\nAction groups:\n\n1-Landing Legs\n\n2-Lights\n\n3-Docking Port\n\n4-Boarding Ladder\n\nAbort-Solar Panels\n\nSome Images are of the prototype.\n\n**Re released 7/23/15! cleaner lines and such things as that.

It has also been used to grab things with a grabby thing, some might say it\u0027s grab-a-licious, but I wouldn\u0027t because that\u0027s just silly. Not atmosphere rated, don\u0027t even try.

Designed to transport fuel from a surface mining outpost to a orbital refueling station. When it\u0027s full of fuel, don\u0027t smack the stations docking port at 2ms or faster unless you like fixing save files. The ports will jam together sometimes. No returns or exchanges if the Butterfly is stuck to your station like a tick and won\u0027t come off.\n\n106.5 tons fully fueled, 31.5 tons empty.\n\nDelta V 4181.

You have been warned. If your mining operation is on any kind of an incline, I advise leaving the Rhino attached to the mining outpost when not in use so that it won\u0027t wander off.\n\nDrone core equipped, but don\u0027t tell the operator, he thinks he is actually a good driver.\n\nAction groups:\n\n1-Advanced grabber\n\n2-lights\n\n3-boarding ladders\n\nabort-solar panels\n\nAvailable for download from KerbalX link in my signature.\n\n![vVKJlIi.png](http://i.imgur.com/vVKJlIi.png)\n\n![u46W5S4.png](http://i.imgur.com/u46W5S4.png)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Does the arrangement of the fuel tanks keep the center of mass from shifting around?\n\nAfter many explosions and third degree burns, our engineering dept has determined that fuel likes to; get really hot, expand and push things away. Once it\u0027s lit on fire it does not seem to be affected by gravity as much as when it\u0027s non-exploded. Because of this discovery we have devised interesting regimes (fuel lines) to move the non-exploded fuel to and from places automatically so that you can experience safe (not really), comfortable (ha), controllable (no guarantees), flight.\n\nShort answer is all the crafts should automatically fuel balance as the fuel is burned. Don\u0027t come wining to me if your unbalanced because of fuel burnt on you though.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nDesigns for the mining operation and orbital station modules will be coming forthwith and so forth\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128254-Farnsworth-Minmus-Ike-mining-operation](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128254-Farnsworth-Minmus-Ike-mining-operation)"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank_G","CreatedById":100000,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T06:41:22Z","Content":"While the design is somewhat alien to me, i really like the unique construction technique.
