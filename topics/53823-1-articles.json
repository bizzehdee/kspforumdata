It can land on and then return from anywhere except Laythe, Tylo, and Eve (and Jool and Sun and the lander won\u0027t get to orbit from Kerbin surface). Of course when going to extremes (Moho, Eeloo) you may need to be careful about fuel or just pack one more orange tank. Notice they are all docked together so it can be reconfigured during flight or drop empty tanks on collision courses when needed and possible. That RCS tank has a probe core and can act as a tug for pulling parts around or just reorienting remaining fuel tanks in orbit for rendezvous after landing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jamgoth","CreatedById":93845,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T03:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow much fuel did you have left, out of curiosity?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-21T06:27:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jamgoth\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jamgoth\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow much fuel did you have left, out of curiosity?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegarding the Eeloo mission:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- more than one tank was used on ejection burn.
