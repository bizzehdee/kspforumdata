As a real kerbal beginner if my plane doesn\u0027t lift, it needs just more powerful engines, solves every problem right? Well the problem is, that if you try to start your plane at max power, the engines start wobbling and thus not push straight forward anymore thus pushing the plane off the track. I think the drifting to the side forces the unstraight boost of the engine even further, pushing the plane more and more off the track. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe solution to the drift off the runaway in this and my only and most experienced problem is not to fix the tires, but to lower the force for the engines. I had to start my plane at 50% push. While the plane is driving slow/standing still, the engines boosting at full power apply a huge force to themself/their connection to the plane. When the plane is actually flying at fast speed, there isn\u0027t this huge force anymore and it will fly straight even if you are at max power. At least that is what I experience. So if you have problem with you plane going off the track, try to start with less power until you lift off (like 50-60%). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed what also help is adding vertical wings, like fish fin at the wings to correct the drift off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw, I first thought its a tireproblem and tried adding more tires (==weight) to the plane, but the problem was still there.

You can\u0027t actually have a pure aileron in default KSP because an aileron is a control surface only hooked up to the roll axis and doesn\u0027t respond to pitch control - in KSP they are either hooked to both pitch and roll (if symmetrically linked) or just pitch. (you can have vertical surfaces linked with roll control too, but that is just weird \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, another KSP issue related to that - elevators behind the Center of lift (or mass?) seem especially ineffective in KSP, especially when attached to wings that are attached mid-fuselage. This mostly because of the lawn dart syndrome you described, because without canards, the CoL shifts back away from the CoM and marginalized the elevators on the wings. So a Delta-wing style plane (or something like the space shuttle, which only has elevons on the main wings) is very difficult to make in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemember, KSP was originally designed for rockets. Winglets on the bottom of a rocket are set up to work in combination to provide pitch, roll, and yaw, in whatever arrangement we slap together. So it helps to think of the control surface behavior as being \u0022mapped\u0022 in the same way as RCS thrusters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe response of a control surface is dictated by its location relative to Center of Mass. The proportion of the response is a simple SIN(\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) function. So if it is put on the tail, exactly centered, it will not respond to roll inputs, only pitch. If you put two surfaces, it doesn\u0027t matter if they are linked by symmetry or not. (Turn on part clipping, and put two surfaces in the center. When they are perfectly overlapped, they will not respond to roll input.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame thing with ailerons. If they are placed exactly even with CoM, they will not respond to pitch inputs. (The only way I can ever do this is by mounting them flush to the top or bottom of a wing surface, near the leading edge.) Since most people put them on the trailing edge, they are behind the CoM, so KSP treats them like rocket winglets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sorry, this would be much easier to understand with sketches or a video.
