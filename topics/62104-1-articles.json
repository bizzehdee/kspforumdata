Now I\u0027m beginning to wonder what others have come up with as a satellite array. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine is simple so far: 3 satellites in a ring around Kerbin at 4200km for normal orbital coverage, and a large relay station and relay satellite at a 6600km orbit, about 90* phase difference. Here\u0027s a screenshot: (I am working at getting the three satellites @ 4200km to form a triangle around Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee229/Sir_Joab/screenshot31.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot31.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo!
