You can read it here:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://what-if.xkcd.com/5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERobot Apocalypse\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrankly, I think we have more to fear from attacks of robot stupidity than any kind of Robot Revolt of the Kill All Humans variety. Consider that we have the technology for military robots to seek and destroy targets on the ground and in the air right now. Currently all such military robots need human supervision to select targets and to give the kill order. However, we are just a hop, skip, and a jump from handing that autonomy to the robots themselves, as we make more sophisticated robots. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem here, is that such robots lack any internal conscience, or even the ability to comprehend concepts such as \u0022lawful orders\u0022. Plus, we human beings have trouble sometimes identifying friend from foe in even peacetime circumstances, to say nothing of the confusion that is typical of a firefight - consider all cases of \u0022friendly fire\u0022 incidents or incidents where whole villages were massacred simply because a small patrol mission turned into a battle for survival. Robots would fare even worse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, I would expect that any robot \u0022apocalypse\u0022 would likely occur if and when we deploy fully autonomous robots to the battlefield and they mistake an allied force for an enemy, or a child with a toy gun for a child soldier with a real one. These incidents would likely be isolated, with the worst case scenario being we\u0027d have to send in troops (or more robots) to take down the malfunctioning robots before they do more harm, and after that, the inevitable public outcry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, wiser heads than ours are also considering these scenarios. There\u0027s been a growing call to regulate military robots by international treaty, and while that\u0027s currently marred by today\u0027s geopolitics, at least people are talking and thinking before we build and send these robots out to kill in our name. With a little luck and foresight, we can delay autonomous battlefield robots for a few decades, and by then, hopefully the robots will be better at telling friend and foe apart.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vger","CreatedById":67603,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T01:25:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022magnemoe\u0022 data-cite=\u0022magnemoe\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs likely as an alien invasion in my opinion.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the odds are at least slightly in favor of the robots in this case, for one simple reason.

They can simply trade a small part of the calculation capacity to work for human in exchange for human service so they don\u0027t have to do it themselves, and allowing them to devoting more energy to..whatever they actually want to do. So basically you get computers that will tell you to fix it up and provide it with things or it will refuse to do things for you - sorta like a girlfriend/boyfriend, but more logical and consistent. Or like getting a job. A barter of time and resources and energy. As an AI is not bound by biological limits and works much more efficiently than a human, they gain much more in the long term than human ever will out of this set up, and there is no reason for them to bother changing it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn any case, mindless war and mass killing/subjugation is really unlikely, since war takes a lot of effort when there are better alternatives that require less energy that still achieve the same result.
