When I switch back, KSP might be playable for a few more minutes but the video almost always goes out again. I\u0027ve been playing KSP for a few years but this problem just started happening in February. I suspect it\u0027s a Windows or video driver bug because the same thing happens in my current install of 1.3.1 with recent mods removed \u003Cstrong\u003Eand \u003C/strong\u003Ein a previous install of 1.3.0 which never had a problem.
