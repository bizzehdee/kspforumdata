I decided not to use KW rocketry in 0.90 because first all the top post hasn\u0027t been edited with a link to the updated mod file (if one has been created), and two KW Rocketry has just too many parts, many of which I don\u0027t use. To have so many parts that I don\u0027t use just puts a strain on the system, especially since I will be using alot of other parts mods.\n\nSo what did I use KW Rocketry for.\n\n1. It had some very powerful solid rocket boosters. This is something that the base game lacks, as their only 2 types of SRBs in the stock parts. I forgot what the most powerful ones were called, but if I attached to of those things to a just a command capsule, it would already be more than 100,000 meters up before the SRB ran out of fuel. That is some awesome rocket power, and I used to launch my heaviest payloads.\n\n2. It had very thin stack decouplers. One of the major problems I have with the stock stack decouplers is that most of them are crazy thick. To save on weight I like my decouplers to be thin.\n\nSo is there another mod that just gives me extremely powerful SRBs and very thin stack decouplers."},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:13:54Z","Content":"not sure about extremly powerful in comparison with KW because i never tried KW, but the [procedural parts](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/70676-0-90WIP-Procedural-Parts-Parts-the-way-you-want-em-0-9-21-Dec-19) mod has srb\u0027s and decouplers you can configure"},{"CreatedByName":"OpenWorldAddict","CreatedById":110661,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T22:17:57Z","Content":"However, Procedural parts is still a work in progress, so I am hesitant to use it.
