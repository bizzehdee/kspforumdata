I\u0027ve heavily modded other games so I know what goes on with memory limits, incompatibilities, etc, so, with the new 24.2 version of KSP, I am looking for some great mods to use with the 32 bit version since it is more stable. I actually already have a ton of mods downloaded but I am having trouble deciding for a new main career mode save which ones to use, without the constant crashing, etc, so I am looking for others\u0027 suggestions who have played with these wonderful creations from these talented modders!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrimarily, what I am looking for is the best all-around experience without overloading my game, including new ways to gather science, new contracts, maybe some colonization equipment, etc, all without worrying about overloading the game, since this is obviously different than modding, say, Skyrim. As I said I have a ton downloaded, around 50 or so , but Im looking for the communities\u0027 suggestions for the best for compatibility and performance. I do have a very powerful PC, but that does not help with the limitations of 32bit KSP.
