This thing is a beast, my flagship of my entire navy. It has 12 stackable tire-torps 2778m/s of d/v when fully loaded and 3211m/s when empty. When loaded it has 0.21 twr.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe Dragon Lore has been laboured on for ages and 3 have come before it, 2 of them had a corrupt game file and couldn\u0027t be saved. A days work lost in the dark and dank\u00A0abyss of the Kraken.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut I continued to fight on with the V3. That was the first complete Dragon Lore. It had a lot of floors like a terrible twr,\u00A0d/v, and weapons.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt had a great armour system though with 2 layers of plates and a wing layer covering the rest of this.\u00A0Surprisingly that didn\u0027t help much and I thought that the weaponry would be far more important than a slight improvement on armour.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI ditched the \u0027Dragon Scale\u0027 armour and went with a more conventional 1 layer of plates and 1 layer of wing. This didn\u0027t compromise much on the structure of the craft but where it did help was in the weight side of things (and part count).\u003Cbr\u003E\nI could now fit the Dragon Lore with my stackable tire-torps. All that was left was the manoeuvring rcs system and lighting and we have this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ELight Fighter - Fang - v2\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/4Qh9H/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNamed after it\u0027s characteristic fangs on the cockpit design\u00A0and the stubby landing gear the \u0027Fang\u0027 is an all purpose Light Fighter designed to deal with enemy fighters and take some pot shots at a frigate.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s usually seen accompanied by a carrier of some sorts as it has a limiting d/v of 1951m/s when loaded and has a standard size docking port and small docking RCS system for that reason. It is great for use on moons with a low gravity (1/4th that of kerbin for optimal results) and can land to provide small recovery missions using it\u0027s vtol engines and search \u0026amp; landing lights.

I spent hours on stream with a few friends just going through the various attempts to build a good looking ship. I finally came up with this cross type hull that looked great. Origionally there were two versions, the base model and this one, the recon craft. I figured that I didn\u0027t need 2 load outs when I made the \u0027Fang\u0027 which replaced the need for the base model. This has 8888m/s of d/v (which I think is a bug, last time I saw it it was at 6km/s d/v idk) and a measly 0.07twr. It works though and does it\u0027s job of scouting very well with the stackable torpedo on top of it. The wings are meant to act as small landing legs but what you\u0027re going to land on with this is beyond me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T09:14:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 09:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by burnoutforzai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"burnoutforzai","CreatedById":93344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-16T13:54:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t worry about this...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-18T09:13:35Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2015 09:13  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by burnoutforzai\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"burnoutforzai","CreatedById":93344,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T21:45:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdded a new thing.
