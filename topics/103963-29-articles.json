I\u0027ll have to do more detailed testing to really say anything conclusive about the new version of Scatterer.\n\n**Edit:**\n\nDid some testing on my game with and without Scatterer. Even without Scatter, there is undoubtedly some kind of vanilla memory leak as the game\u0027s memory usage creeps up. However it doesn\u0027t seem to be as much without it. It also helps that without Scatterer, my initial memory usage (starting at the space center from fresh load) drops to 2.95 versus 3.24.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-17T16:10:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2015 04:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Why485**"},{"CreatedByName":"blackrack","CreatedById":104258,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T16:11:18Z","Content":"Does anybody know how to load an array of string or list of string using the configNode storage method?
