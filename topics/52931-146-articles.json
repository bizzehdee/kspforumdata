So far, so good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I just returned from a test flight (testing something completely unrelated), and on the capsule, I had both a mk16 main chute and a pair of mk12-R drogues. And what I noticed on descent is that apparently the drogue chutes produce exactly as much drag as the main chute does (that is, a single drogue chute fully equaled the mk16). Checking the info panel, that sort of makes sense in the way that both of these are indicated as having the same deployed area, which I presume is the main figure that\u0027s taken into account. The ingame model of the drogue chutes is much smaller, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noticed that the mk16 main chute actually isn\u0027t able to slow a single starter pod down below 7 m/s before touching down. In stock, it would be able to do so, even with one or two extra parts attached. That\u0027s important for career mode, where this is the only parachute you have available at the start, yet pretty much all the parts you have (other than the pod and the modular girders) don\u0027t survive touchdowns over 6 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that perhaps some of you may itch to answer \u0022just use RealChute in the first place\u0022, but I\u0027d like to keep it simple and stick with stock.
