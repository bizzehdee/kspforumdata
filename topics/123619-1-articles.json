With hundreds of deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage, this season was the costliest and one of the deadliest Pacific hurricane seasons. This was due to a strong El Ni\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B1o. The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15, 1997 in the eastern Pacific, and on June 1, 1997 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1997. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when almost all tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Atlantic_hurricane_season\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Atlantic_hurricane_season\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe 1997 Atlantic hurricane season is the most recent season to feature no tropical cyclones in August \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 typically one of the most active months. The season officially began on June 1,[1] and lasted until November 30.[2] These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The 1997 season was inactive, with only seven named storms forming, with an additional tropical depression and an unnumbered subtropical storm. It was the first time since the 1961 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the entire month of August. A strong El Ni\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B1o is credited with reducing the number of storms in the Atlantic, while increasing the number of storms in the Eastern and Western Pacific basin to 19 and 29 storms, respectively. As is common in El Ni\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00B1o years, tropical cyclogenesis was suppressed in the tropical latitudes, with only two becoming tropical storms south of 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0N.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"}]}
