Use IVA for all launches and burns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is to see how much infrastructure you can build in the Kerbin Planetary System with in 48 to 54 hours. Here the catch though: Everything must be done in real time, meaning time warp is NOT allowed. You are allowed to sleep, eat, take care of daily chores, whatever else you need to do as long as you check back frequently, have KSP running the entire time; and make sure not to miss your important laucnh, burn and transfer deadlines. Of course all of this must be done live on twitch. Sound\u0027s crazy, eh! Well the crazier the better. If you have an idea that is even more intense, then go for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the mods I will be using, some of which are required for this challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequired:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemote Tech\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKarbonite\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScanSat\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERasterpropMoniter\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbe Control Room\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVessel Viewer\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther mods I will use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb (mostly for planning complex maneuvers (which I am not good at), planning rendezvous, and auto-manage docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmospheric Trajectories\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Attachment System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Inventory System\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Fairings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProcedural Parts\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch Countdown\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinal Frontier\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Engineer Redux\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShip Manifest\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnhanced Navball\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActionGroupsExtended\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActionsEverywhere\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStockBugfix modules\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDmagic Orbital Science\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFreight Transport Technologies\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStockalike Station Parts Expansion\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtraplanetary Launchpads\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that is what I will be using.
