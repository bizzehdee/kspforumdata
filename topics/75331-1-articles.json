Much the same goes for radiation: You can sit someone down and explain to them in great detail how radiation works and why they should or shouldn\u0027t be concerned about some particular amount of radiation, but they may still be irrationally afraid of it.

While you are unconcious anything could happen to the universe and you have no real way of proving otherwise. Think about this possibility, every time you fall unconcious you die. Except the information in your brain is pushed into another universe that is exactly the same, except everything has been \u0027advanced\u0027 by several hours and now you are \u0027waking up\u0027. There is no way to prove or disprove that such a thing is happening. We simply take it for granted that the being that wakes up in the morning IS us because there isn\u0027t much point worrying about the alternatives. Teleportation technology isn\u0027t much different really. Leaving aside the possibility of some teleportation that works via wormhole, first you is vaporized and never knew a thing. Second you appears and only knows that a second ago he was somewhere else. If teleporters existed that were safe (basically I was reasonably guarenteed that a version of me was definitely coming out the other side, healthy and whole) I\u0027d use them without care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps another piece of the question for those that do care though. Most religions (certainly not all) generally speaking declare that animals do not have souls. And yet, they live and operate as beings, they clearly have memories, and they appear to have emotions. What of feral humans? Humans that as children were left in the wilderness to die, but instead thrived but as animals. They cannot be rehabilitated to become a full human, they can be trained much like any of the apes, but most human skills are unlearnable to them. Would one say that these \u0027animals\u0027 have souls? If one operates on the assumption that humans do and animals do not, then the first human through the teleporter either shows that humans have souls and they are not transferable (they suddenly pop out an animal), souls are transferable (the conciousness is there), or shows that humans do not NEED souls (no soul is present, but the person in question still operates normally without any changes). In the latter two cases, does it really matter which is true? We could \u0027solve\u0027 the ethics debate by being technically horrible and having every newborn immediately pass through a teleporter, thereby ensuring that on the offchance that humans through teleporters don\u0027t have souls that no human has one and therefor has a pass on \u0027final judgement\u0027 (so you cannot be punished in the \u0027afterlife\u0027 for participating in this \u0027murder\u0027) and ensuring that all human souls are passed on in an \u0027innocent and pristine\u0027 state, which most religions tend to treat neutrally if not well. With this system, you never need to worry about losing your soul, because you never really had one to begin with. Horrible (maybe?), but effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, if you want to read a book series where people grappel with this question often (more on the clone with backup memories for immortality side of things than teleportation, but really its the same) read Dark Space. It is an enjoyable (I grab the new ones when they come out) if not a particularly great series if you like hard sci fi, it is definitely on the soft side, and the author seems to have a serious beef with the idea of people doing immortality, any immortality. As characters frequently see any of the infinite great things of being immortal, then they run into one tiny problem (every case I have seen so far is either correctable via policy or engineering) they go \u0022Oh my god! What have we done?! This technology is ONLY bad!\u0022 There is even a character that has been alive for 10K years and when the others try to convince him that being immortal is just wrong (but what about your soul?!) he\u0027s like \u0022You people are stupid, being immortal is great.\u0022 and then in the space of 5 seconds while he is off doing something by himself he suddenly goes \u0022Oh god...what about my soul?! I must turn this machine off!\u0022. So everybody flipflops all around. But the main good point for the sake of this argument is that he does keep coming up with hypothetical bad situations for people to get into with this tech.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
