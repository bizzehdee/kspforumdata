I should play with some sort of periodic funding system since I don\u0027t do many contracts, but usually I\u0027m just very selective about which ones I choose (Finally got enough for tier 3 R\u0026D after completing the Explore Ike contract after 2 years of in-game time). Construction times force me to take contracts that are higher paying but still in line with my goals. I also don\u0027t feel like grinding science, so I used the Outsourced Science strategy so I wouldn\u0027t have to worry about it. I\u0027ve still got thousands left over after finishing the tech tree.\n\nI\u0027m usually limited by funds, which limited my tech. As a result, my Eeloo probe has an antenna that can only reach Kerbin when Eeloo is at periapsis and Kerbin\u0027s on the same side of the Sun, so I\u0027m working on a kOS script to control the thing when it\u0027s out of contact. It has to do the orbital insertion and manage power reserves and scansat scanning.
