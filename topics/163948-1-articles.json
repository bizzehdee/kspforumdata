Well you\u0027ve come to the right place. These tutorials should support the total beginner. So for a start, lets talk about space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022magellanic-clouds.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://space-facts.com/wp-content/uploads/magellanic-clouds.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat you see above you is space. The reason we walk on the Earth (Home) Is because of something called \u003Cstrong\u003Egravity.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EGravity was discovered by a guy named Isaac Newton. Gravity works like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022solar-system-orbit.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.wisegeek.com/solar-system-orbit.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe object with the most\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Emass\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0or a measure of how much matter is in an object, attracts the objects with less matter. Although, the objects require\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Evelocity\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eto be able to have an orbit around an object, other wise they will just fall to it. So lets say we have the sun and the Earth. The Earth orbits the sun at 30km/s, which means that every second it moves 30kilometers. That\u0027s fast. Luckily, in KSP everything is scaled down. Kerbin or the Earth in this orbits at 9284.5m/s or around 9.3km/s. That is less than a 3rd of reality and a lot to play around with. So a 120km orbit around Kerbin is around 2km/s. This is what you want to achieve. But, you have to get high enough, so that takes about 2.5km/s of velocity, or we will refer to velocity needed as \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003E\u0394v\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cfont color=\u0022#000000\u0022\u003Eor DeltaV. The explanation of this is that Delta means increase in and the V is Velocity. So it is the change in velocity. So how do we acquire\u00A0this change in velocity then? We use rockets.\u003C/font\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
