I\u0027m pretty sure the control issues are related to shifting CoM, due to all the Oxidiser mass being behind the CoL on the way up, and the abundance of lift and spread mass distribution on the way down. Shifting fuel mass forward is exactly what I would have suggested. Did you follow to my suggestions about disabling fuel feed? If so perhaps disabling fuel feel from the other forward tanks on the way up would deal with the problem.\n\nI started on a design evolution yesterday but then realised that 100 kerbs to anywhere is totally excessive (unless you\u0027re literally colonising :-p).
