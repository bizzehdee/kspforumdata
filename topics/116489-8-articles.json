I\u0027m pretty sure the control issues are related to shifting CoM, due to all the Oxidiser mass being behind the CoL on the way up, and the abundance of lift and spread mass distribution on the way down. Shifting fuel mass forward is exactly what I would have suggested. Did you follow to my suggestions about disabling fuel feed? If so perhaps disabling fuel feel from the other forward tanks on the way up would deal with the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI started on a design evolution yesterday but then realised that 100 kerbs to anywhere is totally excessive (unless you\u0027re literally colonising :-p).

Drag is a big problem for Mk 3 parts whatever you\u0027re building - u can\u0027t add moar thrust anywhere without increasing the drag profile, and since all the engines have specific roles it\u0027s a nightmare balancing everything!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-04T21:43:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/04/2015 09:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by The_Rocketeer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vegetal","CreatedById":147251,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-05T02:23:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENich, what about a plane that goes to Duna or other planets?
