The reason is that I planning to conduct a Kerbal Space Program 54 hour real time challenge live on twitch. The challenge is to start in science mode at 4 pm on friday to 10 pm on sunday and to see how much I can get done in real time without using time warp. I will most likely be running many missions simultaneously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I am still going to sleep about 6 to 7 hours a night, have 3 meals, and even do other things in that time span, but that whole entire time kerbal space program will be running on the computer, and I will need to be back on my computer on time to meet transfer windows and encounters. I need to know how much time passes in KSP vs. real time so that I can plan my breaks, know exactly how much real time I have until that next burn I need to make, etc. I will have Kerbal Alarm Clock, but that won\u0027t help me if I am not there at critical moments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI plan to start streaming at 4 pm and go until 6, take an hour for dinner, then go from 6 to 10, at which point I will go to bed. As soon as I wake up in the morning I will have breakfast and then stream all day in 3 to 4 hour segments with time for lunch and dinner on Saturday, as well as taking care of chores while the game is going. I would again be on until 10 pm saturday night, and then sunday would just be a repeat of saturdays schedule. At the end of Sunday at 9 or 10 pm, I would then see how much progress I have made in those 54 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how do you convert KSP time to real time?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stibbons","CreatedById":57865,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T10:14:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time\u003C/a\u003E should have everything you need to know.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T10:16:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow game time passes in relation to real time depends on the Max Physics Delta Time setting and the overall power of your pc.
