Is there a specific way to set up these animations in the hierarchy so that they play nice with eachother? Or, is it possible to set the emissive as a snapshot of frames inside the rotation animation so that it counts as one animation, eliminating the need for two animation components, or does it not work that way? Previously I had the emissive set to the nozzle section (which is part of the animation that is rotated), but it would only activate in game if the nozzle had not been rotated, and would not activate after rotation also.
