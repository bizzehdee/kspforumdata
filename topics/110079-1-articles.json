Even in the high upper atmosphere (\u003E30 km), I was losing Ap height at an unexpected rate. Much more so than in Kerbins upper atmosphere. \n\nShouldn\u0027t the upper atmosphere on Duna be much thinner than Kerbin\u0027s, since it is thinner at sea level. I\u0027d expect the atmo tapering off slower on Duna, but the initial density is so low, the drag should not be measurable at 30\u002B km height.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nEdit: It has been verified that the atmosphere of Duna has higher drag at 30000 m than that of Kerbin\u0027s at 40000 m. These heights are both roughly 60% up to vacuum from sea level.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T08:20:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 08:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ftunk70**\n  \nAdded info"},{"CreatedByName":"Idrryl","CreatedById":115209,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T09:04:40Z","Content":"I have aerobraked on Duna in 1.0.2 with a periaps at about 20km and now that I think about it, the drag was a bit more than I expected.

I guess it would have to do with Duna being smaller and thus not compressing its thin atmosphere at a very high rate. But then I think it is probably premature to end Duna\u0027s atmosphere at 50000 m. It should probably extend to 100-150 km.\n\nEdit: This also means that the pressure should be higher at those altitudes, since drag is proportional to density, which is proportional to pressure. I realise I should have used the presbat instead of the accelerometer for my measurements, it would have been much easier to measure the pressure rather than the drag directly.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T08:07:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 08:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ftunk70**"},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T08:11:45Z","Content":"Maybe Duna atmosphere consists of a heavier gas?"},{"CreatedByName":"Janos1986","CreatedById":132068,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T08:26:30Z","Content":"Maybe the fact that Duna\u0027s gravity is lower than Kerbin\u0027s means that the gases are more evenly distributed in the atmosphere...?\n\nDunno, I\u0027m a plump neckbeard, not a physicist."},{"CreatedByName":"ftunk70","CreatedById":109881,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T08:41:21Z","Content":"Kuu, I think that if the gas is heavier (say 100% Radon?), then the atmosphere will be more concentrated to lower altitudes? \n\nJanos, I think you\u0027re probably right.\n\nThe drag is proportional to air density, but pressure and density goes hand in hand.\n\nI guess Duna\u0027s atmo could be more viscous?

These heights are both roughly 60% up to vacuum from sea level.\n\nYes, the density of Duna air at 30 km is indeed greater than Kerbin air at 40 km.\n\nAt 40 km on Kerbin, the air pressure is 78.89 Pa. Temperature varies, but over the equator it is about 275 K at this altitude. The mean molecular weight of Kerbin air is 28.9644 g/mol. These give us a density of 0.0009994 kg/m^3^.\n\nAt 30 km on Duna, the air pressure is 108.0 Pa. The temperature at this altitude is 150 K. The mean molecular weight of Duna air is 14 g/mol. These give us a density of 0.001212 kg/m^3^.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Maybe Duna atmosphere consists of a heavier gas?\n\nDuna\u0027s atmosphere is actually composed of lighter gases, having a mean molecular weight of 14 g/mol. In real life this doesn\u0027t make sense. A small terrestrial planet like Duna could never retain the lightweight gases needed to lower the molecular weight to 14.\n\nBTW, in just the last couple of days I revised the atmosphere section of each planet\u0027s Wiki article. There is now a table for each planet that gives the pressure at various altitudes. Some of you might find that information useful.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-22T15:56:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2015 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob**"},{"CreatedByName":"Dspan_000","CreatedById":144320,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T02:45:48Z","Content":"They changed the Aerodynamics system now so expect stuff that didn\u0027t happen before.
