Then, set an interplanetary manoeuvre for it. This will let you know roughly where the periapsis needs to be. Then, cancel the manoeuvre and burn near the node to raise your opposing periapsis as high as possible and drop the probe. The required ejection angle will move somewhat while the probe is going to apoasis and back, but with a bit of experience and/or experimenting (very cheap if it\u0027s spaceplane-launched microprobes) you can compensate for that. You don\u0027t have to get the ejection angle perfect; the Oberth boost will more than compensate for any minor imperfections.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-27T06:43:51Z\u0022 title=\u002211/27/2014 06:43  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Wanderfound\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-27T18:09:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf what you mean is burning prograde from a \u003Cem\u003Ecircular\u003C/em\u003E orbit near Minmus\u0027 orbit (and I believe this is the situation intended to be described by the OP), then this statement is demonstrably false.
