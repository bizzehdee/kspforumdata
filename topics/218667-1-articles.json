New to the forums here, but been playing KSP since 2019. I am looking to get into modding, but I don\u2019t really know where to start. Looking to make mostly graphical mods, and integrate shaders I\u2019ve made in Unity into KSP, and I have quite a bit of experience with Unity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat render pipeline does KSP use? And is it possible to edit the effects for engine exhaust, and replace them with my own custom volumetric shader effects?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre there any tutorials that walk through how to install the KSP packages, and use them? Just looking to figure out \u00A0where to start.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the past I have only worked on indie games and simulations, and I have always watched the KSP modding community with awe, I\u2019d really love to make some contributions to the modding pool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAny advice is appreciated! Again, I have plenty of experience in Unity, but none in KPS modding.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RevanX_LSR","CreatedById":216972,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-16T11:47:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCreating part textures would be pretty good, like a part mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
