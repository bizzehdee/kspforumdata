It\u0027s almost as if the controls are overridden and will not take user input to apply thrust in the opposite direction to recover from the spin. Using the time warp to 2x speed stops the spin immediately; however, once you go back to x1 speed the spin begins again, even without any force being applied!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
