Now that we can all enjoy Squad\u0027s complete product I figured it was time to get back into the game in a serious way and start from scratch in career mode.\n\nI also figured it was time to participate in the community that has made this game so special! I look forward to interacting with you all through the forums. If I were to share an ongoing mission log of my career mode with screenshots, a narrative, and random anecdotes, is there an audience for that here?\n\nThank you all for welcoming me and being a part of this truly great game!\n\n-Will"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T23:36:51Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums GehringGame!\n\nThe [Fan Works](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/40-KSP-Fan-Works) section has a subsection called [Mission Reports](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/55-Mission-Reports). That is probably what you are looking for. Generally there is a good audience for the many interesting mission reports.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Dman979","CreatedById":123837,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T23:59:50Z","Content":"Yep, Fan Works is the way to go.
