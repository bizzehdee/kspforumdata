Note: This was the first time (yesterday) i got to another planet. I think this rocket looks horrible, like, seriously (this is why i started this thread), also the take off from the ground is slow. The initial plan for this was to have one manned spacecraft orbiting Duna, and send the unmanned rest of the spacecraft (lander and rover) to the planet, it didn\u0027t work because the part that was supposed to keep orbiting Duna had its fuel depleted when it was creating an orbit so i had to push that part of the plan away and just send the lander to the planet. The two small things on the part that was going to keep orbiting Duna are some kind of escape pods that i created for the kerbals to go to the planet if i wanted, but i haven\u0027t tested it yet so i dunno if it actually works. My first design of this ship had the manned pod in the part with two escape pods, but if i wanted to plant a flag i had to either put it on the lander, or not. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the lander \u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BbsdLPQ.png\u0022 alt=\u0022BbsdLPQ.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/OHcjDeI.png\u0022 alt=\u0022OHcjDeI.png\u0022\u003Eit was kind of \u0022sliding\u0022 to the left of where it was supposed to be pointed to, is this normal?

Should be a little over fifteen tonnes of lander - let\u0027s say sixteen because I don\u0027t known what those FASA bits are). Somewhere around 2400 m/s of delta-V total with 180 kN of thrust, or about 6.9 TWR for Mun landings. A tad short for making it to Mun on its own, though it should be capable of landing on Mun, taking off and making it back to Kerbin by itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer stage - based on the mass of your new lander, a transfer stage consisting of a Rockomax Decoupler, a single X200-16 tank and a Poodle engine should give you what you need. You can add a probe core to guide it into a Munar impact when you\u0027re done with it if you so choose; the x200-16 actually gives you a fair amount more fuel than you really need for the job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith that lander and that transfer stage, you\u0027re up to twenty-five tonnes of payload, give or take.

A core consisting of a single Skipper set at 92% thrust should do the trick. For the boosters, you can use a Bi-Adapter with two LV-T30s (set at 81.5% thrust) each for 2.6 tonnes a pop - which will give you some mass savings over a Skipper there. A single X200-32 tank in each stack (core \u002B boosters) should give you the fuel you need to make orbit (actually the X200-32 is about half-a-tonne too heavy, but you can set the engines for slightly higher thrust levels to offset the extra mass). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a SSR (single stage rocket) instead - you\u0027ll want 7350 kN of thrust, which you can get with five Mainsails or three KR-2Ls firing in concert; I\u0027d recommend the Mainsails as they\u0027re the lighter option.
