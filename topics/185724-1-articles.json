When a vessels chute as been deployed we see an empty cannister that can be repacked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen a personal chute is deployed it looks the same....Can we have the visual changed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find it really annoying to see a Kerbal hanging in the air with an intact chute.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other one is can we get Kerbal foot restraints? As opposed to putting the Kerbals in a chair.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would allow better looking IMUs, putting Kerbals on robotic arms, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course that open the possibility of Kerbals being launched to space holding on by their feet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo counter that could we have a hold-limit of say 0.1g or 0.2G to make them fall off. And or an aerodynamic load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHigh enough to be used in space, Gilly or Minmus but not on the Mun nor Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the reading and the consideration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nME\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
