That and you usually need a higher take off speed in the water than you do on land, wheels rolling on a hard surface cause a lot less friction than pontoons being dragged through the water.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t offer much help with the Dynawing but yeah to confirm what you are saying, Space Shuttles are notoriously hard to fly and design.
