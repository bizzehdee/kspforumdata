Today, I\u0027d like to introduce you to my new line of cool jetplanes, the **F-02 FENGHUANG!!!**\n\n\u003E //imgur.com/a/Zgoh6\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

We currently have two different modifications for the craft, E and S, which I\u0027ll explain in a bit.\n\nThe base aircraft is capable of a variety of tasks, such as:\n\n- Reconnaissance missions (the E variant is particularly useful for such an assignment)\n- Atmospheric scans\n- Temperature and atmospheric pressure recordings\n- Ground scans for mining operations\n- Recreational flights e.g. air acrobatics (best performed with the S variant)\n\nThe modified aircraft currently available are the F-02 Fenghuang Sport, and the F-02 Fenghuang Eco.\n\nThe Fenghuang Sport features better air intakes, a lighter body thanks to the removal of all science-related equipment, an emergency escape system, and powerful ramjet thrusters, making it much more manoeuvrable and a hell of a lot faster, and capable of extremely high flights, up to 15,000 metres. I recommend the S for flight enthusiasts and for those looking to push our craft to it\u0027s extremes. \n\nThe Fenghuang Economical features more fuel and is much more efficient than our other variants, at the cost of a tremendous loss of speed and manoeuvrability. It is suitable for scientific journeys over long distances, and recon missions.\n\nThe aircraft are particularly reliable during takeoff due to the front of the craft being propped upwards. This means the craft takes off rather quickly and cleanly, especially the S variant. I\u0027ve also outfitted the craft with a variety of landing precautions, such as:\n\n- Four airbrakes\n- Reverse engines\n- A light for night landings\n- A bowing mechanism (necessary for entering and exiting the aircraft)\n\nA list of action groups is supplied in the description for each plane. Feel free to suggest changes that could be made to improve my plane\u0027s design, and show off your own modifications. I hope you like my plane! \n\nDownloads:\n\nF-02 Fenghuang: [http://www./download/g6rhz7nt71fw36s/F-02\u002BFenghuang.craft](http://www./download/g6rhz7nt71fw36s/F-02\u002BFenghuang.craft)\n\nF-02 Fenghuang S: [http://www./download/0u2bie164ybs6o8/F-02\u002BFenghuang\u002BS.craft](http://www./download/0u2bie164ybs6o8/F-02\u002BFenghuang\u002BS.craft)\n\nF-02 Fenghuang E: [http://www./download/7vgl58i6arucbbb/F-02\u002BFenghuang\u002BE.craft](http://www./download/7vgl58i6arucbbb/F-02\u002BFenghuang\u002BE.craft)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red- the Engineer","CreatedById":123304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-17T17:12:21Z","Content":"Cool!
