The very first Mars rover, Sojourner, was much like its flying technology demonstrator counterpart, Ingenuity, in that both required their lander counterpart for Earth communications. But the MERs, Curiosity and Perseverance have capacity for direct communications, if needed, and use an antenna similar in shape and size (but not in function) to the narrow-band ISRO resource scanner part (but not spinning). What I\u0027m asking for would be 1/4 the size or so as on the real spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, a direct reliable connection from Kerbin to Duna required at least 2 RA-2s or DTS-M1s (four would be better). This makes a small MER-style rover VERY bulky. Small rovers are impossible beyond Duna, even with a maxed Tracking Center, without an orbiter relay. I don\u0027t want to even talk about how an 88-88 is butt-ugly sticking out of the back of the RoveMate probe for a standalone Jool moon mission. It\u0027s simply not realistic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224052103\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022205530\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221636235977\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153700\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Blaarkies\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 11/6/2021 at 5:59 PM, Blaarkies said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA direct connection from Duna surface with a\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://ksp-visual-calculator.blaarkies.com/signal-check\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECommunotron DTS-M1\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0is possible to a Tracking station level 2-3.

Let\u0027s use stock settings with CommNet enabled. If I wanted to emulate the DragonFly Titan rotorcraft (I\u0027ve made many for Mars, too), which will not have a relay, I MUST use an 88-88. Nothing else will reach. Obviously, this makes flight awkward, ugly and impossible.
