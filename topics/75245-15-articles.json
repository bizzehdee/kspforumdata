In principle they should get along well - they seem to perform useful complementary activities. RT2 to control the delay and connectivity with telling the craft to run commands, and kOS to run commands once it gets to the craft. But in practice there\u0027s been problems with kOS having a hard time getting RT2 to allow it to \u0027sanction\u0027 all the things it wants to control on the craft.

Thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile placing sats you have generally 2 things to consider. Planetary coverage/shadow and the distance to other sats. You want your network to be simple, and allow for drift. (there is of course the issue with antennas breaking in atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo for absolute coverage anywhere on the planet surface you will need 3 equatorial, and 3 polar sats (provided you have long enough omni antennas to place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe things which will matter are of course planet radius, sat altitude, antenna range, and the phase angle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we are talking about a single sat covering planetary surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, altitude equal to planet radius (counting from ASL, so in fact 2R). This will cover 120 degrees (from the circle). This will be the maximum phase angle between 2 sats, and you\u0027ll have 60 degree bald spot on the poles. If you increase your altitude to 2R (3R from center), you\u0027ll cover 141, 3R(4Rfrom center) - 151 and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll recommend a mod called Kerbulator. It\u0027s great for doing math ingame, (even though you\u0027ll need to inpiut the formulas yourself, once). Once you do that, you can just run it for given planet and altitude and antenna, and see the max phase angle for coverage, the uncovered angle at the poles. You could also use it to calculate the required sat distance for given angle. These are pretty basic one liner trigonometry funcs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIIRC (assuming infinite antenna range, as connecting to other sats will generally require greater range) happens to be approximately 2*arccos(R/(R\u002Baltitude)).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile the distance for given phase angle is 2(R\u002Baltitude)*sin(angle/2)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: few more tips...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a sweetspot. For example let\u0027s use 3 sats around kirbin, and the 5000km range antenna. Your the altitude allowing for maximum drift, happens to be around 2000km, your sats will remain connected up to 150 degrees (some 30 degree drift).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-03T09:49:08Z\u0022 title=\u002207/03/2014 09:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Aedile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TeeGee","CreatedById":82434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-03T09:40:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHey everyone!

I agree with those that say it has it\u0027s uses, but at the moment the actual use cases are extremely limited due to its limits, which are neither obvious nor explained (or warned about) in the UI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart of the problem is also that it\u0027s not very obvious why a certain link is (or is not) active when looking at the map, the/only primary tool to diagnose a network. A player controlling a probe/sat currently above the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn - intended as a relay for crafts in it\u0027s shadow - can see the connection to their main network around Kerbin, because those satellites have AV as a target. As far as I know there is no way to see why the connection is made (is it targeted? inside a cone? due to active vessel?). Once he switches to the vessel behind the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn - which would now need that relay - he get\u0027s no connection and doesn\u0027t know why.

All this could be in a tooltip (if KSP allows that) or drawn as text next to satellites (with a new button in the lower-right corner to toggle this). As a more minimalist and less intrusive alternative, color-coding the relay-satellite-icons (and potentially the lines to the target) could also work.

It is severely limited in what it can do, but the idea of it has endless possibilities. From the posts just before mine (which finally made me write this out here), apparently AV only works within the same SoI (and possibly child-SoIs)? Some more wide-ranging limitations, that AV works like a targeted connection and not like a cone: I can\u0027t fly my probe to Duna where I have a small relay-network and have my main interplanetary relay at Kerbin targeting AV. It would only try to reach the probe directly but not use the relay network (which would be perfectly inside the cone when centered on the probe).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings like targeting a planet works great, unless you\u0027re in orbit around one of the moons. Why doesn\u0027t the cone include \u0027child-orbits\u0027, like targeting Duna checks for targets around Ike? I remember vaguely that these limits were due to performance concerns, but it seems a bit too conservative to me. Even around Jool, iterating over 5 moons should still not be an issue in that regard. This would obviously exclude targeting Kerbol, as that would needlessly check against everything...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I do hope I have my facts straight.

Thus, excessive tuning would require ripping the guts of a comms system out and replacing it with new guts. And this is not including the complications that would arise from changing transmission signal frequencies with no regards to spectrum or standards.
