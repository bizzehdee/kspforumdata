After another day, and a brief squall of very confused squid, the weather had finally broken. The ground crews had emerged into the brilliant sunlight and bustled about like ants, replacing Burdous\u0027s rocket on the pad and washing away any stubborn ink stains. Today, the dawn brought cooler temperatures and a balmy sea breeze that chased away the last hints of humidity, but not the uncomfortable wad of anxiety in the back of Valentina\u0027s mind.\n\nShe once again stood in a crowd atop the Mission Control building, a considerably better view afforded by a large box she had grudgingly agreed to stand on. The lunch lady\u0027s back was even worse than her face, as it turned out, and Valentina was nothing if not practical. To his credit, J.R. had wisely advised her to stay upwind as well. \n\n\u0022BOOSTER?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022RETRO?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022FIDO?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022GUIDANCE?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022SURGEON?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022EECOM?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022GNC?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022CONTROL?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022INCO?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022FAO?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022CAPCOM is GO, OTC?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022TBC?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022PTC?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022ILA?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022ZILA?\u0022\n\n.....\n\n\u0022ZILA...?\u0022\n\n.....\n\n\u0022ZILA need you to report station readiness.\u0022\n\n\u0022ZILA is go.\u0022\n\nBeside her, J.R. sighed and rolled his huge eyes, \u0022need to have a chat with them folks.

And do *not* make me repeat that!\u0022\n\n\u0022GO flight!\u0022\n\nJ.R. sighed again, and this time put a hand to his face, \u0022our launch procedures could certainly use some streamlining, too.\u0022\n\n\u0022GNN?\u0022\n\n\u0022GO\u0022\n\n\u0022RSO?\u0022\n\n\u0022Range is clear, range is clear, you have a go.\u0022\n\n\u0022PLT?\u0022\n\n\u0022Go flight!\u0022 Came Burdous\u0027s nasally, jubilant voice echoing through the air. \n\n\u0022All stations report \u0027GO\u0027 for launch.\u0022\n\n\u0022This is launch control, you have permission to launch. Terminal countdown has resumed at tee minus ten minutes.\u0022\n\nValentina and J.R. looked on from their place in the crowd, as the flight controllers steadily worked through their procedures. Like so much here, it was all very familiar, yet surreally different. The crowds, for instance. Other than here on top of the Mission Control building, there weren\u0027t any on the center grounds. She could just see them, thousands of green faces, plastered along the outer perimeter fence. Anyone else on the premises was battened down in heavily reinforced buildings. She related this to J.R.\n\n\u0022Well it\u0027s a dangerous business, rockets,\u0022 he replied, glancing at her but keeping his focus on the distant launch pad, \u0022wouldn\u0027t want any, er, civilian casualties, now. That *is* a Rockomax booster under that capsule, after all.\u0022\n\n\u0022But *we* are expendable?\u0022 She said, not quite looking at him.\n\n\u0022We have a top notch health plan here. Besides,\u0022 he grinned, \u0022y\u0027all signed a waver just like the rest of us.\u0022\n\n\u0022I do not recall signing any waver.\u0022\n\nJ.R. chuckled a bit at that, \u0022ma\u0027am, if you remembered *half* of bovine byproducts you signed comin\u0027 through immigration, Ah\u0027d... why, Ah\u0027d eat mah hat. Shoot, Ah\u0027m in the *business* of signin\u0027 things, and *Ah* don\u0027t even remember half of what Ah signed to get into this country.\u0022\n\n\u0022Tee minus seven minutes,\u0022 Gene echoed again, \u0022begin auto sequence start.\u0022\n\n\u0022Have you thought any more \u0027bout our lil\u0027 offer?\u0022 he asked carefully, still watching the distant rocket.\n\nValentina let the moment drift on a bit, giving her mind time to work as the disembodied voices continued their sermon, \u0022in my country, are many rules...\u0022\n\n\u0022That there are,\u0022 J.R. nodded thoughtfully, \u0022Ah have people well versed in just those sort of rules. Arrangements can be made.\u0022\n\nAn uncomfortable pause stretched on, as Valentina\u0027s mind continued to race, leaning this way and that. \n\n\u0022Core LOX purge.\u0022\n\n\u0022Core purge.\u0022\n\n\u0022Upper LOX purge.\u0022\n\n\u0022Upper purge.\u0022\n\nJ.R. raised an eye... bulge, \u0022don\u0027t trust me, do yah?\u0022\n\n\u0022Uh,\u0022 she stammered, \u0022certainly I do...\u0022\n\nHe then gave a deep, bitter chuckle that chilled Valentina to her core, \u0022really, Mizz Kermanova, Ah imagine yah think Ah\u0027m all *sorts*a nasty things, and yer probably right. But one thing Ah am *not*, and never will be, is a liar. Ain\u0027t got no grace for the breed.\u0022\n\n\u0022So why don\u0027t you and Ah start with one small amity, hmm?\u0022 He turned fully to her now, \u0022let us agree to extend this courtesy to one another, that we won\u0027t *lie* to each other. Can we agree on that much?\u0022\n\n\u0022Fuel tanks to flight pressure.\u0022\n\n\u0022RCS purge, nozzle check, tanks to flight pressure.\u0022\n\nAn uneasy feeling crept over Valentina, as J.R. stood there in the bright sun grinning at her, one she had not felt in a very long time, but knew all too well. Anyone who lived in the taiga came to know the feeling, to come to terms with it, and above all, never to ignore it. She knew well when a predator was stalking her. \n\nAnd you never, *ever*, ran from a predator. \n\n\u0022Batt heaters off.\u0022\n\nShe\u0027d had the feeling, too, when the voice had whispered to her all those... *P\u0426TI\u0419*, had it really only been a handful of weeks? But this was somehow different, more visceral, more *real*. \n\nYou never ran from a predator, you\u0027d just die tired. Instead you waited, stalked it back, and always kept one eye on it.\n\n\u0022Firing command enable.\u0022\n\n\u0022Firing command on.\u0022\n\n\u0022We have the firing command.\u0022\n\n\u0022All right. Fair enough,\u0022 she said.\n\n\u0022Well that\u0027s just excellent!\u0022 J.R. beamed, \u0022y\u0027see? We\u0027re agreein\u0027 already, and negotiatin\u0027s nothin\u0027 but findin\u0027 one agreement after the next. Findin\u0027 the common ground.\u0022\n\n\u0022This is so,\u0022 she kept one eye on him as the launch clock continued to count down.\n\n\u0022Terminate LOX replenish.\u0022\n\n\u0022Close topping valves.\u0022\n\n\u0022Closed.\u0022\n\n\u0022Close vent valves.\u0022\n\n\u0022Closed.\u0022\n\n\u0022Take Mister Burdous there,\u0022 he gestured toward the waiting rocket as plumes of fog began to drift from its flanks, \u0022real piece of work that was, feller\u0027s as stubborn as a mule, just had to find the common ground. He\u0027s a real team player, now.\u0022\n\nHim too? Who else was on this \u0027team,\u0027 she wondered, \u0022is that so?\u0022\n\n\u0022Yes, indeed. Stubborn as a mule, mouth like one\u0027s back end, too, but absolutely brilliant. He\u0027s got idears on nuclear propulsion only Dr. Fermi can fully grasp, but one day he\u0027ll do even greater things for the team.\u0022\n\n\u0022Doctor... Fermi?\u0022 Valentina asked.\n\nJ.R. pointed off toward the Research Center, \u0022Dr. Fermi Kerman. The usual source of all these, er, seismic anomalies you\u0027ve no doubt noticed. World\u0027s leading authority on applied nuclear physics. Team player since the very start. We brought him out here and built him that lab after the powers that be back in Exast were... less communally minded. There\u0027s a place for you, too, here among the great.\u0022\n\n\u0022Tee minus one minute.\u0022\n\nValentina frowned, \u0022is wise to discuss such matters so... publicly?\u0022\n\n\u0022Why ma\u0027am, transparency is one of Layland Heavy Industries\u0027 most treasured values. And besides, you might be surprised just how big this here team is.\u0022\n\nAbout this time, the lunch lady turned around and scowled at him. \n\n\u0022Mornin\u0027, ma\u0027am,\u0022 he said to her, tipping his enormous hat, \u0022beautiful day, ain\u0027t it? Boy howdy, you *are* a vision.\u0022\n\nHer expression darkened, and she waded off through the crowd. \n\n\u0022I thought you said you did not lie,\u0022 Valentina observed. \n\n\u0022Well, Ah didn\u0027t!\u0022 J.R. threw up his hands, \u0022didn\u0027t say she was a *pleasant* vision, now.\u0022\n\nHe sighed, \u0022Kerbelle\u0027s got more wool than a sheep on sheerin\u0027 day.\u0022\n\n\u0022Tee minus twenty seconds, start engine gimbal test.\u0022\n\n\u0022Watch,\u0022 he said, putting an unwelcome hand on Valentina\u0027s shoulder and pointing, \u0022here comes the best part!\u0022\n\n\u0022Tee minus twelve...\u0022\n\n\u0022Eleven...\u0022\n\n\u0022Ten...\u0022\n\n\u0022Nine...\u0022\n\n\u0022Eight...\u0022\n\n\u0022Seven...\u0022\n\n\u0022Main engine start... we have ignition.\u0022\n\nOut on the pad, a bright flash precluded a billowing, roiling plume of thick grey smoke, and was followed a moment later by a low rushing sound quite unlike anything Valentina had heard before. A hush grew over the crowd.\n\n\u0022Four...\u0022\n\n\u0022Three...\u0022\n\n\u0022Two...\u0022\n\n\u0022One...\u0022\n\n\u0022Booster ignition and... lift off!\u0022\n\nBurdous\u0027s voice thundered from the speakers, just before the blast of the solid boosters chased away all other noise.\n\n***\u0022HOLEY \u003Cbleeeeeeeeeeeeep\u003E!\u0022\u003C/bleeeeeeeeeeeeep\u003E***\n\nJ.R. buried his face in his hands as the rocket leapt into the clear blue sky. The boosters drowned the world in a deafening roar, and a smile crept onto Valentina\u0027s face. Yes, some things definitely were the same the world over. Like the barely restrained fury of solid rockets, and the need to keep certain pilots on a broadcast delay. \n\nThe rocket continued to climb, pitching out over the ocean on a gray tail of smoke. Valentina felt her own apprehension rise with it. The crowd remained mostly silent in breathless anticipation. Higher and farther the missile shot, the smoke trail deforming into a zig-zag pattern as it passed through varying wind layers high above. Valentina strained her keen eyes, and there, just on the edge of visibility, she saw the plume of smoke abate, and three objects tumble and flash away. \n\n\u0022We have booster separation... Booster separation is good, all systems remain go!\u0022\n\nThe gathered Kerbals finally let out their collective breath in a triumphant cheer, and Valentina realized she had been holding her own as well.\n\n\u0022Well now, fancy that, a Rockomax rocket doin\u0027 what it\u0027s supposed to,\u0022 laughed J.R., \u0022Ah do hope we\u0027ll talk more later, though Ah believe a good faith gesture may be in order.\u0022\n\nHe tipped his hat to her, \u0022y\u0027all have yerself a lovely day, now,\u0022 then made his way off through the crowd. Valentina frowned after him. Who else was he talking to?\n\nShe sighed, and blew at the wandersome hair in her face. A quick glance told her the rocket was far out of view now, even for her. With the continued reports over the speakers, there was no more need to stand out here in the sun. She decided to beat the rush and head down to the cafeteria for a cheeseburger. \n\nMmmmm, cheeseburger!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nA guilty grin crept across Valentina\u0027s face as the last colors of the vision faded away in her mind. That fellow could certainly play the flute well with such a nasty head wound. Something about a feathered hat and... pasta. \n\nThe post-launch crowds had come and gone, indicating an uneventful flight thus far. Only a few dispersed diners still lingered in the cavernous space. Valentina was just about to leave herself, when a new wave of anxiety and trepidation washed over her. Stunned for a moment, a sudden outburst from across the room drew her attention. \n\n\u0022Ugh, as *if!*\u0022\n\nShe craned her neck looking for the source. It was a pretty young cadet she didn\u0027t recognize, talking to...\n\n\u0022I wouldn\u0027t go out with *you* if you were the last Kerb in the world!\u0022 The cadet spun around and stalked off, \u0022loser!\u0022\n\nValentina frowned. That seemed a bit... harsh. \n\nStill standing there, with a fragile, hopeful smile frozen on his face, and holding out a very particular flower, was the simple fellow from the hallway the other day. What was his name again? Gas-man? But... where was his friend? Before her eyes, flower, smile, and Kerb wilted. He turned and wandered away slowly, studying the floor. \n\nValentina\u0027s frown deepened. *Those* flowers were not easy to come by, the least the young lady could have done is show him a little courtesy, even if she weren\u0027t interested. A deep, familiar sadness flowed through the back of her mind. She wished it would stop, it was very distracting when she was trying to think of what to do about the poor boy. Perhaps she should go talk to him? Give him an encouraging word? He did seem to have a liking for her, even if it was a bit... uncomfortable. \n\nShe nodded to herself. Yes, yes that\u0027s exactly what she should do. He was still shuffling toward the door. Go talk to him, just be kind, and hope he hasn\u0027t eaten rec--\n\nShe rose quickly, without looking, and stepped into an explosion of ketchup and expletives, with not a bleep to be heard. \n\n*\u0022YOU AGAIN?!\u0022*\n\nOh, *P\u0426TI\u0419*.\n\n\u0022Excuse... did not see...\u0022\n\n\u0022You\u0027re damn right you didn\u0027t see!\u0022 D.N. screamed, throwing the splattered tray and ruined meal to the floor, \u0022you\u0027ve got a *habit* of not seeing!\u0022\n\nHe looked down at the red, meaty mess on his torso, \u0022my shirt... I love this shirt... THIS WAS MY FAVORITE SHIRT YOU--\u0022\n\nValentina went from apologizing to snarling. The other fighter pilots stepped up behind D.N.\n\n\u0022You!\u0022 He raged, \u0022you... you... shake my nerves... and you rattle my brain!\u0022\n\n\u0022Too much love drives a man insane?\u0022 Waterfowl offered helpfully. \n\nD.N. stopped in mid rant. He blinked twice, then closed his mouth, thought a moment, held up a finger to Valentina, and turned to Waterfowl. He looked the other pilot deeply in the eyes, which wasn\u0027t easy, slowly waved a finger back and forth in front of them... tapped the left side of the other\u0027s head, tapped the right, moved it around this way and that... pulled his mouth open and had a careful look inside... felt for a pulse at his neck...\n\n\u0022Y\u0027know what is it with you, lately?\u0022 D.N. said to him, \u0022you hit your head on the canopy or something?\u0022\n\nWaterfowl just shrugged. \n\nD.N. put a hand to his temples, cleared his throat, and spun around again.\n\n\u0022YOU!\u0022 he snarled back at Valentina with twice the fury, \u0022oh yeah, I know *all* about *you!* I\u0027ve been reading--\u0022\n\nGarter Snake began to clap slowly, but stopped after a glare from his leader.\n\n\u0022You\u0027re a *magnet* for trouble. It seems to follow you around like a cloud. I read, that all sortsa *bad things* happened around you back in Ooski-land, and now that you\u0027re here, it\u0027s followed you!\u0022\n\nValentina clenched her teeth to hold her tongue.\n\n\u0022Suddenly *you\u0027re* here, and Rockomax keeps blowing up... real convenient if you ask me!\u0022\n\n\u0022Um, but, boss,\u0022 Ivylog tapped him on the shoulder, \u0022today\u0027s launch went fine, and Rockomax has been blowing up a *long* time before she showed up.\u0022\n\nD.N. shoved him away with a scowl, \u0022you grew up as some kinda wild child, raised by wolves out in the forest or something...\u0022\n\nValentina took a step...\n\n\u0022...and then they found you and sent you to the orphanage...\u0022\n\n...another step...\n\n\u0022...cuz your parents got arrested...\u0022\n\n...her hands balled into fists...\n\n\u0022...for being *terrorists*.\u0022\n\n...she drew her arm back...\n\nD.N. gave a feral grin.\n\n\u0022Go on, punch me!\u0022 He squealed, \u0022punch me! Get your diplomatic visa revoked! Get thrown out of the country!\u0022\n\n*...you will do absolutely* *nothing* *that might compromise the integrity of the Ussari Union...*\n\nHe threw his arms wide, \u0022*punch me!*\u0022\n\n\u0022PUNCH ME!!!!!\u0022\n\nShe didn\u0027t punch him. \n\nInstead, she punched the wall.\n\nThe *concrete* wall.\n\n*Bleep*.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-25T14:15:52Z\u0022 title=\u002204/25/2016 02:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 25, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"KSK","CreatedById":61025,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-16T10:12:54Z","Content":"Ooohh - that\u0027s gotta hurt.

Maybe it *was* getting time for a haircut. At least the hair distracted her from the throbbing pain in her right hand. The swelling had gotten pretty bad too, almost looked like a-- \n\nThe door swung open, and a smiling Kerbal in a white lab coat entered, a thick folder tucked under his arm, \u0022good afternoon, I\u0027m Doctor Kerman (no relation). Ah, I see they have eggplant at the cafeteria today. Oh my, that\u0027s your hand.\u0022\n\nWithout missing a beat, he held out his *left* hand to shake. She took it gingerly, feeling the swelling abate just a hair as blood rushed to her face instead. \n\n\u0022Well now,\u0022 he grinned, setting the folder on the counter and snapping on a pair of latex gloves, \u0022we\u0027ll see to that manual melongene in just a moment, let\u0027s get a quick check of your vitals first.

In my professional medical opinion, you are *not* dead.\u0022\n\nValentina looked at him flatly, \u0022...is that so.\u0022\n\n\u0022Quite. In my experience, I find it helpful to remind people of this from time to time. Starts things on a positive note. Now, would you like to tell me how you wound up with an aubergine at the end of your wrist?\u0022\n\n\u0022I punch wall.\u0022\n\nHe blinked, \u0022did you, now? Well, I\u0027m sure that wall had it coming.\u0022\n\n\u0022It wasn\u0027t, by chance,\u0022 he leaned in, \u0022a wall by the name of Dean Kerman, was it?\u0022\n\n\u0022No, was actual wall.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh,\u0022 he blinked again, \u0022pity, that guy could stand to be taken down a peg, he\u0027s a real d-*ouch my shin!*\u0022\n\nA small rock *plink*ed off the wall, *plink*ed off the exam light, *plink*ed just below Valentina\u0027s knee...\n\n\u0022Ouch, my *other* shin!\u0022 The doctor rocked on his stool, rubbing at his legs.\n\n\u0022Is there a *doctor* in the house?!\u0022 He pleaded, \u0022oh, wait...\u0022\n\nValentina could no longer contain a giggle.\n\n\u0022There, see?\u0022 He smiled, \u0022feeling better already, aren\u0027t you? Told you you had good reflexes aye yi yi.\u0022\n\n\u0022Next you will tell me laughter is best medicine, no?\u0022 She smirked. \n\n\u0022Oh, no no no, we have *real* medicine here,\u0022 the doctor said with a note of concern, \u0022things with long unnecessarily polysyllabic names like trinitrotoluene, transphlablamaphlognol, and cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene.\u0022\n\nFor a moment, Valentina could only sit there mimicking a fish as she tried to wrap her mind around the veritable phonetic cornucopia. Fortunately, a familiar distant rumble drew attention from her piscine pantomime.\n\n\u0022Phaw,\u0022 the doctor sighed, not quite putting a hand to his face, \u0022that\u0027s going to kill someone one of these days,\u0022 then looked up brightly. \n\n\u0022So, let\u0027s take a look at that stricken *solanum* you\u0027ve got there,\u0022 to Valentina\u0027s relieved surprise, the doctor used an incredibly light and practiced touch on her bloated, entirely too purple hand, \u0022hmm.

You\u0027ve just bruised the bejezuz out of your second extensor tendon sheath. These sort of injuries usually heal up in just a couple of days.\u0022\n\n\u0022And bad news?\u0022\n\n\u0022They hurt like hell and make you look like you\u0027re carrying around a large, bulbous vegetable.\u0022\n\n\u0022So if you\u0027re going to pick a fight with a ruthless gang of cinder blocks again, I would suggest at least wearing boxing gloves, or someone might think you\u0027re trying to transform into a domesticated cultivar of purple-fruited nightshade one limb at a time,\u0022 he winked, \u0022and need I remind you, you *are* already green.\u0022\n\nValentina giggled again, still feeling quite embarrassed but, well, a little bit better actually.\n\n\u0022Now, I\u0027ll just have the nurse--\u0022 the door swung open and a nurse stepped in.\n\n\u0022Ah, just who I needed--\u0022\n\n\u0022Doctor, come quickly, it\u0027s an emergency!\u0022 The nurse exclaimed, \u0022injury from the research lab!\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh my,\u0022 the doctor jumped up, his demeanor instantly changing, \u0022oh my, my, my...\u0022\n\n\u0022Um, please stay here, I\u0027ll be back as soon as I can, we still need to see to that bloated brinjal,\u0022 he said and rushed out after the nurse, the door slamming so hard behind him that the folder fell off the counter and hit the floor with a papery thud. \n\nValentina sighed, and huffed again at her hair. She hopped down from the table, bent to pick up the papers, and -knowing that it was private medical information and that she absolutely *should not*- glanced at one. \n\n\\*\\*\\*CONFIDENTIAL\\*\\*\\*  \n\nPRELIMINARY KERBONAUT MEDICAL EVALUATION\n\nA gasp, and she put a hand to her mouth, which she immediately regretted. \n\n*Just put it back on the counter, that\u0027s private*.\n\nSo of course she peeked again.\n\nAPPLICANT: KERMAN, EDGAS J.\n\nThe thought that the filing cabinets around here must be very homogeneous was quickly replaced by another... why was that name familiar? This thought lingered, as she scanned over the page, feeling *quite* guilty about it but continuing nonetheless, until she reached a hand-written note taped near the bottom:\n\nGene,\n\nI decided to send this one up to you for a final decision. This applicant\u0027s as smart as I\u0027ve ever seen, his physical scores are impressively unimpressive yet passing, but he has the weakest stomach I\u0027ve ever encountered. The poor lad vomits at the drop of a hat, and I don\u0027t mean that as a metaphor. I really liked that hat. That was my favorite hat.   \n\nAt any rate, he shows great potential, but I\u0027m afraid I just can\u0027t recommend him for training. We need good scientists here on the ground, too. I can\u0027t see him amounting to anything as a Kerbonaut. You can review his records and send this back to Admin with the last box checked.\n\nDr. K.  \n(No, the other one)  \n\n(No, the \u003Cu\u003Eother\u003C/u\u003E one)\n\nValentina frowned. That name, that was... that was the Gas-man! The sad young cadet from the other night. She shuddered, as another wave of discarnate emotion passed through her. *P\u0426TI\u0419S \u0417\u0414\u042FS*, that was getting annoying! She was trying to think, blast it!\n\nThat boy... not really a boy, not that much younger than her... he had applied for Kerbonaut selection after all. Even after embarrassing himself in front of his hero and his--\n\nShe shuddered again. Even after that. Perhaps Chadvey had convinced him? No, she didn\u0027t think Chadvey would take that much interest in *anyone*, other than himself. The boy must have acted on his own. His friend, then, the earnest-faced one, maybe?\n\nBut... the cafeteria. The very thing that had planted Valentina in this room with *this*, she rolled her eyes, *plant*. Plant. He\u0027d picked that stuck up girl a flower. She *knew* that flower. They only bloomed down by the lake. Acquiring one would have meant braving those... *things* everyone was so terrified of. They couldn\u0027t be as bad as they said, but still...\n\nThat had taken *courage*. \n\nShe shouldn\u0027t get involved, not her business, Valentina *knew* that, but... Kerbonaut training was hard. You could *learn* not to barf all over yourself. And everyone within a few meter\u0027s radius. But only if you had the *courage* to try in the first place. \n\nShe looked up, turned her head this way and that as if expecting sudden observers in the room, then carefully peeled the note from the paper and shoved it into her mouth. \n\nAnd immediately wished she\u0027d simply thrown it away instead. While she chewed, still glancing about nervously, she scanned down the page... there. At the very bottom, printed next to big, bold letters, were two boxes:\n\nACCEPTED \u2610  REJECTED \u2610\n\nFeeling another tinge of guilt, she took a pen from the counter, and drew a thick **X** in the box marked ACCEPTED. \n\nShe let out a quiet breath, shuffled the papers back in, and closed the folder... at the same instant the door flew open. Valentina shot bolt upright, hiding her hands behind her back and smacking the bad one on the edge of the exam table. She bared her teeth in what she hoped was a smile.\n\n\u0022Oh, hello, ma\u0027am!\u0022 Said a different nurse, \u0022did the doctor by chance leave a folder of papers in here?\u0022\n\nValentina sidestepped away from the counter, smacking her hand again, then nodded at it.\n\n\u0022Oh, good, wouldn\u0027t do to leave that lying about, no sir-ee!\u0022 She picked up the folder and gave Valentina a concerned look, \u0022are you all right, there, ma\u0027am? You\u0027re looking a bit green...er.\u0022\n\nValentina swallowed hard.\n\n\u0022I\u0027m fine,\u0022 she croaked, feeling every edge of inadequately chewed paper scratch its way down her gullet while trying to maintain an innocent smile.\n\n\u0022You sure now? We could always get yah some dramamine or metaproterenol or polyethylene glycol, dontchaknow,\u0022 the nurse smiled. \n\n\u0022I\u0027m fine,\u0022 she coughed, then managed, \u0022is.. everything... all right?\u0022\n\n\u0022Ooooooh, I think it\u0027ll be. They had themselves another \u0027incident\u0027 down there at the Research Center, blew the roof clean off the Extra Tension Building, dontchaknow. Finally got someone sent down here, knew it was bound to happen sooner or later.\u0022\n\nValentina blinked, \u0022but... they will be all right, yes?\u0022\n\n\u0022Well, they\u0027re gonna transport him over to Kerbin City General just to be safe. He\u0027ll be right as rain just as soon as he gets that thingamabob diskajiggered from his whoopsiedaisy.\u0022\n\nFor one brief, terrible moment, Valentina tried to decode what the other Kerbelle had just said, then prudently decided some mental images were best left unthought. \n\n\u0022Oh, well, there I go gettin\u0027 all chatty! I\u0027d best get this on to its proper place,\u0022 she tapped the folder, \u0022the doctor will be back with ya just as soon as he can.\u0022\n\nAnd with that, she was gone. Valentina let out a huge breath and looked at her swollen hand. Her fingers twitched slightly in time to the throbbing. Her eyes scanned around the small room, desperately seeking something soundproof to scream into.   \n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-23T05:48:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2016 05:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T05:48:42Z","Content":"**Chapter 54: Uncomfortably Numb**\n\n*Bing*\n\nThe elevator doors slid open, and Valentina stepped out into the darkened hall of her floor in the Kerbonaut Complex. Her right hand was heavily bandaged, and her left carried a bag of cheeseburgers. Now, the one had predicated the other, she supposed, but they were just going to get thrown out anyway. No sense wasting them. Also in the bag was a little container of pills, something with a name so long it wrapped around the bottle two and a half times, but at least it took the edge off. Her hand was down to a dull ache, but it certainly made her hungry. For cheeseburgers. \n\nYes. Yes, perfectly reasonable excuse for sneaking back to her room with a bag full of stale cheeseburgers. Just a side effect, that\u0027s all. Nothing to worry about. Nothing at all. Alone in the hallway, she laughed nervously. \n\nShe looked around, again expecting lurking watchers, and jumped as the elevator doors *shushhhhed* shut behind her. She sighed, and began walking down the rows of doors. Most of the others were still back at the bar. Valentina *had* considered staying around for the usual Joolsday night festivities until someone had begun passing out buckets of frogs. Some sort of research project. She\u0027d left in a hurry, then. \n\nBut, she supposed, no sense wasting *them*, either. \n\nAn odd sound to her right made her pause as she neared Jorrigh\u0027s room. She listened for a moment, then jumped back in horror, eyeing the door. Coming from the other side was a sound like ripping metal. She whipped her head back and forth, wondering how such a noise wasn\u0027t drawing other gawkers. Even as she stood there, the sound shifted, changed, now becoming a cascade of shattering concrete. \n\n*\u042C\u042F\u0417ZH\u0419\u042DVS SH\u0424\u0417, the building is collapsing!* Valentina thought as she backed a few steps, steeling herself to batter down the door. Just as she was about to charge, however, the sound changed *again*...\n\n*RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPP.....CRRRAAAAAAAACK....wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeze...*\n\n*RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPP.....CRRRAAAAAAAACK....wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeze*\n\nA hand slowly went to her face as she realized it was only Jorrigh.\n\n*That Kerb snores worse than Dibella,* she thought, letting out a long breath. She proceeded down the shadowy hall towards her room, still feeling very unsettled. Must be more side-effects, no coating or anything on those pills. Some food would help, surely. Valentina smiled as she gave the bag a little shake... and froze.\n\nSlowly, her head turned to the left, eyes growing wider. Jerdous\u0027s room. She now realized that her own breathing was the only noise in the hall. Her skin felt tight, tensed, like the moment before a chill, yet none came. She crept to the door, moving softly, suddenly afraid to make a sound. Cautiously she pressed her ear against it, some part of her mind convinced the door its self might reach out for her. \n\n*...no... no please... don\u0027t... don\u0027t want to...*\n\nShe drew back, looked the door up and down, spun around expecting... no, the hall was still empty. Only shadows watched, whispered. Her head moved to the door again...\n\n*...help... please help... no...*\n\nShe had to ball her hand into a fist to keep it from trembling, then lightly rapped on the door.\n\n\u0022M... Mister Jerdous? Are... are you awake?\u0022\n\nNothing. Only the sound of very normal snoring came from behind the door now. Her hand moved to knock again, more loudly this time... but, stopped. No... no need to trouble him, just a bad dream, that\u0027s all. Said he\u0027d been having them. \n\nValentina backed away from the door, eyes still bulging. Again she searched the corridor, finding only shadows. \n\n*It\u0027s all right... everything is quite all right...*\n\nShe took one step back, then another. Her skin, that had felt to tight a moment before now felt numb and dead. Another step, another and another, and soon she was running, fleeing, certain that at any moment the lights would go out, the shadows would converge, then she would scream and... and...\n\nShe flew through the door to her room, flicked the lights on and slammed it behind her in one fluid motion. Chest heaving, it was all she could do to hold herself up on trembling knees as she leaned against it. For a few moments, Valentina stayed like that, just breathing, letting the adrenaline tremors work their way out. Side effects. Blasted side effects, making her feel strange. Just the medication, nothing more. \n\nShe set the bag down on her little table and sat, looking out into the clear night. Medications did all sorts of odd things, she *knew* that. That\u0027s why they needed prescriptions. Probably shouldn\u0027t have taken it on an empty stomach. Probably even says on the bottle not to do that, she was just distracted by the ridiculously long name. \n\nWiping the sweat from her face and peering into the darkness outside, she saw a tiny point of light whizz past high in the sky. She wondered if it was Mister Burdous. She hoped everything was still going well for him. Valentina reached into the bag, and unwrapped a stale and rubbery cheeseburger. \n\nIt tasted like ashes.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-23T05:49:45Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2016 05:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by CatastrophicFailure**"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceplaneAddict","CreatedById":149322,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T13:48:02Z","Content":"I missed a lot didn\u0027t I?
