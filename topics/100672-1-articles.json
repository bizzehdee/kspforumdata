An orbital period with 4 times the orbital period of Mun (556E3 seconds) and half the orbital period of Minmus (539E3 seconds) would require a little station-keeping that maybe you can get from gravity assists. This implies a semi-major axis of about 30E3ish km to get that orbital period. If you choose a Kerbin Pe that\u0027s a bit more than 12M (Mun\u0027s distance from Kerbin), you get an Ap that\u0027s a bit less than 48M (pretty close to Minmus distance). If you start at Mun, then create the orbit when Minmus would be at the farside of Kerbin, I think you\u0027ve got it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lynch","CreatedById":136598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-13T20:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread has helped me form my own thread about orbital mechanics thank you guys \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/136535-The-Martian-ORBITAL-MECHANICS-%28-DUNA-KERBIN-TAXI-%29?p=2241182#post2241182\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/136535-The-Martian-ORBITAL-MECHANICS-%28-DUNA-KERBIN-TAXI-%29?p=2241182#post2241182\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
