The electric field will start to accelerate the particle so it starts wiggling in the same direction. But, we also have a magnetic field. As you might remember from physics class a charged particle moving in a magnetic field is deflected with a force perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field. Drawing out the situation it looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aWMbYMr.png\u0022 alt=\u0022aWMbYMr.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The magnetic field is pointing into the screen as indicated by the crosses)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the situation for half of the wave period. In the other half both the electric and the magnetic field are reversed. This means the velocity vector is also reversed. And as we know -1*-1 = 1. So the force experienced by the particle is in the exact same direction. So the lightwave will continuously push the particle in a certain direction. It even compensates for negative charges, a negatively charged particle will wiggle in the opposite direction while the lorentz force is also in the opposite direction. Those 2 will again cancel out. In other words, everything that contains charged particles will be pushed by a lightwave. Pretty much anything in existence contains charged particles so we can move stuff around by shining lights at it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MBobrik","CreatedById":59889,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-18T17:37:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ephotons do have mass, it\u0027s just their \u003Cem\u003Erest mass\u003C/em\u003E that\u0027s zero but this is irrelevant as they always move at c.

The full equation, from Einstein\u0027s special relativity, is E^2 = (mc^2)^2 \u002B (pc)^2 where p is momentum. Since photons have no mass, this equation simplifies to E = pc or p = E/c.

From regular mechanics, you know that power is energy per unit time, or \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACPower = E/\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACt, so E = \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20AC(Power)\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACt\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow we can say that \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACp\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewall\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E = (power)\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACt/c\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewell, you could now solve for \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACp/\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACp/\u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACt = Power/c\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd since the change in momentum over time is just the force on that object (Newtons Second Law), \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EF = Power/c\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esince pressure is just force per unit area,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPressure = F/A ---\u0026gt; F = (Pressure)A = Power/c\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow we solve for the pressure exerted by the photon, it\u0027s just \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPressure = Power/(Ac)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIncidentally, for light, the power per unit area is the intensity I, so the pressure exerted on the wall by the photon is just\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPressure = I/c\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow if you have a reflecting source, the pressure is doubled because the change in momentum is doubled because now after the collision, the light is traveling away from the wall at speed -c, so the momentum of the light had to double in the opposite direction, this causes the force to be doubled, which causes the pressure to be doubled. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow to answer you question, why? Because energy does not only depend on the mass of a particle, but rather its momentum, for a photon, that comes from it\u0027s frequency and wavelength.
