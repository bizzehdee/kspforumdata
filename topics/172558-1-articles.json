Using \u0022.cfg\u0022 file in gamedata to enable it does not work. i can change the \u0022persistant.cfg\u0022 in saves to open tech tree but the \u0022persistant.mission.cfg\u0022 will not enable tech tree from the start. super annoying as mechjeb literally will not work.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nnot the best because some people are really gonna struggle with some missions and i want my missions to be more about understanding than struggling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni hope the developers didnt do this on purpose and merely just a feature they will implement (soon). i.e unlock tech tree via a tab in mission builder so on launching the mission mechjeb will be good to go... seems simple.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T22:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as I can tell, the tech tree plays no role in missions. Instead, the available parts can be controlled by either a whitelist or a blacklist chosen in the mission editor:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022sdk5peW.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022768\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/sdk5peW.png\u0022 width=\u0022549\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mintme","CreatedById":61058,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T22:21:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyeah 200% understand this, kinda why i mentioned \u0022Mechjeb\u0022 and the need for tech tree enabler because yes u can give access to the mechjeb module as a part but without the techtree being completely\u00A0open its near useless. all i would take is either a node to drag and drop to open tech tree or to have the mission\u0027s act more like sandboxes and not like career settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T22:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223325732\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022172558\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221521325296\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261058\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022mintme\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, mintme said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyeah 200% understand this, kinda why i mentioned \u0022Mechjeb\u0022 and the need for tech tree enabler because yes u can give access to the mechjeb module as a part but without the techtree being completely\u00A0open its near useless. all i would take is either a node to drag and drop to open tech tree or to have the mission\u0027s act more like sandboxes and not like career settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOK, if I\u0027m understanding you correctly, your concern is that some mods lock down some of their own internal functionality in career mode depending on which tech tree nodes have been unlocked.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that\u0027s what you mean, then that\u0027s not a stock problem. That\u0027s a question of whether MechJeb supports Missions mode, which does not have a tech tree (just like sandbox). Considering that MechJeb is not yet updated for 1.4, you should probably either wait for that update or raise this concern politely with MechJeb\u0027s developers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mintme","CreatedById":61058,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-17T22:32:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYe, will have to wait and see.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
