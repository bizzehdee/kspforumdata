On top of that you could also have (3) procedurally generated \u003Cstrong\u003Eground-truthing contracts\u003C/strong\u003E. Stuff like \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CTake a Figaro GPS-reciever equipped craft to these Lat,Lon coordinates to sample the GPS error at that position\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2. Finally, you could have contracts for (4) setting up base-stations, essentially like the ground-truthing idea, but instead you\u0027re putting a transmitter-equipped craft there. Probably on mountains or other high elevation spots with good line of sight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
