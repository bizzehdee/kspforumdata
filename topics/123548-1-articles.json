Well, I\u0027ve been thinking- the game is already segmented into a few different features- administration, building, flying. In a space program, those different elements would be handled by different people, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what if a multiplayer scenario consisted of multiple roles that players could take on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe administrator role (which could also double as the actual administrator of the server) would manage the space program\u0027s finances, pick missions, choose the research path and keep an eye on active missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe designer role could potentially be filled by many people, who build and save craft to be used on missions (but allowing those using the craft to examine it before launching and check stats on things like successful flights, what have you).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission control- here\u0027s where it gets a little tricky. I think what makes sense to me is to have multiple \u0027instances\u0027 of the gameworld that are used for separate missions, and that the gametime that is elapsed is specific to the instance it\u0027s in, although the craft used are persistent in the instance they were launched in for future flights. Anyway, an instanced mission would consist of one player acting as \u0027mission control\u0027, whose has access to time warp, can control any vessel and acts as the central communication for the mission. Multiple players could also join a mission instance as \u0027Mission crew\u0027, to whom the player acting as Mission Control can give control of any control pod or EVA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, all players would be able to communicate with players working in different roles to work towards the success of the space program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts? I apologize if something similar has been suggested before, but I didn\u0027t see anything from using the search function.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-22T22:23:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI highly suggest that you check out KMP or DMP and how they handle warp. Considering that Kerbal Multiplayer is the mod that convinced Squad to implement multiplayer I\u0027m pretty sure that Squad is using a system similar to that. Also it is highly unlikely that Squad would start to tackle multiplayer without knowing how to handle warp.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
