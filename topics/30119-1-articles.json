I also have trouble quicksaving while piloting it because it often says things like \u0022Can\u0027t save while under acceleration\u0022 or \u0022can\u0027t save while about to crash\u0022 even though the rover is 100% stationary (as far as I can tell anyway. Throttel is off, its sitting more or less level, and the game thinks something is happening. What could be causing this?

The latest patch lowered the height of the moon so if you haven\u0027t loaded it up since the last update then It will most likely be fixed when you do. If not, just put it down to a random bug, I have had pieces of my base randomly flip out when I load them a few times now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
