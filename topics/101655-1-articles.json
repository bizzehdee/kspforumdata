Jeb looked at it in disgust. *Like I\u0027ll ever need those,* he thought. Nevertheless, he flipped the switches of the corresponding systems to finish the flight controller\u0027s instructions. Lights started flashing on the overhead consoles, dials began to function. Several cockpit lights flared to life, making it hard for Jeb to see out the small window of his cramped capsule.\n\n\u0022Okay, mission control is giving the green light on all main and sub systems. Launch expected in the next ten minutes.\u0022 This time it was a very familliar voice, through his helmet\u0027s intercom. Jeb cracked a small smile.\n\n\u0022Kraken, Gene, what happened to the good ol\u0027 days when you just lit the BACC whenever you felt like it?\u0022 Jeb heard Gene chuckle softly into the mic.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s not our fault. These new Mun vessels are giving us hell in the engineering department; we really don\u0027t have the funds we need to do it properly. We need to test each one thoroughly before flight to make sure it\u0027s not going to fall apart at the seams.\u0022 Jeb crossed his arms, understanding but still not satisfied. \u0022But still,\u0022 Gene continued, \u0022This isn\u0027t your average ship anyway. She\u0027s a multistage, highly specialized, and extremely sensitive piece of work.\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, it\u0027s a piece of work, all right,\u0022 he muttered, nearly under his breath. He\u0027d seen the haphazard way the engineers had welded the tanks together this time around, the secondhand bolts they used. It was almost a miracle that the crawler had brought it to the pad in one piece.\n\nAnd now he was sitting in it, waiting for a controlled explosion to take place. It was his job, and he loved it.\n\n\u0022You know you don\u0027t really mean that.\u0022 Before Jeb could answer, a burst of radio static from the ship\u0027s console cut him off. He hit the \u0027talk\u0027 button.\n\n\u0022Say again, control?\u0022 A short delay.\n\n\u0022Launch timer initiated. T-30 seconds and counting.\u0022 His heart skipped a beat. *I\u0027m nervous. Why am I nervous?* He managed a level reply;\n\n\u0022Copy. Activating stage one engines... now.\u0022 A quiet, familiar *whoosh* came as the pressurized tanks were tested, venting off a small amout of fuel. \u0022Tanks are good. Repeat: fuel tanks are good.\u0022\n\n\u0022We read you, Jebediah.\u0022 He placed his hands on the flight sticks. \u0022T-15 and counting. Capsule life support maintaining status. Second stage tanks read green.\u0022 Jeb glanced out of the capsule window for a brief moment, saw the deep, rich blue of the sky, and the stark white contrast of a few wispy clouds.\n\n\u0022T-10, 9, 8...\u0022 Jeb tightened his grip on the flight sticks. He saw the throttle readout beginning to climb ever so slowly to its maximum value.\n\n\u00227, 6, 5, main engine start...\u0022 He heard the dull rumble of the seven-engine cluster at the base of the craft as the Rockomax nozzles began to guzzle fuel.\n\n\u00223, 2, 1, clamps released. Liftoff! I repeat, liftoff of the *Venturer I*...\u0022 All further chatter was silenced by the massive primal roar of the engines below him, shoving him down into his seat, and into the sky.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-09T17:31:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/09/2016 05:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 9, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Starwhip**"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-10T04:00:31Z","Content":"[spellingNazi]brought it to the **PAD** in one piece.[/spellingNazi]\n\nbut seriously, this is good.

The worn coffee tables, the dimly flickering lights, the dilapidated door frames to the many offices all screamed \u0022bankruptcy\u0022. He kicked an old cardboard cup from it\u0027s place in the middle of the hallway back under an old conference chair.\n\n*Kraken, we\u0027ve let this place go downhill. I hope Jeb\u0027s flight goes well.* Finally, Bill reached the door of Wernher\u0027s office. He reached up to knock on the door... just as a distant, haunting siren blared. A steady rising, falling, rising howling that penetrated deep into Bill\u0027s being. *The launch warning!*\n\nThe door opened suddenly, revealing Wernher\u0027s drawn, weathered face. It creased into a warm smile.\n\n\u0022Bill! I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. Quickly, come to the window.\u0022 \n\nBill stepped into the barren executive office, not much larger than the break room in the Vehicle Assembly Building. It smelled faintly of paper and metal, and based on the temperature, the climate control seemed to be broken. But there was one gem among the dust and rocks; the large, curved window that overlooked the launchpad and runway, nearly one hundred and eighty degrees of unrestricted vision, so brilliantly clear that it felt out of place.\n\n\u0022She\u0027s a beauty, eh, Bill?\u0022 Wernher gestured toward *Venturer I*, held firmly on the launchpad by the dull red arms of the clamps. The launch siren continued to wail.\n\n\u0022That she is,\u0022 Bill said. *And she cost too much.* He turned toward Wernher, but the voice of Mission Control interrupted him.\n\n\u0022T-30 seconds. All non-vital personnel, please move to your designated areas.\u0022 A small burst of vapor came from the lower engines as Bill looked back to *Venturer I*. \u0022T-15,\u0022 the loudspeaker announced. More jets of gas, this time from the second stage tanks. \u0022T-10, 9, 8, 7, 6...\u0022\n\n\u0022Oh, boy,\u0022 Bill glanced at Wernher, saw that his fingers were crossed behind his back. Smoke began to billow out from the channels under the launchpad; Bill could see the Skippers begin to heat up.\n\n\u00223, 2, 1, 0... \u0022\n\nAnd then the smoke took on a vigor that Bill had never seen before. Deafening waves of sound hit the glass as Grey-white clouds laced with fire rose up in a curtain around the craft, completely obscuring it from view. Bill gasped. \u0022Holy Kraken!\u0022\n\nWernher held up a hand. \u0022Wait for it...\u0022 Several agonizing seconds elapsed. Then *Venturer I*\u0027s grey Mark I pod emerged from the roiling smoke, promptly followed by its transfer section, ascent stage, and seven blazing nozzles. Bill cheered, Wernher\u0027s grin widened.\n\n\u0022Liftoff! We have liftoff of *Venturer I*!\u0022 The PA system in the office could barely compete with the roaring of the engines. The ship continued to rise for nearly a minute, drowning out all other sound, though growing quieter by the moment. Wernher cupped his hand near Bill\u0027s ear.\n\n\u0022The first staging event should occur right about... now!\u0022\n\nThere was a bright flash, and three of *Venturer I*\u0027s tanks and engines separated from the main stage. Bill frowned. \u0022What kind of staging is that?\u0022\n\nWernher positively beamed. \u0022That, my friend, is the dawn of a new form of efficiency, designed by yours truly. Those three tanks that just fell off? They were feeding into the other three radial tanks, which, in turn, are transferring fuel to the center. So right now,\u0022 he pointed upward, \u0022*Venturer I* has all of it\u0027s tanks nearly full. When the next three run out and separate in a few more minutes, the center engine will still be full.\u0022\n\nThe two of them continued to watch as the ship began to curve toward the east, steadily shrinking into a glowing dot. After a while, there was another flash, significantly dimmer this time, and the dot shrunk to a point smaller than the average star in the sky. And then the ship faded entirely. Bill waited a few seconds before looking to Wernher.\n\n\u0022So, I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you... Why did that ship cost so much?\u0022\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-10T21:50:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/10/2015 09:50  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starwhip**\n  \nWhy...

He reached over to the console and depressed the radio\u0027s transmit button. \u0022Control, this is Jeb. Orbit achieved.\u0022\n\n\u0022Telemetry confirms orbit. Mun transfer window in T-3:37.\u0022\n\n\u0022Thanks for the heads-up.\u0022 Jeb leaned back as far as his helmet and the micro-gravity would allow him, closed his eyes and let out a pent-up breath. *Halfway to anywhere,* he thought, and smiled.\n\n*\u0022An autopilot unit?! Wernher, are you crazy?!\u0022* Bill hated yelling at Wernher, but the memory of the catastrophic failure that the last computer-guided rocket had experienced was branded into his mind.\n\n\u0022Relax, Bill, we have it set up only to learn from Jeb\u0027s piloting, it will be fine-\u0022\n\n\u0022The frack it will be fine. If *Venturer I* fails up there, we\u0027re down the hole. Kaput! Not only will we have lost our best pilot, but we have *no money*!\u0022\n\n\u0022I know, I know. It was a gamble. But just imagine what we can do with that autopilot when we get it working.\u0022\n\n\u0022*If* we get it working.\u0022\n\nJeb\u0027s helmet speaker came online once more. It was Gene.\n\n\u0022Okay, Jeb, the Mun should be coming up over the horizon any moment now. You know the drill.\u0022 Jeb pushed the flight stick forward slightly, adjusting the craft\u0027s attitude.\n\n\u0022Right, thanks.\u0022 *Knew it already,* he silently continued. Jeb squinted at the bright blue glare of the horizon line, where the edge of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere brushed the vastness of space. His right hand inched towards the throttle. The air inside the capsule seemed charged with anticipation.\n\nThen the cratered face of the Mun broke Kerbin\u0027s blue disk. *Wait for it...*\n\n\u0022Transfer in T-10.\u0022 Jeb glanced at his instruments for a brief moment. He remembered the training session he had attended not one day ago. *You won\u0027t be able to eyeball this one, Jeb,* Wernher had told him. *You\u0027ll need to reach a certain velocity at a certain time to be on the right trajectory.* The image Wernher had shown him blazed to life, a shimmering mirage floating just in front of his face. The carefully computed number burned with exceptional brightness.\n\n\u0022Go for transfer, Jebediah.\u0022 \n\nJeb shoved the throttle to its maximum position, and the acceleration once again pinned him to the command chair.\n\n\u0022Go for transfer, copy that.\u0022 His velocity indicator began to rise incredibly swiftly. *Twenty-six hundred... Twenty eight... Twenty nine...* Just as Wernher had instructed, as the indicator approached the required value, he brought the throttle back, slowing its ascent.\n\n\u0022A little longer, Jeb,\u0022 Gene encouraged him. Lower he brought the throttle, lower still. At just the right moment, he brought the throttle to its \u0027off\u0027 position. \n\n\u0022Control, this is Jeb, transfer burn completed. ETA of Mun inter-\u0022\n\nThere was a muffled *BOOM*."},{"CreatedByName":"OrtwinS","CreatedById":19144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-13T09:58:36Z","Content":"But... *BOOM*s are good...?

Jebediah, confirm contact...\u0022 \n\nNo response. Gene swore under his breath, pounded on the comms unit with his fists. Mission Control was deathly silent as everyone waited for any kind of return transmission from the damaged capsule. Only the faintest telemetry data was being beamed back.\n\n\u0022Jebediah, if you can hear me, please confirm contact...\u0022\n\n\u0022How can I explain this to you, Bill, in a way that makes sense?\u0022 Wernher sat at his desk, his gaze leveled at Bill over steepled fingers. After a moment\u0027s hesitation, he continued. \u0022Our contacts want many things. Some of them are exceedingly hazardous to a spacecraft\u0027s crew: long-term missions through space, for example, lead to radiation poisoning. Several probes have confirmed this. And yet, even our finest technologies, our most advanced algorithms, are no match for a Kerbal\u0027s piloting skills, of which Jebediah is the best of the best. The autopilot unit has all of the aforementioned algorithms, plus the ability to adapt. It feeds itself raw telemetry data straight from the craft in an attempt to refine it\u0027s programs. After this flight, it should be able to replicate a Mun transfer flawlessly, where other devices have failed from lack of corrective capabilities.\u0022\n\nBill sank slightly into the water-damaged upholstery of his chair, defeated. A light began to flash on the intercom unit; Wernher pressed a small button next to it.\n\n\u0022Yes?\u0022\n\nIt was the voice of Gene, in Mission Control, who answered. \u0022Wernher, you are needed in comms. There is a problem.\u0022\n\nBill became as stiff as a board. He and Wernher exchanged frightened glances a split second before jumping up, rushing out the door, and down the hall.\n\nJeb sighed and once again depressed the \u0022transmit\u0022 button.\n\n\u0022Gene, do you read me? Come in, Gene.\u0022\n\nAnd again, there was no response. He let go of the button in frustration before unbuckling his safety harness. Jeb closed his helmet, made sure that oxygen was flowing independently of the main craft. Then he began to depressurize the capsule. *Fixing a fracking antenna... Why me? I\u0027m a pilot, not an engineer.* The oxygen gauge dropped to zero, and Jeb opened the hatch.\n\nDown by the engine compartment, a small piece of shattered life-support casing floated into some exposed contacts. There was a bright arc as current became redirected, and the fragment became welded in place.\n\nA small LED next to the contacts switched from yellow to green.\n\nAnd a display flickered to life.\n\n**Attitude Adjustment in Progress... Please Wait.**\n\nEDIT:\n\nYes, I end each chapter on a cliff like that on purpose...

He had a set of tools attached to his EVA suit on a strap, each one secured by a cable of decent length. Carefully, he manipulated the joysticks that controlled his thruster pack. Jeb floated closer still, and he readied himself to grab hold of the small rung near the base of the craft placed there for exactly this purpose. Giving the joysticks a last push, he reached out with both arms...\n\nGene was aroused from his half-sleep by a slowly blinking amber light. Frowning, he leaned forward over the control panel, attracting the attention of Wernher and Bill, who stopped their hushed conversation. \n\n\u0022What\u0027s that light, Gene?\u0022 Bill walked over to the comtrol station and cast his gaze on the light. \n\n\u0022Not sure, Bill.

He looked about on his suit, but there were no signs that a thruster had malfunctioned. No fuel drainage, no stuck joysticks, nothing. He slowed further, faster, until the rung seemed to stop. And then he began to drift backwards.\n\nBut he wasn\u0027t the one drifting. As the rung pulled away from him, it began to arc upwards. Baffled, he realized to late what it meant. The cockpit of the rotating *Venturer I* collided with Jeb\u0027s helmet with a CLANG, and sent him spinning away from the ship, dazed, Kerbin\u0027s blue disk floating into and out of view again and again in the black emptiness.\n\nJeb regained control a few seconds later, stabilizing himself. With a quick flick of his wrist, he spun around to face the ship, which was coming to a stop again, its singular solar panel facing the sun. \u0022What in the world was THAT, Gene?! Gene? Oh. Right.\u0022 Deftly he pushed the translation stick forward, moving in towards the rung again. He waited a good minute a few meters away, making sure that the ship wouldn\u0027t lash out at him again, and then grabbed hold. The antenna was to his right, and he could see the transmitter unit floating free on a short lead of cable. It did not appear to have severed, only broken off. *Not focusing the signal properly. Alright. I can fix that.* He grabbed the hanging transmitter. *Probably.*\n\n\u0022Whatever it was doing, it completed.\u0022 Gene rolled his chair back from the desk slightly. \u0022Had we more telemetry we could get the program number, but until Jeb fixes that-\u0022\n\n*\u0022Hello hello, Control, come in Control?\u0022*\n\nGene froze mid-sentence as the transmission fed through. He traded stares with Bill and Wernher, before scooting the chair back in and attempting to transmit. \u0022Jeb? What\u0027s happened?\u0022\n\n*\u0022Well, something blew up, and damaged the antenna. And then the ship tried to punt me to who knows where. I fixed the antenna, sort of. It just snapped off the transmitter circuit, so... I\u0027m pointing it back at the dish.\u0022*\n\nGene burst out in relieved laughter. \u0022Well, whatever works! There should be a welding tool in the service compartment. Check in there.\u0022\n\n*\u0022I\u0027ll have to let go of the transmitter to do that.
