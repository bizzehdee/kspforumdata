Jeb looked at it in disgust. \u003Cem\u003ELike I\u0027ll ever need those,\u003C/em\u003E he thought. Nevertheless, he flipped the switches of the corresponding systems to finish the flight controller\u0027s instructions. Lights started flashing on the overhead consoles, dials began to function. Several cockpit lights flared to life, making it hard for Jeb to see out the small window of his cramped capsule.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Okay, mission control is giving the green light on all main and sub systems. Launch expected in the next ten minutes.\u0022 This time it was a very familliar voice, through his helmet\u0027s intercom. Jeb cracked a small smile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Kraken, Gene, what happened to the good ol\u0027 days when you just lit the BACC whenever you felt like it?\u0022 Jeb heard Gene chuckle softly into the mic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022It\u0027s not our fault. These new Mun vessels are giving us hell in the engineering department; we really don\u0027t have the funds we need to do it properly. We need to test each one thoroughly before flight to make sure it\u0027s not going to fall apart at the seams.\u0022 Jeb crossed his arms, understanding but still not satisfied. \u0022But still,\u0022 Gene continued, \u0022This isn\u0027t your average ship anyway. She\u0027s a multistage, highly specialized, and extremely sensitive piece of work.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Oh, it\u0027s a piece of work, all right,\u0022 he muttered, nearly under his breath. He\u0027d seen the haphazard way the engineers had welded the tanks together this time around, the secondhand bolts they used. It was almost a miracle that the crawler had brought it to the pad in one piece.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd now he was sitting in it, waiting for a controlled explosion to take place. It was his job, and he loved it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022You know you don\u0027t really mean that.\u0022 Before Jeb could answer, a burst of radio static from the ship\u0027s console cut him off. He hit the \u0027talk\u0027 button.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Say again, control?\u0022 A short delay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Launch timer initiated.

Activating stage one engines... now.\u0022 A quiet, familiar \u003Cem\u003Ewhoosh\u003C/em\u003E came as the pressurized tanks were tested, venting off a small amout of fuel. \u0022Tanks are good.

Capsule life support maintaining status. Second stage tanks read green.\u0022 Jeb glanced out of the capsule window for a brief moment, saw the deep, rich blue of the sky, and the stark white contrast of a few wispy clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022T-10, 9, 8...\u0022 Jeb tightened his grip on the flight sticks.

The worn coffee tables, the dimly flickering lights, the dilapidated door frames to the many offices all screamed \u0022bankruptcy\u0022. He kicked an old cardboard cup from it\u0027s place in the middle of the hallway back under an old conference chair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKraken, we\u0027ve let this place go downhill. I hope Jeb\u0027s flight goes well.\u003C/em\u003E Finally, Bill reached the door of Wernher\u0027s office. He reached up to knock on the door... just as a distant, haunting siren blared. A steady rising, falling, rising howling that penetrated deep into Bill\u0027s being. \u003Cem\u003EThe launch warning!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe door opened suddenly, revealing Wernher\u0027s drawn, weathered face. It creased into a warm smile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Bill! I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. Quickly, come to the window.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill stepped into the barren executive office, not much larger than the break room in the Vehicle Assembly Building. It smelled faintly of paper and metal, and based on the temperature, the climate control seemed to be broken. But there was one gem among the dust and rocks; the large, curved window that overlooked the launchpad and runway, nearly one hundred and eighty degrees of unrestricted vision, so brilliantly clear that it felt out of place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022She\u0027s a beauty, eh, Bill?\u0022 Wernher gestured toward \u003Cem\u003EVenturer I\u003C/em\u003E, held firmly on the launchpad by the dull red arms of the clamps. The launch siren continued to wail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That she is,\u0022 Bill said. \u003Cem\u003EAnd she cost too much.\u003C/em\u003E He turned toward Wernher, but the voice of Mission Control interrupted him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022T-30 seconds. All non-vital personnel, please move to your designated areas.\u0022 A small burst of vapor came from the lower engines as Bill looked back to \u003Cem\u003EVenturer I\u003C/em\u003E. \u0022T-15,\u0022 the loudspeaker announced. More jets of gas, this time from the second stage tanks. \u0022T-10, 9, 8, 7, 6...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh, boy,\u0022 Bill glanced at Wernher, saw that his fingers were crossed behind his back. Smoke began to billow out from the channels under the launchpad; Bill could see the Skippers begin to heat up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00223, 2, 1, 0... \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then the smoke took on a vigor that Bill had never seen before. Deafening waves of sound hit the glass as Grey-white clouds laced with fire rose up in a curtain around the craft, completely obscuring it from view. Bill gasped. \u0022Holy Kraken!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher held up a hand. \u0022Wait for it...\u0022 Several agonizing seconds elapsed. Then \u003Cem\u003EVenturer I\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s grey Mark I pod emerged from the roiling smoke, promptly followed by its transfer section, ascent stage, and seven blazing nozzles. Bill cheered, Wernher\u0027s grin widened.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Liftoff! We have liftoff of \u003Cem\u003EVenturer I\u003C/em\u003E!\u0022 The PA system in the office could barely compete with the roaring of the engines. The ship continued to rise for nearly a minute, drowning out all other sound, though growing quieter by the moment. Wernher cupped his hand near Bill\u0027s ear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The first staging event should occur right about... now!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a bright flash, and three of \u003Cem\u003EVenturer I\u003C/em\u003E\u0027s tanks and engines separated from the main stage. Bill frowned. \u0022What kind of staging is that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWernher positively beamed. \u0022That, my friend, is the dawn of a new form of efficiency, designed by yours truly. Those three tanks that just fell off? They were feeding into the other three radial tanks, which, in turn, are transferring fuel to the center. So right now,\u0022 he pointed upward, \u0022\u003Cem\u003EVenturer I\u003C/em\u003E has all of it\u0027s tanks nearly full. When the next three run out and separate in a few more minutes, the center engine will still be full.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two of them continued to watch as the ship began to curve toward the east, steadily shrinking into a glowing dot. After a while, there was another flash, significantly dimmer this time, and the dot shrunk to a point smaller than the average star in the sky. And then the ship faded entirely. Bill waited a few seconds before looking to Wernher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you...

After a moment\u0027s hesitation, he continued. \u0022Our contacts want many things. Some of them are exceedingly hazardous to a spacecraft\u0027s crew: long-term missions through space, for example, lead to radiation poisoning. Several probes have confirmed this. And yet, even our finest technologies, our most advanced algorithms, are no match for a Kerbal\u0027s piloting skills, of which Jebediah is the best of the best. The autopilot unit has all of the aforementioned algorithms, plus the ability to adapt. It feeds itself raw telemetry data straight from the craft in an attempt to refine it\u0027s programs. After this flight, it should be able to replicate a Mun transfer flawlessly, where other devices have failed from lack of corrective capabilities.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill sank slightly into the water-damaged upholstery of his chair, defeated.

Come in, Gene.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd again, there was no response. He let go of the button in frustration before unbuckling his safety harness. Jeb closed his helmet, made sure that oxygen was flowing independently of the main craft. Then he began to depressurize the capsule. \u003Cem\u003EFixing a fracking antenna... Why me?

He waited a good minute a few meters away, making sure that the ship wouldn\u0027t lash out at him again, and then grabbed hold.
