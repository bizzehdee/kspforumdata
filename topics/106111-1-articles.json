I really do! It is a great overhaul and it really makes the game feel more authentic. Problem is, there\u0027s no real way to know what parts are overheating without having the debug stuff turned on, and even that is a bit daunting to new users who just want to figure out why their ship is overheating.\n\nHow can we fix this stuff?\n\nHere\u0027s an idea: Make heat glow based on percent of maximum heat rather than the real temperatures that things start to glow.\n\nNow this does somewhat break realism, but I think this is one of those cases where realism should be replaced a bit with gameplay. I have a shuttle, the Edwin Abbot MkII, and its wing strakes (which are clearly designed to go on a shuttle where they do) keep breaking due to overheating, even when little to no shock heating is occurring. There\u0027s no warning, because its not actually hot enough to produce the red glow. So I figured, perhaps instead you could simply uncouple the heat glow directly from heat and couple it to percentage of maximum heat. Unfortunately, this would have the side effect of making things that SHOULD have a lower heat resistance, like the Mystery Goo or something, glow red when at relatively cool temperatures.\n\nAnother idea would be to have a thermometer (as a graphical thing, rather than a number, a GUI thing like the thrust limit) in the part\u0027s context menu, showing the percent of maximum heat.\n\nAnother problem with the heat system is the radiators, which has already been discussed. TLDR: We should have dedicated radiator panels.\n\nEager to see your suggestions."},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:44:08Z","Content":"I agree, however I think a simpler solution would be to blink a warning light when any part reaches 70% or something like that, of it\u0027s maximum temperature. But then I suppose you wouldn\u0027t know which part was over heating. Maybe a combination of both. When a part reaches around 70% of the max temperature then it begins to glow. That way not all things with low heat tolerance would glow all the time."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T21:48:15Z","Content":"I would like \n\n1) an audible overheating alarm.\n\n2) a key (and assignable keyboard key) that I could press to toggle the heat display on/off for a quick look at WHAT\u0027s overheating."},{"CreatedByName":"Hcube","CreatedById":137241,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T22:36:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 1) an audible overheating alarm.\n\u003E \n\u003E 2) a key (and assignable keyboard key) that I could press to toggle the heat display on/off for a quick look at WHAT\u0027s overheating.\n\n^This.

IMO, it would be much more fun to see parts smoking before they went up instead of looking at whatever dials, right click menu ETC for a status on temp.....\n\nBut this smoke should be different from regular exhaust in the following ways:\n\n-The particles comprising it need to grow from very small to large RAPIDLY.\n\nThis is to allow a player to see with more detail what is overheating, while being very noticeable. Is it the battery on the side or the hull its attached to thats burning? This whole effect is essentially an arrow pointing to the part that\u0027s cooking after all.\n\n-They need to be a very dark BLACK, to be noticeable even amid the shock heading, mach effects and engine exhaust. If it looks like anything else, it wont be noticed, and wont be useful.\n\n-It need to be dense smoke to be noticeable, as ships suffering from overheating tend to be moving extremely fast. Having a puff of smoke every 100m isnt gonna warn of anything. This means rapidly spawning particle effects. To prevent loss of frame rate, they also need to be short lived.\n\n-They need glowing orange sparks in the black clouds. This it to make the effect useful and visible in the black background of space. Of course there wond be any real glow effect, just orange sparks on the sprite used for the particle effects.\n\n-Optional: Add more and more sparks and even flames as the part gets closer to overheating.\n\nAnd... that\u0027s it for now. Any one got other/ better ideas? It\u0027s the best i got on short notice, that doesn\u0027t break immersion, and still lets you see what part is having trouble.\n\nOther solutions I\u0027ve seen:\n\nright-right clicking every part looking for trouble spots would be tedious and doesnt help you if you dont ride around with right click menu open.... right click info would be useful, but not as a warning of impending doom.\n\nHearing an alarm going off would let you know something is overheating... but just that... \\*something\\* is overheating. You still have no ideas whats overheating and you have no clue whats if the impending explosion is tolerable and to keep going, or would be catastrophic, and you need to be trying to get your kerbals out alive.\n\nAnd of course seeing an explosion isn\u0027t even all that informative until you hit F3. Unless your craft is already falling apart and then yo are just cussing anyway.\n\nPlacing bacon outside of craft. While delicious, it is hard to retrieve bacon in situations that allow for cooking.\n\nLemme know if you guys have better ideas for warning of impending thermal doom.\n\nUnrelated, but still important to me, since it got worse in 1.0 :\n\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92819-An-arguement-for-a-simple-intake-jet-engine-tweak\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/...t-engine-tweak](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92819-An-arguement-for-a-simple-intake-jet-engine-tweak)\nhttps://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92819-An-arguement-for-a-simple-intake-jet-engine-tweak\n\nBump it if you agree!"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:52:42Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thing is, if I remember correctly, there\u0027s something like two keys on the normal keyboard that don\u0027t do something already.\n\nWhew!
