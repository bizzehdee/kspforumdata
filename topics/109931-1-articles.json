I am currently attempting to do a career mode using the SPH and the Runway only, to build and launch. I\u0027m using normal difficulty level and I\u0027m having some problems. I have sort of hit a wall and I am unsure how to proceed. I have only unlocked the basic jet engines and I am currently trying to get science from around Kerbin, materials, goo, EVA and crew reports. The basic jet engines are not really good enough to power a space plane to a high enough speed/altitude to get a space plane into orbit so I\u0027m not able to get orbit science nor complete the Get Vehicle into Space contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I really want to know is, am I wasting my tiime? is there enough science on Kerbin to unlock the tech I need to launch space planes?

To help design a plane that works in space we needed to study planes in zero-gravity! So Jeb and Bill ran around KSC collecting all the things they would need to build tiny planes and asteroids and then we designed and built a zero-G plane, complete with a play roo...i mean a zero-g serious tiny plane testing bay. After diving from 14000m to get zero-g while \u0027analysing\u0027 how the timy planes behaved they were able to get a lot of data. 3 zero-g test flights later and after about a year and a half of analysis I just managed to get to my first SSTO plane and now trying to build to launch a satellite payload to get science from the mun and minimus SOI. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sure i know strapping the MPL to a plane and diving about isn\u0027t neccessarily useful, but it made sense for my game and meant i had a viable reason to spend a year an a half warp for the science wall)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elet me know how its going for you! really interested to see how you\u0027re tackling it!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pappus","CreatedById":100574,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-29T23:39:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EShut up are you seriously getting spaceplanes done with basic jet engines?

At least without basically building a rocket with wings. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way I went suborbital is described earlier in the thread, 2 thuds and a basic jet. There\u0027s nowhere near enough dV in that to circularise though. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically I took the funds-\u0026gt; science strategy at 25% ASAP and then did contracts and Kerbin biomes with the occasional suborbital hop to get the science I needed for turbos. Now building turbojet lifters to push probes further for more science!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kcs123","CreatedById":127158,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T06:57:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hyomoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI know this was already said but the biggest problem is the tech tree. The game is heavily weighted towards space, despite the abundance of science experiments and biomes on Kerbin, and you basically have to supplement your science by doing missions outside the Kerbin SOI, which is problematic because you then need to spend science on rockets to perform more missions for more science. That\u0027s not to say it\u0027s impossible, I believe there is around 500 science on Kerbin itself, but it\u0027s a particularly strict path. However, like any challenge, in the case of a stock career you\u0027ll have to upgrade your SPH and runway to at least open up the freedom to pursue less orthodox methods.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend to try SETIctt mod. Link is in my signature. You will still need to build a rocket or two for some basic probe placement, but building successful plane is possible much earlier in tech tree. Also it is quite useful to build ordinary plane/vtol that is going to provide much needed money from contracts or enough science to unlock early tree nodes without too much grinding to loose interest doing it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
