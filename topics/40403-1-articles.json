Burn prograde till your apoapsis is higher, see intercepts when other half of station is set as target. Play ring around the rosie a few times with timewarp until you get an intercept within 40 or 50 klicks or so, then burn either prograde or retrograde to get that intercept to within 5-10 klicks (use maneuver nodes if you can\u0027t figure out which burn to do from sight). Wait till you get within 5-10 klicks, then kill velocity relative to the target before burning towards it. The rest, I assume you know if you\u0027re trying to build a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sojourner","CreatedById":65674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T04:31:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022painking\u0022 data-cite=\u0022painking\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIf one of them is going faster and they\u0027re on the exact same orbit then eventually they will one day intersect \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s physically impossible to be in the same orbit and have different speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T04:45:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe two answers ahead of mine basically explained how to do this. But perhaps a little further explanation is in order. In KSP as in real life getting two objects close together is rather a challenge. In essence you need both ships on exactly or nearly exactly the same orbit. But that needs to happen only when the two ships are close together. the greater the radial difference between the two orbis the more quickly and more often they will pass each other in their respective orbits. The inner orbital craft will always be the one doing the passing. Incidentally that is why we see Jupiter so often in the sky. There is a large radial difference between Jupiter and Earth. So the greater you can make the radial difference the less time you will have to wait for a close approach. However there is a trade off with this, as with all physics nothing is for free. It takes more energy( think Fuel) to create this difference and then take it away again for rendezvous if the difference is large. Also as the difference between the two orbits gets larger timing the hohmann transfer gets harder to \u0022eye Ball\u0022 in other words the timing needs to be more precises to get a decent transfer. Just so I am not throwing out a word you don\u0027t understand a Hohmann transfer is just a short way of saying the least possible energy (think fuel) needed to transfer from one orbit to another. THe basic rule of thumb is if going from a low orbit to a higher one you need be behind the target craft you wish to rendezvous with when you start the burn for the transfer. The greater the orbital difference the farther behind you need to be. The reverse is true when going from a high orbit to a lower one. Hope this helps solves your problem feel free to ask if you have more questions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mcirish3","CreatedById":50775,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T04:46:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sojourner\u0022 data-cite=\u0022sojourner\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt\u0027s physically impossible to be in the same orbit and have different speeds.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery true \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Though actually having the same orbit is.... well..... difficult.
