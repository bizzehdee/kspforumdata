Specifically it feels (and looks, in the air vehicles in the trailer) like my countless hours of skirmish and coop compstomp in Battlefield Desert Combat\\\u0027s tanks and IFVs and choppers, except with bots that have the remotest idea what they\\\u0027re doing. The suspensions are great, the ballistics are great, the terrain\\\u0027s great, even the sound and environmental feedback mechanisms are pretty great already. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne aspect that\\\u0027s not shown in the trailer: When your vehicle is destroyed you become a cartoon bird avatar who can fly around watching the battle in the most charming way (or enter another friendly vehicle). Also the quit key is ctrl-q, documentation obscured behind the debug console by default, naughty dev.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"frogger","CreatedById":5371,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-10-07T06:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you .
