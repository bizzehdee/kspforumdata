I\u0027ve got a Jool window coming up and I want to send a flotilla of missions to establish a permanent presence there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt first glance, Vall looks ideal to support a Laythe base. It\u0027s in the same plane as Laythe; it\u0027s close in terms of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E, and there\u0027s no atmosphere to complicate precision landing or cause ascent drag losses. Howver, it does have relatively high gravity for a planetary moon, and I\u0027ve found that the gravity losses incurred in both landing and return to orbit are eating up all or nearly all of the Ore I can recover with a reasonably-sized rover. By that I mean, after I\u0027ve refined all the Ore into LfOx to refuel the lander, I\u0027ve got nothing left; this is using unscrewed equipment - if I understand correctly, have an Engineer available \u0022on site\u0022 so to speak can increase the efficiency. Is that correct?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy contrast, a mining lander and refinery operation on/around Pol costs next to nothing in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E to land and return to orbit; the downside is that there\u0027s a fairly high \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E cost to haul the fuel back to Laythe. Pol\u0027s orbit is inclined relative to Laythe\u0027s and it\u0027s pretty far out from Jool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m sure that some folks out there have explored these trades in great depth and can provide some pointers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-04T23:59:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re adept with spaceplanes, Laythe itself can make for a self-sufficient system. Jet engines are high-effiency, so you can overcome the atmospheric losses with comparatively low cost to orbit. As an added bonus, you won\u0027t need to travel anywhere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all that, I still prefer Pol (not a spaceplane guy). To me, Val\u0027s gravity negates it\u0027s usefulness, as you said. With Pol, on the other hand, you can make your fuel shuttle as large as you want to. And although you\u0027ll use a lot of it on the transfer, you\u0027ll have plenty to spare. You can also aerocapture at Laythe to save some Delta V. And on the way back, the ship will be much lighter; making the transfer cheaper. And, as you no doubt already know, it costs almost nothing to land on Pol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like Bop as well, and have an operation there, but my refueling setup on Pol has served me well for a long time. You\u0027ll get plenty of opinions on this subject (as with anything else). So it really comes down to personal preference. I think Pol works the best. Others will say somewhere else.

a year ago.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a very large Mk3 cargo space plane with a bunch of liquid fuel in its wings and strakes, and nerv engineers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt used droppable whiplash boosters and drop tanks to get out of Kerbin with sufficient delta V to reach the Jool system without assists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside the cargo bay was a chemically

Val.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 Undock in low orbit and bring the IRSU lander down on its own.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 The trouble with landing the whole plane, is that on NERV engines it won\u0027t have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to get out of the moderate gravity with full tanks, which makes fuel tight for the next stop.\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 After you\u0027ve planted flags and the lander has refilled its tanks, re dock with the spaceplane.\u00A0 It will easily have enough fuel to take you to the next destination, which should be the remaining unexplored low gravity moon (Pol or Bop)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, land intact here and brim everything off.\u00A0 \u00A0 Our next destination is Tylo and we\u0027re going to need to arrive here with as much fuel as possible\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn low Tylo orbit, undock the lander and fly it down to the surface.\u00A0 I set mine up\u00A0 so it could jettison the
