Dihedral can make things less stable if it\u0027s highly pronounced compared to the amount of yaw stability a plane has, which is a common occurrence in KSP since people tend to put half-hearted vertical tails on their planes in this game. It\u0027s generally better to go with polyhedral wings for most designs, which allows you to have more control over the magnitude of dihedral effects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a very sweet spot of roll stability relative to yaw stability. Too much of roll stability and you get dutch rolling motions that take a long time to damp out or end up being unstable, causing lots of yawing and occasionally rolling issues. Too much yaw stability and the plane ends up having an unstable spiral mode, which basically means that the plane starts to roll one way or the other and keeps rolling that way; it causes lots of crashes for pilots unfamiliar with using instruments to fly in bad conditions, because they don\u0027t realize that they\u0027re banked 70 degrees until they crash. Generally you err on the side of making the spiral mode slightly unstable and focus on a well-behaved dutch roll mode since it\u0027s easier for the pilot to correct for a non-oscillatory motion than an oscillatory motion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T00:16:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have an issue where I\u0027m flying straight, and it rolls to one side or the other, depending on what my bank is.
