But how does multiplayer fit in? The developers wouldn\u2019t tell me if it\u2019s going to be small scale or more massively multiplayer. But while talking about colonies, Simpson did reveal that \u201Cin co-op, if you and your friends have established a base in a certain spot and are independently bringing different kind of resources to store at that base, then you\u2019ll be seeing a lot of people coming and going\u201D.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EI want to know more about Kerbal 2 desperately.

If Adventure mode is linear like that then yeah, thats lame. If however its a really a big tree of different milestones that you can navigate as you please, shift your focus, dovetail a bunch of things together, etc. then I think it could be cool. First could be a tree of world firsts, landing probes and setting foot on different planets. Simultaneously there\u00A0could be a\u00A0track for speed records, a heap of different goals for visiting different biomes or collecting samples from surface features, other groupings for space station building, building colonies with x number of kerbals, etc. If there\u0027s an open platter like that that unlocks in multiple directions and there are different rewards for investing this way or that you can chose yourself how your program develops. I do agree that the generative contracts conjured some interesting goals I might not have thought up myself, but without that baseline structure for rewarding exploration it all feels a little random and hollow.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n*Im not picking on you, you just made a lot of solid worth-discussing points.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceFace545","CreatedById":196943,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-29T23:58:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223793460\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022194258\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221590794593\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022146104\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022HvP\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n33 minutes ago, HvP said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf we are being semantically pedantic...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Warp\u0022 means to twist or bend a shape, such as warped space-time.
