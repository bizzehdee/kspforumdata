Models are very nice, but effects need more work and some missiles behave weird. Isn\u0027t it possible to use Baha\u0027s effects?\n\nHere are some thing I\u0027ve thought about:\n\n- Falcon nuclear missile is IR guided - should be radar. It also won\u0027t explode even if it already lost the target but still can destroy it.\n\n- Tomahawk flies in random orientation, usually upside down. Maybe that\u0027s due to terminalManeuvering = true? Also, its booster is too powerful - real one accelerates slower and is at smaller altitude when booster burns out.\n\n- RIM-174 accelerates like crazy, to orbital speeds, and can not maneuver at all in atmosphere. When I launched it vertically it couldn\u0027t get to fly horizontally - accelerates very fast and has low max AoA.\n\n- RIM-116 doesn\u0027t deploy its fins after launch. Looks reallt weird.\n\n- 9M120 has misaligned smoke and fire particles in exhaust.\n\n- Haven\u0027t dropped BLU-82 yet, but it cries for parachute bag model on the back, and preferably at least simple parachute model.\n\n- Downscaling all weapons to 0.75 or 0.64 with config works great - otherwise they are simply too large for tiny KSP parts. I did the same to all Baha\u0027s missiles. Maybe you should provide optional config for MM?\n\n\u003E \n\u003E @PART[PEW\\*] // P.E.W. weapons \n\u003E {\n\u003E \n\u003E  @rescaleFactor = 0.75\n\u003E \n\u003E }\n\nWill post more when I test more of them."},{"CreatedByName":"LORDPrometheus","CreatedById":61414,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T20:25:47Z","Content":"it is radar guided\n\nthat is due to it being asymmetrical all missiles do this actually you just notice it here\n\ni use FAR usually and have not see that issue\n\ni will fix\n\ni will fix\n\nthat is not possible as deploying a bomb detaches anything attached to it\n\nand that is up to the end user"},{"CreatedByName":"sashan","CreatedById":98897,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-24T21:00:00Z","Content":"Hm, I may be using older version of the mod for that Falcon issue.\n\nI also use FAR.
