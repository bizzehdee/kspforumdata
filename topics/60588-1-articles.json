The kind of mission profile I have for this is to put 8 (or extra\u0027s as backups) into orbit of Kerbin and they wait there for a departure window to Eve. Waiting for departure along with them is the \u0022Return Bus\u0022 that will collect all of the \u0022science package\u0027s\u0022 and get them back to Kerbin\u0027s surface safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst is the lander that have the Science Jr and Mystery Goo. With Eve being a lot like Kerbin I\u0027m guessing that it having 4 Mk16-XL parachute\u0027s should be enough for a soft landing. Once it is on the ground you have the Science Jr and Mystery Goo to preform the experiment. After you are done with that you dump the parachute\u0027s (or anytime before that after your on the ground) and launch it back into orbit. I was able to launch it from KSC with the solids at 70% thrust to a 75 km orbit (using MechJeb).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5052189/screenshot4.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot4.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter you get it into orbit you will then need to pick it up with the return bus. That part of the system can bring back up to 8 of the lander\u0027s science package\u0027s. You will need plenty of delta-v on this as you will have to rendezvous with all of them. The plan I have is once the bus gets to within 75-100m of the lander\u0027s return section you switch back to the science lander and have that dock with the bus. Then it will be the smaller of the two that has to use thrusters to come in and dock. Once docked the science return system has a decoupler just below the Science Jr so all you will have left is the minimal needed to keep weight and awkwardness down as the bus starts to more and more of them docked to it. To land on Kerbin it will just use a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5052189/screenshot3.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinks to the craft:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELander:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5052189/Science%20Return%20Alpha.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5052189/Science%20Return%20Alpha.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReturn bus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5052189/Probe%20Return%20Bus.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5052189/Probe%20Return%20Bus.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-21T06:28:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027ll need a lot more fuel than that!

Yah, as scary as that sounds. Thankfully this time EVE\u0027s atmosphere is a dense soup. T/W remains unchanged, though, you just launch out of a more reasonable density. Check out the terminal velocity tables at the wiki so you can remain under them and do an efficient ascent burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yeah, total delta-v is the number you want to increase even further, you are getting there... And seeing for yourself just what a monstrosity it takes. I think you can get away with about 10.5 is you launch from high enough and are very efficient.

Duna just requires that you help the parachutes a bit at the end, since the terminal velocity is higher and normally not survivable. Packing an extra 500m/s for the last 100 meters or so would do the trick, and then it\u0027s only 2km/s back to orbit and a pitiful T/W, and another or so to get on a kerbin intercept. Call it 4km/s to get from a Duna decaying orbit to the ground and then back to kerbin, and you will have enough to spare. You could pack 4,000m/s in a single stage, BTW, you just need a mass ratio=e^(4,000/9.81/isp), which works out to 2.84 for KSP\u0027s most efficient chemical engines (LV-909\u0027s, isp=390).
