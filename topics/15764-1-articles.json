I was trying to test a bigtrak-bus which transports Kerbals by making them cling to ladders on the back of the vehicle, but every time I switched back to the command pod I was using to source my three test subjects, the kerbals clinging on for dear life were deleted.

I could have sworn I saw people putting their kerbals outside the ship and riding it into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Well. That was interesting! The kerbal was able to hang on while the bigtrak moved on the Mun, but when I started turning he slid up the ladder then went flying off the vehicle. Amusing ragdoll flight ensued. However that is a little annoying because now my bigtrak can\\\u0027t be used to bus kerbals! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
