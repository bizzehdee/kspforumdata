Getting full power will be impossible during the early stages of ISS construction in-game because the P6 (first solar array segment delivered) was attached to the top of Z1. Since the P6 is mounted vertically, the single axes (yaw) it uses won\u0027t allow it to collect sunlight at max capacity during day time because it can\u0027t pitch as the sun moves across the sky.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![iss_sts108.jpg](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0201/iss_sts108.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nAlso something I researched a little into it, there\u0027s actually 2 \u0022types\u0022 of solar array trusses.
