However, I\u0027m still stuck on one thing: I like to have my landers equipped with some probes to allow for wider research, and my lander design requires the probes are launched vertically from a docking port (as it also needs to be capable of relanding on the docking port and resupplying). I realise this is not the most efficient method, as launching prior to landing would require less fuel and so on, but it\u0027s more for story usage than anything else (i.e. \u0022An unusual seismic event has occurred at x|y co-ordinates, despatch a probe to investigate!\u0022). Any ideas for how to launch them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have already tried simple undocking and then launching, however even clicking on \u0022control from here\u0022 on the probe guidance unit results in staying with the lander when the port is undocked, and when control is switched to the probe it then auto-docks (which in other situations is much appreciated.
