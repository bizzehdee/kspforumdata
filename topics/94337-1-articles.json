I just need to set things up for it and finish my current series. Anyways, the series will be mostly stock with one or two mods plus Kethane, FAR, Procedural Parts (maybe), Procedural Wings (probably), Deadly Re-entry, TAC Life Support, and Kerbal Attchment System. I will also be creating new parts out of stock parts by modifying their configs (inspired by Bob Fitch, just not to his amazingly tedious level \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).Yeah doesn\u0027t really sound stock, but I will be using mods that don\u0027t add an incredible amount of new parts, specifically propulsion systems. I may also add a few parts from different mods here and there. I will update this thread with new information about this series. Please fell free to leave any ideas and/or feedback.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
