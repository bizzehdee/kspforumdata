Now It\u0027s not that I can\u0027t live without this, i could force myself to do a workaround but currently I can only control the same throttle of all engines that are active. But in a cluster of engines where one of them is overheating, i\u0027d like to lower the throttle of that single engine only, leaving rest at full throttle. So Is this possible? Maybe with mods? This isn\u0027t the first time I needed this and it\u0027s probably no the last one.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-18T23:19:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/18/2013 11:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by iaureee\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-17T22:42:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t be done stock, but there is a mod that enables that.
