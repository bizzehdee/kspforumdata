Not without huge damage. However, it would cause nowhere near as much damage as an asteroid with the same mass as the space station, as the space station\u0027s weight is spread out evenly. They\u0027d probably just crash together, make a big boom and meteor shower over earth, causing hundreds or millions of deaths and maybe the extinction of humankind (if there was a big enough chunk flying down). Eventually the remains of both bodies would meld and become the Moon again- although with a higher metal content.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
