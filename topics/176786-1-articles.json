So I decided I wanted to start a\u00A0modded career game after I had been away from the game for a while, and I downloaded a bunch of mods, including Scatterer. When I loaded up a new, clean career save, the ocean and atmosphere on Kerbin were completely white, however, the terrain was just fine. I checked around in the tracking station, and I realized it did the same thing to every planet/moon\u00A0that had an atmosphere. However, bodies like Tylo, Eeloo, and Bop were fine, since they had no atmospheres. And the game turns back to normal colors once I reach space. I installed it like this: KSP/GameData/GameData (which I renamed Scatterer for easier entry)/scatterer. Anything I did wrong? Please help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. I turned off and tweaked various settings of Scatterer eg. godrays, terrain shadows, accurate sky reflections for oceans, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"4x4cheesecake","CreatedById":187982,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-16T19:42:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223416562\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022176786\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221531764505\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022187504\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThatKSPGuy\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, ThatKSPGuy said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI installed it like this: KSP/GameData/GameData (which I renamed Scatterer for easier entry)/scatterer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry to remove one of the \u0027scatterer\u0027 folders, it should look like:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nGameData\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nscatterer\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nconfig\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nshaders\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nscatterer.dll\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis applies to all mods.
