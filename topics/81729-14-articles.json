Above is not my wish, certainly. It is simply a (perhaps under-researched) prediction as to what the new systems in question could be. I came to the theory above by looking at the direction KSP development has been moving towards, and combining my interpretation of that with the information we have available so far. The auto-pilot mode wouldn\u0027t necessarily have to be a requisite if you lose, but simply an option...and also a separate game-mode. I wouldn\u0027t be too thrilled for it, but it might appeal to a broader audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said though, I think it is more likely than not that the game will see more advances towards the management end, rather than the cool stuff we (the current playerbase) want to have in the game.

I would bet that if you end up failing too many missions, or run out of funds, that an \u0027auto-pilot\u0027 mode will activate. In this mode (coming in 0.26), you will only have to worry about managing your contracts and funds, hiring Kerbals, and other \u0027Administration\u0027 stuff.
