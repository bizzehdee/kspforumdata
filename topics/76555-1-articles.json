Then I switched to 3 LOx/Ker tanks in the middle, along with on the outside boosters. Then I tried to put two solid boosters on the side of that. The problem with all of them is they don\u0027t have enough Delta V, \u0026amp; they are way too big which causes it to start wobbling mid-flight regardless if i try to gravity turn or not. I\u0027m scared to make my rocket any bigger (which would increase my delta V), but would suffer a harder to control rocket. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first stage (the lander) has 4730 m/s Delta V for when I get to the mun. It will burn to circularize my mun orbit, \u0026amp; de orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second stage has 4000 delta V, it will be used to get an encounter from low earth orbit with the mun, nothing more. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis leaves me with getting the remaining delta V from my 3rd or 4th stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 1st stage has 4,619 m/s Delta V combined w/ boosters. I need to get to 8600 delta V for my 1st stage. Maybe a 5th if necessary. That leaves me with an extra 3,981 delta V that needs to be added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, if my rocket already has aerodynamic failures, it doesn\u0027t make sense to make it any bigger.
