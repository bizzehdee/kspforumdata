The universe splits into new strings every time this happens. The lab has been able to tap into electrical signals and radio waves from nearby strings and listen to broadcasts. They are now almost done with a way to jump objects to nearby strings and back. Then [generic disaster] happens. Your lab is called upon by [group] to gather technology from other strings that may help in ending the disaster.
