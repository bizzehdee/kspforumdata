It also ignores the stock drag values. It usually does fairly well, and there are manual configs for wings and stuff, but one of the thing it falls back on for fuselage-ish items is the size of the attach node. Your envelopes are one of the things it has trouble with (in a rather amusing fashion) unless the nodes are changed.
