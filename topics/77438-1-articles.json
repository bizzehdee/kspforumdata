The module would SLOWLY gain science as it orbited what ever body it was around. After so long you could transmit science back to Kerbin, basically what the ISS does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny mods that execute this type of thing well and its actually practicle?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CapturetheBomb","CreatedById":115022,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-13T01:33:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220216-station-science-v-0-4\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220216-station-science-v-0-4\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one does it alright, but the parts are heavy, so you\u0027ll need a lot of power to lift it or bring them up one piece at a time.
