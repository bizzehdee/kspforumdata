The pilot decides his (her) only choice is to jump out and EVA to the station, and he (she) only has enough oxygen for 6 hours in-game.

The EVA from the \u0022defunct\u0022 \u0022shuttle\u0022 to the \u0022station\u0022 must be direct (no refuelling of mono-propellant), and must be completed inside of 6 (in-game) hours.
