And there HAVE been one-shot fairings in real life...the Skylab fairing on the Saturn V was only ever used once. The LM fairing used to test the Lunar Module on top of a Saturn IB had a unique top. And they were going to make a fairing for a one-shot test of the Lunar Module on top of the Little Joe II (until wind tunnel tests showed that the rocket would be unstable with that fairing and only the lightweight LM on top). The ATDA target used during the Gemini 9 mission had a unique fairing set-up. These are examples that I know of off the top of my head.
