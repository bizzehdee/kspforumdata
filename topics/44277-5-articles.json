The Chinese space program has been chugging along at a very measured and methodical pace. While the focus of their manned program this decade is space station construction in low Earth orbit, which likely has many military applications, that will probably shift or branch off by the end of the decade to manned lunar missions. This has military and economic value to the Chinese, not from mining operations, but to establish itself firmly as a modern superpower on par with the United States. Only the US has sent people to the moon, and granted, while that was more than 40 years ago, it\u0027s still a technological achievement that\u0027s gone unrivalled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s not just for reasons of international recognition or prestige that China will want to send people to the moon.

I never said no man has walked on the moon. I said someone probably did, but I didn\u0027t think it was Neil. They/we needed a hero - not one rotting from radiation poisoning.

And the LM was said to be the most complex machine ever devised at the time. And it worked first time out of the box - save for a few alarms. (I refer to the lander). That is kind of surprising.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose the images taken by the LRO of the landing sites, including Apollo 11, were faked too? Or maybe NASA sent a secret mission to space (launching a Saturn V under cover of darkness) to put a LM descent module precisely where Armstrong was supposed to have landed on the Sea of Tranquility, complete with footprints and scientific equipment in order to \u0026lt;ahem\u0026gt; cover their tracks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd contrary to what you\u0027ve said, I think if you actually do the research, you\u0027ll find that catastrophic first flights are pretty rare. Lots of testing and careful design goes into making sure that test pilots don\u0027t die. The Space Shuttle\u0027s first flight was successful. The X-15 flew a successful first flight. Mercury, Gemini, Apollo all had successful first flights. The LM was flown twice before in space, tested rigorously for many years, had its design qualified line by line, etc etc. During Apollo 10, the astronauts flew the LM to within 8 miles of the lunar surface using the descent engine, jettisoned the descent stage and returned to the CM: a full dress rehearsal of the landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore you return with further fabulism you should read this page:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www.braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome samples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETo reach the Moon astronauts would have to travel through the Van Allen Radiation Belts, resulting in lethal doses of radiation.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a claim the hoax advocates often make, but it is a gross exaggeration and simply not supported by the data. Radiation was a definite concern for NASA before the first space flights, but they invested a great deal of research into it and determined the hazard was minimal. It took Apollo only about an hour to pass through the worst part of the radiation belts - once on the outbound trip and once again on the return trip. The total radiation dose received by the astronauts was about one rem. A person will experience radiation sickness with a dose of 100-200 rem, and death with a dose of 300\u002B rem. Clearly the doses received fall well below anything that could be considered a significant risk. Despite claims that \u0022lead shielding meters thick would have been needed\u0022, NASA found it unnecessary to provide any special radiation shielding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe hoax advocates also make the mistake of limiting themselves to two-dimensional thinking. The Van Allen Radiation Belts consist of a doughnut-shaped region centered on Earth\u0027s magnetic equator. The translunar trajectories followed by the Apollo spacecraft were typically inclined about 30 degrees to Earth\u0027s equator, therefore Apollo bypassed all but the edges of the radiation belts, greatly reducing the exposure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHow could the untested Lunar Module land flawlessly six times on the Moon when its prototype crashed on Earth during training.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022prototype\u0022 to which the hoax advocates refer was not a prototype at all, but two classes of training vehicles known as the Lunar Landing Research Vehicles (LLRV) and the more advanced Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTV). These vehicles included a jet engine to support five-sixths of their airborne weight, a pair of rocket engines that simulated the LM\u0027s descent engine, and small jets that mimicked the LM\u0027s attitude control thrusters. The Apollo astronauts trained in the LLRV and LLTV to learn the skills necessary to maneuver the actual LM. During one test flight, Neil Armstrong was forced to eject when the LLRV\u0027s helium pressurization system for the steering jets failed, causing the LLRV to become unstable and crash. Despite this incident, the LLRV and LLTV flew hundreds of successful flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe LLRV and LLTV were very different from the LM and the \u0022untested\u0022 LM was far from untested. Every component of the LM was tested over and over again during its development. Furthermore, the LM was tested in space unmanned during the Apollo 5 mission and manned during the Apollo 9 mission. Apollo 10 tested the LM in lunar orbit and performed everything but the landing itself. The next test flight, Apollo 11, performed the first lunar landing. Testing continued during Apollo 12 as the ability of the LM to make a pinpoint landing was demonstrated. The LM flew successfully to the moon because of the hard work of thousands of workers over many years during the design, development and construction of the spacecraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe powerful engine of the Lunar Module should have produced a blast crater, yet there is no evidence of a blast crater in any of the Apollo photographs.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s consider several facts: (1) Although the Lunar Module descent engine was capable of 10,000 lbs of thrust (the usual hoax advocate\u0027s claim), it was throttled down to below 3,000 lbs as it neared the lunar surface. While still several feet above the ground, the descent engine was shut down as probes, extending 5 feet below the footpads, sensed contact with the surface. (2) The LM descended at an angle, moving laterally across the ground. When the astronauts identified a suitable landing site, the LM leveled off and dropped to the surface. The LM did not hover over its final landing site for any significant length of time. (3) The Moon\u0027s surface is covered by a rocky material called lunar regolith, which consists of fine dust particles, glass spheres and a jumble of large boulders and rocky debris. Lunar regolith has many unique properties, the most obvious being that the particles are very jagged, which causes them to interlock. When subjected to pressure, the regolith will resist, almost like solid rock. (4) In a vacuum exhaust gases expand rapidly once exiting the engine nozzle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen one considers these facts the truth becomes obvious - The exhaust stream was not powerful enough or centralized enough to displace the regolith and blast out a crater. In this Apollo 11 photograph [see photo] one can see some discoloration and a general lack of dust, which was mostly blown away. After the dust was removed a hard surface was exposed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-13T06:44:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/13/2013 06:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Mr Shifty\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LunaTrick","CreatedById":77902,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-13T06:43:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENASA is closed but look at these photos.
