When one sets a maneuver node and then performs the prescribed burn at t-0s, especially in short-period places like low planetary orbit and with long burns, the result is often a distortion in the shape and position the trajectory compared to the one set. If I can estimate though, that a burn will take e.g. 90 seconds, if I start burning towards the target node at t-45 and finish at t\u002B45, will that minimize the distortion in orbit? I\u0027ve tried it a few times but I could never exactly tell if I was making the issue better or not. Is it maybe more subtle and less straightforward than that?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T18:04:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn my experience, yes this is the way to do it : if you have a 90 seconds burn, you start at T-45 s and end at T\u002B45 s (if all goes well).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem with long burn times is that you have to keep the ship precisely pointed for a longer time, thus sometimes resulting in an accumulation of guidance errors (I guess).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somerled","CreatedById":13610,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T18:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup, you got it. Half the burn time before, half after is a solid rule of thumb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, you can start at t-90s plus a bit in your example and adjust for distortion during the burn so that everything lines up much better at t-0s, not t\u002B45s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, you\u0027re approaching periapsis and attempting to circularize. If you burn directly at your target vector you\u0027ll lower your periapsis and distort your orbit from desired (a little or a lot, depending on the maneuver and craft). But if you pitch up just a little bit, you can maintain your periapsis altitude at the cost of taking a little bit longer to slow down. If your periapsis rises too far, pitch down. It\u0027s less fuel efficient than the half-\u0026amp;-half way, but it makes up for the fact that you planned your maneuver assuming an impulse burn, which is unrealistic.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rodion","CreatedById":75111,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T18:08:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022el_coyoto\u0022 data-cite=\u0022el_coyoto\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe problem with long burn times is that you have to keep the ship precisely pointed for a longer time, thus sometimes resulting in an accumulation of guidance errors (I guess).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, even worse when I\u0027m moving complex payloads and the awkward center of mass defeats the power of any ASAS to keep the ship on course.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-29T18:24:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rodion\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rodion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYeah, even worse when I\u0027m moving complex payloads and the awkward center of mass defeats the power of any ASAS to keep the ship on course.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVery annoying, indeed...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I sometimes do is adding a Poodle or a more powerful engine to my stack, and use it in conjunction with the weaker/more efficient engines during the ejection burn.
