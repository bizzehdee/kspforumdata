difference.\u00A0\u00A0 There is a chance, that if they know the exact class of vessel they are pinging, and the aspect of that vessel (the angle the target is presenting to the sonar), there may be a database of expected sonar returns vs distance.\u00A0 I highly doubt this exists, unless they are actively searching for a type of vessel that is carrying something big underwater.\u00A0\u00A0 But then, if they know a type of vessel is suspected of this, they will just use the blade rate vs speed analysis to locate the offending one, so they can skip the active sonar pings that also reveal

dark.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 The best scenario for this would be for the recon sub to stay passive, and just listen to everything that goes by.\u00A0\u00A0 It could even set it self down on the ocean floor and nobody would ever \u0022see\u0022 it.\u00A0 Let the cruiser fire off it\u0027s active sonar, and the sub can listen for returns from that too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut your point to it being vulnerable is absolutely right.\u00A0 Subs hate shallow water, which is what a channel usually is.\u00A0\u00A0 And not only are channels shallow, they\u0027re narrow, so finding a sub in a channel is almost literally shooting fish in a barrel.\u00A0 Look up what the German Uboats had to go through to transfer from the Atlantic to the Med through Gibraltar during WWII.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure if this is a scenario you are creating, or one you have encountered, but duct taping a sub to a cruiser is probably the worst way to go about it.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet me roll a bit with this scenario.\u00A0\u00A0 We have a Heavy cruiser patrolling a channel.\u00A0 Heavy cruisers are not known for their ASW capabilities, they\u0027re more of shore bombardment and surface warfare ships.\u00A0 They are usually not nimble enough for ASW maneuvers, and they are too valuable to be going directly against a sub alone.\u00A0 They are usually escorted by smaller ASW capable vessels, like destroyers or even light cruisers.\u00A0\u00A0 But even a heavy cruiser might have helicopters on board, specifically used for ASW.\u00A0\u00A0 Even if they don\u0027t, we\u0027re in a channel, which means we most likely have a friendly naval air station in the region, so we can get ASW air assets from that.\u00A0\u00A0 These air assets carry sonobuoys, buoys that actively give off active sonar, and report their results back to a controlling source, the cruiser or helicopter in this instance.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 Since were patrolling a channel, the are we have to search is very small, and a tight constellation of buoys can be laid out.\u00A0\u00A0 So you basically end up with a temporary version of a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSUS\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESOSUS\u003C/a\u003E line.\u00A0\u00A0 Upon finding a sub contact, the air assets could prosecute it at will.\u00A0\u00A0 In my scenario, our recon sub wouldn\u0027t even be in the area, or it\u0027s location would be well known to friendlies, to eliminate the chances of friendly fire.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother option is something like an ACTUV system, which I linked above.\u00A0\u00A0 It is quite feasible for a heavy carrier to actually carry a couple of these on board if they were intending to \u0027blockade\u0027 a channel to enemy vessels.\u00A0 These are autonomous sub hunting drone ships, which once locked onto a target are nearly impossible to lose, since they use mainly active system to constantly hound a target.\u00A0 These fit your recon sub idea better, as they are small and light weight (relatively speaking), and are expendable if it comes to that.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 If one of the drones suddenly blows up, then you have a pretty good idea where your enemy sub is.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I think my point is, subs are not your best option for blockading a shallow water passage.\u00A0 A surface vessel with proper ASW assets is the best way to go about it.\u00A0\u00A0 Even subs designed for littoral warfare would not want to be in this scenario.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 The sub trying to get through, though, doesn\u0027t seem to have a choice, so it has to make it\u0027s way through.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, duct taping the attacking sub to the bottom of a large merchant vessel, is a \u0022viable\u0022 option, hypothetically speaking. \u00A0\u00A0 The scenario in\u003Cem\u003E Periscope Down!\u003C/em\u003E is tempting, but a good passive sonar system would be able to pick up the differences in blades and power plants, as \u003Ca

if you physically attached the sub to the underside of an oil tanker let\u0027s say, and shut it down almost completely, it would be hard for them to detect it.\u00A0 But that takes a lot of time and

permanent bases\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo airbase available around the channel since it\u0027s isolated area, but since there\u0027s a passage into inland bodies of water inside the country, a ship was assigned to guard it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe closest ship available is a patrolling heavy cruiser, which is assigned as a temporary solution to guard the channel before dedicated coastal defense fleet arrived\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe heavy cruiser has ASW helicopter and large number of antisub depth charge mortars.\u00A0\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003ENormally it relies on \u0022recon\u0022 sub (it\u0027s designated as such, it\u0027s like an enlarged midget sub with 10-15 crew) in passive sonar to spot the enemy sub, but since the sub has an engine damage from prior fighting, it\u0027s maneuverability is hampered and in no condition for fighting, but it still needs to follow the heavy cruiser during patrol\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EThen someone got an idea to duct tape the entire sub underneath the heavy cruiser (to fool enemy that there\u0027s only 1 sonar contact, thereby making it as if there\u0027s no submarine, only heavy cruiser) to allow the heavy cruiser use the submarine\u0027s active sonar while carrying it along to mitigate the lack of sub\u0027s maneuverability (they figured that since they are in a channel, with relatively shallow water, an active sonar would cover much larger detection area than simply listening with passive sonar, thus, more efficient in covering the entire channel)\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIm going to
