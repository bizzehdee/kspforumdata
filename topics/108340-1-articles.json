It still works, so I bail out another Kerbal from a Steerwing A300 plane. After she landed, safe and sound, the game decided to bug out and make Kerbin, it\u0027s moons, the planets, and everything else disappear. So, I created a new save, but there was no effect. I have not tried quitting the game and re-entering yet, but until tomorrow, I cannot test that.\n\nIf anyone knows what this bug is, please help. Thank you."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T09:41:53Z","Content":"Hi TinMissileMan, please see the support stickies and provide your game logs ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"TinMissileMan","CreatedById":17663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T11:26:46Z","Content":"I can get those sometime later today, I\u0027ve got some stuff to do."},{"CreatedByName":"TinMissileMan","CreatedById":17663,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T16:00:26Z","Content":"Solved this.
