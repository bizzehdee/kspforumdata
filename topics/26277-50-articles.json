studies done on the propulsion system.\u00A0 I\u0027m sorry if you feel it\u0027s over-powered.\u00A0 It is when you compare it to chemical rockets.\u00A0 One of the reasons (among nuclear test bans, freaking Kennedy out, no-one wanting to pay for it, etc) for the Orion project being cancelled is it would have obsoleted the Saturn project overnight.\u00A0 That was why the NASA Orion was pushed as a 10m pusher plate (which is extra innefficient for Orions), so it could be lofted on a Saturn and everyone could feel good about having spent all that money developing the Saturn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re using the Nyrath edition, then you\u0027re getting vacuum performance regardless of atmospheric density, which is slightly unrealistic.\u00A0 The updated version on KerbalStuff has a modifier to boost performance in an atmosphere, as the yield per KT is radically higher in an atmosphere.\u00A0 Unfortunately for the purpose of game balance, Orions just are better in virtually every way.\u00A0 The difficulties are around the \u0022you\u0027re nuking your launch pad\u0022, and the propulsion system is developing thrust in discrete pulses.\u00A0 While this mod doesn\u0027t model nuking the launch pad, it does model discrete impulses rather than steady forces.\u00A0 Also, your craft will tend to be large and heavy, and hard to turn.\u00A0 But before you complain about something being unrealistic and not real, it might be worth researching said thing.\u00A0 Orions just kick poophole.\u00A0 Yes, they violate every nuclear treaty ever, and irradiate their launch site, suck at docking, and god help you if one crashes on the launch pad, but if everything goes right, they liquid on every chemical rocket ever.\u00A0 By orders of magnitude.\u00A0 The Orion project team in the early 60\u0027s were talking manned missions to Saturn\u0027s moons by the early 1970s.\u00A0 In a single
