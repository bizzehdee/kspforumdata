Bioneogenic planets start with atmospheres of CO2, Water, Methane, Nitrogen and other gases. If major surfaces of the planet are below the triple point temperature (216.5K, 273.16 K, 90.68, 273.16 K).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf temperature falls below the temperature of one of the gases, say water, you have the formation of Ice, but the atmosphere can create a dynamic equilibrium. If two are below, for example carbon dioxide, the atmospheric pressure drops as CO2 accumulates in the cold spot and sublimates with circulation. If temperature falls below three, water will become locked by liquid carbon dioxide, which will be stabilized by a sea of methane.\u00A0 At still lower temperature methane freezes, the atmospheric pressure drops further still, if the temperature falls below the triple point for nitrogen there will first be a rain of nitrogen, but as pressure drops it will start snowing essentially locking these on the cold side of the planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf there are enough of these, the planet might, over time rotate and boil them onto the other side creating a very slow rotation phenomena, but not so fast as to prevent sublimation on the slow moving side, even if life were to form it complex life would be routinely crushed my massive rolling glaciers of ice that melt and reform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever because the pressure on the exposed side is so low, stellar winds and flares will almost certainly kick the isolated gases out of the atmosphere, some will condense on the other side, others will end up speeding out to space.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow cold to dark sides of tidally locked planets get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMercury- closer than the habitable zone. \u003C/strong\u003EOn the dark side of mercury, whose lit side reaches 700K the temperature is average of 100K, if mercury had a primordial atmospheric it would\u003Cbr\u003E\nMove 7/8ths of the Argon, Helium and Hydrogen to the dark side, prior to their expulsion\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo water on the sun facing side, all Water would be locked in ice on the dark side and at poles.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo carbon dioxide on sun facing side, carbon dioxide would sublimate on the dark side\u003Cstrong\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nFreeze or rain methane in spots.\u003Cbr\u003E\nRain Nitrogen (Oxygen would never form because all CO2 is locked up in ice), which would transfer heat from the surface to space, and further cool down the atmosphere.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EOur moon, and imperfectly locked example of a Habitable zone planet. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLets go a little colder, lets look at the moon, which is heated up every 30 days on one side.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAt this distance from its stars, so called habitable zone the dark side has a basal temperature of 30K to 50K degrees. Lets argue that the moon was tidally locked with the sun,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWater would boil and sublimate (snow) on dark side.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFollowed by carbon dioxide.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg/330px-Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/13/Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg/330px-Carbon_dioxide_pressure-temperature_phase_diagram.svg.png\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst if that atmospheric pressure were high enough it would rain CO2, then as the pressure fell temperature would fall and snow of carbon dioxide would coat the ice, this would be followed by methane which would eventually freeze on top of the CO2, later Ntirogen and Oxygen would rain and then freeze on the dark side.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSurprisingly Argon and Neon might join the club.\u00A0 The planet would conduct heat to the surface, and this would potentially result in subterrestrial lakes with hot vents, while these potentially melt the most volatile substances on top, the level of insulation spreads this out and limits it they will sublime after melting and vaporization on other areas and at the edges. This will drive eventually water from the edges to the center, the volatiles will flow to the edges and be blow off by solar winds, the pressure would drop keeping ice and carbon dioxide perpetually frozen or sublimating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCaveots, larger planets, better hold atmosphere have greater thermal heat retention and lower surface area to mass, higher potential for subglacial oceans.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-02T21:47:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2016 09:47  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by PB666\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AngelLestat","CreatedById":58968,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-02T22:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnot sure if I understand you..\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou are talking about atmospheres mechanics, but your example was vacuum bodies like moon and mercury, those extreme temperature differences can only happen on planets with less pressure\u00A0than mars.

It is not \u003Cem\u003Elike a tidally locked\u003C/em\u003E planet because it is not a tidally locked planet, period. However it got to that state, its not tidally locked now. The most current research regarding venus poles suggest it could have lower temperatures if it locked up. The atmosphere of Venus has a huge greenhouse effect, Irradiance on the sun facing side heats up the ground and drives high bioling point anionic volatiles out, during the night period these react, The high level of sulfate and C02 in the atmosphere are reflective of intense destabilization (thermodynamic potential) of the Venusian soil, on the night side any cooling results in recombination adding heat back. If you remove the source of ground heating, you would over long periods of time achieve ground chemical equilibrium, I estimate it would take years if not decades because the effects are so deep in the Venusian soils, the ground would begin to cool only slowly. The temperature over the Venusian poles for instance is 100\u0027K colder than models predict. If we extended the poles to cover one half of the planet the depth of coldness would eventually increase. Once stable recombination of sulfate and metals in the venusian soil occurs, the vapor pressure of sulfate would drop, followed by CO2. It would take a very long time for one major reason, Venus has had 5 billion years of geological turbulation to pump high temperature volatiles out, it would take another 5 billion years to recombine them, these were made at a time when water was a catalyst, but hence water is no longer present.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVenus may have formed from the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula\u0022 title=\u0022Solar nebula\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esolar nebula\u003C/a\u003E with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide\u0022 title=\u0022Tide\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Etidal\u003C/a\u003E effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years.

For example if you measure the temperature for an airliner at 33,000 feet (10000 meters) it is typically around -65\u0027F (-58\u0027C) this are the points at which water is no longer stable. In the ITZ the temperature at this altitude is slightly higher, and clouds range much higher, in a polar vortex they can be considerably lower. At the venutian poles the temperature is about 100\u0027K below expectation, I suspect the reason for that is that there is some recombination of sulfate and rock below because local irradiation is insufficient to maintain the instability of S02 in the presence of reactive metals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can see what happens every year plain as day and night when an ocean is exposed to the absence of sunlight for 6 months, Antarctica\u0027s ice area almost doubles by September 15th. If insolance never came to Antarctica, the sea ice would continue to grow and thicken, the life that feeds on the algae would die, eventually the ice would grow to the bottom of the seafloor, the glaciers would begin to slow, ice would begin to thicken to 3 kilometers thick the radius of equilibrium thickness would increase slowly and eventually lower sea levels. In the center of Antarctica you would see the cap reach a level where temperatures where below the sublimation temperature of CO2, CO2 would begin precipitating from the atmosphere, this would cause global cooling, the would be isostatic decline in sea-level and the ice thickness would grow. Antarctic would eventually cover everything from 68\u0027latitutude south, while greenland Ice would melt it would be miniscule compared to sea level falls induced. If we turned Antarctica and locked the northpole to the sun, Antartica would then consume all the water, the sunfacing side would dry up, you would have pools of brine, then salt flats. Life would die, the sunfacing side would have a wholescale burning of hydrocarbons, oxygen would fall somewhat, the hydrocarbons on the \u0027southern hemisphere\u0027 would be perpetually locked in the earth as well as the trees and vegetation in the southern hemisphere, would fall over and form coal fields. C02 would undergo depletion in the coldest artactic regions. Because earth now no longer has a magnetic field (its no longer spinning and tides are no longer slowing the earth down), this causes nitrogen to be knocked out of the atmosphere and it thins. Before to long it thins to the degree that nitrogen starts liquifying at higher antartic layers, followed by oxygen. Then makes atmosphere loss due to radiation and solar winds accelerate. Eventually the earth becomes sterile. It is too far from the sun to become a mercury, so it would retain water and CO2.

If insolance never came to Antarctica, the sea ice would continue to grow and thicken, the life that feeds on the algae would die, eventually the ice would grow to the bottom of the seafloor, the glaciers would begin to slow, ice would begin to thicken to 3 kilometers thick the radius of equilibrium thickness would increase slowly and eventually lower sea levels. In the center of Antarctica you would see the cap reach a level where temperatures where below the sublimation temperature of CO2, CO2 would begin precipitating from the atmosphere, this would cause global cooling, the would be isostatic decline in sea-level and the ice thickness would grow. Antarctic would eventually cover everything from 68\u0027latitutude south, while greenland Ice would melt it would be miniscule compared to sea level falls induced. If we turned Antarctica and locked the northpole to the sun, Antartica would then consume all the water, the sunfacing side would dry up, you would have pools of brine, then salt flats. Life would die, the sunfacing side would have a wholescale burning of hydrocarbons, oxygen would fall somewhat, the hydrocarbons on the \u0027southern hemisphere\u0027 would be perpetually locked in the earth as well as the trees and vegetation in the southern hemisphere, would fall over and form coal fields. C02 would undergo depletion in the coldest artactic regions. Because earth now no longer has a magnetic field (its no longer spinning and tides are no longer slowing the earth down), this causes nitrogen to be knocked out of the atmosphere and it thins. Before to long it thins to the degree that nitrogen starts liquifying at higher antartic layers, followed by oxygen. Then makes atmosphere loss due to radiation and solar winds accelerate.

Following this the higher inertia gases like S03 and C02 would have been left by a cosmic distillation process. It does not seem likely to me that Venus\u0027s atmosphere in its current state would suffice to slow its orbit down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a metric that occurs, the mass loss per unit mass in bright stars is higher due to the increase relative mass of the hydrogen fusion zone, this is what eventually shortens the life of a star. Red stars produce less light per unit mass drawing in the habitable zone, placing the habitable zone close to the destructive tendencies of stars. This increases the likelihood of tidal locking, which makes Venus and Earth type planets unlikely. Flaring in brown dwarfs is not out of the question either, because strikes of extrastellar material can cause a brown dwarf to flare because of lithium decomposition and because brown dwarf internal structure is not uniform.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn answer to Pedar, the basic problem I have with the Venusian dynamic is the high presence of sulfate dehydrants relative to the other Venusian gases. There is for example a tremendous amount of water on earth, and sulfate is only 8 percent of that, if we assume the similar on Venus, then the original atmosphere of Venus was 10 times more massive than today. Sulfate would be one of the last gases to evaporate if Venus ever had water. The bigger problem still is that on earth there is alot of carbonate and sulfate in the earths crust that is in multibillion year flux, this would basically mean that Venus formation was very different from earth, or that its atmosphere was far thicker than on earth. You could argue that if Venus was loosing atmosphere then we should see it happening today, the problem is that it would loose the most volatile ions first followed by things like sulfer dioxide and carbon dioxide, so in essense the atmosphere may have equilibrated. The presence of sulfer dioxide in the atmosphere is troubling because it drives the volatiles away from the planets gravitational field.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgain, I state my basic prospectus on the matter of life, enthusium about life on other planets is NOT a predictor of how abundant or distributed life is, taking a conservative scientific model I approach the distribution of life by starting with the premise that life is most likely around earth sized planets with natural satellites that orbit sun-like stars. From that I think that boundary for life is\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Inhibited by brighter stars, despite tidal locking in the habitable zone being less likely because hotter stars die more quickly, and stars greater than 2 solar mass die catastrophically.

There is for example a tremendous amount of water on earth, and sulfate is only 8 percent of that, if we assume the similar on Venus, then the original atmosphere of Venus was 10 times more massive than today. Sulfate would be one of the last gases to evaporate if Venus ever had water. The bigger problem still is that on earth there is alot of carbonate and sulfate in the earths crust that is in multibillion year flux, this would basically mean that Venus formation was very different from earth, or that its atmosphere was far thicker than on earth. You could argue that if Venus was loosing atmosphere then we should see it happening today, the problem is that it would loose the most volatile ions first followed by things like sulfer dioxide and carbon dioxide, so in essense the atmosphere may have equilibrated.
