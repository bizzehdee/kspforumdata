I\u0027ve already got my orbiter, Explorer I, in a low polar Duna orbit. The next step is putting a lander there. I wanted to design something like the Phoenix lander. But I\u0027m not entirely sure how to do this. I need to make sure I have enough fuel to land safely, but also not make it so the engine touches the ground and the landing skids don\u0027t. I could use external fuel tanks, but the lander\u0027s mostly packed with science, solar panels and batteries. One of my ideas was to land with the help of Puff Monoprop. engines, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027ll be enough to land.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is what the lander looks like (ofc everything will be retracted on launch)\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo I\u0027m not certain where I\u0027d put fuel tanks or monoprop. tanks and whatnot to make it all land. One idea was a skycrane but I haven\u0027t ever tried to do that yet.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, anyone who\u0027s better at this game than me, what might I be able to do to get this thing landed and if there\u0027s anything I should add, let me know please.

In fact, a couple of radial parachutes may be enough to slow it down to the point that the landing legs can take the impact.
