What if we could jump time instead? How many times have you overshot something because of the timewarp system? What if you could select a point in orbit and jump time instead. The game will fade to black, and fade in immidately and you will have arrived at the destination. Of course time and the the game will have progressed, planets will have moved etc. But you are free from having to speed up time and slow it down at the correct time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a mechanic like this, it opens up for much larger solar systems. It opens up for the posibility of adding galaxies. Bodies that are decades away. And it wont change the difficulty of the game. You still have to plan your mission, bring enough fuel, equipment etc. and execute the proper manouvers at the correct time. But getting to the manourvre points and end destinations will be smoother, and the size of the game could expand where you have multiple star systems because you would be free of the time warp mechanic which can only go so fast. One of the reasons multiple star systems havent been added yet is because it would be hundreds of years away, and doing that kind of time even at maximum timewarp is going to take alot of time. I guess what im asking is, what are the benefit of a time warp system, rather than a jump to time system?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:33:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI liek this idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T23:50:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow is this different from the warp-to feature?

The fact that it doesn\u0027t work correctly on hyperbolic orbits is a \u003Cem\u003Ebug,\u003C/em\u003E not a feature. I\u0027m not talking about manual time warp with the ./, keys. The only thing a jump-to system would add is that it would force the developers\u0027 hand and \u003Cem\u003Eforce\u003C/em\u003E them to fix it before they implement it. The underlying accelerated simulation is the same for both systems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rkman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rkman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIncreasing time warp increases the chance of overshooting, so it would make the problem worse instead of solving it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhich is why I continued the sentence with \u003Cem\u003E\u0022\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6as well as Kerbal Alarm Clock.\u0022\u003C/em\u003E I\u0027ve already noted that stock \u0022warp-to\u0022 is buggy, and manual (./,) time warp shouldn\u0027t even be part if the discussion anymore. KAC is known for being reliable, especially since the stock \u0022warp-during-SOI-transition\u0022 behavior was corrected. I suggested such mods so you can see if behavior they provide is similar enough to what you\u0027re/the OP is looking for, before more talk on changing the user experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022rkman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022rkman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe calculations are fairly trivial because everything is on rails, so for each body a specific moment in time directly corresponds to a specific point on their orbit, no actual physics simulation needs to be done.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe calculations are \u003Cem\u003Eexactly the same\u003C/em\u003E (note, this is not an argument against jump-to). Time warp already needs to simulate orbits forward, so would jump-to. There\u0027s no sense reinventing the wheel.

Fair play to the OP for suggesting it and if it gets implemented as a replacement/update to the current warp-to system then fine. I wouldn\u0027t use it myself but clearly some people would. If it replaced the current time-warp system altogether I think KSP would be a lot poorer for that change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is spaceflight. Things take time. Much as I dislike the phrase, pressing a button and skipping over most the actual flying-through-space part of spaceflight would be immersion breaking for me. Missing a maneuver node through over-zealous time-warping is annoying but no more so than crashing into the Mun, forgetting some small but essential piece of equipment, running out of fuel or power, or all the many things that can go wrong in KSP. Learn, move on, try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, this is something of a pet peeve and not directed at the OP specifically. It\u0027s just something I see far too much of on game forums in general.
