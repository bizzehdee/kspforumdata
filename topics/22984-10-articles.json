You also should take into account efficiency of the engines and terminal velocity. The LOLZ ASPARAGUZ AND MAINSAILZ! that most people use isn\u0027t the most efficient way, but it does work. I prefer less weight and less parts (due to the physics stutter I noted above!). In this example I ignite all the engines but the nukes. I run at 2/3 throttle until I kick off the first stage which includes the burned out boosters and the first pair of Skipper engines. Then I increase throttle a bit to stay right around terminal velocity. Each stage I dump comes with a slight increase in throttle. At the third stage, where I\u0027ve dumped all the skippers and Im using just the mainsails I\u0027m right at 10k and I make the gravity turn. Continue on as usual. The ONE issue I have with this particular setup is that once in awhile one of the mainsail stages will hit the nuke engines on the way out...I\u0027m too lazy to rebuild it to get the seperatrons in the right places to avoid that \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR: Asparagus.
