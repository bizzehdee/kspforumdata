Finally figured out how to land, left a base consisting of a habitat with 2 Kerbals, and got the rest of the ship back into orbit on the way home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t really pick a time for my return flight, so the transit was really messy and wasteful but I had plenty of fuel for it. Anyway, I was in the processes of fine tuning things, I had my Kerbin periapsis down to 51,000 km, when I was called away. I THOUGHT I put my computer to sleep but apparently did not. When I came back hours later, my ship was on the screen, spinning at insane speeds. When I got it slowed down, I saw the engines were gone. Actually one of my three engine pods was torn right off, apparently by the rotational force. All my fuel was still there so I didn\u0027t leave anything on, must have been a bug.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t put RCS on this thing, but I did put 2 separator rockets on my command pod. They have enough delta V to screw up my encounter with Kerbin any way I burn them so presumably when I get closer there should be a solution that will let me hit the planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlight Engineer says they provide 114 m/s. But they are mounted on the surface of the Command Pod, so they are not parallel to my axis. As they are on opposite sides of the pod the total thrust is on my axis, but my guess is that Flight Engineer is providing that figure based on rear facing rockets and some of my force will cancelled out. Can someone confirm that?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI say that because I did a little math and, in purely linear terms, I should be able to displace 51Mm if I burn about 5 days before my periapsis. So I spent some time save scumming, fast forwarding to the correct time and separating on an orientation perpendicular to my path. Couldn\u0027t get any closer than 26Mm. I played with changing the time too but I since I don\u0027t know how far off am its pretty rough going. If someone could help my figure out the actual delta V I\u0027m getting from 2 separators on the tilted surface of a Mk1 pod that might be a step in the right direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would also help if I could place maneuver nodes. But the game doesn\u0027t want to let me. I can only put a node on my purple orbit after it\u0027s shifted by my Kerbin encounter. I can\u0027t put one on my light blue current orbit. Is that how the game works or am I going something stupid? Nodes would be super handy to figure things out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to anyone who can answer any of my questions or give me general pointers,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS You may wonder why, if I\u0027m willing to save scum a solution why don\u0027t I go back before I messed up. Well, I would have. When I got my ship to a stop and saw the devastation I instantly thought \u0022no problem I\u0027ll just load my quicksave\u0022 ... and hit F5 to do it. Yeah, I\u0027m a newbie.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T12:19:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour ship spinning? at vacuum space? insanely? how? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eok.

You can leave your guys orbiting for a while, perform some other missions, perhaps run some rendezvous training, then you can return to them and bring them back to Kerbin safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERescue missions are fun, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"eliterrell","CreatedById":81715,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T01:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: After almost a week of trying I successfully corrected my orbit using the separation rockets. My math was almost useless. In the end it came down to brute force experimentation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStock KSP is not the best for this kind of approach. Trying to warp to a specific time is difficult. Many times you will go over your target. Precision aiming on the nav ball is equally tedious. It tells you your heading but it is hard to guess your elevation if you\u0027re off the orthogonal directions. I wasted a lot of time trying things, collecting useless flawed results until I downloaded the Kerbal Alarm Clock and Steam Gauges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock lets you stop warping at a specific time. No going over at high warp, no waiting forever at low warp...then going over anyway because you dozed off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESteam Gauges has a heads up display that is many times better than the nav ball for quickly finding an exact direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I\u0027d got these two mods, it only took one more session to nail down my solution.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T09:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock is sure a great tool but it is also possible to just get used to time warping and get to the desired time precisely enough without wasting unnecessary real time and without overshooting. It\u0027s better to watch the remaining time counter though (and put a maneuver at critical spot even if you don\u0027t plan anything there) as the ship in orbit may accelerate or decelerate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is just one moment in KSP where it is really beneficial to be spot on on the navball and that is during the landing. In all other cases it does not really matter if you are a bit off as it is easy to correct for it. You don\u0027t have to be spot on with your planned maneuver - it assumes that you apply the delta-v at single moment and doing so over period of time generates some drift anyway. I actually learned to plan a maneuver, get my ship in position, then after starting my engines I remove the maneuver and watch what the real orbit is doing as that is what will actually happen. More or less, for instance when returning from Eeloo using single maneuver to Kerbin the difference between Kerbin periapsis shown at Eeloo and where I actually (would have if I did not correct) arrived was about 100 km. Missing my airbrake height by 100 km would be a real bummer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u0027s another reason to not rely too much on such things as the Alarm Clock - it is better to actually watch your orbit and apply corrections with RCS on the course to ensure the most accurate results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReal space probes and ships do so, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I wanted to say is - these tools are sure great and make the navigation a lot easier. But it is possible to do these things without them with some practice.
