You can carry small parts in the command pod which would be right from the start before any tech advance, But you don\u0027t get the tools.

Likely neither is doing anything explicitly wrong, they just have a different set of assumptions for how new parts can be created/attached.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstalling KIS will not fix any chutes you may already have in KAS storage. I was able to create a new rocket with radial chute and screwdriver in the pilot\u0027s inventory, attach the part in orbit, and use the chute to land successfully. Note that I couldn\u0027t find any way to control/tweak the realchute settings, so you get whatever the default sizes are (in my case a bit too small for my rocket unfortunately).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
