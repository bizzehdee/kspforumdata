A shallow ascent curve--after sufficient vertical velocity is achieved--can maximize air-breathing time for even more efficiency. The oxidizer supply is therefore lower, proportionally, than the liquid fuel supply, for weight savings.\n\nUse Action Group 1 to shut the air intakes after switching from air-breathing to closed-cycle, to reduce drag during the final part of the ascent.\n\nLadders are keyed to the Gear Action Group.\n\n[**Craft file available at GameFramer.**](http://gameframer.com/#/ksp/vessel-details/551b3388d5d548f563e36f41)"},{"CreatedByName":"Climberfx","CreatedById":57126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T19:39:33Z","Content":"Cool and Original design.

I was initially inspired by the Buck Rogers/Destination Moon look but given the parts it wound up looking like it came from an 80s SF movie. I\u0027m not complaining. ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T22:57:31Z","Content":"I like this a lot.
