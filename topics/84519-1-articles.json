Oh well, Hyperedit up a replacement). The game has far too many bugsfor me to feel comfortable turning those off. If I turned them off and did a Minmus return mission and, as has happened before, Kerbin didn\u0027t load (you\u0027ve seen the bug before, the surface stays low res, then when you get low enough, the black hole opens up and you die), then why should I be penalised for reverting? I either lose rep and money by continuing, or I lose money and science by reverting - simply because Unity decided to break. Through no fault of my own, I have to lose out on money and progress. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t get why people keep suggesting things like this - if I kill kerbals because of bad piloting, that\u0027s my fault and I accept it. If I kill kerbals because the game bugs out, I shouldn\u0027t be penalised for that. All it takes is self control and willpower to not take the easy way out all the time and actually man up to your mistakes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiaK","CreatedById":80590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-14T07:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eall of your points are valid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eperhaps my Idea wasn\u0027t the best.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"arkie87","CreatedById":103434,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T13:23:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ZodiaK\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Eall of your points are valid.\u003Cp\u003Eperhaps my Idea wasn\u0027t the best.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone a while back posted an idea like this. I suggested a separate button in the VAB/SPH (a yellow rocket called \u0022test\u0022) that allows you to test your vehicle. This is basically a simulation mode, so there is no cost to build or for failure, but you cannot earn any science or complete contracts (though it might show you that you completed it). When you click test, it would load a window asking you what planet/orbit etc.... you want to test your craft (so you can instantly warp to a planet to test it, instead of having to set up the maneuvers etc.... or edit save files or something). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis idea would be useful for both career mode, as well as for players wanting to mess around and have fun...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-15T13:26:58Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2014 01:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by arkie87\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
