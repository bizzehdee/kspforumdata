The money for completing contracts isn\u0027t enough to keep our half billion dollar space center running\u0027, Gene Kerman said. Wilber, the head of PR, suddenly had an idea: Why only send astronauts to space, when there are so many people on Kerbin? And with that, the Tourism Program was created.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCHAPTER 1: \u0027Change\u0027\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next day, all the staff and astronauts at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, as well as those on missions (either watching or listening), were given information relating to a new project. It was to work on passenger aircraft, shuttles, and space station designs. The winner, who\u0027s design was accepted by the administrators, would be given their own \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E transport buggy. As soon as he\u0027d heard the word \u0027buggy\u0027, Jeb imagined strapping rockets on the sides and flying away, but was bound by a signed contract not to attach anything providing external thrust to a vehicle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThousands of drawings were sent in. A new area had to be built for storing all of these. Eventually, five were selected.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1: A light passenger aircraft, capable of holding six Kerbals (two pilots and four passengers).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2: A small Mk2 shuttle, also holding two pilots, and four passengers, with a cargo bay in the back for supplies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3: A giant ring station, capable of holding four of the shuttles. In the case of structural failure, all Kerbals would move to the shuttles, and land back on Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4: A large, four engined aircraft with the ability to swap out passenger cabins for cargo bays\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5: A small, inexpensive colony \u0027pod\u0027. It had room for four Kerbals, could run on solar power, and most importantly, be airdropped (by the aircraft mentioned above in cargo version).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only problem, building all of these in 6 months for the official program launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-05T14:44:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, do you have some mod that floods you with tourist contracts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chel","CreatedById":176173,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-06T04:00:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223286130\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022170499\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221517841894\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002269507\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Geschosskopf\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n13 hours ago, Geschosskopf said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, do you have some mod that floods you with tourist contracts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo, I just use sandbox and some Kerbal customisation mods to make them look like tourists.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
