BTSM further tweaks Deadly Reentry\u0027s settings to be more aggressive, and thus, Eve\u0027s atmosphere is more akin to a spaceship eating shark than a pillow to fall into. Example: After it finished all of its duties, I put an unshielded probe into a 91x91km orbit and then lowered the periapsis to 86km for a super gentle deorbit brake, engine first of course.

Of course, by that point the integrity of your spaceship becomes irrelevant, because the g-forces during aerobraking reduce your Kerbals to a thin film of green goo on the floor of their capsule. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lukaszenko","CreatedById":95776,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-13T11:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u00221of6Billion\u0022 data-cite=\u00221of6Billion\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t have Deadly re-entry, so forgive me if I talk nonsense here.\u003Cp\u003ECan\u0027t you areobrake in 2 or even more sessions?

In the first place, RL spacecraft don\u0027t travel fast enough to really need more than a small burn to capture into orbit, due to the huge amount of dV required to do an accelerated transfer, which drives up the cost of the spacecraft. As such, a Mars probe for example can propulsively capture into a highly elliptical orbit and then use aerobraking over many days to slowly lower its apoapsis to where it needs to be. However, even then it sometimes is not sensible to aerobrake, because the craft may be too fragile, or because the maneuver requires constant human attention - and that means buying a lot of expensive signal time on the DSN.
