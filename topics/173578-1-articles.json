In most games its not an issue, because it doesnt affect the gameplay. But in KSP, the autosave causes the game to \u0022hang\u0022 over a minute each time. Which doesnt sound like much, but it definitely feels excessive when it happens every 5 minutes, or less. It gets REALLY frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt this point, at the very least, I dont think it would be too much to ask for the ability to turn autosave off, so I can play a $40 game for more than 5 minutes at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-04-07T02:51:38Z\u0022 title=\u002204/07/2018 02:51  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EApril 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Dirtmoto228\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FrenchChris","CreatedById":188151,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-04-18T01:52:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi ;\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003EI same problem on PS4 after installing update 5.5 PS4 system.
