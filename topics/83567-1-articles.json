I\u0027m actually not a big fan of the movie; after seeing it once I never want to see it again. I watched it on DVD in 2007 right before starting watching the series (I love Netflix). I chewed through SG1, then started alternating through SG1 and Atlantis discs when the appropriate time came, and when I caught up with Atlantis I watched season 5 live.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also liked Universe and would love another few seasons to see what they do.
