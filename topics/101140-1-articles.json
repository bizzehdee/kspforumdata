It would allow much much more design options when the doors would slide into the cargobay sides instead of opening with a hinge mechanism.\n\nThe opened cargobays often clip into other parts of the vessels and it is difficult to build around it.\n\nExamples:\n\nMK3 cargobays to the side - these need very high/low wings so they do not clip:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66465-Work-in-Progress-WIP-Design-Thread?p=1736007\u0026viewfull=1#post1736007](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66465-Work-in-Progress-WIP-Design-Thread?p=1736007\u0026viewfull=1#post1736007)\n\nMK2 cargobay topdown for cockpit access:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111457-SSTO-Freerider-series?p=1755665\u0026viewfull=1#post1755665](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/111457-SSTO-Freerider-series?p=1755665\u0026viewfull=1#post1755665)\n\nWhere a sliding door would be cool:\n\n- two cargobays facing each other while being opened, creating a larger bay that could fit wider rowers or small planes\n\n- rockets with X-symmetry with cargobays attached all around (right now the bay doors clip into each other when opening all of them\n\n- MK3 bays having things attached to the sides would allow placing them nearly along the full height without clipping (wings, tanks) - right now the doors open at half height, mostly clipping to attached side tanks.\n\nThis could also be applied to the MK2 inline docking port.\n\nedit: here is an example that could work wonderfully if the doors would slide:\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66465-Work-in-Progress-WIP-Design-Thread?p=1769378\u0026viewfull=1#post1769378](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66465-Work-in-Progress-WIP-Design-Thread?p=1769378\u0026viewfull=1#post1769378)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-03T19:22:14Z\u0022 title=\u002203/03/2015 07:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LordFjord**"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Dilsby","CreatedById":232743,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:32:51Z","Content":"I\u0027d be happy if the degree to which the doors opened were a tweakable: that is, I could set the doors on my spaceplane to open only 150 degrees instead of 180, which would be more than enough to get things in and out and yet would not clip wings on the centerline."},{"CreatedByName":"jman508","CreatedById":122550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:38:02Z","Content":"^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nhey devs! if you see what kuzzter just said implement it!"},{"CreatedByName":"pokeman","CreatedById":19553,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T09:52:46Z","Content":"Kuzzter is a genius, I noticed this problem and using tweakable angles on the door is the perfect solution."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T12:29:21Z","Content":"@Kuzzter: That\u0027s a good idea and a LOT less effort than remodelling or redoing the animations."},{"CreatedByName":"Darnok","CreatedById":85708,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T13:28:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d be happy if the degree to which the doors opened were a tweakable: that is, I could set the doors on my spaceplane to open only 150 degrees instead of 180, which would be more than enough to get things in and out and yet would not clip wings on the centerline.\n\n^ this \u002B2^100 ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"KrazyKrl","CreatedById":65849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-05T14:17:46Z","Content":"I would love to see procedural cargobays.\n\nThink of a bay that has 8 parameters:\n\nBay Width (Internal Ceiling Width)\n\nBay Length (Overall Bay Length)\n\nBay Height (Internal Wall Height)\n\nBay Door Length Offset (Able to leave a gap at either end of the bay)\n\nBay Door Width Ratio (Concave/Convex closed cargo bays available)\n\nBay Door Length Ratio (Stubby bay doors)\n\nBay Door Close Angle(Concave/Convex bay doors)\n\nBay Door Open Angle\n\nThe base size of the doors can be extrapolated from the bay width and bay door close angle, which is why the width and length of them should be a ratio.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-05T14:21:10Z\u0022 title=\u002203/05/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KrazyKrl**"},{"CreatedByName":"Azimech","CreatedById":50750,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T21:02:33Z","Content":"Totally agree with both the topic and tweakable cargo doors!"}]}
