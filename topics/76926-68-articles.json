Basically, you could move the cam like any other external or internal camera with the MFD, but when you click on one of the buttons it stays on that spot, no matter what its looking at (Lazor just lets you target vessels and structures).

I think its even possible to make the gun projectiles compatible, just need to add cannon power/blast radius to them. As of now they work too, after 700 meter the bullets don\u0027t even scratch armor(since they have a crash tolerance of 300, my modded vers gives a crash tolerance of 200 to ceramics 300-400 to metal plates).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve tweaked it so it takes 2-4 hellfires to break through a layer of Ceramics\u002BMetal, and 2 cannon shots to punch through it.

Steel core rounds are much more likely to ricochet off of hard surfaces and will do so at anything below around 80 in relation to the path of the projectile. Tanks fire two main types with specialty rounds for certain occasions. AP rounds are kinetic penetrators designed for taking out other tanks and armor and consist of a sabot surrounding a tungsten or depleted uranium penetrator these will not ricochet since they are harder than just about anything and have enough momentum to punch through atleast some of anything.
