There\u0027s no real proper \u0027goal\u0027, although I guess making bases and space stations on most bodies would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EDAY 1\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t have many screenshots in this one, since I didn\u0027t think of making something like this when I did this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought of making a neat little space station around Kerbin as a refresher, but then I realized I messed up as I used the inflatable airlocks by themselves and had no way to dock. Now the situation was that the original three was stuck on a broken station and Valentina and a few scientists\u00A0were stuck on a unusable module. I decided to launch a rescue probe with a arm to pull the station\u00A0out of orbit. Things went okay, until I tried to decouple the inflatable heat shield, for some reason it kept smacking the ship and destroying it. A few retries later and I got away with only the probe core destroyed, which was fine since the cockpit can\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Esomehow\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0control the rescue craft through a arm. Anyway, the landing went well (nothing exploded atleast) and the original three was fine\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022AGHAu6b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022578\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/AGHAu6b.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you think?
