I saw a video on some guy\u0027s YouTube channel of some things he was doing in KSP. He had mechjeb installed and he showed how his mechjeb vehicles had range and how it could be broken. It was further explained that with the addition of satellites the range could be increased as the vehicle could use them as a relay. Is this a native feature in mechjeb or a combination of another mod? I installed mechjeb but didn\u0027t notice anything satellite related, but perhaps I just didn\u0027t look hard enough. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"winged_wolf","CreatedById":46637,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-04T20:50:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry just needed to clarify that by \u0022range\u0022 I intended it to relate to range for control input.
