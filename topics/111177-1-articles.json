I was doing what was supposed to be a normal orbital mission with Jeb, but, long story short, he went out on EVA and accidentally bumped the craft, sending it gyrating away. (More info here: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123449-Jeb-s-Orbital-Adventure?p=1979058#post1979058\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/123449-Jeb-s-Orbital-Adventure?p=1979058#post1979058\u003C/a\u003E) Trying to get it back, to no avail, he used up all of his EVA propellant.. So now, thanks to suggestions, I will send out an unmanned craft with a probe for him, but no RCS! Dman told me I should make a challenge, (Thanks Dman!) and now I will! I would like some art for a banner and sigpic for this challenge. Nothing too complex, perhaps just Jeb and a craft in orbit of Kerbin, and some text saying what the challenge is. Most things work, and thank you in advance!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
