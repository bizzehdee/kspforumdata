Complexity and failure rate\n\nokay each part adds complexity to a craft. the higher complexity the higher failure rate,\n\n engineers reduce complexity by 25% per engineer.\n\n2. failure types\n\nRapid Unplanned disassembly aka engine go boom, from overheat due to loss of coolant, pressure too low, etc.\n\nsolar panel stuck, plain and simple...\n\ndecoupler failure, decoupler breaks into semi circle and may stick to craft or fall awry at a later stage in flight.\n\nfairing half deploy,again very simply fairy only partially deployed.\n\n3.complexity change...\n\nas stages drop so does complexity.\n\n4.Sliders\n\ndifficulty options for failure rate.\n\n5. improvements \n\nas the scientist kerbalnaut uses a part more [uses it in flight while in craft] the complexity will very slowly drop.\n\n6.pilot error...\n\n in the first few flights of a kerbalnaut they may turn off your control, and it will be useful for a override switch aka probe core.\n\n7. training\n\nabout 6,... this will give another reason for planes as it will train them and will be useful for crewed missions later on\n\nas you dont need an override for a apollo mission...\n\n8.

Not when a six year mission to Laythe could be ruined by a string of pure RNG.\n\nIf you want random failure, this is how I\u0027d do it:\n\nAssign every individual part a number between 0 and 30 when you spawn it. Whenever the game checks a part\u0027s Maximum Temperature, Impact Tolerance or Maximum Speed, instead add that number as a percentage before you perform the check. For example, a RoveMax Model M1 wheel has a known heat tolerance of 1200K, impact tolerance of 50 m/s and speed tolerance of 60 m/s, but if you\u0027re lucky it could be anything up to 1560K, 65 m/s and 78 m/s. If you feel like pushing your luck you can take advantage of that, but if you try to push the parts above their recommended tolerances it might blow up in your face."},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T18:27:54Z","Content":"Random failure would be a no go for me too.\n\nI like Grumman\u0027s idea of \u0027random increased toughness\u0027 if an element of randomness were to be included.

There is nothing to be gained from knowing what failed other than \u0022RNG KILLED IT SON!\u0022.\n\nAs for the Falcon 9, KSP doesn\u0027t have the tools to replicate the failsafe for that (Opposite engine shutting off automatically) and besides, IRL those are mechanical failures only very rarely arbitrary in nature (Not enough maintenance, shoddy construction, GLORIOUS RUSSIAN PROGRAMMING, etc).\n\nWith this it\u0027s just hoping RNG doesn\u0027t mess with your flight .
