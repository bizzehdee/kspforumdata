Not when a six year mission to Laythe could be ruined by a string of pure RNG.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want random failure, this is how I\u0027d do it:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssign every individual part a number between 0 and 30 when you spawn it. Whenever the game checks a part\u0027s Maximum Temperature, Impact Tolerance or Maximum Speed, instead add that number as a percentage before you perform the check. For example, a RoveMax Model M1 wheel has a known heat tolerance of 1200K, impact tolerance of 50 m/s and speed tolerance of 60 m/s, but if you\u0027re lucky it could be anything up to 1560K, 65 m/s and 78 m/s. If you feel like pushing your luck you can take advantage of that, but if you try to push the parts above their recommended tolerances it might blow up in your face.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T18:27:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERandom failure would be a no go for me too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like Grumman\u0027s idea of \u0027random increased toughness\u0027 if an element of randomness were to be included.
