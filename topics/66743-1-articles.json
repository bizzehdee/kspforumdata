How many asteroids can you have tracked at once? I don\u0027t remember seeing anything posted by the developers saying, which is why I ask. In theory I guess it should be \u0022unlimited\u0022, or at least whatever the upper limit is for flights in progress (which I\u0027m pretty sure nobody has ever managed to hit anyway), but just the same, it would be good to know if there\u0027s a definite limit to how many can be tracked at once.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dedjal","CreatedById":57220,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T19:19:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Econsidering 32 bit memory limits.
