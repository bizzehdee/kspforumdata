I know how to make an easy and fast multilayer program (using Python sockets, doesn\u0027t matter if you don\u0027t know what these are) but I have no programming knowledge whatsoever in C, C\u002B\u002B, or C#, so I was wondering if anyone thinks it would be possible to make a multiplayer \u0022add-on\u0022 for Kerbal Space Program that would run as a separate program. I was playing around with a few Ideas that possibly the program could \u0022file sync\u0022 both KSP saves which would in a way make it multiplayer, but I have no way of making the save file \u0022live\u0022. In other words, the save file updates automatically as you play.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this is a community project for a reason, would anyone be interested in making a plugin for KSP that my program could use to make the game multiplayer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure how exactly to do this so please post your ideas, and maybe if we figure out how to make this possible, we can start developing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oicani","CreatedById":15361,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T05:14:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHas already been done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T05:37:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBetter yet, merge them so all the unique ships end up in both saves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Suzaku","CreatedById":40800,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T06:25:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStill want real multiplayer, not some synched save singleplayer bs.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parker","CreatedById":32577,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T19:48:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Oicani\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Oicani\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHas already been done.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECool, do you think you can post a link?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ElJugador","CreatedById":18783,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T19:48:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/8610-0-14-0-16-Kessler-asynchronous-shared-world-multiplayer-%28-save-editor%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/8610-0-14-0-16-Kessler-asynchronous-shared-world-multiplayer-%28-save-editor%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E^\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYep, like oicani said: already been done unless this is actual multiplayer instead of just save synchronization\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parker","CreatedById":32577,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T19:49:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Suzaku\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Suzaku\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EStill want real multiplayer, not some synched save singleplayer bs.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, it kinda sucks, but this is all we can really do.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Parker","CreatedById":32577,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T16:32:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif anybody can find a way to make it a LIVE update instead of a file sync that would be wonderful, and I could make the actual server to transmit the data\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkwolfpaw54","CreatedById":37377,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T20:09:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Emutiplayer would be awsome so i can go to da mun with my brother :3 o yea the kessler dont have that DANG IT \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E thats sad;.; i cant go with my buds. thats my point\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deker13","CreatedById":43554,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-29T20:40:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethis would be epic and the system el is not quite multiplayer its syncing game sessions and not actual live gameplay like dogfights.(oh dogfights how i love u \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"darkwolfpaw54","CreatedById":37377,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T00:34:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyea so theres more ksp movies like the falling star and kerbals at war maybe apllo :3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kristopherr","CreatedById":44805,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-30T19:40:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy not just have a separate server app?
