Not for me. I went from load times that took a couple minutes to the current load time of about 15 minutes. ![;.;](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif)\n\nI have a Steam installation, which has never given me problems, and verified it installed in the usual location. No other games are showing increased load times, just KSP.\n\nThe game runs great once fully loaded, and screen switching in-game is normal or possibly quicker than it was before.\n\nHappening to anyone else?\n\nLittle help?\n\nThanks in advance!"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T18:54:32Z","Content":"Can you please see the support stickies Knorf, we\u0027ll need your game logs, they may help to figure out what\u0027s going on ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"}]}
