I believe RT is the most likely cause.  I believe RT modifies all the stock antennas and dishes and adds a couple new ones.  I am guessing that they messed up the way EC usage is reported.  I have left a link to this post in the RT forum in the hopes it can be resolved as I do not want to scrap RT or AMPYEAR and I find RT useless of I cannot compute EC usage.\n\nI saw a bug report of this exact problem saying that there was an issue where RT was causing antennas not to report ec usage in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003Evab\u003C/abbr\u003E.
