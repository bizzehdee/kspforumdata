With careful planning, enough of the tree will be unlocked to build a proper two stage orbiter or three stage lunar orbiter. Designs should remain simple, no Wackjob style monsters. (Later career budgets would prevent such construction). For balance, two Goo pods can be placed on the capsule of just below it since recovery is needed for full science credit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the first test of career, it works quite well although I would have preferred to start the space program out with launching and recovering probes before committing to manned flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v5iuW4p.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022v5iuW4p.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/zUCLXGU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022zUCLXGU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/cfd0Euk.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022cfd0Euk.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-19T12:52:34Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2013 12:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by SRV Ron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flock of Panthers","CreatedById":60349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T20:59:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECould anyone tell me what I need to change to make transmitting experiments from certain parts impossible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to set it up so that Goo/Samples/Science Jr\u0027s have to be returned to get anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kromey","CreatedById":57375,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T23:10:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Gus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Gus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETo slow your progress, limit yourself in these ways:\u003Cp\u003EAllow yourself to transmit data from an observation ONLY ONCE.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAllow yourself to research ONLY ONE (or 2) new tech(s) after each mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve already been doing these, although perhaps a slightly modified version of the first: only once \u003Cem\u003Eper mission\u003C/em\u003E. So e.g. a second sub-orbital mission could legitimately transmit a crew report identical to one the first sent, however the same mission can\u0027t re-send (\u0022spam\u0022, as I think of it) the same report again. I also don\u0027t transmit results from Goo or Science Jr., although when I start doing one-way unmanned missions I may allow one such transmission per mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdditionally, I\u0027m limiting myself to what I feel is a logical progression for a space program: Did a couple sub-orbital flights to learn the basics of rocketry, then did an orbital mission that re-entered after almost exactly one orbit (Mission Control done screwed up the timing of the re-entry burn, neglecting to account for basic principles such as \u0022Kerbin rotates\u0022, and thus landing the capsule far to the west of the KSC rather than aiming right for it as was the intention -- which learning such things is why we take slow and deliberate steps like this!). A few more orbital missions to refine orbital injections (and learn to avoid the highly elliptical and ovoid orbit the first ended up in), then we\u0027ll be off to some Munar and the Minmus-ar fly-byes, then tackle some land-and-return missions, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI intend to send unmanned probes to any interplanetary destination I want to head toward, as well, so I won\u0027t be leaving Kerbin\u0027s local system at least until I\u0027ve unlocked probe cores, although there will certainly be more than enough to do around here until then, and well beyond I\u0027m sure!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m sure I could have orbited Kerbin and perhaps even gotten (at the least) a free-return trajectory around Mun by Tier 2 (maybe Tier 1, but only with a huge amount of trial-and-error, heavy on the error!!), it\u0027s just not a plausible progression for me. Maybe once I \u0022complete\u0022 career mode once I\u0027ll start a new one and set challenges like that for myself, but for now I\u0027m happy advancing as I am.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
