Now yes it is science fiction in the sense that it takes place in the not so distant future and it has not actually happened. However for anyone who has read it Andy Weir has gone through painstaking effort to ensure the realism of this book. The ships, the infrastructure, the characters, the situation are all very possible and stay well within reality while at the same time being extremely compelling. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow since it is such a great story hollywood has sunk its ravenous teeth into this story. Obviously they are interested in it because it is a unique story and the ability to create a film that isn\u0027t a remake or derivative is an exciting prospect. It is or was directed by Ridley Scott and will star Matt Damon as Mark Watney, basically the exact opposite of his character in Interstellar *spoiler*. So I guess this is a book club discussion page? What are your thoughts? Have you read the book? Do you want to read the book? Are you excited about the movie? What do you think of the cast?

I\u0027m a cynic, but big productions in film and music (and probably other mediums) are hardly ever about the art itself, or at least rarely so. I recognize it is entirely possible to create an amazing piece of art while employing the famous stars, but it seems to me that that truly great works of art are usually more underground.
