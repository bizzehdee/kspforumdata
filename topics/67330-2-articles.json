Many, many game companies will set a release date, work their asses off to get make it, fall short, and either cut content or sacrifice quality to release on time. They could release a version that was bug-riddled and come back with updates to the patch in a few weeks. Other companies do that. Think of EA with the shoddy release of SimCity on schedule. It suffered for months afterwards in both quality and with public opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the delay is inconvenient.

Obviously, it could be said that it is my own fault for watching videos/reading posts that contain these spoilers, but I was looking for a couple of new parts, and a showing of some of the asteroids.

I would enjoy it when an update would contain things that we have to go out and discover. Like the eastereggs and the fact you can climb the flag pole at KSC. With the 0.23.5 it could have been that the asteroid classes would not have been made public with the showcasing.

The way I\u0027ve put it in my posts kind of makes me seem guilty of doing this, too, but I\u0027m understanding of the situation and aren\u0027t going to be begrudging about it.

For me, too, this is the worst part. It\u0027s the fact that they\u0027re so unavoidable that makes them bad - you would think that you could just not watch the video, when in fact you know that there are things on the video that you \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E want to see. The issue is that different people want different levels of spoiler. Personally, I like to have a couple of things spoiled - say, 20% of the update - so that I can see that there\u0027s some pretty awesome things coming but still have plenty to find out for myself. On the other hand, I like to hear about everything that\u0027s coming but not in detail. Just a passing mention would be nice, such as \u0022oh, hey, we\u0027re doing something with asteroids, and you\u0027re going to get something that you can use to attach pretty much anything to anything. You can find out about that when you get the update. We also have some SLS parts, thanks to NASA, which means that the old 2.5m parts are no longer the biggest in the game...\u0022. This is just the right amount of spoiler for me: it outlines what\u0027s there but doesn\u0027t detail it.
