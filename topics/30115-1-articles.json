Please note I saw another note on the same problem, only one post in the thread so there are others having the trouble. I NOT ONLY NEED SOME HELP, I MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER SOME AND HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I have something to say about this one and some questions. I have tried the \u0022V\u0022 camera settings. Caps Lock has no effect that I can tell. F12 debug does show some graphics errors and that may be the problem. What kind of video driver are you running beeblebrox? Are you running a mouse? I know about \u0022R\u0022 and I think jetting then going back to walk mode will fix the spin but lock the facing direction. I have found that \u0022H\u0022 has a repeatable effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIntermittently the Kirbal walking on the surface either will only walk in one direction or it will only spin around. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESolution for spin: I have no idea because it is not repeatable but I have gotten that to switch to the walking in one direction problem a couple of times, just can\u0027t make it repeatable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPartial Solution for walking in one direction: The problem of walking in one direction can consistently be fixed by pressing the \u0022H\u0022 key but not entirely. The W-S-A-D keys all send him in the right direction but he will never turn and only faces the direction in which he was stuck. (Yes I know that H is used with RCS but I have not been able to work out a link to this problem.) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have seen this one time before but it quit doing it. I think it was about a week ago and that bothers me because I did not document it as being .19.1 or .2.0, or .2.2 but I have no doubt it has done it on .2.0 and .2.2. I suspected mods since I have loaded several and written some that are to primitive to share at this time so I set up a clean install and it still happens. I have my joystick set up and I suspect that because the first time I saw the problem a couple of weeks ago it was when I did some joystick moves, that did not do what they were supposed too, so I switched back to the keyboard. I thought that may have been the root of the problem tonight so I took it off the system but still have Kerbals at my first anomaly on Duna and they are walk impaired. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just downloaded the latest NVidia Gforce driver and next time I loaded I had the problem but I have been mapping the last three days and have not tried an EVA so it may not be related.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running Windows 7 64 bit Professional on an i7 with 16 GB of RAM and the game is on an SSD.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bang_coi","CreatedById":60934,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T09:25:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA picture would help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rod4Rodger","CreatedById":64406,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-31T10:22:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not what sure you want me to photograph.
