Once the mission proper is underway, if I need to revise the design I\u0027ll have to fly a new rover to the crew before they starve (not a serious issue in Kerbin\u0027s SOI, of course).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to attempt the circumnavigation itself entirely in IVA, or looking through a Hullcam VDS camera, or in Hullcam\u0027s first-person EVA mode.

I\u0027m not convinced by the rover body; radial parts don\u0027t attach to it neatly. If I were going for a complete redesign, I\u0027d probably build the usual sort of girder shell. The tracks seem pretty effective, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EValentina Kermana (pilot) will drive from the Mk I pod, but Sally Kerman (science) will command from the foremost inline pod with its superior view. Valentina is, however, able to use an Aerocam under the nose of the pod and a fore-and-aft Boostercam on top of the rover. The rear pod is for Svetlana Kermana (engineer). The \u0022top deck\u0022 of the rover also has two external command seats, which Sally and Svetlana may wish to use when Valentina has learned how not to roll it all the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo Kerbal Foundries skids under the nose and stern of the rover let it traverse changes in terrain without scraping off the Aerocam or rear-mounted parts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rear part of the rover contains a reaction wheel, life support supplies, a docking port, a 4-wedge Universal Storage core, and a kOS processor.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Universal Storage core has an Kerbal Inventory System wedge with spare parts for the more easily broken extremities, and also a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, a water electrolyser, and a supply of hydrogen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe kOS processor is intended to serve two purposes. One is to detect and control rolls; if the rover tips beyond a certain angle, kOS will level it out with the reaction wheel. The second is to monitor the electricity supply, using the fuel cell when charge is needed and the electrolyser when there is an excess (and capacity for more hydrogen and oxygen). I hope this arrangement combined with the large battery capacity of the rover body will let me drive through Minmus\u0027s short nights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe docking port will attach it to the Minmus landing stage, which will belly-flop to lower the rover to the ground - this should be a safe maneuver in Minmus\u0027s gentle gravity. The rover is not intended to return to Kerbin; Jebediah will bring a separate 4-kosmonaut return vessel to pick up the rover\u0027s crew when the mission is complete.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T03:10:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESnazzy ride \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Good luck with it!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERoving on Minmus has always been a huge challenge for me.

The SRBs are attached with Space-Y rocket decouplers, so even if the abort switch is pressed with them still burning, there\u0027s a good chance of getting away with it. The middle engine is a Modular Rocket Systems quad-LV-N - I\u0027ve no wish for my transfer burn to take all week. When the boosters are lit, it\u0027s really, really loud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe whole craft is a bit overengineered, really; VOID has the dV hilariously wrong. I got down to Minmus with about 3.5 km/s to spare, and I wasn\u0027t intending to use the lander for the return trip, to boot. Another issue is that the lander is not well-balanced; throughout burns, MechJeb was having to adjust the pitch to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the fairing is in two parts, ditchable independently, the crew transfer out of the command pod after the circularisation burn was easy - jettison one half to expose the rover, then the other.

I see however, that it\u0027s mounted on a US wedge. According to the documentation (and when I asked the mod authors about it once), those wedges are modeled in such a way that they treat the wedge structure as a radiator, particularly for their processors which have heat generation. So it could be that. Had a craft once that also had US wedges, mounted onto a structural adapter that was then mounted to a girder. First, the US core heated up, especially when I ran the fuel cell I had there, then the girder acted like damerell\u0027s RTG on his craft. So either there\u0027s a processor running there, or the wedges are soaking up and passing down heat from the rest of the craft into the RTG. And depending on the RTG\u0027s own heat dynamics values, it might be taking in the heat and finding no place else to put it in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHell, for a moment, I thought that my US-powered electric minichopper would blow up (the girder was the structural fuselage, and hence why I asked the US guys about it).

Well, Minmus is really not very big; curiously, indeed, the circumference of Minmus is almost exactly the furthest I ever rode a bicycle in a day, so there was certainly time to zip around it in a rover. However, the trip was a bit of a comedy of errors. I\u0027ve skipped some routine flag-planting pictures at the start to get straight to the things that went wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, the kOS script I wrote to manage the fuel cell and electrolyser worked perfectly. Hooray! It wasn\u0027t really necessary, though; the rover had huge reserves, the power demand was modest because of the low rolling resistance on Minmus and the ease of going uphill, and the solar generation capacity produced an overall surplus through a day-night cycle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe part of the kOS script that detected excessive roll also worked nicely. The part that corrected it did not, even after a few pre-launch design iterations, producing the occasional catastrophic feedback roll. This scraped off the RTG (mind you, it was going to blow up anyway), the deployable solar panels (bother), and the docking port used to release the rover after landing (who cares). The right tool to use for this is the MechJeb rover autopilot\u0027s \u0022stability control\u0022, which turns out to try and turn the underside of your rover towards the ground (accounting for the local topography) at all times. The one downside is that it won\u0027t let you put on the brakes (why not, we ask). After the second wild spin, I switched to using that, experimenting on the way with a \u0022panic\u0022 MechJeb surface SmartASS system - heading 90, 0 pitch, 0 roll. The stability control is better, though - really good at keeping the tracks on the ground whenever possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA second interesting fact I learned was that when you see an odd grey patch in the ground that looks almost like a split in it, don\u0027t drive over it because it is in fact a split in the ground and will fire you into the air stripping a few more parts off your rover. Here I am going for a little flying lesson, having lost the electrolyser and nearly all the hydrogen for the fuel cell.

If the mission hadn\u0027t been so close to the pickup point on such a tiny world, there might have been cause for concern, especially since kerbals seem (understandably, if lazily) to consume whatever supplies are closest to them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, we did get some good out of the command seats on the top platform:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/minmus-8-success.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~damerell/games/ksp/minmus-8-success-small.png\u0022 alt=\u0022minmus-8-success-small.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven their delighted expressions, I can only presume Valentina was not popular with the two survivors, alas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the misgiving. The Kerbal Foundries tracks and rover body were robust enough to withstand the various en-route catastrophes. They might have been anyway (some stock wheels have very large crash resistance figures) but it turns out nearly all KF parts have crash and structural figures that make them basically indestructible. I\u0027m happy enough with this circumnavigation - I didn\u0027t know that my tracks were indestructible when I set out - but before I do another I\u0027ll have to adjust them to something more reasonable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesign notes on the rover:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe KF tracks performed well. The KF rover body was not so satisfactory. It holds a lot of electric charge, but anything sticking out its ends is practically asking to get snapped off, being almost flush to the ground. It\u0027s also an awkward shape, making it hard to attach equipment radially. That\u0027s one reason for the control platform. For a Mk II rover, I\u0027d use a conventional assembly of struts and panels... with a rollcage, if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EkOS can detect critical rolls well enough; what it ought to do when it does is to retract equipment like deployable solar panels. It might not stow them in time, but it\u0027s worth a go, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Universal Storage parts are particularly fragile and should be mounted somewhere better protected.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESetting off with non-working cameras was highly unsatisfactory. I thought I had removed every camera, saved the ship, reloaded, added cameras... but nothing seemed to help. This needs further investigation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfernal Robotics could be used to raise and lower a camera boom for a very high vantage point, and allow it to look around freely. Also, once I\u0027d figured out the stability control, crew could and should have used the external command seats for a higher viewpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIR could also provide self-righting for rovers on higher gravity worlds where you can\u0027t just roll over with reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore testing of headlights (particularly going up/down hills), and more action groups to control exactly which ones are on. Minmus\u0027s albedo varies dramatically; at times, two headlights were too many up close.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s obvious in retrospect that before landing it\u0027s worth doing a complete SCANsat altimetry scan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the cheap OX-STAT panels that survived the trip unscathed, not the deployable panels, the RTG, or the fuel cell - and provided enough electricity for the entire journey. Part count is obviously a concern, but fitting a few and having a few more in KIS storage can\u0027t hurt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t forget your KIS inventory next time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t charge around at 55m/s... or possibly, write some sort of kOS function for detecting we have driven off a cliff and taking appropriate action.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-08T03:53:17Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2015 03:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by damerell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stellarator","CreatedById":92423,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T17:36:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like very much that design...
