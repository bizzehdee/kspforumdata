If it looks like Kal is a moon of Ganag, uninstall K\u002B and reinstall it again, as 2.3.8 seems to have jettisoned a lot of the 2.3.5 files entirely. The correct arrangement should be Ganag and Kal orbiting around a common barycentre.\n\nAlso, (and this is not a plea for a bugfix as I know amarius is on holiday and doesn\u0027t want to think about this, which is fine) why do the planets between Duna and Jool have such high gravity? Valit (0.55g [EDIT: 0.8g?!] or something like that) is smaller than Duna (0.3g) and yet only the latter has an atmosphere. I can take Pergas - it\u0027s got an atmosphere, so I can just say it\u0027s made of lead or something like that - but what\u0027s going on with Valit (and a few others, for that matter)?\n\nEDIT: The entire Sarvin system is fine, as are Faz and Vix, and possibly some of the moons of Keelon. All of the other bodies have weird gravity values. I understand some of them - Keelon is supposed to be supermassive, after all - but not all of them. Corolet, for example.
