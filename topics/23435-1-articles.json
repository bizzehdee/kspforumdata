If you\u0027re limited to that speed at 30km, then I would suggest trying to cut some mass, which will also help your maneuverability. At that altitude you\u0027re barely in the atmosphere anymore, so your control surfaces won\u0027t work very well. Vectoring engines are helpful, but really, control pod torque should be enough to change the attitude of your plane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you turning off avionics at that point? If not, you should try doing so, since it will dampen any changes you try to make.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs your rocket engine(s) off axis vertically? If the thrust vector for the rockets doesn\u0027t go through the center of mass, then it\u0027s going to cause a torque toward the opposite side, which might be what\u0027s keeping you from going up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-22T03:53:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou might have better luck posting a picture of the craft and/or the craft file itself.

Turns out it was just that I had installed extra engines below the centre of mass of the craft and the resulting torque was quite annoying. I found that adding RCS helped out quite a bit, as at high altitudes control surfaces become suggestion surfaces, they just suggest which direction your plane should point, and it goes where it will. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
