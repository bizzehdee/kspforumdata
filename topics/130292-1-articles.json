But I\u0027ve got a problem on reentry. The shuttle looses its lift and then falls to the ground with a back first. Usually I\u0027d say, CoM behind CoL, but I made sure that this is not the case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I took a look at the aero overlay. And on some occasions there\u0027s a cyan vector appearing and if that happens the spin starts. As if there\u0027s another lifting surface which you don\u0027t see in the editor.

You can see in the second and third picture that the wings do what they should. Now on pancake manouvers you see the cyan vectors appear, which seem then to get bigger than the lift. On fourth and fifth image the shuttle has spun out of control and is falling down with it\u0027s back, although the mass should push the nose down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is it?
