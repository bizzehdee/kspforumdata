Just a small wobble at one end can cause havoc at the other end. You\u0027ll need some kind of flexible joint every few meters (test how much you need) to absorb stress. Maybe a U-shaped line with uncontrolled IR joints could do the job.

Structures up to 1 km have been built but more should be possible. The upper end is probably marked by one of the following limits:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- end of physics bubble around the CoM of the active vessel (2.5 km in most cases)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- decreasing position, angular and velocity precision (the further out the worse it becomes)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- KSP recenters the point of origin of the global coordinate system to the center of your vessel if it moves 6? km away from it. That means the universe moves, not your craft. The game does it to increase precision of all calculations (see the point above this one).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I once saw a video of the devs where they showed that at about 20 km away from the center of the coordinate system phantom forces will appear and start shaking your craft. At about 60 km or so even simple crafts (1x pod, 1x tank, 1x engine) will start to disassemble because of that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Every terrain in the game has 10 detail levels (LOD - level of detail). They become visible depending on the distance of the camera and the terrain. The closer you get the more details are shown and vice versa. I don\u0027t know the distances at which LOD switch. It could be only 10 km between the highest LOD and the second highest one. This means the terrain will change heights and your pipes either fall down because they are in mid-air or simple disintegrate when they are now underground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess you shouldn\u0027t build a pipeline with a length of more than about 5 km.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E40 km?
