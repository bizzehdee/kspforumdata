Anyways! Seeing as I can hardly get anything into orbit, I\u0027m using pre-made \u0022Scenarios\u0022. The refueling outpost, to be exact. I noticed a spacecraft attached to the station and did an EVA to get one of my Kerbal\u0027s into the spacecraft. Now, I\u0027m confused as to how I can control it/detach it from the station? I tried igniting the engines via \u0022SPACE\u0027 and other things, but it still is in control of the station. I would love some help here.
