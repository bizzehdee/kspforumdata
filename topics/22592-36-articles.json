Now I \u003Cstrong\u003Eguess\u003C/strong\u003E I could transfer it somehow to 0.22 (asssuming there won\u0027t be problems with some parts and some of them are from 0.18) but this would erase all the traces of \u0022Protues\u0022 journey - flags, debris, vehicles and probes and of course planets configuration which is obviously different in a starting date (Year 1 Day 1). There are some ways to make it work (timewarp and set every thing on a correct orbit in a correct time using HyperEdit) but it would take a lot of time I would prefer to spend on other things like writing for instance. I\u0027ve a lot of crushes recently when I\u0027m playing the Grand Tour however, so I\u0027m considering doing it anyways.
