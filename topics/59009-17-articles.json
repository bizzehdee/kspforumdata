I picked up a survey contract that wanted three different experiments transmitted/recovered, but I already had collected 100% of the science for one of those experiments (low mun orbit temperature, if it matters). I\u0027m guessing that what happened was the contract was generated and available before I completed the mission that collected the science, then after completing that mission I accepted the contract with the now-outdated parameter.
