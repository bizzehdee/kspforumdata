The last stage is used to circularize the orbit, so they produce some space litter, unfortunately. Again, this is just with tier 1 rocketry/SRB. The 6 x SRB\u0027s get it off the ground, and the TWR of the main engine improves enough to accelerate after 15 seconds or so- if I fire it and the boosters at the same time my TWR is way to high and it\u0027s not controllable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/bPKn6Hm.png\u0022 alt=\u0022bPKn6Hm.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my first functional and sustaining satellite, which I put up using an improved version of the above launcher. It barely makes enough power to recharge after the night, and I can\u0027t really fine tune the orbit so it\u0027s stuck in a 100 x 3000 km orbit, but it\u0027s already given me some windows of contact with mission control in other probe flights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/isX7o4Z.png\u0022 alt=\u0022isX7o4Z.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is the beefed up version of the first launcher, used to put up the comm satellite.

It sort of works for Tree Edit, but messes up with Tree loader. So I\u0027d have to have all of them loaded and save the tree, then I could remove them as I wouldn\u0027t be using them myself. Also, engines which aren\u0027t part of the rebalance will definitely through the balance off of the tree/progression.\u003Cp\u003EB9 isn\u0027t just wings and control surfaces from what I understand.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMM tweak files work fine for parts which are not specifically assigned in the tree - that\u0027s how I\u0027ve been using a LOT of the mods that I have which are not supported in various trees. The trick is that they have to be assigned to a node (in the MM cfg tweak) which actually exists in the tree. This works great for trees where the stock nodes are just moved in location/cost but still have the same basic purpose, but less well for trees like yours where the stock nodes are almost completely repurposed. Thus why I had to make a set of MM config files for B9 and Firespitter (and a few other choice mods) specifically designed to work with your tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the most reliable method is indeed to do as you suggest, load the mods yourself prior to final save of the tree, save the tree, then remove the mods if you don\u0027t want to continue using them. Shouldn\u0027t be too much of a concern though if you are willing to do that extra step, as you can load in 1/4 res just for the editor save which should leave you plenty of memory still. Alternatively, you could just have a separate \u0022TreeEdit Building Install\u0022 install of KSP entirely, separate from your \u0022Personal Play\u0022 install (which could also be useful for testing the mod from the perspective of an end user too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the balance issues themselves, both of those mods packs do install additional engines, RCS, etc. which is why I said that the one(s) you chose would change the way that the tree would have to be balanced (or end up with \u0022empty\u0022 nodes in some cases, like without Firespitter you would have no need for a notional Piston Propeller Engines node \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E) However, they should not throw off the balance of the current parts for the rocketry side of things with a few very minor exceptions which could just be added to the current appropriate nodes (like the larger fuselages which can carry rocket fuel would be placed in the appropriate node on the rocketry side of things, instead of in the aviation branch of the tree - which would only have the fuel tanks for jet fuel. And yes, even with MFSC installed, the different fuselages are \u0022intelligent\u0022 and the \u0022Jet Fuel\u0022 tanks/fuselages can\u0027t hold any of the oxidizers \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) The one exception to this that comes to mind off the top of my head is the SABRE engine, especially in its current incarnation where it is more vacuum efficient than the previous versions of the mod. If it would be possible to have your currently proposed shuttle node or something similar also have a rocketry requirement (might be hard with the current tree organization) then this could be solved that way - or it could just be assumed that by the time someone has the highest tier of rocketry research then they can be given semi-\u0022free\u0022 jet technology just for that engine only and make it fit into your existing tree structure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only potential balance issue would be if someone was really focused on building an SSTO from the very beginning, and spent an extensive amount of time/science towards getting the upper end air-breathing engines, cockpits, aerodynamic surfaces, and fuselages and stuck with low-end rockets for orbital maneuvers with \u0022narrow\u0022 tanks. This might change a bit of the balance around but personally (having tried similar in a different tree that separates the aviation and rocketry branches) it is EXTREMELY hard to do well without the other \u0022normal\u0022 rocketry advances and structural advances, and honestly if someone chooses to put in the extra effort required to do so I think it\u0027s a perfectly reasonable \u0022alternate\u0022 route to space for them to be \u0022allowed\u0022 to pursue. But that is of course your choice as the developer of the mod \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll work on two sets of \u0022tech sets\u0022 for you, one which includes a listing with just stock/NP/KW (which I\u0027m going to install again at least to get the parts in the right places for you) - and one which is designed to be used with the above \u002B firespitter and b9 (as I think most aviation enthusiasts - like myself - will likely have both of those packs installed rather than just one or the other). Then you can choose which one you want to use and which one not as you like (and if you stick with just the stock\u002BNP\u002BKW set I can just keep using my current MM tweak files modified slightly for the new node names/locations).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: BTW, there is one other balance issue that comes to mind, but it\u0027s entirely tech-tree independent and has more to do with FAR - B9 and Firespitter both give MUCH better control surface options available for use as rocket fins than having to use a dozen or so of the stock canards/winglets. That\u0027s actually what prompted me to install B9 in the first place, was to get the new winglets and other control surface systems integrated in the wings for use with FAR, since my performance limitations are primarily part-count related rather than memory-footprint related issues. So with either of those packs installed people would have the ability to use larger lifting surfaces with integrated controls as rocket fins, which does have a slight actual performance advantage on very large rockets in terms of weight and dV numbers for launch as well - but even then, the difference is only 50-100 m/s dV savings from the slightly added lift for less weight than just using stock controls and that only really applies to the very large rockets which would otherwise be using 12-20 of the smaller stock control surfaces instead.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-26T03:41:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/26/2013 03:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 26, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RaccoonTOF\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"funfight22","CreatedById":22861,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-26T03:44:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not really able to get enough science.

With a little bit of RCS (or powerful rotational wheels), I actually brought a series of com satellites into orbit with only the orbiter using liquid fuel. A two-staged launch vehicle composed of precisely tuned SRB sizes and thrust levels make for one of the most efficient ascents when you still are early in this tech tree (and use the Realism Overhaul etc.) . First stage being responsible to bring you up to higher atmosphere, second stage using a much lower thrust and using \u0022vacuum stretchySRB\u0022 with the better ISP gives plenty of power to almost complete circularization. Considering their simplicity, I\u0027ll probably reuse this approach with 3\u002B stages once payload mass increases.
