Try deleting the RealPlume compatibility patch by deleting \u0022ShadowWorks/Compatibility/RealPlume\u0022, then delete your ModuleManager cache and restart KSP.

I\u0027ve never used Duna Direct, so I had a quick look at the mod\u0027s opening post.  It says to launch in a 5m expanded fairing, and the core stage and EUS in this mod is 5m, and a 5m fairing base is also included.  The 5m Fairing Base uses the stock fairing module so you shouldn\u0027t have any problems there I\u0027d imagine.  I assume that the mass of the Duna Direct vehicle wouldn\u0027t be an issue, but you could always use the Block II SLS with the Black Knight boosters, or with the liquid boosters."},{"CreatedByName":"Cloakedwand72","CreatedById":38144,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-29T22:46:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 1/28/2022 at 2:56 PM, TheShadow1138 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E The \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s are set up just like the stock \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s, no thrust curves or special mods, so they probably are a bit over powered.

It simply replaces the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E with the proposed F-1B powered liquid booster for the SLS.  To build it yourself from the Ares I (Apophis I), simply remove the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E and adapter from the interstage decoupler.  Then, place the Anubis Liquid Booster Tank on the bottom of the interstage decoupler, then attach two F-1B engines and you\u0027re good to go."}]}
