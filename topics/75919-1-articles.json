I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been playing KSP for about a year now, and it has been a very, very fun rocket-fueled ride. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve flown a lot of the more ubiquitous missions, building a space station and sending a few rockets to the Mun and Minmus. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve also launched an interplanetary probe to Duna in my career-mode save in desperate pursuit of science!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been spending most of my time playing with spaceplanes though. I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think too much of spaceplanes while I was struggling through my first few SSTOs, but I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve come to really appreciate them. I even got the idea to try to make a spaceplane that carries cargo. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d seen a few spaceplanes that could carry cargo on the forum, but it seems like they are uncommon for a reason. Wow, that was a hard project. It took me a long time to get a spaceplane that could carry small probes to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Have any of you had the urge to experiment with crazy spaceplanes? I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m always amazed by the things people on this forum come up with, so I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2d be really interested to hear about any crazy designs you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working with.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"I.T Marcus","CreatedById":86085,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T17:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell I built a small shuttle-thing called \u0022Hermes\u0022 (after the greek messenger god) this was it\u0027s name because he was built to carry cargo from my LKO space station to my Kerbosynchronous \u0022Olympus\u0022 space station.... it had a really big and square hole in the middle of it with a docking clamp inside.... it looked very strange..... sorry no screens, I deleted my save (I do that a lot for some reason)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-26T07:42:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi, and welcome!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, large spaceplanes are a bit uncommon, especially stock ones.

I normally end up calling the first few versions of a new vehicle some weird acronym before I can come up with a decent name for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWas your shuttle vertically launched or horizontally launched? I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t experimented with a lot of vertically-launched spaceplanes yet. Side mounting the vehicle like the Space Shuttle was configured is really, really hard, and putting the spaceplane on top of the rocket tends to cause stability issues for me. I could put bigger fins on the booster, but that makes the booster look bad\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI should probably make a dedicated supply vehicle for my own space station sometime.
