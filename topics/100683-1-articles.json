As you here would eject with the fuel tank you would have plenty of options. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne option is to have one unpressurized cargo only version, this would only be interesting in my scenario where you only dropped the fuel tank. if you drop core or second stage you would be better of with an disposable fairing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T18:19:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
