You would still need the arm but don\u0027t need an so large. Have the option to remove the arm if not needed, say you do an crew and resupply mission to space station, no arm and no eva need so you use that space for supplies. bay can hold an pressurized compartment or unpressurized like dragon trunk. \n\nOne very fun design would be to make this small shuttle with an smaller external tank, now use an first stage who can land again like they try with falcon 9. \n\nSince the shuttle engines are only used as second stage they can be much smaller, benefit over falcon 9 reusable with dragon is that you only drop the second stage fuel tank.\n\nfirst stage can be used with an disposable second stage for heavier payloads. Shuttle can be used unmanned, you can also have an pure cargo version with just an larger cargo bay."},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T10:00:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E everybody knows the space shuttle. but how would YOU design a reuseable, multifunctional crew and payload carrier if you had no insane airforce standards to meet?\n\nI wouldn\u0027t.

The passenger module would still have bottom heat shield.\n\nThis allows you to wrap the bottom part in an fairing if needed and you could use an escape tower. \n\nSecond option is less safe, treat the shuttle as an escape system, it would be smaller and more nimble than SLS and sit on top of an first stage, might put some small SRB on the interface between first stage and shuttle to ensure an fast getaway. As you here would eject with the fuel tank you would have plenty of options. \n\nOne option is to have one unpressurized cargo only version, this would only be interesting in my scenario where you only dropped the fuel tank. if you drop core or second stage you would be better of with an disposable fairing.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-25T18:19:41Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2015 06:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe**"}]}
