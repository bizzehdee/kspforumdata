The engine plumes look as if they had\u00A0shock diamonds in them, but it doesn\u0027t make much sense with rocket engines.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a fixed animation would work better? The engine plume could change and adapt to the pressure instead of having blobs coming out of the engine nozzle. Also the smoke traces could be drawed instead of having particles. What I mean is something like this (except for engines):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00227z8IwSN.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7z8IwSN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the low res.
