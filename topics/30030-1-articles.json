A lot of my ship designs have the payload in front of the command module, and if the payload is long the camera position is a good distance away from the port itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the camera position and the distance from the port itself, its very difficult for me to keep track of all three axis at a time and makes for a long adjustment process getting the ports lined up just right. I usually can track two of them, and find the third has drifted off, adjust that, and then find I\u0027m out of alignment now in one of the first two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf there is an first person view where its like you are looking out of the docking port that would be great, especially if it oriented itself so that it matched your RCS controls. I\u0027ve tried \u0027control from here\u0027 on the docking port but that didn\u0027t seem to do anything useful for the camera angle and positioning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T17:18:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are camera mods that allow this sort of thing. r4m0n has one that I like, though I haven\u0027t messed with it since 0.20 came out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl from here reorients your navball and controls so that the indicated part defines what is up/down/left/right/front/back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"falofonos","CreatedById":57821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T18:23:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/lazor-docking-cam/\u003C/a\u003E\n"}]}
