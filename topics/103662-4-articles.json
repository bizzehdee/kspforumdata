I really, really hope that SQUAD doesn\u0027t try to ship a \u0022finished\u0022 game with water in its current state.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some other placeholders, too:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMany parts\u0027 descriptions (especially the new wing bits) are a measly one sentence long, and contain very little information about the part. These should be expanded: it\u0027s easy to do so, and it would help new players and add a little more polish.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EThe beautiful, cloudy sky that you can see when in the VAB and SPH is a pretty obvious mismatch with the \u0027real\u0027 cloudless sky on Kerbin. I would love SQUAD to either add clouds to Kerbin or remove them from the background of the VAB/SPH. (The latter would be easier, but the former would be very nice.)\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EAlso, it\u0027s always daytime in the VAB and SPH!

I haven\u0027t heard anything about these little things yet, and you guys could probably do each of these in a day or less, with the possible exception of the water one. It would really add to the gameplay experience, show that y\u0027all pay attention to detail, and make it clear that all placeholders in this game are gone.
