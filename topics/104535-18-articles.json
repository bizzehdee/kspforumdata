The mass of the ring is far greater than the mass of the command pod (root part) at the rings hub. Now the mass needs to be considerably different as leverage is also at play here. In the VAB the ring rotates because of which side of the docking washer it is on. In space you aren\u0027t connected to anything. When the Canadarm 2 moves an item around on the ISS. The station is moving in the opposite direction as the payload on the arm. Push the item away you push the entire station away in the opposite direction. But the mass of the station as well as the cushioning of the canadarm\u0027s joints slowly changing speeds is such, it moves very slow / not at all, with a light payload at the end of the Canadarm 2. So in short make the hub / station heavier, the ring lighter. Adjust the acceleration curve of the docking washer, as well as add SAS to the stationary bits. No SAS on the ring and it should work.\n\nI\u0027ve drastically increased the mass of the hub and added a ton of SAS, but the washer is unable to maintain a constant rate of rotation for the ring despite sufficient power being supplied to the washer and the SAS. Both pieces come to a stop every ~45 degrees of rotation.\n\nThank you for your assistance."},{"CreatedByName":"Grumman","CreatedById":76014,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:02:20Z","Content":"Turn off the SAS in those cupolas, for a start. If you have SAS in the hub and no SAS in the ring then *eventually* the SAS will get things rotating the way you want them to, with the hub stationary and the ring moving.\n\nAnother option is to have two contra-rotating rings so that they cancel each other out. You can do it with three bearings, with the middle bearing\u0027s direction reversed and its maximum speed doubled."},{"CreatedByName":"ZodiusInfuser","CreatedById":76163,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T22:09:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve drastically increased the mass of the hub and added a ton of SAS, but the washer is unable to maintain a constant rate of rotation for the ring despite sufficient power being supplied to the washer and the SAS.

I had a suspicion it might have been ATM but because it wasn\u0027t causing an issue with any other mods I didn\u0027t check it. Thank you again for the help I\u0027ll check into that solution and will also as suggested try to inspire the ATM devs to address the issue."}]}
