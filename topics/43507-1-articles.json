My KSP almost always crashed during loading when using only 1,3-1,5GB memory, and when I deleted just the exact number of parts for it to not crash, it was using 2,2GB max when fully loaded. So this was weird, it should be able to use 3,5GB as I understand it. Anyway, it always crashed when something \u0022mk1\u0022 was loading, not sure what exactly, because it was very fast and there is no reference to it in KSP.log. So since I was not using mk1 cockpit or mk1 pod, I deleted them both, with internals as well. It is rather unfortunate to delete stock parts, but it did the trick and I can now use much much more mods, and KSP can run with all those 3,5GB without problem. Maybe there is something bugged with those mk1s? Or they somehow cause crash when used with certain number of mods? Or it\u0027s OS/system related, not sure. Still, hope it helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUbuntu 64-bit\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T16:24:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESquads folder is one of the largest in the directory. And cockpits and there internals take up a nice chunk of memory. So just by deleting those parts you went under the memory limit. Me? Well I butchered squads gamedata folder. I have every major parts pack installed. Everything except KW. Nova, Soviet, American, Home, European, FASA\u0027s Gemini, LazTek\u0027s SpaceX, Kosmos, B9 and... That\u0027s about all I can remember but theres more. And my game data folder is 1.06gb. I strip each and every mod down to its essentials.

No? \u0022 delete.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E A lot of mods have impractical cosmetic parts so they go and squads folder has been reduced by two thirds. It took a long time to run through everything with a fine tooth comb, but my god was it worth it. My game boots in 30 seconds and I probably have one of the most diverse part collection one can imagine. Delete your unused parts. Even the stock ones.
