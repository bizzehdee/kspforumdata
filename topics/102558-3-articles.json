Have an option to display the \u0027outside\u0027 based on time of day, where only the \u0022kerbal made\u0022 lights would be toggled. That way, if it\u0027s night outside it would still show as night outside even inside the VAB/SPH. (Since time doesn\u0027t move in the VAB/SPH, you only have to check it once when the scene loads)\n\n2. Make right clicking the toolbar button be the equivalent of Alt\u002BU, instead of Alt\u002BL.
