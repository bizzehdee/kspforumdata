My name is UpsilonAerospace (you may know me).\n\nToday, I\u0027m going to start a long, painful, grindy trek towards the conquest of space! This mission report will likely stretch into the dozens of pages, take months to complete, and be (to put it nicely) more interesting at some times than others. I\u0027m not sure why I\u0027m doing it, but I\u0027m doing it anyway. And you can follow along.\n\nRealistic Space Program: Career Done Very Differently!\n\n*A Kerbal Space Program Experiment*\n\n~~~\n\nThe goal of this project is to create an accurate representation of a space program. I\u0027ll try to \u0027hack\u0027 career mode to properly represent a real-life space center. While I won\u0027t try for accurate replicas of various space missions, I\u0027ll nonetheless play the game as if it was real life. I\u0027ll try to keep my Kerbals as safe as possible, and I\u0027ll follow a \u0027logical\u0027 progression of steps that nonetheless never happens in the average career game.\n\n~~~\n\n**So, what does this mean?**\n\n- **I\u0027ll start off with a \u0022rover\u0022 that uses command pod torque and use it to drive around the KSC.** I\u0027ll also have a Kerbal walk around the space center, collecting information (Science) about the various parts of our Tier-1 launchpad and buildings. After all, how can we launch things from the space center if we haven\u0027t even seen the buildings up close?\n- **This will (hopefully) eventually give enough Science to unlock a Stayputnik.** I can then build some unmanned planes to test aerodynamics around the KSC - and hopefully give me funds for setting altitude and distance records. (I don\u0027t think that ground exploration will give me any funds, but at least the overall cost of this is very low.)\n- **I can then build a manned plane**... and test it with a Stayputnik before flying a Kerbal. I\u0027ll likely use some of these planes to survey the immediate area. By this time, I\u0027ll likely have some rudimentary science experiments that I can run in the various biomes surrounding the KSC: the Grasslands, Shores, and Sea.\n- **Finally, I\u0027ll begin to build unmanned rockets and flying them into suborbital space.** I\u0027ll do my best to return the rockets in one piece: after all, it\u0027s dangerous to drop pieces on the space center! I\u0027ll build a craft with an empty capsule and fly it successfully twice before putting a Kerbal on it.\n- **After this, this space program will begin to look a bit more typical, with some exceptions.** I won\u0027t fly an untested design with a Kerbal on it. I\u0027ll try not to drop any parts without a parachute, especially if they\u0027re falling onto a land mass. I won\u0027t do part-test contracts with manned craft. If my Kerbals are flying for more than a week, I\u0027ll provide multiple pods per Kerbal for a bit of stretching room. If I strand a Kerbal, I\u0027ll have to rescue him as soon as possible. If a Kerbal dies, I\u0027ll have to fix the problem and then test the rocket unmanned to make sure a Kerbal would survive. I\u0027ll try to rotate Kerbals, especially after difficult or record-setting flights. In short, I\u0027ll try to be as safe and responsible as possible.\n\nYep, this is going to be a long adventure.\n\n~~~\n\nI\u0027ll try to post YouTube videos, photos, written dialogue, and other forms of \u0027mixed media\u0027 to make the experience worth watching. I have a feeling that this will take about as long as Scott Manley\u0027s Interstellar Quest... I sincerely hope not.\n\n**Anyway, please let me know what you think!** I\u0027ll probably have the first installment up tomorrow.\n\nThanks for checking this out! Wish me luck.\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T01:07:36Z","Content":"This is going to be... interesting.

These kinds of constraints do indeed add a good amount of challenge to the game. Good luck with your grind, mine is probably going to last years if I can manage to keep it up. Look forward to seeing how you go about things, especially since you\u0027re doing career and I couldn\u0027t be bothered to deal with finances getting in the way - there\u0027s more than enough missions to run just to collect science alone to keep things busy for me."}]}
