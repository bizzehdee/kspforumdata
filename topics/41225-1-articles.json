It can\u0027t control its direction so instead it is just pointed where it needs to go and then spun up to keep it heading that way. After it\u0027s burned out the payload can release weights to slow the spin down, like an ice skater throwing her arms out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe spirit rover travelled to mars spinning at about 2 revolutions per minute. While the rover was in transit the engineers wanted to keep the comunication antenna pointed at earth and the solar pannels at the sun. They could have used RCS thrusters to keep it steady, but that takes fuel, they could have used reaction wheels, but they are complex and heavy. So the simplest option was just to keep it slowly spinning while pointed the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-05T23:54:33Z\u0022 title=\u002208/05/2013 11:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Fuzzy Dunlop\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xeldrak","CreatedById":57228,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T14:55:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EActually, spinning it up for the burn, then loosing the angular momentum by extending and then sheding two weight is just an awesomly simple and beautifull solution ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
