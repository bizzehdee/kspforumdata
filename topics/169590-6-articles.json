The gas is light. So even though it is very hot in temperature, it doesn\u0027t have a lot of energy in any specific bit of volume. So in a static situation, the gas presses against the seal, gives up its small amount of energy, and then sits there as a barrier protecting the seal from any new gas getting to it. But in a flow situation, new gas is continually pouring through, carrying new energy with it. Those o-rings would slip out of their groove and jam into the gap and cut off the flow, thus cutting off the source of new heat. But on the day of the crash the o-rings were not flexible enough to jump out of their grooves. So lots of flow went past them, all bringing its own new heat, and that quickly destroyed the o-rings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen, luckily enough, the aluminum oxides from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E combustion coked up in the gap and blocked it themselves. That\u0027s the only reason it didn\u0027t explode right there on the pad. So again the flow stopped and so did the new source of heat. Sadly, flexing in flight (apparently due to wind shear) broke the brittle plug formed by the aluminum oxide, and then the hot gasses could flow again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(In more conventional terms: static gas is terribly bad at heat transfer by conduction, but flowing gas is terribly good at heat transfer by forced convection.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-16T18:49:44Z\u0022 title=\u002201/16/2018 06:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 16, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by mikegarrison\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PB666","CreatedById":107380,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T18:39:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223269480\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221516122506\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022119411\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tater\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n8 minutes ago, tater said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, they\u0027d be huge. A little lost cargo bay payload, but the vehicle was a compromise anyway in that regard. The Shuttle system put well over 100 tons into LEO, it\u0027s just that most of the mass was Orbiter. Once the goal (make work) was to make a station, the problem was that you could eliminate 4 launches by making all the parts over 100 tons, and not bother with the orbiter. Something akin to Shuttle C, but where the entire SSME/OMS rear package is dumped, and the \u0022cargo bay\u0022 part is replaced with a single, skylab-like station part. An earlied Shuttle C mission could have left a hub, and perhaps a tug part, so that the huge modules are rendezvoused to within X hundred meters, and the tug goes out and brings them in after the engines are gone (that package could deorbit itself).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ilrvmd68.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022479\u0022 src=\u0022https://sites.google.com/site/spaceodysseytwo/stg1969/ilrvmd68.jpg\u0022 width=\u0022640\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tanks are just fuel in this example (McDonnell-Douglas ILRV, 1966)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least there is one person here thinking about the evolution argument, but in my opinion (n dealing with other posts and getting back to this one at the end) its not about the crew release. Biologically speaking the source of the problem also has to mandate the solution, not the 3rd dependent reaction. As you state the shuttles capabilities are exceptional, just not as efficient as desired.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI say biologically because FIRST the crew has to be in a conscious or mobile state. You can\u0027t argue success if three were already unconscious as the moment of force application is completed. So if the state of the system evolves too quickly no crew compartment is going to work thoroughly and if the solution is not going to be complete there is no reason to waste mass to remediate the problem. The problem with the evolution of the STS-51-L is that there was a state that could no longer be contained. Even if one person was conscious there was no way for him to protect the rest of the crew from the effects of decompression, there was no way to alter the shuttles trajectory (other than one-human unit movements) because all of the control features disintegrated. Before we can discuss saving the crew (both in the case of challenger and columbia) we first have to save the orbiter. If the orbiter is significantly torqued to its disintegration point\u00A0 then its likely you already have dead or nearly dead crew. This is my interpretation of what happened. There was a pressure breach people went for their O2 but there was no means to escape or the crew were not able to escape due to structural criticality. Unless we are talking about launch crew in a \u0027bug\u0027 that they then move to the orbiter after a certain stage is released, there are basically no solutions to this problem. So 7PF does have a minimal point, but then the next flight of the Soyuz could show us a design flaw in their system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nChallenger disaster should not have happened and it was 100% preventable, this does not mean by some other mechanism a similar crisis could occur, but that was the negligent homicide of the crew, a crime that was never prosecuted. If it had been prosecuted our view of the incident may be completely different. Because it wasn\u0027t we look at flaws in a system that in reality worked as designed, you don\u0027t drive a car off a cliff and say the brakes are broken and you couldn\u0027t stop; the time to test brakes is before going over the side of cliff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is the initial problem but let me take the devil\u0027s advocate and argue that it could have been a completely random occurrence. Im doing this to develop a structural argument for manned space flight that eliminates certain models (i.e the above). So we have to define the what that state was then work to correct it. The initial state is a booster who nominal performance evolved over time along an \u0027unexpected\u0027 tangent (literally there was a tangent exhaust vector to the axial vector) . That tangent interfered with the containment function of the hydrolox tank. There was a domino effect on performance that went critical and standard models of prediction break down because there are forces acting in many directions and damage becomes foggy. So here we have to stop and argue, there is a theoretical crew escape system that would have work, it could be explosive bolts on the crew compartment with a hidden parachute that drops them safely in the Atlantic, the pointy nose should mitigation the impact deceleration. SO we have a handwaving solution. We assume that would stay alive long enough for them to catch their breath or be aided by a crew member.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem is this you have torque being applied on two lift surfaces differentially to the point at least one breaks, that torque commutes up the craft and before the bolts blow its now compromised the craft. The main engines are still in a declining burn\u00A0 the nose is under Q and the compartment cannot run from the orbiter, its stuck until all thrust go to zero. You can\u0027t really modify the orbiters outcome until you deal with the torque issues, and you cant deal with that until you deal with the structural issues on the tank (its liquid oxygen and hydrogen that want nothing more than to bypass the engines and burn). Yes, the orbiter is too close to the tanks, but both are too close to the SRBs that really have a design flaw, the joints. But for the sake of our random argument lets only consider the functions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe function of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E is only to burn, thats it you strike a match and stuff shoots out the back (it applies to all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E designs). The function of the Red tank was not to burn; it was a fuel supply and so all the forces intrinsic to itself can be prevented. Of course, the orbiter engines can explode, but then there are limitations on the fuel they have access to and thus torque they can produce. There have been several RS-25 failures of these type and none jeopardized the mission. We have to look at the problem logically, we need oxygen and fuel in space, so we can\u0027t be so afraid of these things that we never take them. We can have 10 levels of switches on them such they will always be shut off from threat generation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all our disintegration thrust vectors are tied to the red tank and attached boosters. There are situations were the red tank could have otherwise failed, there could have been a failing of\u00A0 a joint it could have suffered Q damage, etc. But then the next step is that the hydrolox would ignite, OK we need at\u00A0 a spark or lightning, and then on top of that we need some mixing torque to get that \u0027boom\u0027 required to disintigtate the orbiter. So we have an If and If and IF and then construct. Whereas the booster burned a whole through the tank and directly ignited the hydrogen, it circumvented two of the Ifs in\u00A0 a single step and we dont need and electrical spark. So the probability of the Red tank, in and of itself, triggering the orbiter\u0027s fate is much lower than if the booster does it. We can\u0027t definitely know how low because we have to cross parameters like when is max Q, when is the most force applied from the boosters . . . . . but needless to say there is a time constraint on when intrinsic forces can occur. And by and large Q is known and F is known and in aircraft these failures are pretty rare (Aloha airlines 737 is the last incident I remember, and the Corsair incident was another set).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread really should be about SRBs. WE know about the link of structural failure of the orbiter and random booster malfunction (again we are assuming that this could ever happened inside the rating and that the probability is ~\u0026lt;1/133). OK then what is the correct course. So i have to correct one thing I said, the boosters do produce more thrust, but the main engine produce more thrust * time than the booster produces. As a result the boosters are not the main source of thrust or energy and certainly not the main source of acceleration. Hydrolox has almost twice the Ve of solid fuels.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore boosters are replaceable. And if they are replaceable and are creating excessive risk they should be replaced. But I would argue one other thing, to the\u00A0 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E of the boosters is not impressive, we have newer launch systems that have better \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E are more tolerant of single engine failure (since they have nine engines) can be more easily recycled AND can be throttled off in case of an emergency in their operations. So given that why use SRBs on manned missions? The next logic here is that for any system where the booster is close to the orbiter or crew compartment, should we be using solid fuels? So what about mounting SRBS (several way down the red tank, the problem with that if they break the fastening they can slam into the orbiter which is above it and they cannot stop propelling themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in the model above as drawn and any of its still it does not circumvent the critique because essentially the SRBs can compromise any structure if they are mounted far enough away from the core and dont have active steering functions.

You can\u0027t argue success if three were already unconscious as the moment of force application is completed. So if the state of the system evolves too quickly no crew compartment is going to work thoroughly and if the solution is not going to be complete there is no reason to waste mass to remediate the problem. The problem with the evolution of the STS-51-L is that there was a state that could no longer be contained. Even if one person was conscious there was no way for him to protect the rest of the crew from the effects of decompression, there was no way to alter the shuttles trajectory (other than one-human unit movements) because all of the control features disintegrated. Before we can discuss saving the crew (both in the case of challenger and columbia) we first have to save the orbiter.

But first the shuttle was effectively designed in 1977, 40 years ago, and there is no expectation that in a break-thru industry that a single design should last 40 years. But the RL-10s design is basically the same a expansion cycle cryogenic engine since 1960, that is 57 years. The difference here is that the RL-10 is a component of a system (like an RS232 analog serial connection) and the shuttle is the system. Evolved systems should improve both performance and safety, no doubt and there is plenty of room for replacement. For example pilots could be replaced with flight computers that are controlled via generic commands (like change orbit, or controlled from encrypted ground commands). So get the crew down from 7 to say four. Remove certain functions, get rid of the ISS rescue functions and you have a much smaller crew compartment, more payload, potentially.

ANY malfunction of the SRBs meant LOCV (loss of crew \u0026amp; vehicle). One of the SRBs fails to ignite? The one that DOES ignite melts the pad, rips free, and cartwheels the stack across the landscape, and everyone dies. One of the SRBs has a thrust fluctuation in flight? The stack will start to tailspin and rip itself apart, and everyone dies. An O-ring fails and the side of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E burns through? The struts will melt and fail, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E will smash into the ET, the orbiter will rip free and disintegrate, and everyone dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why it was a death trap. Once the SRBs were ignited, you held on and hoped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat others have said is correct; there was no contingency for dropping the boosters, because dropping the boosters before burnout were instant LOCV. For one thing, the mechanics of separation required that the SRBs burn out while the SSMEs continued to fire; if the separation motors fired while the main motors were still firing, they\u0027d be pushed forward, into the tank. And even if the SRBs could be magically removed, the stack was not aerodynamically stable without them. The thrust vector of the SSMEs went up and through the forward center of the tank; the whole thing was flying off-prograde. The tank would roll and yaw beyond the SSMEs\u0027 ability for gimballed correction, the orbiter would rip off, tumble, and disintegrate. Everyone dies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey couldn\u0027t just separate the orbiter from the rest of the stack, either. The attachments of the SRBs were below the centerline of the external tank, to balance the thrust from the main engines. If the orbiter separated, the thrust vector would be under the stack \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECOM\u003C/abbr\u003E and the tank and SRBs would pitch backward, colliding with the orbiter as it separated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if the orbiter could be safely separated from the stack, it was not passively aerodynamically stable at any point in the ascent. It was built for entry, gliding decent, and unpowered landing; it was in a stalled state through the entire ascent and was carried only by its engines and the SRBs. In the \u003Ci\u003EChallenger\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0failure, the orbiter likely did not take significant collision damage from the SRBs or the ET; rather, the orbiter simply ripped itself apart in the off-axis airstream.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYep. The Shuttle looks big and tough, like some super-hardy ginormous fighter jet, but in reality it was far more fragile than an airliner of comparable size. It had the glide ratio of a brick and the structural integrity of a kite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, this is because it was super cutting-edge. There is no way we should have been able to make a VTHL crew-and-cargo spaceplane with reusable engines back then. Every single part had to be custom-made, every single part had to be constructed from the most lightweight materials, and every single part had to work perfectly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the really informative (if not seemingly heavily biased) reply, it is really interesting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T20:15:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223268166\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022169590\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221515986947\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022157695\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sevenperforce\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/14/2018 at 10:29 PM, sevenperforce said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich design was the HOTOL one?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile we\u0027re on the subject of alternate Shuttles, might I submit what has got to be THE most inaccurate scene from anything involving the Shuttles, ever:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/65I1AMRFdGo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike...what the actual hell?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre they supposed to be...underwater?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-16T20:17:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s a lot of misinformation swirling around in here that suggests that several people haven\u0027t read the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/outreach/SignificantIncidents/assets/rogers_commission_report.pdf\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ERogers Commission Report\u003C/a\u003E.
