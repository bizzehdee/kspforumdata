In other words, if you scroll the mouse wheel up, it doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re pointing at the prograde or retrograde vector, the trimming is done in the same direction. This isn\u0027t \u0022wrong\u0022 but I\u0027d prefer if there is an option in the settings that allows players to choose whether they want the scrolling to be independent of the vector the mouse is over or invert the scrolling trim depending on the vector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, double-clicking periapsis and apoapsis nodes currently makes them stick, which is a huge leg-up and a great feature. I feel it should be possible however to do so for intersection (encounter with celestial objects as well as non-celestial targets) and ascending/descending nodes as well, especially considering the new trim feature for maneuvers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-20T10:33:01Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2014 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MechaLynx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Egot ui behaviour backwards\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
