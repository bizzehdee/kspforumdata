For a classical rocket, if it\u0027s traveling at velocity v, and exhaust velocity relative to rocket is v\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E, then exhaust is traveling at v - v\u003Csub\u003Ep\u003C/sub\u003E. That is no longer the case for a relativistic rocket. So trying to exploit conservation of momentum becomes a bit complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother complication is that there are two different velocities to be considered. From perspective of inertial observers, map velocity is the relevant quantity, and it\u0027s limited to c. So as you get close to c, your rocket\u0027s efficiency drops dramatically. The faster you go, the more fuel you need to burn for the same dV. On the other hand, if you care about how fast you get somewhere by ship\u0027s clock, then the relevant quantity is the proper velocity. And that\u0027s not limited to c. The reason for that is that while you can\u0027t go faster, by burning more fuel you make the distance you need to travel shorter, thanks to Lorentz contraction. And if all you care about how fast you get there, it\u0027s just as good. And from perspective of fuel efficiency, it\u0027s better. Once you\u0027re going fast enough, the hyperbolic nature of Lorentz contraction starts to compensate for the logarithm in the rocket formula. And that has some absolutely insane consequences, such as it becomes actually feasible to build a matter-antimatter rocket large enough to cross the galaxy in a matter of decades. By ship\u0027s time, of course. On Earth, tens of thousands of years would pass anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe actual derivations involve serious math.

Because of relativity (and as someone pointed out earlier), one cannot come closer to the black hole than the photon sphere, or for those of you who have seen Interstellar, the \u0022critical orbit\u0022. While certain mechanics still apply (like conservation of momentum), they are extremely skewed due to the gamma factor caused by speeds near those of the speed of light.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn aside note and interesting fact: The photon sphere is where the black hole starts from the \u0022black\u0022 void perspective. It is NOT the event horizon. What the photon sphere means is that any photons on an INWARD trajectory to the black hole will never escape, but those on an OUTWARD trajectory can (and will). So while radiation can indeed escape from inside the photon sphere, there is not very much of it. The general concepts applying to the event horizon still apply.
