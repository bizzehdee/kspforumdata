THink about this for a second. you finally get past the hurdle of not burning up on reentry from a low suborbital (if you stick around that long to keep playing), only to have your parachutes ripped off because you deployed them too early, or to simply smash into the ground because it is now possible to have a velocity above parachute deployment speed all the way to the ground even from a low suborbital.

There are Lego sets not intended for people younger than 16 years, because younger kids usually don\u0027t have the patience and/or the abstract reasoning ability to build stuff with them.

Kids who were particularly interested about space learned from books how rockets get to orbit, why reentry capsules are shaped as they are, and similar stuff. These days learning is much easier than it used to be due to the Wikipedia and other online resources. Unless kids have become more stupid over the past 20-30 years, we should assume even more background knowledge from them.
