Fortunately, you quickly learn the language and culture, and in true Connecticut Yankee style you make your ascent to a position of power within the society. You cannot, of course, manage to effect full industrialization since that infrastructure would take a few hundred years to get up and running, but you make enough contributions to agriculture and astrology and military tech that you\u0027re sure to be remembered as a great leader.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s at this point that a thought occurs to you...what if you could be remembered as \u003Cem\u003Emore\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0than a great leader? By now, you\u0027ve already reached the conclusion that the future you remember is gone forever. You\u0027ve already changed history enough to ensure that. But you can guess that thousands of years in the future, archaeologists will dig up your civilization, and you want to give them something to really blow their minds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat do you do?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can write down your story -- \u0022I\u0027m a time traveler who came back from the year 2018 and used my knowledge to become powerful\u0022 -- but that\u0027s hit or miss. For one thing, you can\u0027t write in English, because English probably won\u0027t evolve in the same way, and if you write in the language of your civilization then you\u0027re more likely to create a new religion than anything else. Plus, written texts don\u0027t really survive very long, and in any case you can\u0027t make predictions about the future, because you don\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Eknow\u003C/em\u003E the future any more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou do, however, know that certain things don\u0027t change. Like the value of pi or the mass of an electron or the speed of light.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow would you encode advanced scientific knowledge in monuments or other relics to give future archaeologists the shock of their lives?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Csub\u003EMy own idea, spoiler\u0027d:\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe ideal relic, in my opinion, would encode information that the ancients absolutely would not be able to determine on their own, but which would be easy to correlate to reality without needing to speak the language or translate equations. Bonus if the information could potentially be explained to the ancients.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat could the ancients have guessed at, but never accurately known? How about\u00A0the relative distances, radii, and masses of the major planets and their largest moons? The ancients could not have observed Neptune or Uranus with the naked eye and certainly would not have known detailed information about the moons of Saturn, Jupiter, or Mars. And they definitely would not have been able to guess the semimajor axes of all the orbits.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d have them build a sprawling citadel with eight monoliths surrounding a central tomb. The relative distances between the monoliths and the tomb would correlate to the semimajor axes of the planetary orbits. Each monolith would rest on a cylindrical base such that the masses of the bases form ratios matching the ratios of the masses of the planets. The height of each monolith would be in ratio of the radii of the actual planets. Obviously, heights of the monoliths would not be to scale with the distances between the monoliths, but it could use a ratio like the fine structure constant. The monoliths representing Mars, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune would all have satellite monoliths (or at least pillars) representing the arrangement of moons around that planet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe specific locations of the monoliths would match the conjunction and alignment of the planets as of the date I woke up in the ancient world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInside my tomb, I\u0027d also have 14 spheres in mass-ratio to the masses of the non-massless elementary particles (excepting the electron neutrino because it\u0027s just too small).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRadii ratios:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nelectron: 1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nup quark: 1.6\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ndown quark: 2.1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ntau neutrino: 3.1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nstrange quark: 5.7\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nmuon: 5.9\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ncharm quark: 13.6\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ntau: 15.1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nbottom quark: 20.1\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nW boson: 53.9\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nZ boson: 56.3\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nHiggs boson: 62.5\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ntop quark: 69.7\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThis of course assumes radii is taken to represent volume, and volume correlates to mass.

The first is so iconic and the second - well we may as well go full-on time loop paradox here!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to encode the information? Good question, and to my mind the real trick would be encoding it in a way that it really couldn\u0027t be called out as a fake. Sure, I could (and probably would)\u00A0leave the derivation on a papyrus in a sealed jar in my tomb, but I think it would be too easy to disregard that as a hoax. We need something more obvious and much harder to fake, that ties in with the detailed derivation in my tomb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess the obvious answer is to spell out E=MC\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E in buildings (pyramids, temples or whatever) so that the equation is only apparent from the air. Buildings have a tendency to fall down, wear away or be vandalised / dismantled to build other buildings though, so we need redundancy. I think I\u0027d write my E=MC\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E into the shape of the building foundations\u00A0 too. Then, I would build a highlighter structure beneath and\u00A0around the foundations (think a moat around a castle). Ideally the highlighter would have the following properties:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nBe made out of an economically valueless material to discourage looters.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nBe made out of a material that stands out well on a multispectral image.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, even if my enormous ego-boosting tomb complex doesn\u0027t stand the test of time (or at least not enough of it to be readable), then hopefully the foundations will be. And if they\u0027re not, then hopefully the highlighter will be - and will only be visible by satellite to boot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh - as a final touch, I would leave multiple copies of a Rosetta Stone in, under and around my tomb. The Stone would be a personal letter from me to the future written in at least two contemporary languages and also in English. The letter would further\u00A0include the digits 0-9 expressed as a simple tally. It would include a guide to arithmetic symbols\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u00A0 =\u00A0 I\u003Cbr\u003E\n2=\u00A0 II\u003Cbr\u003E\n3 = III\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3x2 = III x II = IIIIII\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat sort of thing. It would also include the\u00A0equation weight/9.81 = mass and the note that mass = M.\u00A0 My reasoning here is that weight is a fairly general concept that may appear in other archaeological texts but mass is quite a specific concept that probably wouldn\u0027t be.\u00A0I would need to think of some other way of describing what the E in E=MC\u003Csup\u003E2\u003C/sup\u003E signifies\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat way, even if the shape of my \u003Cs\u003Eego\u003C/s\u003E tomb\u00A0complex means absolutely nothing to the future archaeologists, they at least have the means to decode it. Or, if they\u0027re excavating my tomb before relativity has been discovered, it\u0027s clearly an important equation given the amount of effort I\u0027ve put into making sure it\u0027s understandable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-06-01T12:51:09Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2018 12:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by KSK\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sevenperforce","CreatedById":157695,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-06-01T12:59:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223390673\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022175525\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221527857337\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002261025\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KSK\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, KSK said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinor nitpick - I\u0027d prefer to be remembered as a leader who contributed to astronomy rather than astrology. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs would I, but you\u0027re much more likely to gain critical acclaim in a stone age society through the avenue of astrology (simply because you\u0027ll be able to accurately predict star alignments, planetary conjunctions, etc.) than through astronomy, which wouldn\u0027t yet exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nQuote\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow to encode the information?

Requires a lot more leather than an ox collar, but allows you to get a full horsepower out of each horse (without this you basically strangle the horse.\u00A0 Yes, chariot races were a lot slower than you\u0027d think, largely because they were strangling the horses.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- mouldboard plough would be the next: you need iron and probably the horse collar (you could do it with oxen, but get the horse collar first).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- building hotter and hotter forges would be an amazing trick.\u00A0 Start with producing iron, and work your way up to steel, pig iron, and hopefully even crucible steel.\u00A0 Hope you know where historical iron and coal deposits are!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- remember that while the katana was an amazing performer made out of questionable ore (lots of swords were far better, but almost certainly used better ore), samurai were far more likely to fight with spears on the battlefield.\u00A0 Forging something like a katana might get the attention of kings (for good or ill), but don\u0027t expect to change the course of a battle with them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- could you make a compound bow?\u00A0 Sounds hard, and I\u0027d hate to imagine all the technology needed for it (maybe you could lathe hard wood/iron roller bearings instead of ball bearings), but it would probably become the \u0022super weapon\u0022 of anything before gunpowder (you need hardened steel plates to even think of stopping it).\u00A0 And even if you can make gunpowder, can you make the steel barrel needed to contain the explosive (sure, you could probably use it to sack walled cities, but that doesn\u0027t sound like a long-term thinking that goes into leaving a legacy).\u00A0 Again, infrastructure is key.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- there is likely a huge difference between a horse riding nomadic band and the same band with stirrups as cavalry.\u00A0 Expect amazing pushback from the tribe who learned to stay on a horse the hard way and insist that anyone who can\u0027t isn\u0027t part of their tribe.\u00A0 Don\u0027t be too surprised if the local cavalry have weird systems that work almost as well (the Romans had some weird circular stablizer).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally: on writing systems:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe all know that finding the Rosetta Stone meant that someone merely looked at the Greek text and was able to transcribe the Egyptian pictograms into Greek.\u00A0 Except it didn\u0027t happen that way at all.\u00A0 Certainly papers were written at the time that said as much, but it took another 20 years before Champollion finally got around to doing the hard work of matching up the text.\u00A0 Champollion was one of the few westerners (and probably few people altogether) who was fluent in Coptic.\u00A0 He was able to show that hieroglyphics were essentially Coptic, typically with stylized pictures to replace Coptic sounds (note that classical hieroglypics were often meant to be visually impressive to illiterates on temples and tombs and even if you could read them were often propaganda, so accuracy wasn\u0027t a big thing.\u00A0 Scribes had a separate simplified writing system for keeping records).\u00A0 A similar method was used with Linear B, and that had to be done without the aid of a Rosetta Stone: Alice Kober was able to show that it was an archaic form of Greek, using an ancient syllabary (each symbol meant an entire syllable, not just a sound).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll need a lot of copies of a complete explanation of your language and writing system, and even then they don\u0027t have a great chance of being decoded.\u00A0 So far, unknown writing systems have relied on knowing the underlying language, but there is always hope.\u00A0 Recently, there may have been advances in decoding the Incan knot system, but the actual advances are far less than the clickbait\u00A0
