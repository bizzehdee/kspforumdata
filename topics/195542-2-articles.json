But then you run into issues of how fast and effectively you can aim the laser. Ships that are AU away will be tiny dots - 100 meters at 1 AU is 6.67e-10 radians. And the lag between target observation and the beam arriving at the target will be around 16 minutes and a lot can happen in 16 minutes. Even just tiny movements may make it very difficult to land a surprise hit, and\u00A0a tiny movement is all you need to effectively dodge since we\u2019re dealing with sub-nanoradian accuracies here. A meter per second in any perpendicular direction will put the target a km away from where you observed it. And that\u2019s assuming you instantly arrive at a targeting solution and fire the laser the moment you observe the enemy come into range. It would take time to acquire a solution and move to it.

Any mistake and you miss. It may be possible but the question becomes whether or not it\u2019s desirable. If the range becomes multi-AU then it would be preferable to have battle stations that don\u2019t really move from their orbits and just destroy anything you don\u2019t like.

Your task as an SF author is to invent developments and deduce their consequences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe science fiction that has fictional stuff should be called Science Fantasy then?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause anything we dream up that we know does not exist is just that... until we learn otherwise.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding such, it is my approach to modify or enhance or manipulate stuff we already know to make scifi super tech.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnology like culture is\u00A0iterative, the future is based on the manifold acomplishments/failures of the past.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, the greeks/romans developed primitve steam engine technology, but even if they had went further to actually utilize it in an industrial manner it would not be as efficient as modern tech steam engines\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince they lacked the fine and precise tools and machinery that made steam engines an efficient choice for the 18th century. They would have likely resorted to some manpower and\u00A0gear/pulley analog to run their primitive steam machines if they chose to industrialize them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for tech scaling... warp and FTL is fantasy... since even known theory admits as much that we need *we hope it exists* \u0027exotic\u0027 stuff to make it work. Which if it does not... is fantasy again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus, the way I see it, if an author chooses to use antimatter freely because the civilization has WARP starships... it does not bother me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWarp literally involves messing with fabric of space itself! If a civilization can do THAT... then engineering a material that won\u0027t go boom when it touches antimatter gets a pass as far as my suspension of disbelief goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt may not yours... but I cannot have an alien race with cars rely on bow and arrows if you get my drift.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-07-20T21:55:58Z\u0022 title=\u002207/20/2020 09:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 20, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Spacescifi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-07-20T22:38:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I had to express my opinion, I think the space combat would be fought primarily by kinetic weapons (railguns, coilguns, etc.) over extremely long distance. Energy weapon tend\u00A0to get weaker with distance, judging from collimation and energy dissipation, while missiles has limited propellant, which, since the target spacecraft could maneuver away (and has way more deltaV than missiles), even tracking would be ineffective if the target could outmaneuver it, not to mention the missile could be shot down (and warships tend to fit defense turrets for that reason). Even if missile explodes, the fragment it creates may not be any different than a hail of highspeed micrometeorite strikes, which, a military-grade warship operating in space is certainly equipped to deal with that. A good weapon would be guided railgun, firing a kinetic slug with course correction thrusters. The initial firing will immediately close the distance to the target before course correction will be made to compensate if the target in maneuvering away for evasive action. No need for explosives, since kinetic energy will do the job. A hull breach is much more catastrophic for spacecraft than shockwave explosions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
