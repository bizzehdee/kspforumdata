The rim size is controlled by a component called AtmosphereFromGround, and it\u0027s a very simple class. You\u0027d have to write a replacement, as the rim size is hardcoded proportionally to the size of the planet. The outer radius of the rim is hard coded at 1.025 times the planet radius and the inner rim size is hard coded at 0.975 times the planet radius.

If you have a tree of game objects, each game object inherits its parent\u0027s active setting (well, game objects are rendered top down, so if it encounters an inactive object, the children are not processed). This enables us to have a \u0022deactivator\u0022 game object outside the prefab, but be the root object of the prefab contents. This object is disabled and marked DontDestroyOnLoad, which the children inherit. When KSP Instantiates objects out of the prefab and assigns new parents to the objects, they become active automatically. This enables our mod to actually be just a prefab rewriter.
