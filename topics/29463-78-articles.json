I thought I was being clever by mounting a turbo and a nuke together in the center rear on a vertical bicoupler, with each canted outwards to offset its off-center position. I only wanted one of each kind of engine on an otherwise symmetrical space plane. That actually worked great early in the flight profile, when the CoM was near where it was in the SPH, way out ahead of those engines. The design performed great on the initial ascent, and I was able to get to a 100 km KO with over 2000 fuel and the nuke. The engine still worked fine through all my orbital maneuvers, easily getting me to LMO with like 1400 fuel left. But by the time I was actually trying to land on the Mun with that crooked nuke, the CoM had moved so far back that the engine pretty much just wanted to make the ship go round and round. By burning the straight-mounted RAPIERs with my remaining bipropellant I was able to barely keep the thing under control, but despite maybe 10 attempts I never managed to touch Jebediah down properly. I.e. on the rear-mounted landing legs. I did manage to land on my wheels undamaged one time, but without enough fuel to get home, and when I tried to take off horizontally I cleared the ground but then crashed into a mountainside before I could get my heading up enough.
