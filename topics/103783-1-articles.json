The missions window can\u0027t have many missions, but when we\u0027re ready to explore Duna, the Eve contract shows up, or we\u0027d like the Laythe contract to be there as we reach for Jool, but only Bop and Pol are offered...\n\nExample:\n\nExplore Mun and Explore Minmus become \u0022Explore the moons of Kerbin\u0022 and have objectives and sub-objectives that are the same of both missions. Added goodness: another reward for finishing it\n\nCombining Inner planets, Outer Planets, the joolian system still keeps them all at a manageable size.\n\nAnother one would be the \u0022reach an altitude record of x\u0022 because we\u0027ve all missed a step or two on our way up to space."},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T20:34:08Z","Content":"I actually sort of disagree (but I sort of agree, too ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ). I\u0027d rather see fewer commercial contracts cluttering up the Mission Planning Center (it is NOT mission control, that needs to be renamed, dunno what squad was thinking there, the tracking center is really \u0022mission control,\u0022 but I digress).\n\nI want more Explore Missions, and in fact I want most of the pure science \u0022contracts\u0022 and most of the base/station contracts folded into Explore type contracts. Some of these would get bigger, mind you, I like the idea of large \u0022missions.\u0022 Really these are \u0022projects\u0022 of your program\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 like Mercury or Gemini. The reason to split some out are that I think some should not appear until you complete the mission the precedes it.\n\nProgression might be:\n\n**Achieve Spaceflight:**\n\nThe various early milestones would all fit into a single Program as you suggest, along with the altitude records, etc.\n\nDo atmospheric science (get temp or crew report from some altitude ranges).\n\nManned flight and recovery (get to some altitude and land safely).\n\nReach space.\n\nReenter safely.\n\n(unlocks BOF)\n\n**Basic Orbital Flight:**\n\nAchieve Orbit.\n\nScience from orbit.\n\nReenter successfully.\n\n(unlocks AOF, Cismunar, Cisminmar Flight)\n\n**Advanced Orbital Flight:**\n\nAchieve a specific LKO. (shown on map)\n\nChange orbital plane (some amount shown on map like a sat contract).\n\nRendezvous with another part (get within physics range of a part after having left physics range (so it could be part of your own craft, but you have to separate from it, first), then get within 100m or something).\n\nDock with another spacecraft (might give you a docking port as you would get in a parts testing contract).\n\nEVA.\n\nEVA with separation of some distance and return (2km?).\n\n(unlocks CF and MF1, MF2?, Orbital Science, plus Extra-Kerbin Flight)\n\n**Orbital Science:**\n\nVarious science from orbit stuff goes here.\n\nStay in orbit XX orbits.\n\n?\n\n(unlocks Build Space Station)\n\n**Cismunar Flight:**\n\nAchieve some high apoapsis above Kerbin.\n\nConvert flight to suborbital at apoapsis, and successfully reenter (testing higher velocity reentry, sort of like the recent Orion capsule mission).\n\nScience from high orbit.\n\n(unlocks MF1, MF2?, and EKF)\n\n**Cisminmar Flight:**\n\nAchieve apoapsis above Mun, below Minmus.\n\nConvert flight to suborbital at apoapsis, and successfully reenter (testing higher velocity reentry, sort of like the recent Orion capsule mission).\n\n**Munar Flight (Explore the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, part 1):**\n\nAchieve munar SoI.\n\nScience from near the Mun.\n\nAchieve munar orbit.\n\nScience from LMO.\n\nAchieve escape velocity from munar orbit (likely to Kerbin SoI for reentry).\n\nImpact the Mun (landing counts as well)\n\n(Unlocks MF2 and Minmus missions)\n\n**Advanced Munar Flight (Explore the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn, part 2):**\n\nLand on the Mun.\n\nScience from munar surface\n\nSample from Mun.\n\nReturn sample to Kerbin.\n\n(unlocks EKF, and Minmus missions)\n\n**Explore Minmus part 1:**\n\nLike the Mun.\n\n**Explore Minmus part 2:**\n\nLike the Mun\n\n**Extra-Kerbin Flight:**\n\nAchieve Kerbin escape velocity.\n\nAchieve Solar orbit.\n\nTransmit data from solar orbit (need a part to do this as the thermometer won\u0027t).\n\nAchieve maneuver with an interaction with a non-Kerbin SoI.\n\n(unlocks all other first exploration missions (First Exploration of Duna, etc))\n\nThe unlocks listed above are tweak able so that there can be different paths taken. Some steps require one before, others might be skipped (though at a loss of funds, etc)."}]}
