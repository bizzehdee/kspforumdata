I installed RP-O the other day and recently started a care\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003Eer game. My rockets are working well but there was a few contracts to build planes so I tried that. My first attempt there was something seriously wrong because the rear of the plane just started floating upwards and the props or jets did nothing in terms of thrust. I had a similar problem when a mod didn\u0027t like a certain part. I found out it was the tail section so I replaces it with a procedural tank and it seems to have remedied that problem. The plan takes off down the runway now but I can\u0027t seem to get it to fly. I\u0027m not sure if it is something to do with the parts or with how I\u0027m used to building planes in KSP. This is really the first time I\u0027ve tried to build a plane in RO. Watching the FAR data I\u0027ve tried an AoA on the runway from about 5-7 degrees and once I pickup the speed needed for liftoff I go straight up into a stall and I can\u0027t get out of it. I\u0027ve also noticed that the COL in the SPH shows up for the most part but it does not have an arrow pointing up like it normally does and the last plane I built it doesn\u0027t show up at all.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll screenshot my gamedata folder\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/fvBlNJ7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/fvBlNJ7\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/Nr4l9Ei\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/Nr4l9Ei\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/OyPjDux\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/OyPjDux\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nany help is appreciated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-06T01:31:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModded support is a better place for this kind of question, and so your thread has been moved, archenemy_6.
