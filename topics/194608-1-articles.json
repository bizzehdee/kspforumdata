Includes the Blender, Unity projects and the final in-game part. One on the solar panels should be retractable (animated). For the animation I would suggest looking up some youtube tutorials on animation. One thing that really helps in animating parts that rotate (like the panels on a solar array) is to set the origin of the part to the hinge. Another thing to note is that (last time I checked anyway) at least one of the Blender exporters didn\u0027t export rotations based on Euler angles (the Collada one I believe).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
