If you have multiple objects that can contain experiment results, like a command pod, hitchhiker container, or the new dedicated science container part, you can store one copy of each experiment in each different part, and when you recover the vessel, you receive the full amount for the first copy and the additional bonus science award for each extra copy, with each award being a certain fraction of the previous award).\n\nBecause you cannot store multiple copies of such experiments in the same part, due to the duplicates simply getting discarded, the only way to do this on a single trip is normally to collect the first results, store them, re-run the experiment, collect those results, and store them in a different part (or for a probe, just bring along multiple experiment modules so that no collection and resetting is required).\n\nWith this mod automatically running experiments and collecting results, how would it handle a situation where I manually run (for example) a materials bay a second time? Would it recognize that the duplicate results would be lost and store them in a different science results container, would it leave them in the experiment, or would it collect them and overwrite the existing copy in the part it wants to store all the results in?\n\nAlso, if I load up a vessel which already contains more than one copy of an experiment in different parts, will FS try to consolidate those experiments into a single part (resulting in loss of the duplicates)? Similarly, if I take multiple surface samples and stash them in different parts before re-entering the vessel (or stash the first in a science box and then board the command pod with the second), the same question applies?"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-20T06:53:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 5 hours ago, flatbear said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E the latest \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E is not allowing me to update dmagicorbitalsciences because it says\n\u003E \n\nI made same question in Dmagic\u0027s thread.

I have installed both and it works fine for me.\n\u003E \n\nEh, I always just saw getting more science for running those experiments again as a minor challenge to be met, particularly when designing probes -- it\u0027s another advantage of manned missions (being able to get multiple results without needing redundant science parts). And it makes sense that you would want multiple samples to study, it\u0027s just a nuisance that the base game allows you to collect as many different experiments as you want in a single container \\*except\\* when they match, it won\u0027t just say \u0022Hey, this contains TWO of this one and that one,\u0022 even though you \\*can\\* bring two (or more) of them back by putting them in different parts... It\u0027s a silly restriction that makes no sense since it can be worked around so easily, just like it makes no sense to have to take the crew report out of your command pod in order to take another crew report, even though you\u0027re just putting it \\*right back in\\*... and how transmitted data is worth less than bringing the readings home, even for experiments where there\u0027s no physical test subject to perform a detailed lab study on (I\u0027m looking at you, 2HOT \u0026 co.)\n\nAnyway, I could test FS\u0027s behavior myself under those circumstances, it would just take enough time to run a mission to somewhere I haven\u0027t already studied, which could have been wasted if it turned out to cause undesired behavior.

For an easy example, right click on a science box and use the option which makes it collect data out of other parts. FS immediately re-runs all experiments (because they are no longer present in its preferred command module), and then starts grabbing experiment data out of every other part on the ship, including the science storage compartment you just moved the previous results into, resulting in a whole bunch of duplicates being created and discarded (even for results like materials bay and goo, and presumably surface samples as well, though I haven\u0027t specifically tested those yet).\n\nPerhaps FS could be programmed to explicitly ignore the contents of the science storage containers? Better yet would be to test whether a certain result is already present in the pod it wants to move results into. It\u0027s obviously capable of doing something like that since it isn\u0027t constantly re-running experiments which have already been run. It just needs to perform those tests when moving results around as well, and not move them if they\u0027re the same."},{"CreatedByName":"WaveFunctionP","CreatedById":104784,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-30T07:11:17Z","Content":"FS stores collects and stores all data to a single location. This is so that the users always knows where his data is located. I\u0027m not overly concerned about collecting multiple data to multiple storage containers because a) that is a fairly niche use case, b) FS already makes science so easy it is already arguably cheating, and c) if you want full science, there are very simple \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E configs to do just that.\n\nThis mod is purposefully as simple and consistent as possible. I made a conscious choice to try to remove tedium and complexity. There is a reason that there are only three states to the mod and one button. On (green), off (red), not applicable (missing).\n\nI know I\u0027m not very charismatic like the popular youtubers, but I think I covered everything you need to know to operate FS in the video, including multivessel behaviors.\n\nOn another note, DMagic uses special experiment modules which do not conform to the stock behaviors. He does this to add more complex behaviors to his parts. There is nothing wrong with this, but FS does not support them. I know it is not the most popular things to say, but I\u0027ve been down the rabbit hole of trying to support other mods and having breaking changes every week. This mod pretty much only breaks when KSP itself changes the underlying interfaces that this mod depends on. There have many updates to KSP that didn\u0027t even break the mod. And the breaks that do happen are usually very minor edits to a couple of function signatures. This is also important because I am not paid to make this mod. I think I\u0027ve gotten like $25 over the years that this mod has been in service. I loved making it, and I love the game, but I simply can not devote a ton of time to development without financial backing. One of the reason this mod was updated so promptly was because of a donation. So, I felt obligated to updated it asap. I have other projects that I work on as well. If someone wanted to support a ForScienceAllTheThings! version that supported every feature and mod imaginable with ongoing donations that would be another thing.  \n\nOne of the main reasons why players want a mod manager like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003Eckan\u003C/abbr\u003E is because mod authors are always breaking each others stuff and the constant updating gets old after a while. At least, it did for me. I didn\u0027t want FS to be one of those mods that breaks when you sneeze in its general vicinity. I know its not fancy to not have a bunch of gizmos and widgets, but I think it is OK to focus on doing one thing really well, and I think FS does a fairly great job at what it does.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-30T07:28:24Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2016 07:28  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by WaveFunctionP**"},{"CreatedByName":"FlyingFalap","CreatedById":147997,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-31T07:57:33Z","Content":"Thanks for keeping up work on this mod [@WaveFunctionP](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/104784-wavefunctionp/)!
