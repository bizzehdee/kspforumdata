This craft is completely stock and operated in stock aero. Only informational mods were used during construction (RCS Build Aid) and operation (KER and Advanced Resource Panel).\n\nPaul Moller said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CA VTOL aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system. It\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s essential. ...If that system fails, or the engine fails, that vehicle crashes.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 This model has 4 torque of SAS per ton, plus vernor thrusters tucked under each engine nacelle for fine-tuning landings.\n\nMoller also said \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201CA VTOL, like a hummingbird, has a high metabolism, which means it requires a lot of energy. It is very difficult...to get a large amount of power in a small package.\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 This model uses a pair of jets tucked almost out of sight for hovering, a pair for forward thrust and another pair for retro thrust. Takeoff can be horizontal with the hover jets gradually lifting off, or vertical with the forward jets transitioning to horizontal flight.\n\nThe Moller M400 has 8 engines, 4 computers, and 2 parachutes. This one uses 6 engines, 2 computers and 1 parachute. This parachute was tested many times and the pilots survived every time it deployed. They also survived many RUDs when the chute was not deployed.\n\nThe Moller M400 \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ctargeted performance\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 (never tested), and this model\u0027s actual performance:\n\n    [FONT=courier new][COLOR=#000000]             M400 vs v12.4Top speed: 143 m/s-\u003E 285 m/s[/COLOR][/FONT][FONT=courier new][COLOR=#000000]Range:     207 km \u003C- 150km[/COLOR][/FONT][FONT=courier new][COLOR=#000000]Ceiling:  9.75 km -\u003E 12.5 km[/COLOR][/FONT][FONT=courier new][COLOR=#000000]Climb rate: 19 m/s-\u003E 20 m/s at sea level[/COLOR][/FONT][FONT=courier new][COLOR=#000000]Cargo:     340 kg -\u003E 3350 kg[/COLOR][/FONT][COLOR=#000000][FONT=Arial][FONT=courier new]Mass:        1 mt \u003C- 18.5 mt[/FONT][/FONT][/COLOR]\n\n KerbalX link: [Moller Skycar v12.4](http://kerbalx.com/Torquimedes/Moller%20Skycar%20v124)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
