They are firing and my fuel is depleting but they have absolutely no effect on my trajectory. I have tried going full throttle retrograde to test this and my speed actually increased slowly due to a lowering phase of my half orbit. I bought the game, but I have tried downloading completely outdated versions in the hopes of avoiding this issue, but to no avail. If I can\u0027t get things into orbit around Kerbal I really can\u0027t play the game at all. And no I don\u0027t just suck at getting into orbit.. I have tested this with nodes more often than not and when I switch engines the Delta V bar thingy just stops going down and the estimated burn time flickers between around 2-10 days. I have also experienced this issue when trying to get out of the muns orbit to return to Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny help would be much appreciated\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-09T12:22:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat you describe seems what happens when another part is \u0022covering\u0022 the engine nozzle (even if you may think is not, KSP is pretty sensitive about that).
