Two of those lifeships are conventional single-hulled passenger vessels, and the other two are high-speed catamarans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis vessel has an exceedingly high passenger capacity, and has every facility possible somewhere on board. During the siege of Anfywa Island, the ship was commandeered by the HSD and acted as a troop carrier from the mainland, and deployed the majority of soldiers sent there.* As with large aircraft carriers and icebreakers, the \u003Cem\u003EAurora\u003C/em\u003E is powered by nuclear engines, in this case thorium molten salt reactors to negate the threat of meltdown or dangerous radiation levels. She has twenty one decks. Below that is either engines or ballast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The Siege Of Anfywa Island was the result of a faction of anarchists attempting to cause heavy damage to HSD infrastructure through means of a captured HSD facility which controlled an orbital missile platform - capable of deploying a large number of nuclear missiles. Said facility was designed to withstand bombings, and the anarchist faction had taken control of other areas of the island including one port city and several major towns.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(This thing is seriously massive.
