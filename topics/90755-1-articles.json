My jubilations were short-lived, because I landed on an inclination. Still, no problem - rover was dirtside, and my lander was upright. Jeb just wanted to disembark to take his new rover for a spin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut suddenly, my Rover, well... went off downhill. At first I thought it was just rolling down, but after three kms (and after it crashed), I realised that the wheels were stll turning - it obviously was on! Without any kerbalnaut in it?!?!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow do I keep my Rovers from... roving away before my Kerbals can actually use them? Is there some part I\u0027ve missed? I\u0027m guessing the Rover was connected with my lander and got some commands during the landing, but I don\u0027t know for certain...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the help!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-20T19:40:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/20/2014 07:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 20, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CmdrBone\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Decent Weasel","CreatedById":74583,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-19T23:30:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d click on the \u0027brakes\u0027 symbol next to the altimeter, next to the \u0027lights\u0027 and \u0027gear\u0027 indicators.

In RL the bearing would create enough friction to slow and eventually stop the wheel, but what you\u0027re seeing is basically the same as a bicycle-wheel that\u0027s freewheeling after a crash - it doesn\u0027t mean anybody\u0027s still actually pedaling.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CmdrBone","CreatedById":129357,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-20T19:41:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you everyone, it was the brakes.
