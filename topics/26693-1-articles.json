I haven\u0027t really had a joystick before, and I really wanted to get starting strong, so I\u0027ve been looking into the x52 Pro. I\u0027ve done some research and read lots of reviews, and most of them seem to be quite positive, but I want to get some feedback from some actual users before committing. Any info about it would be good, also, if anyone has a profile for KSP that would be great (profiles from the original x52 aren\u0027t compatible, but would still be good as I can reverse-engineer them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMatrixmage\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"IvanTehFennec","CreatedById":26927,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T03:23:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have the X-52 Pro, but I do have standard, and it hasn\u0027t let me down in the 5-6 years I\u0027ve owned it. It\u0027s quite a joystick, with powerful programming software.

And i must say - its pretty awesome joystick, in general. It fits for all types of games from MS Flight Simulator to some arcade ones. It very easy to handle, easly to push buttons and triggers and it\u0027s light weight, which is good for long games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut there is 3 problems exist with it: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Hall sensors non-linear by default (on the Joystick itself, the X and Y axises); - easy to fix (see below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Throttle sensor gonna glitching with time (Z axis) after 1-2 years of use; - easy to fix (see below)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) After long time there will be backlash, or free move (or Luft - in german, sorry i dont know how to say that) on the main handle. Especially around \u0022twist\u0022 axis, which will make almost impossible to use it anymore. So you\u0027ll have to switch to actual pedals (if you have them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first two problems are not so critical, since you can easy fix it by yourself. I don\u0027t know is this problem still with X 52 Pro serie persist, but for X52 - you just need to make this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Disassemble the base platform of joystick and then just turn around the magnets and then assemble everything back. Thats it! It takes only 1 hour of work and you will get fully linear joystick behaviour, which is awesome =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- To fix Z-axis glitching, just disassemble Throttle base, and then use some WD-40 on it\u0027s resistor. This will do the trick =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the last, third problem you can\u0027t fix it so easily, because of the Joystick\u0027s constuction itself - its plastic body attached to metal shaft, so that plastic stuff just slowly breaking and loosing its connection by time. But its ok, since everything is aging, and everything is dying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also have Thrustmaster\u0027s Hotas Warthog, but this one is real hardcore - full metal jacket for serious simulators only. You can\u0027t use it on every game as X52, because of it\u0027s weight and total brutality. So for KSP and 90% of other games - X52Pro is just perfect, but of course it\u0027s up to you, what to choose/use =P\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-24T23:34:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2013 11:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by quadro7f\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Efixed some errors\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chobit-389","CreatedById":40105,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T23:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI love mine, but it might have an issue with the triggers zappign your fingers, just cover them with electrical tube\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
