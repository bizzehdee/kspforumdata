But what I am saying is that when you look at Mun it looks very 3D. No Light really reflecting off of it. But when you look at Luna it looks like a flat reflective surface, which is awesome, Could we have a similar thing happen in KSP? With all planets and moons? Have minmus be the brightest dot in the Kerbin sky?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hashbrown66","CreatedById":65106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-26T03:23:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be cool if they just put a simple sprite or something over distant planets so you can see them in the night sky. Right now Venus is really visible, so it would make sense for you to be able to see Eve.

Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, etc... are very visible in the night sky, naked eye... Heck you can practically see the moons of Jupiter naked eye...
