I have built rockets and subsystems in other games (most notably in garrysmod); with KSP, I really would like to attempt vGUI for cockpit views. This is not a possibility just yet I am to understand. This unfortunately was my first idea at attempting to mod for KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/0U60D.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00220U60D.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/LIvdt.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022LIvdt.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething old - I actually have much better EGP3 avionics screens, but this shows you the first concept. The entire rocket was just teeming with avionics, mission data, and other fun status stuff. I even included an audible alert system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich leads me to my second, presumably do-able concept; how about a sound mod based on game events \u0026amp; conditions? And no - not a rocket sound mod; but a computer of sorts - detection based with soundplay as audible cues for events. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose of you familiar with aircraft technology will know all about \u0027bitchin betty\u0027 - and audible alerts. I\u0027m thinking - why should this be tough in KSP? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe core list of ideas / events / triggers;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u0027Altitude\u0027 - Warning when approaching ground level \u0027Tone\u0027 followed by \u0027Vocal Alert - Altitude\u0027 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Radar Altimeter Call-Out - Mod calls out 2000,1000,500 ...100...50...40...30... (would be epic when landing on the mun) \u0027Vocal\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Master Caution - Triggers on rocket failure events \u0027Klaxon\u0027 \u0027Whoop Whoop\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rate of Descent - overspeed warning if rate is greater than ship surviveability \u0027Whoop Whoop\u0027 - Vocal \u0027Rate\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Altitude -vs- Orbital Speed Alert - tone or ping to indicate orbit conditions (based on table of oV \u0026amp; alt) \u0027Beep Boop\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Vehicle Radar - Pings when nearby object is detected - rate effected by distance \u0027Ping - Pong\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Stage Fuel Warnings - 75, 50, 25, 10% Trigger values - Vocal \u0027Fuel Levels are at Seventy Five Percent\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figure I could grab the altitude, vertical \u0026amp; ground speeds, and deltaV and use them to trigger sound events. I have a good library of opensource sounds that could be useful or I can produce my own. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy questions;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. What do you think of this concept? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. What would the community think would be the best way to implement this?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn truth, I have yet to invistgate the variables and SDK so my idea may not even be possible. Either way, I feel it would be a good test to see if I can produce some content for KSP. Of course, if anyone wants to help for shared bragging rights, I\u0027d love to collaborate. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts, feedback, concerns, comments, or notifications of next of kerb are welcome. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ninja","CreatedById":1165,"CreatedDateTime":"2011-09-08T05:57:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game framework is not really in place yet to consider mods any more serious than just parts packs.
