I\u0027ve used the mod for a long time and love it, but lately I have noticed multiple game freezes - resulting in a crash since the game never becomes responsive and needs to be closed - and have removed all the science related mods. I\u0027ve added them back one by one until the problem came back. Removing Science Relay got me a 9 hours of play without a freeze.\n\nOnly other science related mods currently installed are DMagic Orbital Science, Science Lab Info (and 6 crew), Crowd Sourced Science, [x] Science! Continued and Extended information about scientific experiments. Adding Science Relay back in will freeze the game randomly when I do a science. It does not happen every time, but does for sure within 30 minutes. So it may freeze the first time I do science or the 10th time I do science. But never a game longer than 30 min without a crash.
