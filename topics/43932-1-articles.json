So I used Hyperedit to get an orange Rockomax near their orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, since its completely stationary, I cant get it to rendevous with them. Burning at max thrust, it just stays in that spot. Also, since its not moving at true orbital speed, how does anything in the same orbit dock with it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanx!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T14:21:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat function of hyperedit did you use to get it there? The Orbit modifier? If so, it sounds like the error where the vessel\u0027s state stays at landed, despite it being launched. Is the vessel\u0027s orbit line showing up in the map?
