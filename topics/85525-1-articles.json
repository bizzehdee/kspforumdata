Radial in shortens the time until periapsis, and radial out lengthens the time until periapsis. Since Kerbin\u0027s orbit is so much smaller than Jool\u0027s, a small radial burn can change the time you encounter Kerbin\u0027s orbit (near solar periapsis) by a lot. By tweaking that time, you can always get a Kerbin encounter. (By the way, this also works in other situations like going from Kerbin to Moho.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re in orbit around Jool, an easy way to add a radial in/out component to your burn is to move the maneuver node forwards or backwards along your orbit. You want to exit Jool\u0027s SOI mostly going retrograde, but with some radial in/out (and maybe normal north/south) component. So assuming you\u0027re going counterclockwise around Jool, and make a maneuver node going straight towards solar retrograde, if you move that maneuver node a little forwards you\u0027re going to get a radial out component (lengthening the time until Kerbin encounter), and if you move the maneuver node a little backwards you\u0027re going to get a radial in component (shortening the time until Kerbin encounter). If you use a Tylo flyby, just make sure it\u0027s in the right position to take you out of the SOI in the right direction. It takes about a 1300 m/s burn from low Tylo orbit to encounter Kerbin, which is about 400 m/s above Tylo escape velocity, so make sure you have that amount of velocity as you pass Tylo periapsis.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"el_coyoto","CreatedById":49292,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T11:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you like porkchop plots, graphs and all that, I find \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/36476-WIN-MAC-KSP-Trajectory-Optimization-Tool-v1-1-7-Mission-Animator!\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKSP Trajectory Optimization Tool\u003C/a\u003E to be an excellent companion to mission planning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used it a few times to do gravity assists because I find the maneuver node system a bit limited in those cases, but it can do so many other things...

As long as you can eject into a transfer orbit having its periapsis at Kerbin\u0027s orbit, you can often manufacture a Kerbin encounter without too much delta-V. You can use small radial burns and also mess around with when and where the burn takes place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother great, nearly foolproof technique is to be prepared to \u0022go once around\u0022 in your transfer orbit. Just enter your transfer orbit from Jool back to Kerbin at any point, without worrying about where Kerbin will be when you get there. Then, when you get to periapsis (i.e. near Kerbin\u0027s orbit), a small prograde or retrograde burn will usually create an encounter the next time around. This works because your transfer orbit is so much bigger/slower than Kerbin\u0027s orbit that even a fairly small delta-V adjustment can lengthen or contract it by a substantial fraction of a Kerbin year. Just watch the target encounter markers as you add or remove thrust from the maneuver node you\u0027re setting up... they will rapidly converge to an encounter. The only drawback here is that your Kerbals are stuck in interplanetary space a little longer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-02T17:12:40Z\u0022 title=\u002210/02/2014 05:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 2, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yakky","CreatedById":94432,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-02T17:10:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Rocketeer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou would be better off/save more fuel using a moon to sling you into a low periapsis of Jool and use Jool\u0027s gravity to assist for Kerbin.
