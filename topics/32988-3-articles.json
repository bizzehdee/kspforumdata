I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the same thing. See, in the classical asparagus, every booster is the same. What I do is that each stage is about twice the mass of the one before. So I start with a core (that gets to almost-orbi or orbit), then put two copies around crossfeeding into it. And finally, another two with double the fuel, since they don\u0027t have payload on top. You maintain a very uniform T/W peaking on liftoff that slowly goes down as you stage, the first stage drops just before starting gravity turn, and you make orbit with only two staging events and a big tank. Easy to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the job to do is huge, then I can add another stage just by copying the last set of boosters and adding four on the corners, which turns the whole thing into a four stage to orbit filling the 3 by 3 matrix. And all stages have a mass ratio of about three, which is where the rocket equation gives you the most bang for your buck. That is important. If, however, I\u0027m carrying a light payload, I just use two stages for a three-core body and use the payload\u0027s engines to make orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do use mainsails, but the core is usually a cluster of more efficient engines, since I have them burning from the pad to orbit.
