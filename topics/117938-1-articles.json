Well for me and a few other\u0027s that I\u0027ve talked to, it\u0027s annoying as all hell.\n\nWhat this mod is is a simple ModuleManager config that renames all parts to the mod they belong to. It also renames all stock parts to \u0022squad\u0022 manufacturer. Of course when I say \u0022all\u0022 parts, I mean any mods that have support. As of now I have included support for the follow mods\n\n**All Stock Parts**\n\n **Near Future**\n\n **Atomic Age**\n\n **Cryo Engines**\n\n **Habitat Pack**\n\n **RemoteTech**\n\n **DeepFreeze** \n\n**Stockalike Station Parts** \n\nThis is an ongoing project and any mods I find that have weird naming schemes I will add support for. If you find this useful and have some mods that you\u0027d like to see support for please let me know and I\u0027ll be sure to add them as well.\n\n**Download**\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/3skarucd06agx3s/Manufacturer%20Rename.cfg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3skarucd06agx3s/Manufacturer%20Rename.cfg?dl=0) \n\nSince this is just a simple text file the license is \u0022do whatever you want with it, but some credit would be nice\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"legacynl","CreatedById":138182,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T11:18:39Z","Content":"Great idea, but this problem can be kind of mediated by using filter extensions.
