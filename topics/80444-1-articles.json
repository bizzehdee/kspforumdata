Like wobbling about during take-off and sending the plane veering wildly and uncontrollably left or right. Same sort of problem when landing comes up too: the plane will start doing the electric slide off in a random direction no matter how straight-on you are, but entirely at random. Now I\u0027ve noticed that physics-less parts tend to be at the root of problems like this, and I\u0027ve also noted that the landing gear is definitely physics-less. If they had that flag removed, I\u0027m sure there would be some serious rebalancing necessary, but I also think this would be a very, very good idea. As they stand now, the landing gear are something of a hazard to use since you can\u0027t be sure if they\u0027re going to flip out and kill you or not.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Random Tank","CreatedById":104325,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T21:39:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmmm... maybe...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey\u0027d have to lower their weight though really, as it could kill most planes with the weight change, and completely destroy Ion planes... Have you done any testing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, most of the issue with wild veering is caused by them not being mounted 90 degrees perpendicular to the runway, not being physics-less\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T21:59:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen the crazy veering effect happen even when the wheels are all perfectly level with the runway, actually. And no, I haven\u0027t tested making them physics-enabled, because I don\u0027t know how to do that. The flag for it is either not in the CFG or not obvious. I suspect that a large part of why they\u0027re not is because of the fact that gear has to be able to handle moving at speeds well above their crash tolerance when taking off and landing both.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-01T22:28:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe field is PhysicsSignificance and if it\u0027s not present then it uses its default value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisabled would be PhysicsSignificance = 1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s an enumerator not a boolean so the above is not the same as \u0027true\u0027.

This is more an issue with the gear not being perfectly aligned, and it might NOT look like it is, but a degree of difference of even 0.0001 off will throw you off course when you approach takeoff speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-08-01T23:53:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2014 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starwaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ELeft out the word \u0026#039;NOT\u0026#039; above.
