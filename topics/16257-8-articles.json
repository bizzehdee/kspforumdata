The whole ship would be rotated sideways and be completely uncontrollable and completely unaffected by physics. The cause turned out to be an uncaught exception thrown by incorectly iterating through a list of strings. Something akin to that might happen here.

It\u0027s very hard to diagnose with this many possible factors. Thankfully it seems as though it\u0027s a rare bug. Still, I think I might build in a little extra bit of exception handling in 0.4 just to be safe.

As it is right now, it will however not work with MechJeb. I\u0027m looking into a way of disabling RemoteTech activation if there is a MechJeb present on the vessel, so I don\u0027t end up forcing you to chose between RemoteTech and MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eautopilot:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve done a little conceptual work on a RemoteTech autopilot.

I would like to get basic attitude control working (al\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1 Smart A.S.S.) before I release 0.4, which is a huge challenge, as it involves areas of coding that are completely virgin land for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe autopilot will definetely not be anything to rival MechJeb, and it shouldn\u0027t be. It will be very basic and all burns must be guesstimated by the player. That way it\u0027s still challenging enough to make it a major achievement to orbit another planet, and even more so to land on one. I will probably be adding a very basic landing module, where you can set a specific vertical speed for it to maintain, and probably also a specific height at which to start breaking to the set vertical speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E0.4 beta:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0027ve been thinking about maybe starting to release the most current beta build of 0.4 as an alternative download to 0.34.
