The majority of the times when they capture those vague figures of mist, the investigators say that they resemble people, but I see something different.\n\nI see almost completely blank shapes of what could be considered a person, but there\u0027s almost always a couple of distinct features: Large, dark, slanted eyes and an unusually shaped head, almost identical to the stereotypical \u0022Grey\u0022 alien.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Ghosts? Demons? Aliens? Fakery? Overactive imagination? Potato?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T04:13:11Z","Content":"I think it\u0027s a conspiracy theory."},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T04:21:17Z","Content":"I think confirmation bias.

And by that, ghosts don\u0027t even need to be what we think of them as. Could be deceased people, could be creatures using some insane stealth system, could be inter-dimensional beings that just scarcely touch our plane of existence. Whatever.\n\nBut if you want to play ghost hunter, I suggest you just go find a real group and ask if they will take you on a \u0027mission\u0027 or two. I will NOT trust reality shows for ANYTHING. The amount of sensationalism that gets artificially stuffed into these shows is beyond ridiculous.
