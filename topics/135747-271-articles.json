Sending 200 people and cargo for 100 doesn\u0027t cut it, and regardless, only the 1 ship of cargo can land, even if you cram people in for the short EDL part of the mission. So you\u0027ve used 2 ships to get 2 shiploads of people to Mars. If they both landed, then you\u0027d still get to reuse both of them, just at a different synod than it would be with Musk\u0027s plan now. I\u0027m not seeing it as useful when the vehicles have any parity. If it required 5X the volume for an ITS full of people to be happy in transit, then maybe that makes sense, but 2X the people in 2X the volume... nope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou seperate the cargo into dedicated cargo-only ITS\u0027s that don\u0027t interact with the Cycler at all, and arrive ahead of the crew. \u00A0This is worth it even without a Cycler architecture because it allows you to send your cargo on a slower, lower Delta-V trajectory, but with a Cycler it is an absolute necessity in order for the Interceptor to focus on only carrying crew (which is the only type of payload that benefits from a Cycler Ship)\u00A0and make it worthwhile to use one...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for gettimg 2x the crew with 2x the ship space dedicated to crew, that is true, yes. \u00A0But the main benefit of a Cycler, and what makes it worthwhile, is not somehow needing to launch less mass in crew accomodations in order to carry people to Mars, it\u0027s the fuel-savings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith a Cycler architecture, you can pack roughly 2x as many\u00A0people into the Interceptor as into an ITS dedicated solely to crew, but you only need to conduct the same number of Tanker missions to refuel the Interceptor as you would a standard ITS. \u00A0The result is substantial fuel and cost-savings over a number of missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s no coincidence I said you could save $110 million over the course of a number of ITS missions where you relied on a Cycler and an Interceptor where two crew-only standard ITS\u0027s could have held the same number of people- that\u0027s precisely equal to what I estimated the refurbishment and refueling cost of an ITS to be over 11 missions. \u00A0Basically, you still have to refurbish and refuel the Interceptor between missions like you would a normal ITS, but you don\u0027t have to do the same for the Cycler, since it requires very little fuel or maneuver to maintain its orbit and make necessary plane-changes (and what little fuel it DOES need is provided by surplus from the Interceptor each trip- this is also why I said the Interceptor and Cycler together could accomodate 800 people instead of 900- I assumed you\u0027d replace the crew accomodations and life suppory of roughly 100 people on the Interceptor with extra fuel tanks for this purpose-\u00A0which would start out fully-fueled to get the same launch mass as an ITS that could carry 450 people instead of 350...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re only sending 800 people to Mars every two years (not that many\u00A0when our planet has a population of over 7\u00A0billion, and at least 800 million of those are wealthy enough their families could probably afford to travel to Mars at $140,000 a person if they really wanted...) then you only save about $5 million a year in refueling and refurbishment costs this way. \u00A0But if you\u0027re sending 80,000 then that number jumps to $500 million a year, and designing a Cycler Ship becomes much more worthwhile...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMusk was right. \u00A0Cycler Ships are a thing for when you\u0027ve really scaled up your transit system to Mars and are spending a lot of money on refueling ITS\u0027s each year. \u00A0They don\u0027t make sense when your cost\u00A0of mass to LEO and the number of people you\u0027re sending to Mars each year are both low... (not coincidentally Cycler Ships make GREAT sense in the \u0022classical\u0022 scenario we have right now\u00A0where ever kg of mass you send to LEO is incredibly expensive... \u00A0Hence why they made sense to Buzz Aldrin back when he proposed them- he never foresaw anyone finding a way to get mass to orbit as cheaply as SpaceX will be\u00A0able to if their launch-stage reusability works and the ITS booster ends up being as cheap as planned...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, if the fuel tanker architecture Musk proposed turns out to be a lot MORE expensive than projected, then the fuel-savings of a Cycler Ship will really be worthwhile. \u00A0And let\u0027s not forget that if you\u0027re really patient, you can accelerate a Cycler Ship to its Cycler Orbit with nothing hut ion engines, since you don\u0027t have to worry about crew waiting the excruciatingly long time this would take if you establish the Cycler in its orbit unmanned, and only send it crew the next time it swings by Earth...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegards,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNorthstar\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-10-01T03:21:12Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2016 03:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CatastrophicFailure","CreatedById":57438,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-01T03:20:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222782060\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u002288441\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221475286860\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222795\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022softweir\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, softweir said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou missed a point: the regolith is rich in perchlorate salts.
