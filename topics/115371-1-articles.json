What I\u0027m referring to is the way the exhaust changes in appearance as velocity increases and pressure decreases.\n\nThis video is a good example of what I\u0027m talking about:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUJ9Dtyiclw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nNote how at about 1:20 the exhaust is a very fine column, at about 2:30 it\u0027s starting to expand out, at 3:00 it is much wider and has become somewhat transparent, at 3:50 the air is no longer burning red and we can just see a very wide vapour plume. At about 5:20 when the second stage ignites there is no visible exhaust (since there\u0027s no air to react with).\n\nI\u0027m not too learned on the subject of engine exhaust, I\u0027m not even sure the terminology I used was correct, so if I have misunderstood something I\u0027d be happy to learn more about it.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027d very much like to see these sorts of dynamic effects and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the sort of realistic thing Squad has any intention of implementing."},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T06:36:16Z","Content":"HotRockets did have some expanding plum\u0027s [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65754-HotRockets!-Particle-FX-Replacement-Tutorial](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65754-HotRockets!-Particle-FX-Replacement-Tutorial) but think the files for them was in the thread somewhere."},{"CreatedByName":"Buzzou","CreatedById":100703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T07:05:52Z","Content":"I\u0027m pretty sure [Real Effects](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100519-Real-Effects-An-FX-mod-for-Realism-Overhaul-DEV) did, i doubt if it still works though"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T09:16:15Z","Content":"RO does with [https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/wiki](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/wiki)"}]}
