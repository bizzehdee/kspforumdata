At about 5:20 when the second stage ignites there is no visible exhaust (since there\u0027s no air to react with).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not too learned on the subject of engine exhaust, I\u0027m not even sure the terminology I used was correct, so if I have misunderstood something I\u0027d be happy to learn more about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027d very much like to see these sorts of dynamic effects and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the sort of realistic thing Squad has any intention of implementing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mecripp","CreatedById":181994,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T06:36:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHotRockets did have some expanding plum\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65754-HotRockets!-Particle-FX-Replacement-Tutorial\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/65754-HotRockets!-Particle-FX-Replacement-Tutorial\u003C/a\u003E but think the files for them was in the thread somewhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzzou","CreatedById":100703,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T07:05:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100519-Real-Effects-An-FX-mod-for-Realism-Overhaul-DEV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EReal Effects\u003C/a\u003E did, i doubt if it still works though\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T09:16:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERO does with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/wiki\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/KSP-RO/RealPlume/wiki\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
