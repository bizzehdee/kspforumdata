However, you can test it yourself in half an Ike month by setting up the maneuver node for one journey, and then setting the maneuver node up for the other journey when Ike\u0027s on the other side.

The Oberth maneuver would probably be *somewhat* cheaper but at cost of seriously increasing difficulty of the maneuvers.
