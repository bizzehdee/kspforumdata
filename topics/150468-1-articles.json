On a long save (Year 9 and counting ) and on that save only, I cannot seem to get the CommNet GUI to display, either in flight mode or from the Tracking Station. I have tried making a new clean save and have been able to use CommNet on that, as well as on the Transmission scenario. However for some reason I haven\u0027t been able to use it on my main save. KerbNet is working fine to my knowledge.

I think I discovered the issue. I had not yet discovered the difficulty options in-game had a toggle for CommNet among other things, so I went in and edited my persistent.sfs file\u0027s settings and voila \u0022enable CommNet = false\u0022 was what I had. \u00A0A simple flip of code later and I was in business.
