It sounds like the lander is the vehicle that delivered the rover to the surface, and you also have an unnamed probe orbiting Duna. You are on the right tract, all three vehicles can communicate with each other most of the time (I would imaginge the orbital probe loses connection from time to time when it is on its far side of its orbit). What is missing is the manned part of your unmanned mission.
