You might be able to take the module you want to activate individually, drag it off the main ship into its own assembly, then copy it and attach to the main rocket one at a time with symmetry mode disabled. So long as the mount points were created with symmetry, you should still be able to place these symmetrically, but because the modules themselves aren\u0027t part of a symmetry group, they should activate one at a time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf that doesn\u0027t work, I\u0027d report it as a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yes, disabling symmetric activation would be a nice QoL feature either way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
