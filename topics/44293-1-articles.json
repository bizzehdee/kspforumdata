Can carry nearly as much to orbit as the Delta IV Heavy that launched yesterday, and has significantly more thrust than that rocket at liftoff: 13.7 MN vs. the DIV-H\u0027s 9.4MN. The rocket will be launched from the ESA\u0027s Guiana Space Center at Kourou in French Guiana, which is near the equator for equatorial GTO launches. Payload is two communications satellites: one Eutelsat for European commercial and government use and one GSAT, first military communications satellite for India, which will be used by the Indian Navy to communicate with their ships. Liftoff is scheduled for 2030-2120 GMT (1:30-2:20PM PST).
