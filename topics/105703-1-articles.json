It seems to happen more with the FASA clamps than with the stock ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA workaround I usually employ is sticking a couple of radial detachers on the vessel, then attach the clamps either to those or to something you place in between, such as a strut block, to provide a bit of clearance. You then launch as normal (in whatever fashion you like to release your clamps) and then drop the radial detachers afterwards. I have never observed any post-launch clamp-biting when applying this somewhat clumsy approach, and it always fixes the problem for the craft that has \u0027the clamps\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll try this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hotblack Desiato","CreatedById":93895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T21:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Einteresting, so the bug is still in the game\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I found this nice thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128122-Launch-Clamps-follow-me-into-space\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128122-Launch-Clamps-follow-me-into-space\u003C/a\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elet\u0027s hope that this bug gets fixed sooner than later... launchclamps aren\u0027t supposed to fly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WeirdCulture","CreatedById":76591,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-08T22:08:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hotblack Desiato\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hotblack Desiato\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Einteresting, so the bug is still in the game\u003Cp\u003E(I found this nice thread \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128122-Launch-Clamps-follow-me-into-space\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128122-Launch-Clamps-follow-me-into-space\u003C/a\u003E )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have created an infinite loopthread \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alchemist","CreatedById":8825,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T18:29:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I had: clamps appearing in orbit (seemed to be orbiting properly).
