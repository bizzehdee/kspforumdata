In the stock game you have instantaneous control over all unmanned assets anywhere in the solar system, but to transmit data back you still need an antenna.

I think this sort of things can be added, by Squad or by mods, once reputation and the kerbonauts stats become meaningful: send a single kerbonaut in an MK1 lander can in a mission to Eeloo and you take a huge hit on reputation. Plus, the kerbonaut stats become meaningfully bad, to the point that you have to discharge him once he returns. Maybe the game can simulate dementia: reach Eeloo, land, and the kerbonaut will go on EVA on his own, do cartwheels, fail to operate a rover (if any) and do any other crazy stuff (without destroying your ship or refusing to carry out a critical maneuver). Send, however, three kerbonauts in a ship with ample space and their stats improve, your reputation grows and they are fully reliable once they finally reach their destination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere should also be a sort of \u0022time off\u0022 for kerbonauts returning from a mission, as they recover physically and psychologically for the ordeal.

Right now, it\u0027s designed around maneuver nodes, which work for engines that burn for minutes at most. But true ion engines don\u0027t work that way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) True, but it\u0027s a matter of game balance. If the developers rescale the entire Kerbol system and make sure, after rescaling, that the delta-v requirements and the balance remains, then they\u0027ve used valuable time to achieve little in game terms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) Right but, again, gameplay. Nothing prevents any player from refusing to send manned missions to those destinations anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7) Gameplay. Random failures that forces you to abort (or abandon) a well executed mission hinder gameplay if there is nothing you can do about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9) Asparagus Staging is theoretically sound. It\u0027s just that fuel transfers in real life are a lot more complicated that attaching fuel pipes. This is sort of matched by the rather poor specs of the chemical rockets and fuel tanks, though. Before the introduction of the new SLS-like parts, it was very hard to put some payloads in orbit (in stock) without asparagus staging or a cpu-melting part count\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E11) While, on the other hand, they can not possible put any SSTO in orbit. Right now, turbojets are more like ramjets that work a low speeds, or a sort of combination of turbojet and ramjet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E15) What kind of gravity even a class E asteroid would have in the real world?

I agree with Hattivat that something where the \u0022simplified\u0022 version is more confusing than the \u0022realistic\u0022 version needs to be changed. Something similar to NEAR would work well. Fairings would be a nice addition but they aren\u0027t really needed, since a rocket of any shape can get into space with FAR/NEAR if you go slow enough (maybe even as slow as in the stock game...).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Deadly reentry: same as aerodynamics, but should probably be more scaled back than the mod. Something physical (other than solar panels breaking off) should happen when the ship is engulfed in flames. Although this might only be included on a difficulty higher than vanilla.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A sliding scale of difficulty would be awesome. The difficulty slider they\u0027re adding in 0.25 is a good first step in that direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I don\u0027t think the planets should be scaled up much (unless maybe on the harder difficulties). On scaled-up systems, delta-v takes on a much more important role than in the stock game. This forces the player to use more efficient ships, learn optimal launch windows, use gravity assists, etc almost from the start. This also means that the payload is a much smaller fraction of the rocket, which would be mostly fuel. The stock game is a lot more forgiving in that respect. For example, in the stock game a rocket that can land a payload on the Mun is only twice as big as a rocket that only gets that same payload into low Kerbin orbit. In a real-scale system, that rocket ratio would be about 5 or 10 to 1. This makes the other celestial bodies seem much further away, not in terms of distance but in terms of delta-v, and how hard it is to get to each one. From a gameplay perspective, this means that a much smaller fraction of the playerbase would be able to visit other celestial bodies (and would need CPU-breaking monster rockets to do so). The much smaller available payloads would also make rockets seem much less efficient than in the stock game, and would rule out many of the crazy designs people come up with to put into orbit or on other bodies. And there\u0027s also the much longer burn times required. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think a scale-up of 1.5 to 2 times the current game would work pretty well (and would balance out the delta-v gain due to smoother aerodynamics). But anything bigger would make the game less fun overall (at least for non-advanced players).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- n-body gravity: totally unneeded. It has almost no advantages from a gameplay perspective over conic-patch, and many disadvantages. And it\u0027s only marginally more educationally instructive. Unless there are equal-sized closely orbiting bodies put into the game, it makes about as much sense to include as relativistic effects.

We need more realism. Therefore:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Fix the aerodynamics immediately. The stock implementation is completely unintuitive and offers the new player no experience whatsoever they can draw upon.

It\u0027s backwards and teaches players the wrong thing. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Fix jet engines so that they work in a realistic manner. ferram4 has gone on at length about this in other places. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Fix the solar system so it has a realistic size (Note: Keep the Kerbin system, it fits the Kerbals just fine, and I like Kerbals!) One way to make it friendlier to newer players is to have Kerbin as a realistic planet with a gravity of 0.75 G. Using realistic engines and part masses would make launches from such a Kerbin a breeze, and pretty quick, while retaining a fairly decent payload fraction. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add proper reentry heating and effects that really mean something. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add life support. It perfectly illustrates the difficulties involved in space flight, just like reentry heating. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add axial tilt to planets. Give Kerbin a mild tilt, enough to make launches from other latitudes than the equator mean something. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Utilize the asteroid generation routine to its full potential and add more objects in: KBOs, Jool trojans, comets, an asteroid belt, etc... \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Realistic fuels and such would be awesome, but they\u0027re not really needed (besides, gives us something to mod).

They\u0027d be able to recreate rocket launches that look like actual rocket launches, with very little effort.
