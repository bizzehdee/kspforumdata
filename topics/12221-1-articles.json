It was early morning, and the tower was still lit up by the floodlights of several small vehicles placed around it. Eerie shadows played across the stark white hull of their Veto Aerospace \u003Cem\u003EIbis\u003C/em\u003E version 2. Oscar spoke first. \u0027Just looking at that bird makes me want to go push trollies at a supermarket. Way safer.\u0027 Rufam turned to look at the Commander. \u0027You know that the only reason these ships crashed was because of Kerbal error?\u0027 Munble joined in, counting the crashes on his fingers. \u0027Pilot error, unsafe flight direction from ground, and, oh yeah, pilot error again.\u0027 he said, referring to the losses of all three previous \u003Cem\u003EIbis\u003C/em\u003E class spaceplanes. \u0027These things have it in for us somehow.\u0027 replied Oscar. \u0027You just don\\\u0027t believe it yet.\u0027 Rufam put on a mock-shock face. \u0027You scared?\u0027 Oscar turned to face him. \u0027Hell yes. Doesn\\\u0027t make me a coward.\u0027 he said, before striding off towards the VAB. \u0027I\\\u0027m getting my kit on. You slackers coming or not?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHarsh sunlight glinted through the cockpit window. However, the three Kerbals had the helmets\\\u0027 sun visors up, to prevent themselves being blinded. Loss of vision could be disastrous for the mission, and the Space Program wasn\\\u0027t going to lose its pilots so easily. Not after learning it the hard way. The launch control link crackled with static, before a woman\\\u0027s voice rose above it. \u0027\u003Cem\u003EIbis IV\u003C/em\u003E, Deltal GC. Confirm vessel prepared for launch? Go/no go poll was a-ok.\u0027 Oscar hit the transmit button and held it down. \u0027Deltal GC, \u003Cem\u003EIbis IV\u003C/em\u003E, confirmed. Go for flight.\u0027 There was a moment where the link was silent. \u0027Ok, booster ignition in T-60 seconds. Counterweight drop in T-75 seconds.\u0027 The counterweight was a full tank of fuel that would be dropped immediately after clearing the tower - it was there to solve launch instability problems that had caused prototype Ibis X1s to crash into the tower despite SAS and apparently being balanced. Crude, but surprisingly effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u002710... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Booster ignition.\u0027 The four huge liquid engines under the stack lit up like a bonfire, sending tonnes of thrust downward. \u0027Pad clamps off.\u0027 The stack left ground. \u0027\u003Cem\u003EIbis IV\u003C/em\u003E has cleared the tower.\u0027 And it did, The vessel swayed alarmingly, but did not reach the angle nescersary for it to tear itself apart against the tower. \u0027And 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Drop counterweight.\u0027 A number of explosive bolts popped, and the decoupler fell away from the stack, carrying its fuel tank with it. The stack straightened up. \u0027Go for throttle up.\u0027 The powerful engines were given use of their full power. Up in the cockpit, warning lights came on. \u0027Boosters overheat. Let\\\u0027s throttle down some.\u0027 he said, and Rufam gently slid the engine controls down a little. The warning lights went out. The vessel was barelling up into the sky, vibrating heavily. The G-forces pushed the three Kerbonauts into their seats. The altimeter counted their ascent, while another system measured the atmospheric density outside.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEventually, the needle slid into the dark blue, and the altimeter read 36,000 metres. \u0027Complete engine shutdown.\u0027 came a message over the control link. \u0027In progress.\u0027 replied Oscar, as Rufam put the four boosters out of action. \u0027Engage Reaction Control System. he told them. \u0027Disengage Stabilisation of Attitude System.\u0027 Rufam was in a state of full concentration, working the controls swiftly and carefully. The RCS jets each emitted a muffled \u003Cem\u003Ebang\u003C/em\u003E when they were fired, a sound that reached them by passing through the metal structure of the ship. \u0027Attitude attained.\u0027 muttered Rufam. \u0027Ok,\u0027 said Munble, \u0027get us to 24,500 m/s. Perigee 75,000 metres is our minimum target.\u0027 Rufam put the throtttle up to one quarter power. After that, he gently slid it up. The ship buffetted around violently - an effect which had been fatal for many earlier missions of the Space Program. Oscar and Munble watched the console\\\u0027s centre navigation screen, which was displaying a 3D view of Kerbin, and their currently sub-orbital flight path. The flight path\\\u0027s arc grew longer and its apogee higher as the engines rammed them forwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA jolt sent pain through the spines of each Kerbonaut, and slammed them forwards, as the boosters cut out. They had no more fuel to burn. \u0027Booster seperation.\u0027 said Oscar, as he operated the appropriate system. More explosive bolts fired, and the boosters were cut adrift, to come down somewhere over the ocean. Meanwhile, Rufam was preparing the NERVA engines that would get them to orbit. \u00273, 2, 1...\u0027 he murmered, \u0027Main engine ignition.\u0027 Two NERVA engines began sending their exhaust blasting out of their nozzles, rocketing the \u003Cem\u003EIbis\u003C/em\u003E faster and faster. The flight path simulation\\\u0027s arc extended and extended. Eventually, it formed a ring. Oscar tapped a control, and the simulation turned 2D, as if give a bird\\\u0027s eye view, perpendicular to the plane of their orbit. The ring grew, and a marker apppeared, reading \\\u0027Pe - 1233\\\u0027, with the number going up by the millisecond. Finally, after what seemed like an age, the Pe marker reached 75,000. \u0027MECO.\u0027 stated Rufam, as he slammed the throttle back, choking the NERVA engines. \u0027So,\u0027 he said, turning to Munble, \u0027Where\\\u0027re we going, Navigator?\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[TO BE CONTINUED]\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LaydeeDem","CreatedById":5984,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-06-10T08:47:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENice job!

Finally, clearence had been given to make a trans-Minmus burn. Of course, that wasn\\\u0027t technically what it was, it was a burn to get apogee out to Minmus\\\u0027s orbit. It wouldn\\\u0027t intercept, not yet. More interesting things would come later. Commander Oscar spoke, shattering the silence that had only occasionally been punctuated by reports from Mission Control or from Munble and Rufam\\\u0027s jibes; \u0027Initiate burn in 15 seconds... 10... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and ignition.\u0027 \u0027Ignition confirmed.\u0027 replied Rufam, who was throttling up the engines. Munble watched the orbital mechanics simulation intently. \u0027Speed climbing. Attitude good, SAS holding.\u0027 The \u003Cem\u003EIbis X\u003C/em\u003E class had had troubles with SAS in the past, but only through overly violent initial thrusts. Gradually, the simulation showed the orbit extending outwards, past the Mun, at which point Munble told Rufam to slow down. Rufam put the throttle at 1/8, until Munble confirmed that the apogee was at the correct altitude. The three crew looked at each other for a moment. \u0027Good so far.\u0027 muttered Oscar, who settled into his chair to wait.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe waiting was long. Several days after launch now, and the \u003Cem\u003EIbis X 4\u003C/em\u003E was preparing for circularisation thrusts. Not enough to put them in a completely circular orbit, or they would never have the fuel to get back to Kerbin. Rufam was fiddling with the RCS, getting the bearings just right. All was the silence of concentration. This had to be done right. Previous \u003Cem\u003EBluebird\u003C/em\u003E missions had to be abandoned because fuel wasn\\\u0027t spent carefully enough. Several minutes of concentration later, Rufam announced he had the right bearing, and was ready to fire engines on Mission Control\\\u0027s guidance. Munble confirmed that the direction was right. The launch control link woman\\\u0027s voice crackled over the radio. \u0027Deltal GC, \u003Cem\u003EIbis IV\u003C/em\u003E, telemetry confirms you are on target. Ok for thrust in 22 seconds.\u0027 Oscar spoke: \u0027Copy that Deltal, Preparing to fire.\u0027 Muble started humming. Rufam recognised the tune and whistled to it. Oscar sighed, but let them continue. They were professional enough that this wouldn\\\u0027t affect their judgement too much. Besides, it wasn\\\u0027t like they had to thrust \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E at apogee. Minmus was, after all, an entire moon, and a little leeway could be given for getting into its sphere of influence. The engines fired, and the simulation displayed their increasing speed and its effect on their orbit which was, as expected, widening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
