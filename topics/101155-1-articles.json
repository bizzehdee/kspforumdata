But I have a (small) suggestion. Squad, can you make it possible to assign an analog axis to a button binding? That it just \u0022Presses the button\u0022 if you press it fully? For instance that would make it possible to assign the brakes to the LT so you can drive with a rover like you would normally do in driving games using RT to accelerate and LT to brake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually don\u0027t know how small this is to implement, but I would love to see it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind Regards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eviccie211\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-03T15:31:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, it\u0027d be nice to have default settings for a 360 controller.
