This was all accomplished mainly with reductions in drag, from replacement of the ram air intakes with shock cones, reduction in the number of *mostly* unnecessary struts, and addition of shock cones to the ends of the RAPIERs to create RapierSpikes. With the higher speeds achievable and the new heating, be careful with the canards; they will explode if you\u0027re not paying attention.\n\n-Ojimak"}]}
