But i still haven\u0027t managed go really get in to orbit lately, whats on offer in the demo pack isn\u0027t much not without going really nuts and designing something really wacko, (i know thats the object, but i know a bit about engineering and i tend to think conventanally)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am still having trouble getting used to the steering and setting up the stability, my stacks seem to like tipping over even with the SAS on, i check the COG, COT and the areodynamics before each flight but still i have the problem.. nothing for it but to keep trying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill its a load of fun and a welcome reielf from hours on Farming Simulator 2013, and looking around on you tube has found tutorials and some great movies- give them a look wonderful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there anything i can add to the demo version, since i\u0027m still saving for the full version of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"diomedea","CreatedById":93700,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T09:38:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi husheruk,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eas you know, the demo can only give you a basic set of the capabilities of the real game. If you already find the demo addictive (as it is for most of us here), the complete game will add a lot to your experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what you show, there is still something to learn about building and flying techniques. Even with the limits of the few parts available in the demo, is definitely possible to build stable crafts, to achieve orbit, and to reach Mun. Enough to keep playing for a bt, while getting the knack of things also frequenting the forum and watching some tutorials or videos if you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne thing however that can\u0027t be done with the demo (or at least, care was taken by Squad to avoid the possibility) is to exploit it with additions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kurja","CreatedById":66303,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T11:20:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewhat version is the demo these days?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Great General Kaboomsky","CreatedById":96553,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:51:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not a great engineer or anything, but when I was first playing the demo, I know I had trouble with the front-end of my rockets not being heavy enough. As the cliche goes, I was trying to throw the dart backward, with all the weight to the rear. This inevitably causes the rocket to go all topsy-turvy once you build up some speed. Shifting weight forward helped immensely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s not your problem, do you have a gimble-capable engine or active control surfaces on the first stage? While it is fully possible to build a stable un-guided rocket, its really helpful to have some steering capability in the beginning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou should totally be able to make orbit without building anything crazy, even with the demo parts. One relatively long first stage with a more powerful engine to get you up to altitude and gain part of the necessary sideways momentum and one relatively short, stubby second stage with a more efficient engine to build up enough lateral momentum to circularize the orbit. I think I tend to use 1 LV-T45 \u0022Swivel\u0022 engine with two FL-T800 fuel tanks for the first stage and a LV-909 \u0022Terrier\u0022 engine with a FL-T400 fuel tank, a decoupler and a 1-man capsule for the second stage, but there are many possible ways to arrange a successful orbiter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, sounds like you\u0027re already watching them, but Scott Manley has some great tutorials. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEmqpOkQZCl5SZB5t0vXuxE0\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany happy launches!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T12:58:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kurja\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kurja\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ewhat version is the demo these days?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe demo is based on 1.0 (not 1.02) but is limited in content.

Just the LV-T30 and some boosters IIRC. It\u0027s still possible to build a rocket that orbits, gets to the Mun, lands and returns in the demo though. I would suggest utilizing the build tools in the top left to offset your engine into the fuel tank so that the lander legs will work properly. Of course if you\u0027re just wanting to orbit, try this: command pod with parachute, small inline reaction wheel, 2 tanks, engine, decoupler, 10 tanks, engine. No fins or boosters. Press T and space, it should go straight up. At 7000M pitch slowly on the 90 degree vector. Not too fast. The first stage should get you to space, second stage to circularize, and there should be more than enough fuel to return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just tested this exact rocket in the demo, and it worked just fine even though my orbit was terrible and I wasted a crap ton of fuel.

This means your CoM may drift backwards (depending on your staging) as you burn.
