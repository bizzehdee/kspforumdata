I\u0027m currently musing over the creation of some parts for the construction of medium-large rovers, but beforehand, I felt it necessary to do a little research and gather the insight of my fellow kerbonauts. Thus, I would like to posit a few questions regarding your personal criteria when designing your own aforementioned medium or large rovers, and get the ball rolling on what I hope to be an educational discussion on the subject.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMoving on, I would like to split this topic into two major parts; One concerning rovers for use on worlds with moderate gravity, eg. Duna, and another concerning rovers for use on low-gravity bodies, such as the Mun, or Minmus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how would you folks go about designing rovers for these environments? For example, what kind of footprint do your rovers generally posses, how do you cope with various inclines or rough terrain, and how do you go about designing something for a given task, such as Kethane mining, or moving other objects over the surface of a given celestial body? Go nuts, be as detailed as you like, I most certainly look forward to your replies! c:\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmicScientist","CreatedById":78000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T16:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhilst I never go overly big, usually either enough for science equipment and a sight-seeing tour through the cameras of a rover or just enough for a buggy that isn\u0027t going to weigh me down on the launchpad because I\u0027m still just trying to explore and plant a flag on almost all celestial bodies in the system. I find that planning rovers for Gilly-like conditions is best in any situation so you\u0027ll have little as possible chance for it to tip, make sure its base is wide and possibly long, rotate the wheels to almost 45 degrees (so shift\u002Beight twists to 40 degrees as it doesn\u0027t register wheels at 45 or beyond I find) to make the profile as low as you can without causing anything on the bottom to hit the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I\u0027m on Minmus, I take advantage of its superbly flat and frozen ground and put on the airplane wheels that have no maximum speed and let ion engines take me to where I want to go if I need to go quickly (getting to orbit this way is certainly fun).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor rough terrain, I\u0027m still puzzling how to make something to my aesthetic taste but if you take the structural girders and plonk wheels on them, you\u0027ll find they can give better suspension when on places like the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn because they bend to the landscape from where they\u0027re joined to the body of your rover, they probably will do worse and worse when you use them on large enough rigs such as Kethane would likely bring.

Low CoM, wide wheel base, and ASAS for stability when it \u0022catches air,\u0022 plus lots of wheels to distribute the stress so blowing wheels is minimized, are the features that make it successful. It works best in higher gravity, and used RCS on Minmus for those exciting \u0022airborne\u0022 moments.

It\u0027s a small plane so it can get from island to island on Laythe, and can land/take off in surprisingly small areas. When its nose gear is raised, the two front rover wheels are lowered to the ground to put the ship in rover mode. It can handle steep slopes approached at an angle (you have to learn to drive the contours of the landscape), and even handles well at 2x or 3x time warp on moderate terrain. The things that are most dangerous to it (and many rovers) are hitting v-bottom valley at speed, or trying to run along the top of a sharp ridge (where it can bottom out and rip off the jet engine). There have been a couple times where I\u0027ve accidentally (or purposefully) taken it over a sharp drop off, and it was able to survive because it could glide down to a safe landing. The aircraft landing gear are very resistant to damage, and possibly the ship\u0027s mostly-triangular wheel layout makes it handle rough terrain well...but I haven\u0027t tried that configuration on airless bodies yet...mainly because the landing gear weigh a LOT compared to rover wheels (although it\u0027s not clear if KSP actually counts the mass of the landing gear in flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qy8kVJg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022qy8kVJg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wO0geWy.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022wO0geWy.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-24T20:51:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/24/2013 08:51  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 24, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Brotoro\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Zoom","CreatedById":8333,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-24T20:42:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Levelord\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Levelord\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI made a dune bike for a Duna mission recently.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*drools* .craaaaaaaaft\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T06:16:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis thread inspired me to play with some rovers... trying to make something suitable for Vall.
