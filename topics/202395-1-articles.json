I can\u0027t say I\u0027m too worried for that happening to kerbal though. I don\u0027t see much of a way to rigidly base the game on realistic physics and make the gameplay more simplistic in an ungratifying manner. Sure, some of us who came to kerbal with a background in physics or a knack for it were able to figure out a bit about orbital mechanics with little guidance but I don\u0027t think I would be much less satisfied just because somewhat hand holdy tutorials are introduced.

KSP is amazing but there are some tricky concepts to wrap your mind around at first and I love the simple graphical way they\u0027re approaching tutorials. There are some core tasks that take some time learn: gravity turns, maneuvers, transfers, docking, landing without an atmosphere, etc. that took a long time for me to really master.\u00A0I love that they\u0027re creating little vignettes to help players into that and bring in new fans of of the game.\u00A0The thing is though once you\u0027ve built up those core skills you\u0027re off to the races and can do almost anything. Once you\u0027ve gotten through this initial learning phase and start contemplating colony building I do hope they keep a least a little sophistication, that the mechanics of balancing resources are simple to understand and employ but still challenging to perfect.
