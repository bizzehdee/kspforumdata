To rephrase Zarakon\u0027s point, out of all the possible velocities two objects might have relative to each other, what are the odds that the conditions are right to result in a closed orbital path? The odds that this would result by chance are indeed pretty low, which is why in the game, it only results from intentional manuevering.

An unstable mass such as the soon-to-be moon could have been easily captured if it was ejected from the planet at a relatively slow velocity, but not too slow as to cause it to rebound.
