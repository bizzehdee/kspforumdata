I\u0027ve tried using the standard SAS mode to fix this, however, my plane wobbles a lot, so I\u0027m not exactly sure which angle the SAS is trying to move to, and secondly, the fuel drain changes the center of mass. So have anybody in here faced this problem, and how did you solve it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T21:57:18Z","Content":"Pilot Assistant (link in signature) has an altitude control system.

Short answer is that \u0022level flight\u0022 is a foreign concept in KSP no matter how you choose to fly.\n\nAs far as fuel drain changing the center of mass goes, though, there is something you can do about it - there\u0027s this wonderful little mod called RCS Build Aid, which I\u0027d recommend to anyone wanting to get serious about planes regardless of aero model. Among its many useful features is an indicator for the \u0022dry center of mass\u0022, i.e. where the CoM will be when all the fuel tanks are empty. It\u0027s a good indicator of which way the mass will tend to shift as you fly, and you can use it to where you can balance your fuel load so that it won\u0027t shift around in flight when you\u0027re designing your planes.\n\nEDIT: Mostly ninja\u0027d."},{"CreatedByName":"Runezor","CreatedById":140317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T22:04:08Z","Content":"Thank you!

Then go to the far Gui and enter the values. On the right upper side at level flight there is shown the AoA. So try to angle your plane as given or preangle your wings. The plane have to be stable at cruise altitude and velocity, wing shape determines mostly stability during level flight. Use TAC Fuelbalancer or goodspeed fuel pump, and assure the dry and wet COM are in the same place. I mostly use PilotAssistent SAS Assistant for smooth flight, if the plane is well balanced, you can physical timewarp up to x4. Another way could be using KOS.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-02T18:55:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2015 06:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by funk**"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T19:32:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Short answer is that \u0022level flight\u0022 is a foreign concept in KSP no matter how you choose to fly.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E capi3101, with far I managed to build a cargo plane that followed the curve of kerbin by itself for around 15 minutes before having drifted a few meters up or down.

The extra \u0022stability\u0022 is mostly down to the reduced rate of CoM shift and often a bit of luck with trim/altitude/airspeed (the CoM shift could also be self stabilising, but that\u0027s fairly rare)"}]}
