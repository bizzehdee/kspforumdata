Short answer, you\u0027re using an outdated version of M2X, and need at least the most recent version of the NFE patch (below). Long answer, earlier versions of M2X\u0027s NFE patch lacked an exhaustCooling value, which is why the Heat Rejected value for your Rontgen stays at 80kw instead of 880kw at full throttle. Replace the contents of your Mk2Expansion/Patches/Mk2X\\_NFE\\_Functionality.cfg with this\n\u003E \n\nUpdated the mod and now works like a charm.
