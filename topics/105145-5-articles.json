Despite this it can lift 36 tons of cargo to an ~80 km equatorial orbit. Weighing on the pad at 155.9 according to stock engineer\u0027s report (155.06 according to MJ) that gives it a cargo to orbit capacity or 23.09% (23.22% according the MJ). \n\nTo reach orbit with 36 tons of cargo: Launch with one pair of jet fuel tanks empty. Take off at 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to 5 km (Do not exceed 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 during take off), then 15\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to 10 km (should be exceeding 500 m/s at 10 km), then 20\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 to apogee, coast at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and circularize at apogee. Turn off jet engines when they flame out (custom01), close pre-cooler intakes (custom06) when Rapier engines switch to rocket mode. \n\nFor landing I used MJ to see a predicted landing spot. Retro burn at antipolar to the spaceport achieving a periapsis of 41.6 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B1 0.1 km with the predicted landing spot at the space port. Re-enter at at a 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 angle until the spot moves 100-30 km before the space port then level off to 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until the spot returns to the spaceport, repeat until reaching 1500 m/s at which point you can\u0027t do an angle of attack that steep. Continue at 10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until reaching 500 m/s, then dive at -45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 until below 10 km, then turn around if overshot spaceport or simply level off at 3 km. Turn on Turbo Ramjet engines to ~66% until close to spaceport, then to 33% while landing such that landing speed is between 100-150 m/s. \n\nMy contender is provided below as is with two locked X200-32 tanks as dummy cargo mass. The rules don\u0027t say the cargo needs to be one mass, but it can launch with one Jumbo-64 instead. \n\n[http://www./download/xrf7naptx143p27/Xylol_SSTO.zip](http://www./download/xrf7naptx143p27/Xylol_SSTO.zip)\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.

Do the pre-coolers do anything? I just have them on their because I \\*think\\* they do something, could they be replaced by any other kind of intake? I went with ram air intakes over the cones because they of aesthetics and lighter weight, the cones can be shut off and that means less drag, but when I shut off the pre-cooler intakes early in the flight profile I notice no benefit. So I don\u0027t know if the drag is appreciable. \n\n2. Every strut is sacred? I strutted the wings to reduce deformation and without them... your going to have a bad day, but how do stuts work exactly? I figure they need to attach parts to parts that are not directly attached together. That rear chime is the linch pin though, but it does not need to be strut-ed to the inner engines, here in Xylol SSTO A I prettied the struts even more and have it connected the wing parts, it performs the same.\n\n3. Why do RCS cause a lot of drag? It seems to be depended on part count and not just RCS type, here in Xylol SSTO B I minimized RCS thusters to what is absolutely needed for travel along every dimension, even so I see an appreciable performance loss and do not recommend lifting more then 27 tons with it. \n\n4. How do cargo bay work? The code seems a bit wishy-washy. Xylol SSTO B I have to launch with cargo bays open, then close them before take off to make sure the RCS tanks and docking ports are counted as inside the cargo bay and thus drag is negated, if not it won\u0027t even make orbit with 27 tons. \n\n[http://www./download/8umhcpp8wg4n457/Xylol_SSTO_A\u0026B.zip](http://www./download/8umhcpp8wg4n457/Xylol_SSTO_A\u0026B.zip)"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:30:56Z","Content":"1.

Struts apparently produce a [disproportionate amount of drag](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/122688-Something-doesn-t-seem-right-here), so minimizing the number of them is a useful goal (I wasn\u0027t aware of this when I made my entry, I should see if it performs better with no struts). Some are necessary though, can\u0027t have the ship being a wobbly mess.\n\n3. Might be related to #2, perhaps physicsless parts are having drag troubles. \\*shrug\\*\n\n4.
