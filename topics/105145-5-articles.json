Do the pre-coolers do anything? I just have them on their because I *think* they do something, could they be replaced by any other kind of intake? I went with ram air intakes over the cones because they of aesthetics and lighter weight, the cones can be shut off and that means less drag, but when I shut off the pre-cooler intakes early in the flight profile I notice no benefit. So I don\u0027t know if the drag is appreciable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Every strut is sacred? I strutted the wings to reduce deformation and without them... your going to have a bad day, but how do stuts work exactly?

Why do RCS cause a lot of drag?
