Now most of would probably question the use in that however, making replicas with cargo bays can be hard due to their shear size. I believe making an Mk.1 cargo bay and more .625 meter parts is the way to go. This suggestion was inspired by the F-35B. My question is, what if we do get that, then we can put hidden VTOL engines and actually store internal cargo in our Mk.1 ships. What do you guys think?
