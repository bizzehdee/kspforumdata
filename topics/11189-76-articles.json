But, refuelling breaks the rules of the challenge.\n\nHowever, would it be fair to use composite SSTO missions? For instance, an SSTO spaceplane dedicated to going to Laythe, launching into orbit, expending its fuel. Another SSTO spaceplane, dedicated to bringing up fuel, supplies the Laythe craft with fuel, then returns. The first craft then goes to Laythe and completes its mission. Would that break the rules, since there is refueling, or would all craft involved being single-stage-to-orbit spaceplanes make it compliant?"},{"CreatedByName":"Mic_n","CreatedById":27054,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T14:12:38Z","Content":"I think the concept is that it\u0027s one craft.\n\nTechnically, two single-stage craft are.. two stages ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\nJust personal opinion there, of course.

But during the descent, I managed to totally avoid significant re-entry heating by pitching to 40\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 above the horizon until around 40 km. \n\nI should probably add that this was the second flight of my first SSTO design in 1.0.2 (and my second serious SSTO design attempt ever). ![Z6I7DezNZt2tAlQBoWMEYV3_9S9n5OJYxaususOzBVd6Rb0Sn-hjgIlzSp-N7MJixZs9LrypAE7VYoXmmwxx-mkEk4gQ1TF2Q2O2hn3JLkWY2kKDmRcatXo7YIVfPhCRea8hPiA](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Z6I7DezNZt2tAlQBoWMEYV3_9S9n5OJYxaususOzBVd6Rb0Sn-hjgIlzSp-N7MJixZs9LrypAE7VYoXmmwxx-mkEk4gQ1TF2Q2O2hn3JLkWY2kKDmRcatXo7YIVfPhCRea8hPiA) I should be able to fly SSTO Tsiolkovsky without needing RCS for the de-orbit burn- I was impatient and did a couple maneuver nodes earlier than I should have, which probably wasted fuel. Also, the screenshot system on my computer automatically throttles up the engines, which made me even less efficient.\n\nNext up: see if I can get Tsiolkovsky on a one-way trip to Ike!

Let me know if I missed anything. Its worth remarking that the K-Prize has become more of a challenge with the new physics so its gratifying to see these effective spaceplanes in action. I am certainly taking a few pointers myself and I am sure that other KSP players will likewise find these designs instructive.
