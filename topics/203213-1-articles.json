Thanks for coming to check me out. i\u0027m a small time KSP youtuber, who is just trying to get into some simple KSP streams. I am going to be playing some KSP with Kerbalism, and a long list of other mods, and I would love to have you all join me starting this journey out into the Kerbal Solar System. Come check it out when you have an opportunity. I\u0027ll be streaming from 9:30 pm CST till around midnight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nrtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
