It means the version will be completely stable.\u00A0 And to be honest, unless its a significant bug fix, these version bumps are not really bringing much anything new to those of us who run mods. \u00A0 They should really be treated like maintenance releases on a case by case basis, since they are scheduled by date and not by function or content\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nUsually its [Major].[Minor].[Maint/Rev].buildnumber\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nChanging the minor every 90 days can be a bit misleading.\u00A0 If you see something go from 1.5 to 1.6 you expect some sort of significant change, although there might not be any in terms of actual game functionality for a large portion of players (common \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E usage for years). Squad wasn\u0027t originally a development company, so I guess they kind of wing it - for example, going from one unity version to another with a loss of backward compatibility should have merited an increment in the major version from 1.x to 2.x. Or do it like Blizzard does with WoW, increment a major with each expansion, and the minor moves up with large updates to content, and the patch level is for bug fixes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe way I was taught is that Major only when there is a change to central functioning or multiple APIs are changed with no backward compatibility. Minor only when there is a significant addition of core functionality with backward compatibility, or a single API with limited impact is changed with no backward compatibility. Maint is for scheduled releases from a process standpoint (quarterly releases, finished a bugfix sprint, small addition to content, etc), as well as urgent releases like bug fixes or minor non-vital content additions (recolored or new model for existing content).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr it could be something simple: Like marketing is driving version numbers, something that\u0027s not all that uncommon (Windows 10 not 9, etc).\u00A0 And I have to admit seeing 1.6 instead of 1.5.2 and 1.7 instead of 1.5.3 does \u003Cem\u003Elook \u003C/em\u003Ea bit more impressive from a marketing standpoint (and I want them to stay in business, I love this game)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-22T20:42:23Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2018 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Murdabenne\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ehit enter too soon\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
