As Nibb mentioned, they are susceptible to vandalism and there is a risk of injury and damage. There are also the equally difficult problems of how to integrate them into the existing air traffic system. Even if they are restricted to flying outside of controlled airspace in daylight VFR conditions, they would need a means to \u0022see and avoid\u0022 other air traffic. You can\u0027t rely on the human piloted aircraft to do all of the seeing and avoiding, and the entire fleet of existing aircraft is not currently equipped with transponders suitable for electronic collision avoidance.

It\u0027s part of the fun. These things run on batteries. Batteries run out. Bugs happen. Data connections fail. Interference occurs. Wind blows. Sensors fail. Things crash. If they are carrying valuable stuff, then the stuff is lost. Simply finding a place to safely drop the parcel is going to be hard in an urban area. How does it know which window or balcony is yours? How does it know that it\u0027s safe to leave the parcel there? Does it drop the parcel on your doorstep so anyone can pick it up? How does it detect obstacles, vehicles, people? What if a dog pounces on it while it\u0027s on the ground? What happens if it gets lost? Developing reliable software is going to be a huge challenge for things like this.
