The same could be done for two bodies, but it turns out that, in that case, the differential equation can be simplified so that Kepler\u0027s laws fall out and we can solve for the position of both bodies at any point in time. However, doing so requires solving some tricky inverse-trigonometric functions to link the area swept out by a body (which increases linearly in time) to its actual position, which (I gather) adds up to a fairly hefty computing load when this happens every time-step for every body in the solar system, while AndreyATGB\u0027s \u003Cem\u003EN\u003C/em\u003E-body solver (and eggrobin\u0027s plugin, presumably) just has to add up the forces and tweak each body\u0027s velocity at every time-step. (There\u0027s probably a bit more to it than that, since there\u0027s some prediction and filtering, but everything is being solved \u0022forward\u0022, which is much easier than solving backwards.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis comes at a price: because the solution is no longer closed-form, and because our computers only have a finite amount of precision, we cannot predict with certainty where any body will be at any given time. This is where the property of symplecticity comes in (and this is where my knowledge starts to run out -- I am an aerospace engineer and have some coursework in numerical analysis and astrodynamics, but I\u0027m not eggrobin or AndreyATGB, so if any of this is different from how they\u0027re doing it, listen to them...). Eggrobin\u0027s solver is set up so that it can guarantee that certain system properties (things like energy or angular momentum) are conserved. This will preserve the \u0022character\u0022 of each body\u0027s trajectory, even if the exact details might vary -- if I leave a spacecraft sufficiently deep in Kerbin\u0027s gravity well, for example, I won\u0027t find it zooming out of the solar system if I let my system run in time-warp for a while. That said, it probably won\u0027t be in exactly the same orbit (as happens to real satellites).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis also opens up possibilities for recreating advanced space missions. By placing a satellite\u0027s energy at key threshold values, I can sit back and wait and let it pop out of the Kerbin system (for example) without having to spend the fuel to escape (at the cost of having to wait). This is great for getting larger scientific payloads to other planets, if not so helpful for crewed missions (though it might be good for getting ISRU and other infrastructure pre-deployed).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T22:30:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a common misconception.

It\u0027s much harder than solving the simple Kepler\u0027s equation, but by no means impossible. In fact, it turns out that there is a perfectly good method of solving those equations well enough for the purpose of a computer simulation. Principia will be using that to solve the N-body problem numerically, in real time. This does not, contrary to popular belief, require a supercomputer.
