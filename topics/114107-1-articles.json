Or at least that adds a button \u0022mark as debris\u0022 because I\u0027m playing career mode and have lots of rescue contracts completed, so my tracking station vessel list became terribly long. I know that I can rename it before I get the kerbal out of cockpit, but not all parts allow me to do so (and sometimes I just forget it). And I know that there is a big red button to remove the vessel from tracking station, but looks like this button completely destroy the vessel (and I want that this part to have a chance of colliding with my other launches)."},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:00:20Z","Content":"The stock game allows you to rename vessels from the tracking station.\n\nSelect a spacecraft in the tracking station.\n\nClick on the \u0022i\u0022 button that appears on the right of the screen.\n\nClick on the name of the vessel in the info panel that appears.\n\n\u003E ![screenshot348.png](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4057920/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/v1.0/Screenshots/screenshot348.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-25T11:02:59Z\u0022 title=\u002206/25/2015 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by maltesh**"},{"CreatedByName":"buzuc","CreatedById":60507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T11:51:46Z","Content":"Or simply remove the debris from the tracking station...
