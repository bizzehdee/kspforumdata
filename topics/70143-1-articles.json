At start up, it would work like a SRB, burning through its fuel and gaining speed. As time goes on, the rocket would go faster, and the fuel\u002Boxidizier mix would get consumed, until it is almost completely consumed and the thing flies close to mach 1, when you open the intake and use atmospheric oxygen to burn pure fuel, or a fuel rich mix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EObviously, such a design would be more expensive than either a SRB or a solid fuel ramjet, with the intake control and and layers of different fuel mixes, but it would combine the thrust at zero speed of SRBs with the much higher ISP of ramjets, while staying relatively simple. The intake control could be something as simple as a one-way valve, opening only when ram pressure becomes larger than chamber pressure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother variation on the concept would be to start as a hybrid rocket rather than SRB. That way, you could use a single grain with no solid oxidizer, but you would need a turbopump and a tank of oxidizer, which would probably result in something heavier and more expensive than a SRB/ramjet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T14:46:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAFAIK most air breathing proposals falls apart because the rocket doesn\u0027t stay in the atmosphere for long enough for it to make sense when you take the added structural weight in to account.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-22T14:50:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECongratulations, you have just invented the air-augmented SRB!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a clever arrangement, there is never any need for closeable intakes or valving.
