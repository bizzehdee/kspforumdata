I\u0027ve been using a second pod for the 1 person ones and 2 inline cockpits \u002B a pod for the 3s but it is a tough stack to get aloft. And pretty bad to land too.

If they want a pilot (Or is that the tourism mod?) then just stack 3 of them and use 3 radial chutes.\n\n3 Mk1 capsules is about 2 tons, which is pretty small by KSP standards. If you can get a science vessel landed on Mun you can cart 3 guys up to LKO.\n\nHere\u0027s a vid of my mission with a pretty simple (and low tech) ship that got 2 people into space and even brought a satellite to complete some of those contracts.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/8RsmKPLjrVM?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T05:44:51Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 05:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**"},{"CreatedByName":"monophonic","CreatedById":76902,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T05:58:13Z","Content":"You don\u0027t have to take them all on the same flight.
