I can also add an extra cost to them. I can also make it where ou can select whether you want the collector added or not int eh editor, so you don\u0027t have to have them weight a bit more or cost more if you don\u0027t want to be able to auto collect to them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-21T01:27:29Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2014 01:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by SirDargon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tahib","CreatedById":111243,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T03:59:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022SirDargon\u0022 data-cite=\u0022SirDargon\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUpdate: I have a completed plugin. It works, but I\u0027m not happy with the lack of control you have with the data. You tell it to collect and it collects, but which data 1st? Random, largest 1st, smallest 1st. etc? When this mod had infinite capacity, order wasn\u0027t an issue. What if you want to transfer a specific ScienceData from one drive to the other? You have no control....
