In a particular ship keeps getting messed up if I load the game with the Crew Support plugin. It doesn\u0027t literally explode, what happens to it is that it vanishes from my view.

I\u0027ve seen the same centre of mass issue with parts when they have modules that have caused a null reference exception and have stopped executing. In testing when this happens at low speed - such as during launch - the camera will suddenly get dragged behind the vessel followed by the vessel breaking apart, usually at a joint with the part that crashed. I think once in orbit the speeds are high enough it just breaks apart.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect the culprit is the old CO2 scrubber module, since that module has been merged with the generator and no longer exists.

I have not seen ships just vanish. I also have not seen parts on ships move without becoming detached.

Even simply automatically activating them when levels get dangerous requires somehow knowing which generators to turn on in which situation. While it\u0027s not hard add checks to see that the CO2 scrubbers remove CO2 and conclude they should be activated when there is too much CO2, there are much more complicated setups possible with the mod and they would have to work too. Things get less clear when the generators deal with multiple resources or multiple generator deal with the same resource but do different things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELeaving control in the hands of the player is the simplest option and keeps the mod more flexible. I do want to add a GUI eventually that will have controls to activate/deactivate all of the pod generators and collectors on the current ship.

So for the time being each part is going to have to be controlled individually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will be a while before the next update unfortunately.
