But when you think of Moon landings, do you think of the many robotic landers or do you think of the 12 men?

Unless the mission is explicitly designed to do things robots cannot do at all, or could only do at greater expense (something hard to even imagine, but let\u0027s assume it\u0027s a possibility), then there is no point in sending humans to the surface---other than it\u0027s awesome to see humans on the surface.
