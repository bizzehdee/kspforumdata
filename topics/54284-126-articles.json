Thanks !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I tested with another smaller rover: this one hovers for a few seconds when I \u0022finalize\u0022, and then gets teleported under the launchpad, pushing it in the air. I\u0027d say the big rover suffers the same teleporting, but explodes instead of just pushing the launchpad away, due to being bigger. With the small rover, when clicking \u0022finalize\u0022, the finalize button does not disappear, and it apparently allows spawning additional instances of the rover (but the launchpad is flying away by that time).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-27T13:33:08Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2015 01:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by TauPhraim\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"taniwha","CreatedById":57176,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T13:50:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETauPhraim\u003C/strong\u003E: I need your full log file, not an excerpt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TauPhraim","CreatedById":146808,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-27T16:02:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI could not reproduce this problem after restarting KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the meanwhile, maybe I have another issue for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E I\u0027m using UKS and I noticed the Rocket part cost displayed in the VAB is not the same for (at least) one part, depending on how I add it.
