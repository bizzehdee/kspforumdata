A docking port seems like the most obvious way to drop a rover from a lander, but I haven\u0027t really been able to just stick them together face to face. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I would ideally design a rover by itself and test drive it around the space center to make sure it can be can climbed into and out of etc. How best do I attach a pre-existing rover to a pre-existing lander? Do I make the rover as a pre-assembly with the docking port as the root? Have had a few time consuming failures when using pre-assembled parts. I don\u0027t want to design the perfect rover and then not be able to attach it to anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother issue is that I don\u0027t have a great deal of structural tech yet. When I use things like the \u0027Modular Girder Segment\u0027 or the \u0027Cubic Octagonal Strut\u0027 Will everything I put on there stick to them with a strong connection? Can I use odd angles and such to create ground clearance so my rover doesn\u0027t bottom out on bumpy terrain?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T13:09:54Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 01:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T15:52:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would suggest building a rover in the SPH (generally the SPH makes it easier to put tires on evenly), saving it as a sub-assembly with whatever bit you want to attach to the delivery vehicle as the root, then build the delivery vehicle in the VAB and attaching the rover when it\u0027s ready to go. That\u0027s just the general order I\u0027d go in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA decoupler would work just as well as a docking port, BTW. The main difference is that the decoupler would give it some oomph as it separated from the delivery vehicle. If you don\u0027t want that oomph, go with the docking port. I might point out that you don\u0027t need a corresponding docking port on the rover itself to attach it to a docking port, its just that if you don\u0027t you wouldn\u0027t be able to pick up the rover and take it somewhere else if you needed to. Something to consider.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re not adverse to mods, I might suggest you investigate KIS/KAS. There\u0027s a neat demo video out there where somebody builds the rover \u003Cem\u003Eon-site\u003C/em\u003E. True, it used the little shopping cart wheels, but it was a fully functional rover capable of hauling a Kerbal around the Mun a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGeneral rover guidelines - build it low, build it wide, include a Reaction Wheel or Stabilizer, drive it around in docking mode (that last one may not be applicable anymore; haven\u0027t designed a new rover in 1.0.x yet).

Unless you\u0027re exploring Eve (or now that they\u0027ve nerfed rocket engine ISP and added a better aero model, Tylo and Laythe), it\u0027s much easier to make them the same vessel. I\u0027ve never quite understood why so many people are so fixated on making rovers that are not capable of spaceflight (maybe for realism\u0027s sake?). Why not just avoid the whole question and make your rover a lander? It\u0027s very easy to do on low gravity worlds. In fact, even on bodies with as high of gravity as Duna, you can make successful \u0022everything ships\u0022- vessels with rover wheels, all science instruments, mobile science lab, big solar panels, a large crew complement, ISRU mining, refining, and scanning, even interplanetary transfer.
