I have been playing ksp on and off for the past year now. I just started playing again recently and started to build a space station. It\u0027s the largest I have built yet but I have noticed my periapsis seems to be slightly dropping since the first piece I sent up. When I started building the station the periapsis was around 99.8 km with my apoapsis being about 101 km. I have brought up quite a few pieces since then, I have a refueling adapter put up, 2 solar arrays, and around 6 or 8 living units (containers, pods, science labs/cuppola). Now my periapsis is currently at 98.973 km, which to me seems like a pretty significant drop. I will be in map mode and I can also see the periapsis slightly dropping. Is this a normal thing that I shouldn\u0027t worry about? Or is it something that will affect my station significantly like continually dropping till it de-orbits? I\u0027m not anything close to a scientist, but it seems strange to me that it keeps dropping when I (believe that I am) am in a stable orbit quite a bit above the atmosphere so I shouldn\u0027t have to worry about falling back to Kerban.

The classic argument that the reason gravity must make all things fall the same is because of the contradiction that two objects attached together would simultaneously fall at the same speed and yet at different speeds if it was any other way is utterly false. It happens to arrive at the right conclusion but for all the wrong reasons. It\u0027s a bit like saying \u0022cars are animals that like the taste of gasoline. You have to feed it to them or they get ornery and refuse to move\u0022. While it might teach someone that they need to put fuel in the car to make it go, it\u0027s still a faulty explanation that it\u0027s a bad idea to use.\u003Cp\u003EThe crux of the \u0022fall at the same speed but different speeds at the same time\u0022 argument is the incorrect notion that movement based on gravity happens in a sort of \u0022on rails\u0022 way. If it\u0027s properly expressed as a force that pulls on things rather than a magical forced deterministic path that things follow, then it\u0027s easy to see that objects attached together could still remain at the same speed if the force trying to pull them apart wasn\u0027t strong enough to break the attachment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat matters is the experimentation. The fact that when you try to drop the two objects they don\u0027t in fact show any signs of being pulled apart (i.e. a string between them remains slack) is the reason. Not the mere thought experiment based on the false notion that objects can\u0027t remain stuck together if gravity pulled them differently. Of course they could remain stuck together, but then it would be like a tug-of-war between them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat the hell are you talking about? \u0022The classic argument\u0022?
