Problem is, He2 immediately collapses back into a pair of H1, again leaving you with no net energy change. On very rare occasion He2 instead undergoes beta decay into deuterium. That is an energy producing reaction, but its one that runs very slowly even under the conditions found in the core of the sun, so its not a good candidate for any type of fusion reactor.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-07T23:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JMBuilder\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JMBuilder\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI see the problem!
