They would be much more cramped aboard the landers, but at least they\u0027d all be together and more assured of rescue, once Goshawk arrived. Their departure was marked by saddened silence, broken only by occasional automated positioning updates from Ronin\u0027s nav systems on the flight channel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo days later, Goshawk obtained Ronin\u0027s beacon and began its approach, guided remotely by Mission Kontrol. At 5 keks away from rendezvous, alarms began to sound on the ground. Tracking flooded the Flight Director\u0027s local channel with information that Goshawk itself was currently confirming: the area had become suddenly filled with numerous scanner pings that should not have been there. Medical quickly joined in, calling out loss of connection with all of the crew members aboard Ronin. The command channel was largely unintelligible, filled with screams from the Kalypso crew, still aboard the landers -or according to tracking- what remained of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt quickly became clear that for some unknown reason, Ronin had suffered a serious failure; one that had resulted in the ship\u0027s explosion and subsequent disintegration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the second time in a year, the \u003Cem\u003EBlack Shoal\u003C/em\u003E protocol was initiated at KSC. A broad, temporary media blackout was enacted, and all attention at Mission Kontrol was diverted to saving what lives they could.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETracking was able to lock on the lander pods, which had somehow survived the event intact, but tearfully informed the Flight Director that they were currently on terminal return trajectories, and they were now too far away for Goshawk to reach them before they re-entered the atmosphere. The entire crew of the Duna mission had been lost within a five minute span.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the lander pods fell silent, the Flight Director ordered Goshawk to begin searching the debris field. Kalypso, unmanned and at standby power, was discovered a short distance away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts flight recorder hadn\u0027t captured the event that had befallen Ronin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKalypso was left where it was, to act as a memorial to the fallen crew, and to offer support services for future missions on-orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMeanwhile, IPEV Tailwind, stationed at M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar orbit, had just overseen completion of yet another science mission on the surface. Tailwind, originally launched as a mobile exploration command station, had been temporarily re-purposed as a docking and service platform for the KSC\u0027s High-Speed Trans-Atmospheric Courier program. Expanded over a year ago with a disposable fueling and docking tower, Tailwind had not originally been expected to depart its orbit for another 18 months.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/NK6v11o.png\u0022 alt=\u0022NK6v11o.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETailwind had also suffered some damage during its initial launch, destroying its on-board fuel conversion and power storage capabilities.
