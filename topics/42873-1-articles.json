The CSM then does the remainder and ends up in a 75km orbit with about 800m/s delta-V left for orbital manoeuvring in LKO. Gravity turn should start after the first stage is jettisoned, between 8 and 11km. Press 0 before launch to deploy the antenna on the craft and the LES, and press 1 during the gravity turn to jettison the LES.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s an ASAS module for those who like using mechjeb, and an RTG for extra power during the night, both clipped into the body of the CSM. Perhaps I\u0027ll modify this craft so it reaches orbit with more delta-V, but that\u0027s a pretty low priority on the list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yHlS3l1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022yHlS3l1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/5MLZed7.png\u0022 alt=\u00225MLZed7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/2hg86faeqnrvlbq/Kuropollo%20CSM.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ECraft file\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
