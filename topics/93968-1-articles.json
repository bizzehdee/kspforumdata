Well, remember how the faster we go, the slower time is?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the expansion of the universe is increasing each unit of time. Why?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, my idea is that space-time has a \u0022concentration\u0022, and that space and time is linked to one another in an proportionate ratio. This is why at light speeds, your length(space) is zero, and time is basically zero. (as space decreases, time decreases).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, the expansion of the universe is increasing space all around us, thus time is increasing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, the speed of light is bound by time being 0. When there is a larger unit of time, there is a larger unit of space. Thus, light have more space to cross during t = 0. Hence, the speed of light, c , is decreasing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENow, we are at the present world.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe speed of light is bound by the geometry of space-time. As the universe is very, very, very large, the speed of light seems constant, although it is decreasing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is what my theory is accompanied by:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Tachyons. Tachyons in the past can travel faster than light (due to the increment of C). If they travel faster than light, time becomes negative. Hence, they must remain before a certain point in time. Which is why their existence is possible, but does not exist now, as they travel backwards in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Conservation of energy states that the length of a single time frame in any point in time is the same. However, as my theory states that it is different, that means that there is an increasing amount of energy in our universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is true, if we accept the theory of zero-point energy. The theory states that there is a \u0022background energy\u0022 in empty space. It has been proven to exist, but yet not known well. As the universe is expanding, that means that more space must exist, hence more energy. The increasing amount of energy and space links back to my previous point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may ask : If your idea is true, why didn\u0027t anyone publish this theory?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am seeking advice from the community and correct any of my statements if untrue.

That\u0027s not it at all. When space expands, objects are not moving. The \u003Cem\u003Espace between them is expanding\u003C/em\u003E. But relatively to their local space, the objects don\u0027t move. It makes the objects /appear/ to go faster than the speed of light, but they really don\u0027t. Spacetime can expand, contract, and do whatever it is, and as it\u0027s not matter, it can \u0022move\u0022 faster than the speed of light. This is the whole concept behind the alcubierre drive.

Even in the few first nanoseconds of the Big Bang, when the universe became ridiculously voluminous from nothing in such a short amount of time, objects didn\u0027t move faster than the speed of light, but the space between them did expand faster than it. That\u0027s the concept behind redshifting. Far far away galaxies are not actually moving away from us, the the space between us and them is expanding faster than they might be able to move toward us. And the further they are, the more space can expand between us and them, and the faster they appear to be moving, the more the light coming from them is redshift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no evidence ever than the speed of light might have changed across time.
