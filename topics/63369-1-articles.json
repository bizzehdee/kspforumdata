Yet recent research has show that this diminutive creature will sometimes travel great distances over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsually this travel is due to the use of a captive OCTO-2 as the (minimal) guidance mechanism of a Kerbal space vessel, where its very small form factor and mass make it desirable for use in lightweight probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut...

Validated a lot of my theories, suprised me on a few others. I never anticipated an Eve-aerobrake-Moho superslingshot like that. I mean, the odds are something like 10^12 against it, per orbit!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the gradual creep inward rather than out matches what i thought. Also the reduced variance of the inner orbits, but greater variance of the outer ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe timescale, quite frankly, ran much faster than I expected, at first. I had planned using real-world orbits, which are 3-d. My initial setup was essentially 2-d on Kerbin and Mun\u0027s very unrealisting matching orbital planes and perfectly circular orbits. This **enormously** amplified the scattering during the first few hundred orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, the fun of seeing mathematics dance like this!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-13T17:44:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBrilliant study, and a great reminder that there are always new interesting things to do in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
