The color order some have mentioned (the \u0027shower-head\u0027 model) is an artificial false-color model based on the most common instinctive associations between colors and temperatures.

The reasons being that LiquidFuel is essentially cryogenic kerosene (by density and other engine stats, IIRC) with the thermal properties of Aerozine 50 (the thermal info according to NathanKell). It\u0027s a super-fuel, nothing near cryogenic hydrogen in terms of storage and handling. Realistically, an NTR running kerosene would probably have a terrible isp. Also, while NTRs may actually be quite cool engines (they appear to be about mid-range in terms of chamber temperature) KSP glosses over the storage of cryo fuels, which require some sort of cooling mechanism in order to avoid boil-off.\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t believe I\u0027m saying this, but I feel the NTR heating is a balanced and interesting gameplay mechanic because KSP is not realistic.
