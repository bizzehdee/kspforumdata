Take Minecraft as an example. When I got Minecraft, there was no way that 8 year old me was able to download a mod without help from my cousins or an adult (I actually got a mod downloaded for me as a gift at my 9th birthday). Come May 2013, when I got KSP, mods were incredibly easily to download because of 3 reasons:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Easy places to get the mods, and organized at that (Curseforge, what used to be spaceport, spacedock, what used to be kerbalstuff)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Downloads were very easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Instructions included in the mods most of the time\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust my opinion, but this is also what makes KSP a great game. An avid modding community, and I thank you guys for making KSP the way it is. This isn\u0027t the only thing I like about KSP, it\u0027s just something that makes the game great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Moach","CreatedById":9,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-24T05:08:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat is not by accident\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nmodding was an intensively upheld priority in development for KSP - and the community was built from the ground up with the premise of fostering all the best possible conditions for authors and users alike since a very early stage in production\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this, because I was there.... me and my brother (HarvesteR) had plenty of open discussions about just how to approach features he was working on with regards to potential modding options - I would always remind him to keep that in mind, even though most of the time, he did not require even being told\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat\u0027s because both of us started our careers in game development not as programmers - but as a pair of prospective mod makers for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe internet has kept a good record of this history:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://simviation.com/fs2004jets84.htm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://simviation.com/fs2004jets84.htm\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthat link points to that very first foray into game development for the both of us - mind that we kinda shared the username \u0022Moach\u0022 for that project, for the sake of simplicity, or whatever... eventually I kept that name and he went with \u0022HarvesteR\u0022 (I reckon mainly because of\u00A0MetallicA, as in \u0022harvester of sorrow\u0022)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nhow\u0027s that for a KSP pre-history lesson?\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nanyways - that\u0027s why modding has been such a primary concern - since we\u0027ve experienced first hand just how powerful mods are as a force to bring a community together\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso, back when the forums were first setup, (back in a time when I was the first moderator)\u00A0we deliberately came up with a\u00A0few guidelines for modders and how they should post their releases in a way we thought would be most beneficial for both authors and users. those were simple tips, like: \u00A0keep the first post always updated;
