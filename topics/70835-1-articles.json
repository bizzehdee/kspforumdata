This will allow you to stage everything else is sequence and not stage the past you want kp Claw has detailed instructions in the reply above mine. To set command groups you need to look for the command group icon at the top of the screen in the Vertical Assembly Building: VAB. There are three buttons which switch the display at the left of the screen in between parts, command groups, and Kerbalnauts active for the current mission. To set or change what a relevant keyboard button does you need to click on that button in the command group section, then click on the part you want it to do something with on your craft, then in the menu in the command group section under the part in question switch over the action you want that button to do. Most of the buttons towards the top already have actions associated with them but actions can be added to these. The backspace button is reserved for an abort sequence which is something that you have to set yourself. The buttons 1 through 0 correspond to the keyboard buttons 1 through zero above the letters on a QWERTY keyboard. I make frequent use of these to do things like deploy or stow all solar panels at once. You could set the decouplers you want only to be used in an emergency to stage zero and use the command group to activate the decouplers when the abort button (backspace by default) is pressed. Command grouping are saved when the craft is saved. I hope you understand this explanation.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith Respect To raising one\u0027s altitude and keeping one\u0027s orbit circular: this is not physically possible. Performing a burn does not change where one is but where one is going. When a maneuver is performed the resulting orbit must pass through the location that the maneuver was preformed at. Changing from a circular orbit at one altitude to a circular orbit at a different altitude necessarily involves more then one maneuver. The Hohmann transfer and bi-elliptical transfer are the most efficient ways to do this (depending on the particular situation). Instructions on how to do these are here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Advanced_Orbiting\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Tutorial:_Advanced_Orbiting\u003C/a\u003E and you can ask for more instructions. I suppose one could burn continuously throughout an entire orbit to change from one circular orbit to another at a different altitude but this would be both inefficient and would require precise throttle and orientation control. This would not be the most efficient maneuver to achieve the desired end, there is no utility that can do this for you (I believe), and the orbit will not be circular during the transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope you enjoy the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-28T21:22:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022benschwab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022benschwab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWith Respect To raising one\u0027s altitude and keeping one\u0027s orbit circular: this is not physically possible.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is, but it is very difficult.
