I like the rationale, but the implementation is a little nonsensical since you can have your kerbals briefly stay at a luxury station in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E to give them a really long Home timer before going interplanetary on a much smaller ship, then have your ship equipped with a small runabout to reset the Hab timer as needed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalism\u0027s psychological-status model of habitation looks interesting, but I haven\u0027t tried it yet.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah I see where RD was going with it and it works but if\u00A0it were adapted into stock I might suggest\u00A0it being simplified. Each hab/seat could keep its kerbal-month rating, but docking with another vessel would only increase the hab time if it had a higher rating (like docking with a fancy station). To balance that out the hab timer would reset after any vessel became \u0022landed\u0022 on any body. So kerbals wouldn\u0027t get much relief from climbing from one tin-can to another, but being the adventurous creatures\u00A0they are landing on another world would relieve their homesickness. Mainly though just like with supplies you can reduce your targets in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E down to a single value to keep things simple and predictable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-12-06T21:41:46Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2018 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Waxing_Kibbous","CreatedById":151611,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-12-06T21:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are some solid mods that cover it already, but an official LS\u002BHabitat expansion would be pretty cool.
