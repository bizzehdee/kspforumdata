The cernamic materials used mean they can also withstand far higher temperatures. Additionally, a particle bed reactor is designed to be resistant to overheating, it takes advantage of a negative feedback caused by doppler broadening to progressively reduce the reactor power output as the temperature increases. This creates a nice passive safety feature, should the temperature ever get too high, the reactor simply stops producing power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis reactor runs at an optimal temperature of 1173K but can operate all the way to up 2700K. The amount of power the reactor produces depends on the temperature, at 1173K, it can generate its rated maximum. At higher temperature, you will produce less power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis creates an interesting situation in space travel because the specific impulse depends upon temperature, thus you can try to add lots of radiators to maintain the highest power rating, giving you the most thrust or you can allow the reactor to heat up a little and lose a bit of thrust but achieve a higher specific impulse. At optimal temperature, Isp is significantly lower than the existing un-upgraded fission reactors but, if you allow the reactors to heat up a bit more, values of just over 1000s are possible. That\u0027s pretty interesting for an early tech!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, it suffers from significantly lesser fuel burn-up than the existing MSRs and the complicated fuel pellet design means that reprocessing cannot be done on the fly. Instead, you will have to make do with simple refueling - fortunately, this isn\u0027t too hard. This reactor uses UraniumNitride fuel, it comes fully stocked in the VAB and this fuel can be produced from Uranium Tetraflouride and Ammonia at your nearest refinery. (Tip: This makes Laythe an excellent location to deploy this design in a self-sustaining way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith proper tweaking, you might find this design can offer some unique and interesting capabilities, especially for thermal rocket applications.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EDusty Plasma Reactor\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a very interesting design of reactor which suspends a \u0022dusty plasma\u0022 of microscopic solid particles electrostatically. The advantage of this design is a feature rarely seen in fission reactors - the ability to use direct conversion on charged particles. Like certain fusion reactions, a significant proportion of the energy of all fission reactions is initially released in the form of fast moving charged \u0022fission fragments,\u0022 these are simply the lighter atomic nuclei that result from the fissioning of a heavy atom. In most fission reactor designs, the fission fragments are prevented from escaping so virtually all of the power is generated as heat. This design is one that specifically allows the fission fragments to escape, that means you can hook it up to a Direct Conversion generator and enjoy the huge efficiency gain that design brings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside of the dusty plasma is that it runs at very low temperature (4100K) for an upgraded reactor because the particles in the dusty plasma must remain solid. That means specific impulse with a thermal rocket is a fairly uninteresting (for the tech level) 1432.5s. These reactors also don\u0027t get a huge power upgrade over the original pebble bed design but the upgrade does offer increased fuel burn-up meaning that despite the (moderately) increased power, the upgrade actually uses less fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, they are the earliest opportunity in the tech tree to make substantial use of Direct Conversion power and should be rather nice if you\u0027re looking for electrical power rather than good thermal rocket performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportant Note\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have changed the densities of UF4, ThF4, Actinides and DepletedFuel into units of t/l instead of t/m^3, this makes them more consistent with most of the other densities found in Interstellar and the general drive amongst parts of the modding community to adopt those units. It also gives you a more conveniently sized unit for the resource bars in game and basically looks a lot nicer.

I would highly recommend having the engines set up to hotkeys on toggle so you don\u0027t immediately blow them up. That\u0027s where I believe the bug lies.

The advantage of this design is a feature rarely seen in fission reactors - the ability to use direct conversion on charged particles. Like certain fusion reactions, a significant proportion of the energy of all fission reactions is initially released in the form of fast moving charged \u0022fission fragments,\u0022 these are simply the lighter atomic nuclei that result from the fissioning of a heavy atom. In most fission reactor designs, the fission fragments are prevented from escaping so virtually all of the power is generated as heat. This design is one that specifically allows the fission fragments to escape, that means you can hook it up to a Direct Conversion generator and enjoy the huge efficiency gain that design brings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe downside of the dusty plasma is that it runs at very low temperature (4100K) for an upgraded reactor because the particles in the dusty plasma must remain solid. That means specific impulse with a thermal rocket is a fairly uninteresting (for the tech level) 1432.5s. These reactors also don\u0027t get a huge power upgrade over the original pebble bed design but the upgrade does offer increased fuel burn-up meaning that despite the (moderately) increased power, the upgrade actually uses less fuel!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, they are the earliest opportunity in the tech tree to make substantial use of Direct Conversion power and should be rather nice if you\u0027re looking for electrical power rather than good thermal rocket performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirstly, let me say that I think that this is a fantastic mod, and I\u0027m really looking forward to the new reactor designs. I\u0027m sure that you are very busy implementing your own ideas, and I understand that a person doesn\u0027t get into modding in order to make other people\u0027s ideas work. With that in mind, how easy/sensible would it be to implement the following things?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMagnetic Nozzle Engine\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would be a type of engine which can connect onto the dusty plasma reactor or fusion reactors. The idea is that it would simply divert the charged particles resource out the back of the ship for thrust, using the fissionable/fusionable materials as both fuel and re-mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve taken a quick look at the numbers. Assuming U235 fission, the maximum theoretical performance is an Isp of 1,192,661, and a thrust of 169.5 N/GW. Pure He3 fusion gives an Isp of 2,073,191 and a thrust of 98.3 N/GW. These are real-world numbers, so I don\u0027t know what fudge factors are required (if any) in order to be consistent with the peculiarities of Kerbal physics. Those thrusts look too anaemic to be useful, but I understand that you have had a look at a better physical time-warp system. It may be a useful drive type in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOpen Cycle Thermal Exhaust Vent\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI often find that I have a bit of an issue expelling waste heat in the early-tech tree, but that it tends to be very easy later on. Do you think there is any future in a tiny heat vent system which simply uses waste heat to boil a fluid (possibly monoprop) and dumps it, as a way of getting rid of heat? I imagine that it would be a tiny, early-game part suitable for use on probes. If it could be made to only vent when waste heat gets above a certain threshold, it may also see later use as an emergency cooling system on larger vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEarly Game heat sources/Generators\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to the nature of the parts it creates KSPI tends to centre around the late-game. However, I think that the heat source/generator system is flexible enough that there is a lot of room for early game tech too. For example, a lot of probes require either small amounts of power over a long period (for keeping things running), or large amounts of power over short periods (for transmitting science). I could think of an early game generator (presumably a sterling engine), radioisotope thermal source, and a simple chemical furnace (burning liquid fuel and oxidiser). The generator would be less efficient than the Brayton cycle/KTECs but would be a lot thinner and lighter for small probes and rovers. The furnace would have a surprisingly high thermal power output, and fully throttle itself, but would naturally consume chemical fuel very quickly. This would mean it would only operate for short periods, presumably while transmitting science. It may even see some later use as a backup supply for restarting other power systems. The radioisotope source would be somewhat weedy in output, but it\u0027s small size and weight would still make it useful for long duration probes. I could also see some interesting missions being carried out with such tech, for example coupling the radioisotope source with a thermal jet (assuming the source could \u0022store\u0022 a decent amount of thermal power), in order to recreate something like the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24213830\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMars Hopper\u003C/a\u003E proposal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENuclear Salt Water Rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou obviously know your hypothetical space tech, so you are probably familiar with \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_salt-water_rocket\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis concept\u003C/a\u003E.

In real life, you could reach around 20% of orbital velocity with a standard airbreathing jet, this is about right for the SABRE engine as proposed too. The early flight is the most expensive part because you have thick atmosphere and little velocity to reduce gravity drag, so you\u0027d expect to save a bit more than 20% of total delta-v to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the purposes of KSP, I decided to keep the precooler velocity requirements about the same as in real life, meaning because of Kerbin\u0027s small size you can achieve over 60% of orbital velocity without even using a precooler - you can easily build KSP SSTO aircraft without even using them so I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve managed to make anything massively more realistic but at least it adds an extra design constraint and a bit more depth to spaceplane flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, the nice thing about using real numbers is you could try it with RSS without modification and then you\u0027d have a very interesting engineering challenge.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fractal_UK","CreatedById":61595,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-28T14:06:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022YourLocalMadScientist\u0022 data-cite=\u0022YourLocalMadScientist\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirstly, let me say that I think that this is a fantastic mod, and I\u0027m really looking forward to the new reactor designs.

Assuming U235 fission, the maximum theoretical performance is an Isp of 1,192,661, and a thrust of 169.5 N/GW. Pure He3 fusion gives an Isp of 2,073,191 and a thrust of 98.3 N/GW. These are real-world numbers, so I don\u0027t know what fudge factors are required (if any) in order to be consistent with the peculiarities of Kerbal physics.

Do you think there is any future in a tiny heat vent system which simply uses waste heat to boil a fluid (possibly monoprop) and dumps it, as a way of getting rid of heat? I imagine that it would be a tiny, early-game part suitable for use on probes. If it could be made to only vent when waste heat gets above a certain threshold, it may also see later use as an emergency cooling system on larger vessels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe, I\u0027d have to look into whether there are any designs that would actually be able to do this effectively.

However, I think that the heat source/generator system is flexible enough that there is a lot of room for early game tech too. For example, a lot of probes require either small amounts of power over a long period (for keeping things running), or large amounts of power over short periods (for transmitting science). I could think of an early game generator (presumably a sterling engine), radioisotope thermal source, and a simple chemical furnace (burning liquid fuel and oxidiser). The generator would be less efficient than the Brayton cycle/KTECs but would be a lot thinner and lighter for small probes and rovers. The furnace would have a surprisingly high thermal power output, and fully throttle itself, but would naturally consume chemical fuel very quickly. This would mean it would only operate for short periods, presumably while transmitting science. It may even see some later use as a backup supply for restarting other power systems. The radioisotope source would be somewhat weedy in output, but it\u0027s small size and weight would still make it useful for long duration probes. I could also see some interesting missions being carried out with such tech, for example coupling the radioisotope source with a thermal jet (assuming the source could \u0022store\u0022 a decent amount of thermal power), in order to recreate something like the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24213830\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMars Hopper\u003C/a\u003E proposal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI actually created an Interstellar RTG part module which consumes a Plutonium-238 resource to produce ElectricCharge and ThermalPower. You could attach it to thermal rockets too and use it in similar ways to the ones described in that article as well as attach generators to it to produce power more efficiently. The main problem with the idea is that Pu-238 isn\u0027t really versatile enough to fit all these requirements, if you want thrust, you need to use a shorter half-life, higher activity material. That article was where I got the idea, actually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s relatively easy to use the existing code I have to produce chemical power generation equipment, different types of RTGs, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOddly, in KSP, RTGs are one of the latest techs in the game and I\u0027m not really sure why or what the justification for that is since they were regularly used in the 60s and 70s.

Suffice to say that the mod already has Fissionable salts and water as resources. It also has a lack of high thrust engines in the mid game, which this would nicely fill.
