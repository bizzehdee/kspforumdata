I am not and early early adopter however I have been playing KSP for a long long time. Recently I have been wondering why when I begin a new career mode or sandbox\u00A0I get frustrated and start over. I am currently playing a new career mode and again I just grew increasingly frustrated with my save. I came to the realization that i have too many part mods. I, like everyone loves to have a variety of mods. I can\u0027t just play a vanilla version of KSP. I need part mods. However I think the problem comes with having too many choices. For example I love Bluedog Design Bureau by \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105588-cobaltwolf/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022105588\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/105588-cobaltwolf/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@CobaltWolf\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I am not saying anything surprising here that, it is one of the most extraordinary mods ever made for KSP. His maintenance of the parts creation of kerbalized NASA parts is extraordinary. There are hundreds of parts in the pack, so many that I doubt I have or will ever use them all. Now when you install the mod and use it career mode the parts evolve perfectly for the contracts Mercury for the first missions, Atlas parts for relay launches and satellites, gemini for orbits, docking, etc. Then you go to the Mun with the Apollo parts and now the entire kerbol solar system is at your fingertips. But then you are trying to play the game in the confines of a \u0022NASA\u0022 style launches and not Kerbal. This is not a criticism of BDB in the slightest but the confines of my own personal imagination. \u0022Do I take an Apollo capsule to Duna?\u0022 Now I have restock, near future, Tundra exploration, and more. I want to use those for my launches. Its more realistic and futuristic if I use Tundra parts and near future to get to Duna.\u00A0Now you\u0027re designing a frankenship with parts from everywhere and its messing with the narrative you have in your head. You spend 45 minutes in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E trying to put together the GREATEST SHIP OF ALL TIME, and you hate it because you didn\u0027t have to overcome obstacles. You didn\u0027t have to Kerbalize or problems solve. Which honestly I think is one of the most fundamental parts of the game. I mean before KSP introduced the NASA parts (SLS) parts it was extremely difficult to get to the outer planets. Just being able to get to another planet was satisfying in and of itself. Now you can overbuild crafts and you know you\u0027re gonna make it so there is a thrill missing when you ad every possible part imaginable. Every single type of engine imaginable makes the Kerbol system really small and ultimately unrewarding when you get the Jool system. Grand Tours are easy when you have engines that need mere drops of fuel to run an engine that generates 1000 thrust in a vaccum. I exaggerate a bit, but being stuck within the confines of limited choice helps trigger creative problem solving for KSP which is why I think us veterans loved KSP in the first place.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe long and short of my post is that, the\u00A0advice I would give to KSP people new and old is to pick a narrative and stick with it. If you\u0027re gonna download BDB stick with NASA style missions. If you\u0027re gonna use Near Future download all of \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002283952\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/83952-nertea/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nertea\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s incredible and astonishing mods and play that way. Pick part types and stick with it. Force yourself to come up with creative solutions instead of looking for mods that have all the answers. I honestly think it\u0027s possible to have too many parts now. If you can navigate having ALL OF THE PARTS then you\u00A0obviously have a much better KSP imagination than me. This is just something to consider for new people who just don\u0027t know what to do and maybe veterans like myself who don\u0027t know what to do anymore.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy Launches Everyone\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CobaltWolf","CreatedById":105588,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-04T20:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223612235\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022185147\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221559678903\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105359\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022sp1989\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 minutes ago, sp1989 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003EWhen is \u0022MOAR PARTS\u0022 too many?\u003C/span\u003E \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022677\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/471/227/dd0.png\u0022 style=\u0022width:400px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 alt=\u0022dd0.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#dddddd;\u0022\u003E5char\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-06-04T20:13:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just go with simple solution: one part pack per purpose.
