I know I can view experiment info in Kerbalism directly, but if I want to know what (newly researched) science am I missing at the Moon, I need to click through every single experiment and click on the moon rollout menu. It would be much more handy to view it the other way around (\u0022I have a contract for a Moon landing, what experiments should I pack with me?\u0022). I found xScience should work with regular ksp, but unfortunately I cannot get it to work with Kerbalism. Are there any mods that would allow me to view a body/biome and tell me which experiments I\u0027ve already done and which will still give me science?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m running the latest version of ksp1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"theJesuit","CreatedById":122369,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-08T08:14:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure that what you ask for exists.\u00A0 \u00A0But it would be great.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
