We\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on those in parallel with the U5 port, which has been an \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153interesting\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 experience, given that U5 and the hotfix are built on different unity versions\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 My workstation now has about 50\u002B gb of KSP in it (dual git repos and multiple test installs).\n\nAs for U5, work continues at a steady pace. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m halfway through the wheel overhaul on my end. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve implemented a smart suspension module, which sets up the spring and damper values on each wheel suspension based on the total vessel mass and how much of it each wheel has to support (closeness to CoM factored in). That means suspensions are nice and springy regardless of vessel design.\n\nApart from that, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m also implementing a new steering module. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve always had this peeve about the old system that it required you to manually set up each wheel to be inverted or un-inverted, with no good way to tell which way was which. The new steering module uses a new method to calculate which way each wheel should turn based on the steering input, which is used to figure out where the commanded turn \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00CB\u0153pivot\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2 point would be, and that is then used to make each wheel rotate to face sideways to that point, so regardless of where or how they are mounted on a vessel, wheels will always respond properly to steer the right way (There will still be steering invert and toggle tweaks though, just in case). Another benefit of this approach is that Ackermann steering happens as a consequence.\n\n**Mike (Mu)**\n\nThe Unity 5 UI upgrade continues. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been working on the main flight scene this past week and it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s almost finished. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been completely rewriting the staging UI to work with the new system which has been mildly painful as the old version uses a combination of two UI systems. New version is a lot slicker, faster, easier to use, and provides some new avenues for modding with the ability to create different information displays for the various icons.\n\n**Marco (Samssonart)**\n\nI have a bit of bad news about the Unity 5.1 release we discussed earlier. Unfortunately it seems Unity 5.1 brought many more problems than we expected, it got to the point where the project can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even be compiled without the Unity editor crashing. We don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have the time to troubleshoot this kind of problems now, so we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll stick with 5.0 for the moment.\n\nWe started the week with a couple patch releases, so I got busy handling the KSP Store server and the tasks needed in it in order to get a new version out, covering what Alex used to do. Luckily for me he was very supportive even though he doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t work at Squad anymore, so cheers to him.\n\n**Daniel (danRosas)**\n\nSpending some time improving skills and learning new stuff. Starting a production schedule of things I want to improve on the game before moving into new things, to figure out with Max at what point in development can be worked. Also helped Kasper and Miguel with the graphics for the E3 announcement, as well as keeping track of all the amazing news that happened on the industry, as well as keeping an eye on what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s trending and what\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s the artistic goal of all the games showed last week.\n\n**Jim (Romfarer)**\n\nThis week i have upgraded the astronaut complex and administration facility to use the unity 5 gui system. It is a bit of a tedious job since the overall goal of this process is to make it look the same as it did before. That said, the new system adds some nice features we are taking advantage of while upgrading. One being the ability to scale ui elements to fit any aspect ratio.\n\n**Max (Maxmaps)**\n\n*Maxmaps is on vacation!*\n\n**Ted (Ted)**\n\nProduction type work continues, working on plans for 1.1 and refining our plans for upgrading the project to Unity 5. Additionally, we finished up Experimentals on 1.0.3 and ran a quick patch up to 1.0.4 for a rather mean bug. In other areas, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been assisting Marco with tracking down some customer support issues and figuring them out. Finally, I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve been continuing work on our internal documentation.\n\n**Kasper (KasperVld)**\n\nIt\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s been quite a week with the PS4 announcement, preparing for the 1.0.3 patch with Max out of the office and then seeing a particularly nasty bug pop up in specific save files. Fortunately Mu was able to localize it and we were able to patch it around in under 24 hours. I want to extend a big thank-you to everyone who has reported this bug and to \\_ayli\\_ in particular for providing a workaround that really helped us narrow it down. Turns out it had the potential to extend beyond this instance, so it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s good to have it fixed at a fundamental level.\n\nI had fun hosting Squadcast last Friday, and if you liked it too I have good news, because I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll be hosting this Friday as well.
