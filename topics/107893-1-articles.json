No snacks included.\n\nSome efficiency and cost have been sacrificed in exchange for incredible performance and science value! Make sure you know your thing before heading to Vall or Tylo as you may find yourself in trouble there! Usage of this craft for Minmus/Mun is not recommended as it is way too overpowered for those short missions. \n\nMore info in the link below,\n\nHappy launchings!\n\n![H5x577Z.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/H5x577Z.jpg)\n\n[see Eeloo Surveyor on KerbalX.com](http://kerbalx.com/iVG/Eeloo-Surveyor)"}]}
