I\u0027ve made a part in 3ds max and exported it to unity. The textures are 512^2 (diffuse with alpha and normal map) and the shader is a ksp bumped specular shader. In the part tool script both copy/convert textures check boxes are ticked and one of my meshes has a mesh collier. When I hit write only a .mu file gets created and no mbm file. Whats going on here?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T00:56:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eis the .mu file only 1kb?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sava","CreatedById":45826,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T01:46:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethe .mu file is 53 kb\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiberion","CreatedById":8356,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T02:51:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoes the texture show up in Unity if you select the model in the Scene list and hit F (to focus the camera?)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vvaris","CreatedById":27444,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-13T15:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you have a folder name with a space?
