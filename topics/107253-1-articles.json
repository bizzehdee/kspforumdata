Since the rover itself is baking soda and a pat of butter away from being a pancake, I figured that it would save me some dv and look cool to put a fairing around it for better aerodynamics, and, curious as to how much it was saving me, I immediately started some tests (1.0.2 aero).\n\nAbstract/introduction/procedure\n\nAs you may note, the launcher has a fair number of wings on it, this is because any design I tested had a strong tendency to flip in the atmosphere, including the fairing design. In my initial design, I used just one engine, and that could get my rover to around 8k without incident, but since that resulted in a TWR \u003C 1 for the fairing, I use three engines for all tests to try to ensure that the tests are as fair as possible. I\u0027m primarily testing for whether or not the extra mass of the fairing outweighs any aerodynamic benefit they give, and I submit that this may not be the case for all incidents, as I don\u0027t really want to try to design every reasonable rocket and put a fairing around it, I\u0027m open to any screenshots by anyone else.\n\nAll tests are performed at 100% throttle using SAS to go straight up. All designs were also tested for gravity turns, and, while the fairing run did the turn the smoothest, none of them had serious issues performing up to a 45 degree turn. Obviously that\u0027s not efficient for an actual launch, but if they can do it at 3k they should be able to do it at 10\u002Bk.\n\nResults:\n\nAs the album shows, the rover on top of a rocket with no special aerodynamic precautions reaches close to 4k maximum height, while the fairing\u0027d rover reaches a mere 2380. I then recognized that maybe it\u0027s simply the additional weight of the fairing that causes the TWR to be very non-optimal, and so a smaller fairing would not have these issues. To account for this, I stick an extra ~10.5 tons of mass on my rover in the form of fuel tanks on top of it (that don\u0027t feed into the bottom engines) and repeat the test, interestingly getting 2823 for a maximum height, weighing .1t more than the fairing and getting an extra 500 meters in the air. \n\nConclusion:\n\nFairings are literally worse than dead weight. I can appreciate that the additional fuel tanks on top of the rover may have been, in some way, aerodynamic, but they should not provide a better aerodynamic surface than a fairing, and the completely stock weight should be accurate (I have precisely 0 mods installed in this save)."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:23:04Z","Content":"I heartily agree that fairings are too heavy.

The payload was my 60 tonne Duna Base payload on a modified Big Advanced Reusable Rocket (you can follow the Developing Duna link in my sig to see this stuff if you care).\n\nFirst I tried to launch the payload on the rocket with no fairing (for a control). Unfortunately, I wasn\u0027t able to get the payload boosted in a proper turn without flipping out of control. The payload stack was just a bit too flexible, I think, so the rocket bent enough to put it out of control.\n\nThen I tried it with the fairing. The building of the fairing was difficult -- the interface wasn\u0027t responding well to my mouse clicks...but I\u0027m not sure why. Maybe because the payload/rocket has 400\u002B parts, so there might have been lag in recognizing my clicks. Or something else...I dunno. Anyway, I finally got the fairing built and launched it. Arrrgh, it was terribly laggy. Quite a bit laggier that without the fairing. Painfully laggy. BUT...the fairing allowed me to get the rocket through the boost. But, oh, the lag.\n\nOddly enough, the lag continued even after I blew off the confetti at 40,000 meters. Weird. And painful.\n\nBut fairings DID allow me to fly a payload that I was no longer able to boost in 1.0.2."},{"CreatedByName":"Farex","CreatedById":126838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T06:31:43Z","Content":"Oh Brotoro tried fairings, maybe something in the making for the Duna-Mission?^^\n\n@Topic:\n\nIn 1.0 the fairings did their Job perfectly.

I\u0027ve been using them to launch small satellites for contracts. The weight isn\u0027t excessive (around 0.25t, if memory serves), no aerodynamic issues, rocket perfectly controllable, no flipping. Frankly people experiencing control issues with fairings have either a design issue (e.g. lack of control authority), or are are not following a valid flight profile (45 at 10 is \\*\\*\\*BAD\\*\\*\\*, wrong, incorrect, etc; real gravity turns are not a single sharp pitch change), or are showing a lack of pilot skill by letting the nose get too far from prograde.\n\nOther complaints here seem invalid to me, based on trying to use the fairings in ways that is far out of scope for the game, and not something they are intended for, e.g. launching a capital ship. They work fine for the normal use case; totally different use cases need something different, not a change to the existing fairings. \u0022One size fits all\u0022 is rarely a good thing, so it\u0027s a very bad idea to try to make a single set of fairings work for all use cases; the current ones work for the standard cases, and should remain tuned for them; other cases need different fairings (probably from the mod community, if the use case is out of scope), or some alternative solution.\n\nI\u0027m not saying they are perfect, as there\u0027s still scope for fine tuning just about everything in the game, but they are perfectly reasonable for their normal purpose.

Without actually spending time flying it and fixing it, I\u0027m 99% certain that it\u0027s item #1: a design issue, namely lack of control authority. I don\u0027t see very much control on that rocket, for its height and mass, just the thrust vectoring and a couple of 1.25m torque wheels in the payload. I reckon if you add some 2.5m torque wheels to the main lifter, the problem will be solved, either that or a mixture of torque wheels and some tail fins.\n\nAdding the fairing both increases the weight, and increases the side surface area (i.e. more surface for air to react against when it\u0027s anything other than directly prograde). Smoothing the air flow does nothing to eliminate the large surface area itself, it just minimises the drag for the surface area, and eliminates friction heating of the protected parts. Both of those factors require more control authority, and I\u0027m guessing that it\u0027s just enough between them to push it over the limit of what you have available. I\u0027ve yet to put much effort into big rocketry in 1.0, but past experience (pre-1.0) with things very like the rocket in your picture tells me that the thrust vectoring alone is frequently not enough for a 400\u002B tonne rocket. (Your boosters do seem well strutted, which rules out a different issue where the flexing of the mounting negates the thrust vectoring.) With really big payloads, I\u0027ve used a stack of 4x 2.5m torque wheels (more typically on top of a 3.75m core \u002B boosters, rather than 2.5m), and tail fins in the past."},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T08:58:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And for the ones that think all complains are because of incompetence: my ascent profile looks like this, turn over from start at about 5\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 than turn of sas and let the aero do it\u0027s work or turn slowly until the craft hits 45\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at about 8-10km.\n\nIt is your incompetence, but not as a pilot.
