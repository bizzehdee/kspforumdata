If you cut the upper tube along the long dimension, I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ll find the ring jammed cross ways in the tube, slightly above the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConclusion: Your rocket was doomed by whoever put it together. My advice... MOAR glue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe careful and have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(I once bent down at the launch pad and almost put my eye out on the end of the launch rod.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is my guess as well. Obviously, without any evidence to support it, my theory is that the engine came loose at some point and moved up the rocket body where it shouldn\u0027t have. This is probably what caused the cascading failures. Whether the rocket casing itself was burned and caused some kind of overheating event, or whether the eject charge was partially blocked, I don\u0027t know. But, my blind, over-the-internet guess is the engine motor wiggled itself loose somehow.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
