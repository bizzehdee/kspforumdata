To show you what i mean, here the mods i use at the moment: Mechjeb(for Data), KAC, NEAR, EVE, Chatterer, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSPRC\u0027s EVE Config(,soon Spaceplane Plus) and now Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI stumbled upon Kethane and was surprised how simple it actually is. It only adds one new Ressource and doesn\u0027t have many Parts, but it gives Bases and stations a economical use and i really like the idea. But some things aren\u0027t believable i think, so i reconfigured some Parts. I wanted to achieve that it is not practical to simply build a self-mining-refining-refuel-everywhere ship, but it should be possible to build bigger bases that mine and refine the fuel and can refuel your ships. So you can\u0027t simply build a get-everywhere-ship, but instead have to build a little infrastructure to get things running and then you can use this (practically) immobile mining-base to refuel your ship. So i mostly refined the electric rates and the Tech-Tree-implementation and some little things.(I also wanted to change the converter Ratios, but i think they already got much more realistic with the 0.24 Mod-Release).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EIf you search for COMPLEX ressources go for Interstellar Mod.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now the problem: I read the License of Kethane and although you\u0027re free to modify your Kethane it is prohibited to publish any modified Kethane files.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to modify your Kethane the same way i will tell you now what i\u0027ve done and you can do it yourself on your own Kethane.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEDIT: Simplified the Edit, with no duplicated parts and fewer edits, while achieving the same goal.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EEDITED Modified Config:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003E1mConverter:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Electric charge for Jet-Fuel Conversion: 30\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Electric charge for Oxidizer Conversion: 70\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E 2mConverter:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TechRequired = nanolathing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E RocketFuel:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kethane = 150\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E ElectricCharge = 500\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E RCS-Fuel : ElectricCharge = 35\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E Generator:\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TechRequired = experimentalElectrics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E KethaneRate = 1.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E PowerRate = 10\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EheavyDrill: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TechRequired = robotics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EsmallDrill: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E TechRequired = specializedConstruction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1mstandardTank:\u003C/strong\u003E TechRequired = specializedConstruction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2mTankLarge : \u003C/strong\u003ETechRequired =experimentalAerodynamics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E2mExtralarge :\u003C/strong\u003E TechRequired = experimentalRocketry\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E1mSensor :\u003C/strong\u003E TechRequired = experimentalScience\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EhighGain: \u003C/strong\u003ETechRequired = advElectrics\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal_Blender:\u003C/strong\u003E TechRequired = experimentalMotors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EZero-Bypass-Turbine:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Propellant Kethane changed to ElectricCharge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eratio = 200\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectricity Production to 0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E------------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExlanations:\u003C/strong\u003E I see Kethane not as Methane, but as a composition of all the usable Soil Gases/Liquids - so converting to Oxidizer makes any Sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Generator producing much less Electricity, because it sqeezes all the chemical power out of a raw material.
