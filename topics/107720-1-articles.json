If you use the [Launch Window Planner](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/)and give it your in-game date accurately, it can help you find out ahead of time how much it may actually cost. The windows are not indentical.\n\nI suppose it goes without saying (yet here I am saying it) that if you send a ship with 14000 dV but the lander only has 1000 dV, your kerbals are staying on Moho.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T20:41:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 08:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Gaarst","CreatedById":126740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:39:23Z","Content":"Yes that\u0027s right but remember that atmospheric delta-v predictions are outdated on this map since 1.0 and that these delta-v are usually for optimal manoeuvres (especially for interplanetary trips), always have more delta-v than you actually need.\n\nEDIT: ninja\u0027d"},{"CreatedByName":"seaces","CreatedById":131939,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T20:45:57Z","Content":"Good.

I have looked at the map and I see that your mentioned 2520 stands above the red line leading to Moho above 760dV(which is btw never mentioned in your post).
