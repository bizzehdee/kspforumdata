I was slowly burning towards the landing site I had planned. Upon my arrival, I began the landing procedure. Unfortunately for me, my fuel ran out just as I was about 50 or so meters above the surface. I managed to touch down fine (if by fine I mean my lander tipped over, then yes. Fine) and all my kerbals were safe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn future though I\u0027ll have to send a rescue mission once I hone my skills enough. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
