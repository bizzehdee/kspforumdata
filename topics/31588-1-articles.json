I\u0027m a graduate of the University of Florida, and I received my bachelor\u0027s degree in Nuclear Engineering. At the time I was in Navy ROTC, and had an interest in becoming an officer on a nuclear submarine. However, as my career evolved so did my professional interests, and I started to feel like I wasn\u0027t honoring my path by going into the Navy. As a senior with only months to go before getting my commission, I dropped the program and decided to try my luck at the private sector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t regret the decision, but I have yet to find a job in the private sector for nuclear engineering. I decided that I have an inspired passion for aerospace engineering, and have since applied for graduate school at UF a master\u0027s in Aerospace Engineering. Against all odds, I was accepted!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I have about two months to go before I start graduate school, and I\u0027m starting to have second thoughts. My interest in Aerospace Engineering is still there, but I have this Bachelor\u0027s degree in Nuclear Engineering that I have yet to use, and all of the people I went to school with have gone on to get lucrative nuclear engineering jobs...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, so seeing this has a way of getting under my skin more than it\u0027d get under others. I\u0027m worried that I will never get the opportunity to use my highly specialized undergraduate education, and that employers will look past my master\u0027s degree and refuse to hire me because I do not have a more in-depth background.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy ideal solution would be to practice both degrees in my graduate period of study by researching nuclear propulsion methods in space travel, which would put me in a position of desirability for my dream job, which is to work for NASA or SpaceX... I\u0027m worried though that it still won\u0027t be enough, and would like to see if there are career options for me if I pursue this path, or to see if I can switch my graduate focus to nuclear engineering before the damage is done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anybody have useful advice for me?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
