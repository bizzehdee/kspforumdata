Here is where my problems come in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI took a look at the different variations of the Greenhouse .cfg from this thread and tried to replicate it on the part with adding modules, switching the animations, trying simpler things but it was all in vein as I cannot make it behave like a Greenhouse (producing LS).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn line with what was said earlier 4 of these per 2 kerbals to make a self-sustainable base sounds pretty good to me as it will look great having all those greenhouses around your base and it will make larger base/colonies possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you say ? anybody with superior ksp modding skills want to give this a try ? If you can do it i\u0027m pretty sure I will be able to replicate the result to the rest of the mods parts to have a IFLS compatibility add on to the mod.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sandworm","CreatedById":66244,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T21:49:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELittle error: The install seems to have an extra MM dll contained in the IFILS directory.
