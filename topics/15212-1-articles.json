Make sure your orbit passes over the spot that you want to land (roughly), and just before you reach that point in your orbit you fire a retrograde burn. If you don\\\u0027t know how to change your orbital path, you need to learn how to do that before you can begin to choose a landing spot. Shrink your orbit until your \u0027descent\u0027 line is touching on the area you want to descend. Your orbital line should be a very narrow looking oval shape - much longer than wide - with the ends nearly touching. Use small thrusts to change the landing zone. Come down as straight as possible. Make small adjustments as you get lower as others have said.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guard13007","CreatedById":30274,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-27T19:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, this is how I do it, and it works damn good for me every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Get into orbit (preferably a low circular orbit or with near where you intend to land being low).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If where you want to land is not somewhere in your orbit, you need to change the plane of your orbit, it\\\u0027s a bit hard to explain, but you point on the horizon directly between where you are going and where you are coming from on the navball and one way will drive your orbit one way, the other will drive it the other way. I can\\\u0027t explain it any better and you get a nice feel for it after you\\\u0027ve done it once or twice. (Additional note, because the Mun rotates, your orbit may not be over where you want it when you actually get there, just do more adjustments as you get closer, and/or as you get a feel for it you can figure out what adjustments to make earlier on.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Now that your orbit goes over that spot, go to the opposite side of you orbit and retroburn until your periapsis is about 5 km (I assume you have strong engines on your craft, else you may want to come in slower/from a different angle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When you get near where you want to land, retroburn until you\\\u0027re moving about 100 m/s, then slowly continue to retroburn as you get lower and you\\\u0027ll notice you have to tilt yourself upright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. When your path is almost straight down, go ahead and switch to burning straight down and lock yourself in place with ASAS. You can tilt a little bit here and there to kill off any remaining lateral movement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. As you get closer to the ground, start slowing yourself down, depending on how responsive your craft is, this will be to different degrees. For instance, mine is very quick so I can keep it between 20 and 40 m/s until I start to get uncomfortable (when I can see rocks coming up at me).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. For final touchdown, bring it down to as slow as possible, under 5 m/s is best. Use steady low thrust instead of bursts. As soon as you touchdown, cut engines, if you bounced, just make sure you are coming down straight again so you don\\\u0027t tip over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor future flights, if you are trying to set up a base, this becomes even easier because you have the craft as a point of reference. Just land everything within a kilometer, and then you can take off again and carefully move closer to the other structures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps and isn\\\u0027t too complex. Like I said, after the first time (or second), it becomes second-nature to change your orbit and land. Unless you decide to do a direct decent landing, in which case the biggest thing to remember is to slow the heck down while you are still high up because you won\\\u0027t have enough time to closer to the ground (3 of my Kerbals learned this the hard way).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maxsil","CreatedById":4017,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-27T19:45:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EStrap a few RCS thrusters and some tanks on your ship then Just do a deorbit and to get the landing area withing a few KM of eachother, then use I J K L N and H to steer the ship/base into position using that\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Animal Mother","CreatedById":2477,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-28T21:59:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAim for the Green Circle with the cross through it, then perform a long burn at 5-10% engine power, at any altitude; unless your under 1000m, in which case you burn that engine as hard as you can. You should be looking at between 0-10 on your velocity speed indicator before you hit the ground otherwise your landing struts will snap off like twigs.

Wow. I\\\u0027ve never been able to be off by more than a few degrees. Anyway, if your craft are commonly on this inclination, you can take advantage of it to get them all to the same place. Retrograde is the green circle with the X through it at all times. Point towards that and fire your engines to bring your orbit down. If you wanna do the stop and drop method (as is what appears to be suggested from a skim-read of this topic), just keep firing retrograde until the speed is very close to zero. Then switch it to Surface to account for the Mun\\\u0027s rotation, and point retrograde again and fire your engines until it\\\u0027s as close to zero as you can get it.
