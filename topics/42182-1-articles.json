Compare to stock parts and other mods (KW, NP, AIES etc) and you\u0027ll see. I understand you probably didn\u0027t want to release OP engines but you\u0027ve gone too far the other way IMO.

It only beats the maverick 1D on delta vee in atmosphere and at a lower TWR.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried making a 3 section engine but it overheated very quickly and the pre-made one has weird connections (or is it supposed to attach to the 5s?). The weight of a single section compares ok to the lv-909 for example or again slight heavy compared to the 50 thrust AIES engine but it\u0027s when scaling that the problem is compounded. There are simply too many lighter alternatives with similar efficiency. Especially with 1.25m smaller rockets, low weight is worth more than thrust (which is what the dV numbers show).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbolar","CreatedById":69747,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T17:12:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGristle: Thanks for pointing that out, definitely needs fixing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERatzap: I do want to try using both FAR and B9, but I\u0027m having some trouble getting the game to load.
