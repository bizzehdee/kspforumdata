If anything I\u0027m getting more, not less picky as there is no excuse for using the wrong aircraft, for example, since it\u0027s animated anyway.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will become more\u00A0and more true, not less true. I\u0027m really thinking about this as a primary thing going forward since the models have to be made anyway, so I won\u0027t give a modern movie a pass for using the wrong model now since it literally takes 5 minutes with google to pick the right one, which is a pretty low bar for a 100 million dollar movie to be held to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGo back to movies where muzzle-loading cannon almost universally shoot magical, exploding rounds, when they could CGI balls skipping through the ranks, instead (but dumb moviegoers expect all artillery to explode). Heck, they do this with medieval combat in film/TV---they have to have catapults always shooting things on fire for the same reason, hits need to \u0022explode.\u0022 It\u0027s really distracting when you know better.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, 78stonewobble said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd offcourse a very accurate movie, can make a dumb mistake whereas even a less accurate movie can get something right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I\u0027d say... if I want historical accuracy, I should watch documentaries... Movies, to varying degrees of historical accuracy, try to tell stories.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t disagree here, but as technology improves, the excuses for doing this really wrong become fewer and fewer. If you need to have your animators build 20 different vehicles for a film anyway, having them build 10 wrong ones because they look cooler than what they should be is pretty inexcusable to me. There was a WW1 airplane movies a few years ago... seeing the trailer made me not see the movie, because all the German planes were Fokker DR1s. If I ever see it on TV maybe I\u0027ll watch some of\u00A0it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, 78stonewobble said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t discuss technicalities and details as much as we want, but I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s reason to get worked up about.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt depends, obviously. a movie with a great, and \u0022realistic\u0022 story (both from a historical and/or from a personal perspective) can survive technical issues for the greater truth of the history or experiences, obviously. Some stories get very derailed for me when technology is wrong, though. Pearl Harbor is an example of a movie I cannot abide on multiple levels... just watch Tora, Tora, Tora! instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
