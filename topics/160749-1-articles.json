So your LAN is basically undefined. I think that\u0027s the source of why it didn\u0027t work for you. The game picked an arbitrary value for your LAN.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat these guys are saying is basically right. The easiest way to know when to launch is just to eyeball it -- put some kind of marker at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, and in the tracking station figure out the plane of the target orbit. When the marker is on the plane, launch. I have heard that there is also a way to calculate your proper launch time via a mixture of all the orbital parameters, but I didn\u0027t pay attention.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-18T04:12:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI launch to Minmus inclination all the time. \u00A0It\u0027s not hard, I\u0027ve been meaning to write a tutorial for a while, it seems like few people know how to do it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pand5461","CreatedById":172084,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-05-18T04:58:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow exactly did you get your LAN while on launchpad?
