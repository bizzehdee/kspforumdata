As you scale down, atmosphere becomes an increasingly daunting problem: smaller rockets have a smaller inertia-to-area ratio, and have a harder time punching through atmosphere. As you scale up dimensions, surface area exposed to atmosphere, and thus drag, goes up as the square of dimension, while mass/thrust/inertia all go up as the cube, meaning atmosphere becomes increasingly irrelevant as you go big.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn stock KSP, if you had the parts (ignoring differences in TWR, Isp, etc) you actually could get away with your 1-gram payloads, because the terribleness of the stock aero model means there are no advantages to aerodynamic rockets. If you move to FAR/NEAR, you would see limits on micro-rocketry, however, because the smaller your rocket, the more delta-V you have to spend fighting aero drag, until you reached the point at which your rocket could not carry a single gram of payload to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: The reason you see the average air drag losses there is that rocket engineers know this, and very deliberately choose to design rockets large enough to minimize aero drag. If they spend excessive amounts of delta-V fighting aero drag, their launch costs balloon; it would be more economically efficient just to go big from the start, and carry several payloads per rocket if small stuff needs to get to orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-08T14:14:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/08/2014 02:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kryten","CreatedById":348,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-08T14:22:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Starman4308\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Starman4308\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EYou are misunderstanding what is going on.
