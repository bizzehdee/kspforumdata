Its much too big to be a satellite. Well, up until 7.0 a ship this big was needed to be able to scan at 1000x timewarp, so I just started with that and removed scanners and tested until I found the minimum, then added an extra pair again for good measures!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the pad-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDouble tap 0 to lock gimbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewith mechjeb just launch with whichever profile you want, it has lots of fuel and lots of thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce out of the atmosphere and/or at your target orbit press 1 to deploy all solar panels and toggle your scanners. 1 will not toggle the panels back in again only extend them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe sure to place yourself in a decent orbit for the most efficient scan time.

That way you will be in sunlight full time, and wont accidentally go behind the planet and lose power. There is a single RTG on board but that\u0027s just so you never lose control, it wont power the actual scanners properly. It has enough battery power to not run dry while scanning the Mun and going behind Kerbin, so it will probably work for most other Moons except the closest 3 to Jool. That giant is too big for batteries to last so there\u0027s no real point in trying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.catalystservers.com/hoy/ksp/1000x%20K-Scanner.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECraft with no launcher\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.catalystservers.com/hoy/ksp/1000x%20K-Scanner%20with%20Launcher.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#00FF00;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECraft with Zenith VII Launcher\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, this thing has an effective DeltaV of over 7000m/s from LKO, so its absolutely Overkill, but it is enough to send to any planet or moon.
