Regardless it\u0027s probably because your entry profile is wrong or something is fundamentally flawed in your designs such that they fail under high dynamic pressure (mostly if its a \u0022yes\u0022 to the FAR question)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first case come in shallower than you are. It doesn\u0027t take much, the drag will do the work for you. If you\u0027re coming back from a moon or extrakerbin planet try to aerocapture. You don\u0027t need to land in a hurry; get yourself a shallow periapsis around 30km or so and be patient. Aerobraking with literal airbrakes/high angles of attack is advisable at those altitudes, though usually difficult to maintain stably in denser air. You can bleed a lot of speed that way without much heat buildup and hold off your descent while you\u0027re at it, preventing further heat build up. If you\u0027re patient with it you should be able to avoid overstressing the airframe, though a well designed one, even in the case of very heavy spaceplanes, can be good for in excess if ten g\u0027s per my experimentation if applied somewhat gradually. If it\u0027s an airframe issue, it could be as simple as needing more struts. The more parts you square off to other parts the better you\u0027re going to do. I haven\u0027t found intentional flex very helpful in KSP. If not simple strutting it could be poor transonic design resulting in extreme drag when coming in fast (another FAR thing) in which case try to build more gradual curves. If its pretty, FAR will probably like it. Similarly loss of pitch control (FAR or otherwise) usually results in very high angles of attack and as such high instantaneous g-force. That would be due to poor center of lift/center of drag/center of pressure location vs center of mass, possibly the result of burnt fuel in space (only jets burn evenly in most cases). As long as your weight is forward your balance ought to be manageable.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Toyotawolf","CreatedById":75259,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T15:56:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K1productions\u0022 data-cite=\u0022K1productions\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor the life of me, I cannot get a spaceplane to re-enter the atmosphere without folding up like an accordion.
