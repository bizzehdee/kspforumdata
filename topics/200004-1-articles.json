A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E that they look weird, in my opinion there should also be some additional kind of strut that can only be seen in editors and only reaches a very short distance - kind of like a blob of space grade glue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly I keep reiterating this every once in a while but here goes; the sizes of the biggest and smallest pieces of any same type in the whole game are almost universally not ever nearly far enough apart to allow detailed looking crafts without reaching absurdly laggy part counts. This isn\u0027t at all limited to structural pieces though, so a partially off topic remark, but still relevant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-02-03T21:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022129319\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3729945052\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/97146-130-mobile-frame-system-mfs-v033-29052017/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:193px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022190933\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed3509749724\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/191921-181stork-delivery-system-sds-v0050-mission-control-the-bigger-stork-has-landed08-mar-2020/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:193px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKinda this, but needs update.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
