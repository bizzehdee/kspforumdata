I was performing a Mun base mission, place a base on wheels that can support 17 kerbals and also have a science lab. I sent it up in two parts, one with a huge aircraft fuselage crew compartment, and the other with the science lab. I painstakingly got them together on the munar surface, and then at the moment of connection the game crashed. I restarted the game, quickloaded, tried again... again it crashed. I thought maybe one of my mods was missbehaving (all I have is parts of the B9 mod which I haven\u0027t used yet, Kerbal Engineer Redux, and JSI to go with B9) but removing them only seemed to make it worse. I could get into the game but it would freeze and crash at the space center menu. So I put the mods back in, tried to load up the game and thought... maybe my space has gotten too loaded with junk. So I went and deleted most of the debris sitting near Kerbin and the Mun. This time the game gave me an error report when it crashed. So I figure now I can at least share this. Where do I post this report by the way?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, is there a way to reinstall my game to a fresh install but somehow preserve my game? I don\u0027t want to lose all of the progress I\u0027ve made. The one problem might be that I have ships out in space that are using the Kerbal Engineer sensor tape thingy. If I reinstall the game and I don\u0027t have Engineer installed the game might bug out when it tries to load those parts... Is it hard to go into .craft files and remove those mod parts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T02:36:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETry making a new \u0022game\u0022 in-game.

If I am correct, the issue is that your game is running too much memory, thus crashing the game. Downgrade the graphics and the texture resolution. The game should start working correctly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you add more mods, you will need to lower the texture quality to save memory.
