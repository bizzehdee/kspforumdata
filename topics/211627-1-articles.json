I\u0027m considering each of these things have already been in development. I\u0027m assuming they\u0027ve placed each category in the road map as the progress they\u0027ve made on each of these. We\u0027ve got sneak peaks of colonies and an orbital assembly. I know that an image of these things still requires the developed means of how they\u0027ll be implemented so that\u0027s the\u00A0 critical part. And all these considered that the game won\u0027t release from early access until the road map is completed so the player base will act as the final quality control with bug fixes.

I\u0027m assuming this issue with surface bases will best be tackled as \u0022establishing\u0022 the surface colony will turn physics interaction off and otherwise \u0022freeze\u0022 the object outside of time warp (as I know KSPs time warp does this to objects). I can predict orbital colonies will require a circularized orbit at a certain orbital height, I\u0027m hoping this isn\u0027t the case so I can recreate a munar gateway of the Artemis program. But I see it as the easiest option. I\u0027m assuming the game would give you a prompt to lock the orbital colony in place. I\u0027m just hoping that you can only choose a specific orbital height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterstellar: No idea\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know KSP2\u0027s development has spent probably the most time involved with subject matter experts of astrophysics and aerospace engineering. They\u0027re looking to develop into the theoretical realm which I\u0027m sure is quite the task. The only data we have is from Voyager 1 \u0026amp; 2, which the high radiation of interstellar travel proves we still don\u0027t understand exactly how this will affect vehicles. I can see most of the time spent here to be with providing the most accurate representation of what we know and theorize right now. I know mods have implemented this in KSP but they\u0027re building the entire game to fit this subject in with it which is a much bigger task.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExploration: 2-3 months\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis should prove the easiest updates as all others have walked before this one can run.
