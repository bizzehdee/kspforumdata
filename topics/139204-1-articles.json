To make tweakable (able to change amounts in VAB/SPH) change the modifier for \u0027isTweakable\u0027 to \u0027true\u0027 THESE VALUES ARE ALL CASE-SENSITIVE!

It\u0027s just a generally good thing to have in the game and I don\u0027t know why Squad changed it.

It\u0027s very sensitive to part placement order, try this little experiment: Build a single fuselage plane with a single\u00A0intake in front and single jet engine at rear. Place the intake before the engine, then fly and observe the readout. Go back to the SPH, remove both, and then place the engine before the intake and repeat. Observe that the readout gives very different readings even though performance is identical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027re much better off using the propellant requirement percentage\u00A0visible in the right click menu for the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
