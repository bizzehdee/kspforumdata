Firstly, look up some tutorials on youtube for basically any aspect of the game that confuses you (like orbital construction). And secondly, install MechJeb, and use its autopilot features. Tutorials can be pretty useful for giving you an idea of how to do things, particularly with regards to planning out your missions properly so that everything functions right. MechJeb\u0027s autopilot features are incredibly helpful for teaching you how to play the game, as you can use it to do almost anything autonomously and with pretty good efficiency. Rendezvous and docking, interplanetary transfers,\u00A0ascent and landing, all stuff that MechJeb can help you with. Watch how the autopilot does it and you quickly learn how to do it yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, for this sort of thing in particular, if you want to launch the whole base at once, don\u0027t launch it fully assembled. Keep everything as symmetrical as possible and as close to your rocket\u0027s central column as possible. Attach base modules via separators, and give them RCS, docking ports,\u00A0and command pods so that you can dock the base together once you\u0027re in space. Don\u0027t even try to launch an entire base of that size completely assembled, the drag will make it incredibly difficult to get out of the atmosphere.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T13:24:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222603364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140547\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464326683\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022164785\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Charkim Paul\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, Charkim Paul said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni want to know that how to send such a big building into the space and land on the planet?i am a new guy in the Ksp\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe base can be assembled on ground as its easy to put on wheels.\u00A0I assembled it in orbit using mechjeb to get the angle correct.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause of its wide base its pretty easy to land but it need plenty of reaction wheels.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nit has included parts to help launching it, I work on an new version who will probably have all the 4 arms loose and in front and assemble them after aerobrake at target.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Charkim Paul","CreatedById":164785,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-27T14:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222603425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140547\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464334021\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022137748\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022T.A.P.O.R.\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n7 hours ago, T.A.P.O.R. said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not super skilled with this, but I use parts from infernal robotics to help with deployment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI learned a fair bit from looking at the construction of the demo craft that Nils made.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t \u00A0remember if it shipped with the mod or was a separate download though.
