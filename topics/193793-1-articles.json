I have read through the majority of the documentation listed on its Github wiki page. However, though said documentation has indeed increased my understanding of how antennae work within the realms of this mod, I nevertheless find myself in need\u00A0of a number of\u00A0gameplay related clarifications and general advice. As such, what follows is a list of inquiries alongside their respective explanations:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. How can I determine a threshold for when an antenna ceases to communicate with another?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the intent of any antenna is\u00A0to communicate, the variables given by RealAntennas must ultimately lead the user\u00A0 to a conclusion about a maximum distance within which a given antenna can communicate with another antenna. In RealAntennas, I see that this distance is a result of transmitter power, gain, and frequency used. The antenna planner ultimately produces a number that represents a data transfer rate at a preset distance (why the distance slider only reaches 1Mm is completely beyond me).\u00A0How can I determine the minimum acceptable data transfer rate between two antennae? What benefit does a high transfer\u00A0rate have from a sandbox mode\u00A0perspective? At what point do two antennae lose connection?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote: in questions 2\u00A0 and 3, I assume that communication satellites primarily perform their purposes with dish antennae.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. How does one distribute dishes on communication satellites?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I recall correctly, an antenna can connect to only a single radio source. Firstly, I am unable to create communication satellites with hundred-dish arrays for every single object I will launch in my save. Secondly, given that I, as a player, would generally like to do things other than launch an endless number\u00A0of communication satellites for months, I limit myself to eight communication satellites (four in equatorial orbit at 10000km, four in polar orbit at 10000km) per save unless I expand outside of Earth\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. How can I do the same with RealAntennas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Dish angling.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, a dish must be pointed in the correct direction. This raises multiple issues. To begin, I am unsure if I will be able to launch enough satellites to blanket the surface of the Earth with good communication. Secondly, I am not sure how I can approach satellite orientation. Given that I have Persistent Rotation, I may be able to simply let my satellites constantly rotate to face the Earth. However, once in a while, these satellites will drift. This\u00A0means that I will need to constantly check and reorient every single communications satellite I will ever launch. Is this true?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll in all, my confusion lies in how one designs a communications satellite\u00A0 and how one maintains a communications network. I am unsure whether omnis or dishes are what a communications satellite usually uses to connect to its surrounding objects, and, if dishes are what I should use, I am unsure how to keep said dishes oriented correctly. Of course, I may simply be misunderstanding everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy apologies if I come across as ignorant,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMatuchkin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-05-11T18:34:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2020 06:34  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Matuchkin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
