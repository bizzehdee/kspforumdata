It was loading normally and suddenly (2-3 seconds after Module Manager finished its job) it stopped loading at around 80%. It was just standing there, HDD indicator was blank and nothing happened. I thought it was RAM issue, so I uninstalled all recommended mods and only things left were RO and its dependencies. Once again, it failed to load. Same problem. It stopped loading at around 80%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither my PC hates me, or I have some big problems.
