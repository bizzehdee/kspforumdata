Get a ship in low orbit, then jump out and thrust backward. Minmus\u0027s low gravity (0.491 ms^-2) and relatively fast rotation (11h 13m 20s) mean that the relative velocity of landing on the surface isn\u0027t much. Getting back into orbit is easy if you time the rendezvous intelligently. I\u0027ve contemplated going twice in one run.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003ELanding on Ike, though . . .\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003EThey said it was impossible.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003ETechnically, it is. Ike has well over twice stronger gravity (1.10 ms^-2) and a slower relative rotation (18h 11m 58s). The lowest energy stable orbit I got was 325m/s relative to the surface. Since a jetpack only has 600m/s dv and crashing a Kerbal at \u0026gt;50m/s to make up the difference doesn\u0027t sound survivable, well . . .\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003EThis all occurred in my Duna mission, whereupon it was realized that fulfilling both contracts (Duna and Ike) at once wouldn\u0027t work with a one-time lander. After getting into orbit around Ike I got an idea: \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003Estop the ship\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003EJust bring the ship to a dead stop over the surface, drop the kerbal out, and then accelerate back up to orbit. Switch to the falling kerbal and use the jetpack to break the fall. Land and do all the science.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003EGetting back to the ship is much harder. You need to jetpack upward, and simultaneously stop the ship exactly so that the altitude, speed, and position all match. Stopping the ship means of course that as soon as you switch to the kerbal, the ship will start falling. In practice, though you \u003C/span\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003Ecan\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E boost upward periodically to compensate, the timing tolerances are too tight to also control the kerbal to a rendezvous--and altitude loss is unavoidable. So, you\u0027ll get a hair-raising near-surface rendezvous, after which you immediately blast off back into orbit, just seconds before slamming into the ground.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003EThe difficulty here is managing the actions of two different vessels, one without a HUD to tell you where to go.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003EI succeeded after several tries, although it could be easier with a different ship.
