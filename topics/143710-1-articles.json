Everything was going fine, then I installed some extra mods with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network (a KSP mod manager)\u0022\u003ECKAN\u003C/abbr\u003E in addition to the mods I have now. I now can\u0027t click any button, I can\u0027t go into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E or \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E, tracking station etc. sometimes I magically can go in, but then when I press the \u0027exit\u0027 button, I can\u0027t come out. I tried all methods I could find online. I also got my backup quicksave, and replaced it as \u0027persistent.sfs\u0027 or whatever it is called. As I said I got this problem before, and what I did was restart my game and it would be fixed. However this time I got much farther in, I just learnt how to R \u0026amp; D, I flew by Duna, etc. I am really annoyed. I will post a link to a screenshot with the error log onto it, and will post my save.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScreenshot:\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/MiptZZG\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/MiptZZG\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSave:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/home?preview=persistent.sfs\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/home?preview=persistent.sfs\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stelum","CreatedById":166516,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-14T09:11:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Nevermind, I fixed it.
