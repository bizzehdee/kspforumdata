These recording software use your GPU\u0027s h.264 video encoder to capture video, and as a result, they create very high quality videos with very little impact on in game performance. Plus, the file sizes are very reasonable; I just got half an hour of 1080p 60FPS KSP game-play for about a gigabyte of hard-drive space. Best of all, they are completely free.\n\nAlso, for the love of Kod do not buy FRAPS. It costs $37 (Which is a lot considering the other options are free), can have a huge impact on in-game performance, AND it exports massive AVIs that will consume your hardrive. Shadow-play, OBS, AMD GVR are FAR better options. \n\nFor editing the videos, I use [AVIsynth](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page), a very powerful non-linear script based editor (its also free). Its great for trimming videos, speeding up videos, overlaying images and videos on top of videos, transitions, and all sorts of useful stuff. Since it is script based, edits are instant and there\u0027s no chance of crashing the editor and losing your work. Although, it is a bit un-intuitive with the lack of a GUI. Still, if you\u0027ve done any programming before, it shouldn\u0027t be too hard to learn. It also comes with tons of user-created plugins for doing all sorts of cool stuff (Like adding perspective to videos, so that you can have a tilted screen).\n\nSince AVIsynth processes AVIs, and since OBS/Shadowplay/AMD GVR output to mp4s, I use [XVID4PSP](http://www.videohelp.com/software/xvid4psp) to convert the mp4s to AVIs. Its quite a versatile tool since it can convert video into many different formats using a wide variety of codecs. If you use the right codec, the quality of conversions is nearly loss-less as well.\n\nSo there you have it, a completely free setup for recording and editing (if you don\u0027t count the computer you\u0027re using to record, or the electricity required to run your computer, ect..)\n\nYou can check out my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTIgONilLxeAPqkiZrqZOzg) to see videos I\u0027ve made with this setup. Though, I haven\u0027t been too active lately and I\u0027ve only uploaded two videos, but I\u0027m hoping to change that soon^TM^..."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T14:40:33Z","Content":"For video capture, I use Bandicam.
