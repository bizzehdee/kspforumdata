As you will see on the OP there are now \u0027two\u0027 versions of SVE you can download, one is the Overhaul version, one is the Release version. I\u0027m not going to go into extensive detail on the differences (you can read them \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Nhawks1717/StockVisualEnhancements/wiki/Which-one-do-I-get%3F\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E) but basically one is built on the old EVE-Overhaul version while the other is built off of the latest Release version. The Overhaul version has more features but is a little more buggy. I am going to continue the development of SVE on the Overhaul version because of the additional features (at least until the features are added to the release version). As of now the Release version is going to be at a developmental stop until Scatterer updates to support multi-planets and/or EVE release updates to include the features. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETL;DR SVE has two versions, Overhaul will be continually updated.
