Thats all I want. Ive tried it myself hour upon hour day upon day following tutorial designs and trying to make my own designs but NONE OF MY ROCKETS EVER GET CLOSE TO ORBIT.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy is it IMPOSSIBLE to make such a rocket. all I want is payload stage consisting of Mark 1-2 Cockpit and a Lander capable of going down to planet or moon surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery single one of my rockets either tips over which is due to my incorrect use of asparagus staging which I will never use again seeing as it will become irrelevant anyway in the future\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor my rockets fall apart on the landing pad and explode\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eor they explode when I throttle up\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have tried to make every damn interplanetary rocket I can but NONE of the large rockets work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Elittle ones....fine. Travelling to the Mun or Minmus thats fine. But getting out of the system to say Duna or Eve. Impossible it makes me want to quit, but I wont I will get out of the kerbin system dammit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomeone please post me an easy design with the two requirements I have above. I am still very new at this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have no idea how grateful I will be for a workable design that I can put together with the 3 man cockpit and a lander. however that is configured I dont care I just want it to work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am at my wits end \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E ;.; \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E ;.;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for your help\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T06:33:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds to me like your issue with bigger rockets is structural integrity.

It\u0027s a trite saying, but it\u0027s true here. You\u0027ll just want to use a compact lander design, probably broadly similar to your M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCnar landers, and for propulsion, you don\u0027t need a gigantic fuel reserve powered by eight Mainsails, you\u0027ll want a fairly modest stage (one Rockomax 32-200 tank could be enough), and one or a few nuclear rockets. Nuclear rockets, or NERVAs, don\u0027t provide much thrust, but they\u0027re incredibly fuel-efficient, which makes them a must for interplanetary transfers. They can make a little fuel go a long way. You\u0027ll likely be burning for a while - several minutes or so - but you won\u0027t need too much fuel. Then, when you arrive at your destination, just put the lander down the way you usually would (but be mindful that Duna\u0027s atmosphere is so thin that parachutes alone won\u0027t work).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, if you want to be able to return your Kerbals home afterwards, it becomes more complicated, but the basic principle remains the same: don\u0027t overdo the fuel, and use nuclear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
