I built a KSC to LKO orbital bus to bring ferry my crew to an orbitally assembed interplanetary ship. So I wanted to bring up 2 Hitchhiker storage containers along with a Cockpit mk I. So 6.25 tons. Also, I\u0027m a horrible pilot, so I put on enough wings to give me a stall speed of about 70 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince I\u0027m horrible at this, I put together quite a monstrosity of a space plane (but it works). I suspect I wasn\u0027t being very efficient, as I have 6 RAPIER engines (pretty sure I can go down to 4), an X200-32 fuel tank, a pair of mk I fuselages, and a LOT of intakes (4 rams, probably 14 radials).

At this point, I\u0027m doing about 1800-1900 m/s, then I pitch up to 60 degrees, go closed cycle, and burn until my apo hits 90 km or so. Standard circularization and orbital rendezvous after that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo I really need this many engines? I suspect not.
