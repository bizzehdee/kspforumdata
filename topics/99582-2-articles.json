I think that KSP should allow players to move beyond \u0022flags and footprints\u0022 and into meaningful exploration that opens the way for settlement and economic development of the Kerbol system. I personally think that this should be kept strictly near-term in it\u0027s scope. KSP should not depict space exploration as something that should be ignored until the far future. On the other hand, not everyone who plays KSP wants to play \u0022Space Tycoon\u0022, although if you ask me, exploring space without understanding why you would want to go there in the first place seems bizarre! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other players who want to depict interstellar space travel. There are technologies that are know today, but which are technologically immature, that can be used to reach nearby stars on missions that take only a few decades. A few decades is still a long time, but it\u0027s still a huge improvement over the hundreds or thousands of years flight times offered by less advanced propulsion methods. The technology required is quite advanced: Fusion thermal rockets, light sails, magnetic sails, and antimatter propulsion, are all understood in principle, but aren\u0027t something that could be developed and built as near term technology. On the other hand, no science fiction tricks are required. Obviously, an interstellar expansion would need to ensure that players have somewhere to go. The current version of KSP does some weird things if you send a spacecraft too far into deep space, so an overhaul of the current coordinates system would be needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t think many players fully appreciate what it would take to make even a passing attempt at implementing a decent depiction of even \u003Cstrong\u003EKerbol\u0027s inner solar system\u003C/strong\u003E. I don\u0027t think that most players even begin to understand exactly how much traffic, in terms of presently detected asteroids, is present on current maps of the inner solar system. The business of tracking Near Earth Asteroids is currently considered to be unimportant, so the task is relegated to small and obsolete telescopes. Dinosaur killers are tracked, city killers are not. Big dinosaur killers are rare, \u003Cstrong\u003Esmaller city killers are extremely common!\u003C/strong\u003E As a consequence of this, \u003Cstrong\u003Eplease ensure you are wearing a hard hat!\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E Due to their large size, the best defence against asteroids is to mine them to depletion before they can kill you! Don\u0027t worry, although impact is inevitable in a great many cases, we frequently have many orbits to go before they hit us. Being killed by a flying lump of platinum group metals, industrial resources, and ISRU feedstock would be wasteful and embarrassing in equal measure! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Kerbol\u0027s inner solar system isn\u0027t enough for you, how about an Outer Solar System expansion!? We currently have a Jupiter analogue in KSP. If you want to see exactly how hopelessly inadequate that is, ask yourself one question: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Where-is-New-Horizons/index.php\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EWhere Is New Horizons?\u003C/a\u003E Seriously, the current Kerbol system is a joke, and suggestions for \u003Cem\u003EGas Planet 2\u003C/em\u003E are a joke right along with it. Give us a decent outer solar system! As an advantage, the Kuiper Belt is already spelt with a K, so end-gamers can be kept busy exploring the Kerbal Kuiper Belt! There are many known Kuiper Belt dwarf planets in orbits that make utter nonsense of the comparatively tiny orbit of the Pluto/Charon system. The inclusion of a modest number of Kuiper belt iceteroids (there are estimated to be trillons of the comparatively rare bigger ones) should help to set things in perspective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad could make a semi-realistic Kerbol system by populating it with major planets, their moons, and \u003Cstrong\u003Every\u003C/strong\u003E severely limited representative examples of asteroids, iceteroids and dwarf planets.
