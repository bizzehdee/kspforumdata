However, it would be great if we could assign hotkeys to those hidden settings by editing the settings.cfg file so we don\u0027t have to quit, edit the settings, then start the game up again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nINCREMENT_CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT\u003Cbr\u003E\n{\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0primary = SingleQuote\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0secondary = None\u003Cbr\u003E\n}\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything starting with \u0022INCREMENT\u0022 increments the variable name behind it, anything starting with \u0022DISABLE\u0022 sets the variable to false, etc. By default none of these would be present in settings.cfg, but users could add them as they saw\u00A0fit. Novice users never even need to know, so it won\u0027t confuse anyone.
