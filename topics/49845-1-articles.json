It\u0027s not exactly in 2 missions like Scott Manley claimed would be possible, but I still feel that maxing the tech tree is too easy and quick. Of course, the career mode isn\u0027t complete yet so I\u0027m wondering how future updates will make maxing the tech tree more challenging? Adding more science requirements to unlock a node is an obvious way, but I\u0027m thinking something along the lines of budget, life support, and the need to send more than one kerbal on a long mission (because what\u0027s the point of sending a 3 kerbal mission to Duna to gather samples if one kerbal can do it just fine?) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m interested to hear your thoughts on this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scotius","CreatedById":57622,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-21T10:02:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETraining and specialisations for Kerbals \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E.
