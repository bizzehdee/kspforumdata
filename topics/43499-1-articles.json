Stock parts, except for the MapSat. This is not the first time I\u0027ve been to the Mun, but this is the first attempt to bring the bastards home and the first time I\u0027m trying to emulate Apollo. Three Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/sgnz89.png\u0022 alt=\u0022sgnz89.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rocket is functionally very similar to Saturn V, but you obviously can\u0027d make it look like one. I didn\u0027t bother about the looks. The stages lift you to similar heights. Despite numerous struts, the rocket swings ~10\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 sideways. There\u0027s an abort system at the top that works like a charm in case something goes wrong during liftoff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is after transmunar injection.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i43.tinypic.com/2eq89wj.png\u0022 alt=\u00222eq89wj.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Command module is turned into appropriate position and docked. Funny thing, that procedure involved bumping into a jettisoned ring which just stayed in the way. I had to move it like a dog uses his nose to move stuff around. The ring went away, you can see it as a mark 5.2km away. Later, during the orbit injection burn and while viewing the map, I actually slammed into it (what are the odds?!) and my whole ship exploded, except the capsule. F9 time. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe landing went well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/2zthdw3.png\u0022 alt=\u00222zthdw3.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve chosen a spot on the rim of a large impact crater.
