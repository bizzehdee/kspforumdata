Having thought about it later, maybe i should have reduced the thrust of the booster a bit to have a longer runtime/decouple in less dense atmosphere.\n\nWhat i ended up doing was increase the thrust of the radial decoupler separator-boosters somewhat with a patch, so it was able to push the boosters away and the nose of the booster outwards. To do that you also might need to turn down the thrust-level of the lower separator-booster and spread them out so they are at the end of the booster."},{"CreatedByName":"Jiraiyah","CreatedById":97667,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-07T16:29:36Z","Content":"[@Shadowmage](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/138730-shadowmage/)\n\nSir can i ask for a second version for one of your parts?\n\n![rLF9_H6FQVO6Gy6WBo04SQ.png](https://image.prntscr.com/image/rLF9_H6FQVO6Gy6WBo04SQ.png)\n\nThis one has a side without docking port, can you make another version side by side this that has ALL sides with docking port? also something that may worth looking into it? rover dude has a docking port that lets you destroy it after docking to fuse two parts and reduce not only part count but at the same time will stabilize the station or what ever more. can something like that be added to this mod too? maybe a module manager patch IF we have rover dude\u0027s system to add the needed stuff into your mod?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-01-07T16:31:19Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2018 04:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Jiraiyah**"}]}
