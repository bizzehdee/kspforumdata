Currently we have parts that are previously done by developers/modders. But I thought that it would be fun to have some kind of simplified editor to make own designs for rocket, rover, satellite, space station (and many other) parts which would need some base materials: different metals, electronics, propellants etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it would be a lot of work, but I believe that it\u0027s doable.
