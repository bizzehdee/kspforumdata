That\u0027s one of the reasons why agile development was invented, literally noone could consistently predict how long the whole thing would take correctly, most companies would under-guess, and suffer massive losses and go over-budget (It still happens now obviously).\u00A0 Eventually it just came down to \u0022just keep making features until its there, and update your estimate along the way.\u0022 You pay for development time not the product itself, the more dev time the better the product.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe old adage is \u002290% of the work occurs in the first 90% of the project, and the other 90% occurs in the remaining 10% (making a total of 180% of work)\u0022. Software problems always seem simple on the surface, as our minds cannot fathom every sub-problem in our estimate, and thus, we just have to deal with the fact that a time estimate is no more effective at prediction then a self-imposed soft deadline. You can simply extend your estimate by X%, but you run into issues with budget, requirement changes due to time, and delivery there.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo should we criticize KSP2\u0027s team for their delays? I would say the criticism is about as valid as blaming your coworker for arriving late after they needed to use a foggy highway covered in ice at rush hour.
