Ap was listed 181km and I was at 180 (Per is about the same margin), I don\u0027t really see how to check my inclination in the standard game, but Mechjeb lists me at 90.076 (contract asks for 90) and my orbit looks dead on to the indicated contract line. But it\u0027s not completing. I have a checkmark for everything but \u0022reach the designated orbit\u0022. Then I noticed the little swirling dots on the indicated orbit are going the opposite direction I am. Does it really matter if I am orbiting counter-clockwise and the indicated orbit is clockwise (at least from how I am looking at it currently)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd is there a better way to go about putting sats around other bodies at odd angles?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-26T00:45:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2015 12:45  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by SignalCorps\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T05:55:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt;\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EDoes it really matter if I am orbiting counter-clockwise and the indicated orbit is clockwise (at least from how I am looking at it currently)?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt really does. Hover the AN/DN node see whether you see 0 degree or 180 degree. If 180 degree, you\u0027re going backwards. In this case, the displayed inclination value doesn\u0027t even tell you anything because it will be 90 in any case - you really need to see AN/DN node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the best way for polar orbit on Kerbin is to directly shoot polar orbit rather than correcting after getting equatorial. I believe former is like 300m/s penalty while correction from equatorial will take at least 1.5km/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting to polar orbits on another celestial body is another completely different process - mid-course maneuver gives you just additional 10~50m/s depending on the size of the target planet.

Transfer to the mun. Make a very high mun orbit. Since the delta v required to change your plane to a polar orbit is roughly equal to your orbital velocity you should make your plane change high over the mun (where your orbital velocity is low). From there you can reduce your orbital height and finish your orbit! Polar orbits always require extra \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0v but how you execute the orbit change is what changes the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T06:01:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, you need to be going the same direction of the dots.

What I said earlier still applies, but I can give more detail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this case, the least dV way is - launch equatorial, maneuver intercept when the desired orbit aligns with your ejection direction (usually when the line between Kerbin and Mun is on the satellite orbital plane), then put mid-maneuver node to make you eject into a polar escape path (be careful that whether you go normal or anti-normal depends on the direction you want to go), then you just circularize at Mun periapsis and should be a small inclination adjustment around Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Reactordrone","CreatedById":110060,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T07:40:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor a non specific polar Mun orbit I usually set up regular Mun transfer but with a Mun impact trajectory rather than a low periapsis, then when I\u0027m about half way to the Mun switch focus view onto the Mun and do a small burn normal or anti-normal to align the orbit to above or below the Mun.
