My personal favorite is to set up a mining operation on Minmus, and bring the fuel down to LKO for a huge refueling station. Then, you can use all the fuel tanks that you\u0027re going to use to get wherever you\u0027re going to also get into LKO from the surface. You can even then use those same tanks get to Minmus (after an LKO refuel) to refuel AGAIN, before heading out. Not only does that save you fuel and tanks (and the fuel and tanks to lift them as well) on launch, it makes the resultant ship smaller due to the 700ish free m/s of dV you get from refueling at Minmus (if you go that route, it\u0027s frequently not necessary).\n\nI have a 147 ton ship I\u0027m sending to Jool. The total mass on the launch pad is 340 tons. The extra 193 tons is 8 solid rockets and 4 disposable fins to help get the behemoth into LKO, and everything else is going to Jool, after a stop at Minmus. That\u0027s a 43% payload ratio, and (more importantly in career) an 84% cost ratio (The payload is 182,965 funds while the extra stuff costs 34,928 funds)."},{"CreatedByName":"Warzouz","CreatedById":140055,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T19:59:39Z","Content":"Make it simple and add fins at the bottom of the rocket.\n\n15 to 300T cheap LKO stage.

You\u0027d need srbs to push through the first 10-15 km, but that\u0027s why we have srbs. \n\nYour rocket can have a wide fat front, as long as the bottom is just bigger. Use that and make sure you have an engine that can gimbal and/or RCS(but if you have to use up alot of monoprop, then you should consider redesign) along with some big enough fins to make sure the more draggy ends face retrograde. \n\nYou should also consider doing a less than perfect gravity turn if you\u0027re not tight on dv and have trouble getting your angle at 45 degrees when you\u0027re at 15km. Space is much much more forgiving with aerodynamics than kerbin is since there is none. If you use up some of your payloads fuel, you can always refuel in orbit via a docking port or the klaw (the klaw is our master! The klaw chooses who will go and who will stay). \n\nBack to your original problem of tanks bping into and exploding, if you have the tanks positioned with its CoM near or right on the decoupler, then it should just slide right off. You should be able to see its CoM by selecting the decoupler as the root part and emptying the tanks, and moving the tank vertically till it sitting fairly close to the decoupler(havnt actually done that before, but I\u0027ve gotten pretty good at eyeballing it due to my refusal to work with sepertrons). If you\u0027re willing to install a mod, space y have two decoupler that have sepertrons built in so that when you decouple, it will basically shoot the tanks out, but balancing can be a problem if it\u0027s far from the CoM."},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:03:32Z","Content":"The best way to combat separating your boosters is to just make your launch vehicle simpler. Just make the LF\u002BO boosters x-large enough to take you into LKO without any staging, and use solid rocket boosters to get the TWR so that you can lift that extra fuel off the ground (but of course dump the solid rockets when their empty). Separating boosters is a lot simpler when you do it in orbit. I also use TT-70 Radial Decouplers attached to the payload plus a strut on that to put distance between the payload and boosters, and I\u0027ll place the LF\u002BO boosters symmetrically around the payload. They\u0027ll simply put me in space and once there, I drain the extra fuel from the boosters and have low-power sepratrons detached the boosters safely away. That\u0027ll usually be enough to at least get me to Minmus.\n\nThis is my heavy booster system using only size 2 fuel tanks and engines.

The main thing is to make sure that you **attach the booster as low as possible on the radial decoupler** (i.e. the radial decoupler\u0027s attachment point on the radial tank is as high above the radial tank\u0027s CoM as possible).\n\nWhen the decoupler fires, it will naturally tend to make the radial tank rotate slightly away from the main body of the ship (since it\u0027s applying the repulsive force above the tank\u0027s CoM). Even a tiny bit helps, because the airflow against the side of the (slightly) tilted tank will tend to pry it further away from the main body of the ship.\n\nAdd to this the fact that the central ship is continuing to accelerate (because it\u0027s got its own engine firing), and it just works.\n\nOn another note:\n\nIf your monster is headed beyond LKO (e.g. if you\u0027re going somewhere else that will require a lot more dV than just LKO): You can make your life easier by not trying to do it all in one go. Just give your monster enough dV to make it to LKO, so that it ends up there intact, but nearly empty of fuel. Then you can launch refueling missions to top it off before it heads out into the great black beyond.\n\nFinally: For *really* big craft, you can assemble them in orbit, using docking ports. Of course, the problem with this is that docking-port joints are very floppy, and your craft will tend to wobble all over the place. However, if you\u0027re willing to use [Kerbal Attachment System](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92514), this becomes much simpler: it includes \u0022strut sockets\u0022 that you can mount on your craft, so that after you dock, your kerbal can go EVA and attach struts to stiffen things up.
