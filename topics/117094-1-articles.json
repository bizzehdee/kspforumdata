My personal favorite is to set up a mining operation on Minmus, and bring the fuel down to LKO for a huge refueling station. Then, you can use all the fuel tanks that you\u0027re going to use to get wherever you\u0027re going to also get into LKO from the surface. You can even then use those same tanks get to Minmus (after an LKO refuel) to refuel AGAIN, before heading out. Not only does that save you fuel and tanks (and the fuel and tanks to lift them as well) on launch, it makes the resultant ship smaller due to the 700ish free m/s of dV you get from refueling at Minmus (if you go that route, it\u0027s frequently not necessary).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have a 147 ton ship I\u0027m sending to Jool.

If you\u0027re willing to install a mod, space y have two decoupler that have sepertrons built in so that when you decouple, it will basically shoot the tanks out, but balancing can be a problem if it\u0027s far from the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Edax","CreatedById":147162,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-28T21:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe best way to combat separating your boosters is to just make your launch vehicle simpler. Just make the LF\u002BO boosters x-large enough to take you into LKO without any staging, and use solid rocket boosters to get the TWR so that you can lift that extra fuel off the ground (but of course dump the solid rockets when their empty). Separating boosters is a lot simpler when you do it in orbit. I also use TT-70 Radial Decouplers attached to the payload plus a strut on that to put distance between the payload and boosters, and I\u0027ll place the LF\u002BO boosters symmetrically around the payload.
