I watched several different tutorials on youtube to learn how to reliably dock. However, I\u0027ve noticed that no one uses the\u00A0docking mode. I have tried using it, but I\u0027m confused as to what it\u0027s supposed to do other than alternate between translational and radial directional keys. Nothing shows up on the little window when I click the docking mode button. I see the crosshairs that shift around as I adjust my trajectory, but what am I supposed to line it up with? If someone has a link to a video that explains the ingame docking mode, I\u0027d appreciate seeing it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stamp20","CreatedById":202020,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-13T20:08:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll docking mode really does is allow you to use WASDQE for translation instead or rotation.
