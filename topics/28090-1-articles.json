Now it build my landing stage around it and attached another command pod above it, now i want to build the launcher stage beneath, but because of the main pod being sideways i cant use symmetrie accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way i can change which command pod is being the main-pod?
