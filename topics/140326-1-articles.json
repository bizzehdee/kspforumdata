My problem is that when I try to use the autopilot in mechjeb, it does NOT want to cooperate. It turns to, let\u0027s say, north, then south, then north again until it breaks apart from the aerodynamics (I have FAR if that helps). I already correctly entered the numbers, my target orbit, AoA is at 2 degrees, I\u00A0edited my ascent profile\u00A0and everything, but the thing just doesn\u0027t want to work! I have NO idea what is going wrong. I know it isn\u0027t a problem with my rocket because I was able to fly it to orbit just fine by myself, but mechjeb just wants to throw it all over the place.\u00A0This is my first time trying to use it and it\u0027s frustrating because I already tried looking up tutorials for it but they\u0027re all very outdated or not a good explanation. I just want to know why it won\u0027t perform a gravity turn smoothly without jumping everywhere. If anybody could help me, I would be very grateful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-22T23:00:30Z\u0022 title=\u002205/22/2016 11:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by bigguy4u\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sebi.zzr","CreatedById":81294,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T10:03:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027re using MJ and FAR,you need additional extension.dll for FAR.Just put \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/55482-optional-mechjeb-modules-for-far-near-km_gimbal-23-july-16/\u0026amp;page=1\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EMechJebFARExt.dll \u003C/a\u003Ein KSP_win\\GameData\\MechJeb2\\Plugins,next to MechJeb2.dll.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd here is my ascent AP setup:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qAdLzts.jpg?1\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022562\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/qAdLzts.jpg?1\u0022 width=\u00221000\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sarbian","CreatedById":57146,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-23T14:22:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo. This is not needed anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGet the last \u003Ca href=\u0022https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/MechJeb2-Dev/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edev version\u003C/a\u003E of MJ.
