I patched the opt ramp and it\u0027s not enough. The way it unfolds just isn\u0027t right. There\u0027s no where in the animation to stop it that looks good and it collides with the runway if it\u0027s too low.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI should ask nertea if i could use his module adjustable cargo ramp once the remodeling is done.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, this dev continues! Heres a sneak peak at engine remodelling: top is the ARI engine, in the middle is a new 2.5m engine (probably runs on dark goo?) and the original dark drive with better model and hopefully better texture.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI haven\u0027t made any progress on naming these engines because im not good with acronyms so feel free to suggest any names. But you dont have to suggest name that must be a acronym because im thinking of naming the large one \u0027Lotus\u0027 because of the look\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/R2K1ueL.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022R2K1ueL.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are still quite alot to be done but ill be allocating most of my time this week working on this mod so optimistically OPT should be at release status at end of this week! And hopfully it will fit right into the new forum\u0027s add-on release section \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother thing i want to mention: many of you probably tried the 1.8 test version, in my opinion the bulged K fuselage for some reason doesn\u0027t look as good as the flat version. I can\u0027t explain why but it just doesn\u0027t feel right. Even it\u0027s very useful carrying 3.75m stuff but i decide to revert to orginal K fuselage. I want to prioritize look over function :P. But for those who already gotten use to the bulge, don\u0027t worry ill link it as optional download so you could have both.\u003Cbr\u003E\nLastly, ill keep the number of cockpits of OPT down to 3, 3 for each type:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/z9VItzV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022z9VItzV.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes thats the design of each cockpit i FINALLY decided to use... The reason for this change is i want to keep the OPT MAIN files as lean as possible, i will use 4096x4096 sized texture for maximum efficiency so the whole mod should stay under 50mb. But again, ill add the other cockpits as extra downloads.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the design of the k cockpit above, i kind of made it a continuation of the j cockpit, you can see the resemblance. I decided on this design because it gives a very \u0027space plane\u0027 look, also even k fuselage is very bulky this cockpit makes it look streamlined and it\u0027s cockpit will give a much better IVA view. Overall It just feel fit much better with the OPT pack.\u003Cbr\u003E\nedit: And yeah, when they light up they will create this smily face every time XD\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThats all for now!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t really like that K cockpit... i love the one in the current test version!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not really a problem having extra cockpits in the pack, anyway -- I don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s complained about it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for part descriptions -- I\u0027ll be back at home in just over two weeks, so I can finish them off then.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gwtheyrn","CreatedById":136455,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-01T12:49:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLove this mod so much.
