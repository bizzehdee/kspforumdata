And of the stock ones, almost none look and/or fly like conventional seaplanes (whacky designs or resorting to VTOL for water landing/takeoff), so I set out to create a realistic looking seaplane that lands and takes off like real seaplanes (no VTOL). I soon found out why no one makes them. It was a challenge to get the lift, thrust, and cg to line up favorably, but I eventually came up with this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/ndlKaABTp3k?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInspired by a Martin M-130-ish design, this plane is incredibly easy to takeoff, land, and fly in general!
