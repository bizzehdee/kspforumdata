(I know, a whole universe of planets out there now and Im playing around with Kerbin)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUp to now the best I\u0027ve managed is getting up there but I dont have (even close to) enough fuel to circularise my orbit. Now I\u0027m sure the design can still use some work but thats not what I\u0027m currently looking for advise on. I\u0027m assuming my piloting can be made more efficient as well since ive been more or less having a gutt feeling go at it. So basically, whats the most efficient way of flying a space plane up?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy current plan is get into a 45 degree angle off the runway, hitting SAS and waiting for 13.5-14 km where I switch from the 2 jet engines to the aerospike and increase my climbing angle to about 70-80 and wait for the projected apo to hit 70k at which point I throttle down until Im near the apo (65km ish) and then start burning again level with the horizon to circularise. Then I run out of fuel shortly after.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurely there are a myriad of improvements to be made.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fuzzy Dunlop","CreatedById":27329,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T21:32:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirstly the jet engines can still supply useful thrust up till about 20km (and even after then keeping them burning will at least shed weight) so don\u0027t turn them off too soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly it sounds like your trajectory is too steep. I think you should try keeping the climbing angle at about 45 degrees after areospike ignition.

This isn\u0027t easy, but you can look on the K-prize thread in the challanges forum for inspiration.

Remember getting to orbit is all about -horizontal- velocity. The reason you go vertical at first is to give yourself enough time to build up the required horizontal velocity before you hit the ground, also to get you above the drag of the atmosphere (on bodies with atmospheres). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow on Kerbin there isn\u0027t much drag above 30km so once your that high you should just burn horizontal untill you get most of the required velocity.
