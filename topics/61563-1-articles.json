Generally this works great, and control signals are received by KSP when I use the T.Flight. However, if I happen to forget that my Logitech Rumblepad 2 is still plugged in, I get the annoying surprise at launch time that the stick is unresponsive. So I unplug the rumblepad, but KSP requires me to completely restart the game before detecting the T.Flight as active controller. If there was some way to at least trigger a re-detect in game it would save so much time! Ideally I guess the game could just do a detect when a USB plug or unplug event occurs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-30T09:29:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebe happy that your flight stick actually works at all in this game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
