Fantastic spacecraft in bright colours, checks and patterns. \u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the dull, drab stock look with the colors used by most real-world spacecraft. But if you want colorful ships, there are mods. Here I am, practicing my orbital rendezvous techniques back before we had the docking, targeting and maneuver planning systems:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/c9bZ2.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c9bZ2.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dsnt1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022dsnt1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/Ifi40.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022Ifi40.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lyndonguitar","CreatedById":61194,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-15T15:22:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Trux\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Trux\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDoes white paint save weight :S\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E???? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_external_tank#Standard_Weight_Tank\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_external_tank#Standard_Weight_Tank\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022The original ET is informally known as the Standard Weight Tank (SWT) and is fabricated from 2219 - a high strength aluminum-copper alloy used for many aerospace applications. The first two, used for STS-1 and STS-2, were painted white to protect the tanks from ultraviolet light during the extended time that the shuttle spends on the launch pad prior to launch. Because this did not turn out to be a problem and to reduce weight, Lockheed Martin ceased painting the external tanks beginning with STS-3, leaving the rust-colored spray-on insulation bare, saving approximately 272 kg (600 lb) of weight.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
