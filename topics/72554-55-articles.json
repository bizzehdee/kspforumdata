With the new Auto-Scale system there are some parts that have the wrong scale type (2.5m to 1.25m [as opposed to 1.25m to 2.5m] adapters come to mind), and many mod packs have added, renamed and removed parts. This *will* break saves using those parts, which sucks. If anyone has updated .cfgs, I\u0027d love to get them.
