Thats right! Its the patched buildings scenery! I remeber seeing some in SPH. They dont fit the style of the game. I know they should represent the humble, low budget begining of the space program, but still: too cartoony in my opinion. Wouldnt mind if they got removed, even if there were holes or broken windows behind them.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-12T23:30:47Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2015 11:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Veeltch**"}]}
