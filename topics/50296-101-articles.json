Using this method you don\u0027t really need to worry too much about stuff burning off, because your reentry heating should be minimal; if it isn\u0027t, you aren\u0027t spending enough time bleeding off speed in the upper atmosphere. However, one drawback is that this method of reentry is highly inaccurate regarding landing spots, so expect to either make a lot of landings on suboptimal terrain or to spend time motoring back to KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0027fun\u0027 way is to throw your periapsis to around 20km and position it above the desert on the continent west of KSC. Then, you use the aerodynamic qualities of the middle atmosphere to ride over to KSC at 20-25km altitude the whole way. Using this method, you need to make sure that all your valuable heat-sensitive equipment is either in a cargo bay or otherwise aerodynamically shielded behind some other bulky part. The advantages are it\u0027s shorter, and personally I find it more fun to ride the ragged edge and see how far you can push it. ...also, I don\u0027t bother to use drag chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: aaaaand I totally missed that stuff was melting off your craft during your way \u003Cem\u003Eup\u003C/em\u003E, not your way \u003Cem\u003Edown\u003C/em\u003E.

This is simply due to terminal velocity : your craft won\u0027t physically be able to fall at a higher speed than than number, unless of course you point your engines towards the ground ! That being said, it\u0027s probably better to check the speed you\u0027re falling at rather than the current altitude : if you\u0027re below 330 m/s, you\u0027re good, if not chutes will get ripped off.
