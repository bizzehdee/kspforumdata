Since about version .21 SAS is included in all control pods, so the old module became obsolete. I think it\u0027s included mainly so that older designs aren\u0027t made unusable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow there isn\u0027t much reason to use it aside from looks, or if you\u0027re looking for some extra weight to balance a design or something. Personally I think it should give some extra torque for the extra mass to rebalance it... but it\u0027s not a big issue, really.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E -- Steve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-06T15:53:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI believe that SAS is included in all command modules \u003Cem\u003Eexcept\u003C/em\u003E the external seat.
