I\u0027m not sure this topic is the right place, so if you know a better one, please let me know.  \n\nI see a strange behavior of Action Groups and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E upgrades. But it also applies to stock game(v1.12.3), I checked it with no mods.   \n\nMy observations from stock game:\n\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E lvl1 you cannot use ActionGroups since menu is not there.  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E lvl2 It says you can only use basic ActionGroups. As I remember when I played a couple years back, it means you can only use groups like gear, brakes, light, etc. But now when I select a part, I can assign custom groups 1-0 as well. Custom groups work fine in flight.  \n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E lvl3 it says you can use  custom groups and it works like in lvl2.\n\nI am posting it here, cause I installed Custom Barn Kit for my unkerballed start career. And as I remember, action groups were available from the very lvl1(\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\nAm I doing smth wrong? What is the expected availability of ActionGroups in stock and modded game?"},{"CreatedByName":"Padrone","CreatedById":132505,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-17T19:30:46Z","Content":"[@serg.bloim](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/143535-sergbloim/)From what I could tell from my testing, if you have Custom Barn Kit installed it overrides all the configuration work done by AGE.  (Either using the in-game settings or directly editing the .CFG file for AGE. (\\Diazo\\AGExt\\AGExt.settings)\n\nAnd the default behavior of CustomBarnKit is to emulate default behavior.

I would like the tracking station to only be available (or at the very least unlock) after a certain science amount has been accumulated. I have a few levels added to my tracking station to increase the DSN levels to points where OPM will eventually be encompassed by a max level TS (I use GU as well, so I may add an insane unlock minimum in order to amplify my signal enough to reach the closest galaxy if possible or a set of relay satellites close to Pols orbit). Preferably, since I gimp my finances in career mode (or they increase much faster than I can use them), I would like to only allow certain TS upgrades unlock based off either a science level gate or just a sink for *x* amount of science to unlock the level. I haven\u0027t seen this implemented in other mods so I doubt this is possible, but figured I\u0027d ask and maybe get some advice on alternatives to make the idea work (very open to suggestions). That said, I was wondering what the \u0022DSNScienceCurve\u0022 key was about? I searched through the forum and on google but couldn\u0027t find much.\n\nThanks all!\n\n\\*Edit\\* I was wondering that maybe it\u0027s possible to gate-keep the TS upgrade based on Research facility level? I thought maybe you could use an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch that \u0022unlocks\u0022 the TS 4\u002B building upgrades after the Research building level has reached certain upgrade levels (like an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch where you\u0027d place @CUSTOMBARNKIT[\\*]:HAS[@RESEARCH[levels \u003E 3] or something like that that then adds in the @TRACKING \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Module Manager (mod)\u0022\u003EMM\u003C/abbr\u003E patch pass)? The syntax is likely off since I\u0027m typing this off the top of my head but don\u0027t know how much of the CBK patch can be edited.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-01-24T04:23:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/24/2023 04:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 24, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by shoe7ess**"}]}
