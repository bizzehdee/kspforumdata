I would like the tracking station to only be available (or at the very least unlock) after a certain science amount has been accumulated. I have a few levels added to my tracking station to increase the DSN levels to points where OPM will eventually be encompassed by a max level TS (I use GU as well, so I may add an insane unlock minimum in order to amplify my signal enough to reach the closest galaxy if possible or a set of relay satellites close to Pols orbit).
