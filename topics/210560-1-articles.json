I would like it if in ksp2 we had something like this. It has been confirmed that kerbals will have more looks and styles, so why not put those to use in a new kerbalizer? They could allow you to port them into saves through a system like the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E menu so you can load and save different kerbal creations. They could turn it into a photo maker where you can put kerbals on scenes of planets and pose them. The photo maker could have a way to make different color grading profiles like TUFX and\u00A0 custom boarders on photos. What would be really cool is if they could put those photos into custom albums. You could make an album for pictures from Duna or Ike. I really hope ksp2 has a way to make kerbals and use them on our saves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
