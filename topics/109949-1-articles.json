I suppose we could test stock aerobraking at Jool under worst case, and see if it is needed. From kerbin worst case is ~14 km/s, from Moho it\u0027s ~29. It might have a use in stock, I suppose."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T15:45:55Z","Content":"Inflatable heatshields would be cool for aerobraking things greater than 3.75m in diameter without aerobreaking them."},{"CreatedByName":"Tay_T","CreatedById":67173,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T16:13:00Z","Content":"The way I see this could be useful is when the heat-shield doesn\u0027t cover all the width of a vehicle or other parts of it that stick outwards, especially if it were a horizontally wide ship, such as a space station that wanted to be turned into a land base for example. Basically, this would be a workaround to avoid stacking multiple shields, or putting multiple ones over parts of the ship, making it visually and literally become redundant. *(Even though, the game nicely lets you select how much \u0022Ablator\u0022 is used, which could reduce the weight slightly, so you only burn up as much as you use, but that\u0027s another subject.*\n\nAlthough heat does dissipate, and yes, there is some valid points about heat not being a major issue with a regular heat-shield provided with the vanilla game version, this is still an idea nonetheless. \n\nAnother thing it could be useful for? Aerobraking. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E Inflatable heatshields would be cool for aerobraking things greater than 3.75m in diameter without aerobreaking them.\n\nYes, what I\u0027m saying was already said, but maybe I\u0027ll continue on that notion.\n\nIt sounds perfectly valid, like it would be great at slowing down a vehicle, which might even be more valid on low-density atmospheres like Duna where you basically are hurled towards the ground if you fall through the atmosphere at a slightly uncontrollable speed. (The article shown mentions it being a \u0022decelerator,\u0022 so this seems somewhat proven. Also, an amazing idea presented in the article that could totally work for KSP: Dropping cargo from space with heat-shields that fold out. That sounds like fun to me. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) ) Although... \u0022A.I.R.B.R.A.K.E.S.\u0022 does a very good job of doing the decelerating as well, the same as creating a fairing that dissolves most of the heat and speed without sacrificing anything inside of it. It\u0027s about the same result either way. I\u0027ve done a few tests myself, going typical orbital velocities as different angles, using a combination of the airbrakes and heat-shields, which, the brakes seem to lower the speed greatly, and in my experience, around 2x as fast deceleration than it would be without the brakes. But, this is all for you to decide. Just some thoughts I guess."},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-20T22:24:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Inflatable heatshields would be cool for aerobraking things greater than 3.75m in diameter without aerobreaking them.\n\nThis."},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T04:02:21Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Inflatable heatshields would be cool for aerobraking things greater than 3.75m in diameter without aerobreaking them.\n\nMy current forkaround is to us a fairing and but a regular heasheild on the inline bit"},{"CreatedByName":"sumghai","CreatedById":66272,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T04:27:22Z","Content":"**[MOD - Thread title renamed for clarity]**"},{"CreatedByName":"mattinoz","CreatedById":118580,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T05:10:40Z","Content":"Would double as a good toboggan on minmus."},{"CreatedByName":"Kegereneku","CreatedById":66154,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T09:13:40Z","Content":"I\u0027m betting someone would make boat out of them.\n\nAnyway :\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Inflatable heatshields would be cool for aerobraking things greater than 3.75m in diameter without aerobreaking them."}]}
