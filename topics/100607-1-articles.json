I think, from a glance without playing it, it has a lot of potential to teach people about how human bodies work, and the kind of diseases it may have. It may help people react better when they or someone they know got one of such disease, and report to medical professionals properly. May cause problems of amateur self-diagnosis, however.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that is just my casual observation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shynung","CreatedById":101096,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-25T04:57:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s pretty informative, actually.
