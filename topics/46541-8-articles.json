I already know the KTC save file is totally incompatible with Interstellar so installing that mod in the same game install will kill the KTC, and that ain\u0027t gonna happen until a KSP update kills it like its fathers before it.\u003Cp\u003EBut I seriously doubt that Interstellar will alter my approach to flying on Duna. I\u0027m not at all interested in flying super high and super fast there. You only need to get high enough to clear MOST but not all of the mountains, and the only critical speed characteristic is being able to fly slow enough to land at what is the average terrain altitude of the planet. If you can do these things, then you can pretty much explore all of Duna in an aircraft, or fly between bases anywhere on Duna you care to put them. And that\u0027s the essence of this challenge and the reason for the minimum 2500m landing capability. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI look forward to your flotilla\u0027s arrival.

There\u0027s great value to being able to produce your fuel off-planet more sustainably than Kethane allows...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut beyond that, when it comes to flying, its realistically-implemented nuclear reactors (NearFuture reactors produce far less power per ton than their real-life counterparts) open up the possibility of building larger cargo planes/helicopters on Duna- in my opinion the only type of aircraft *REALLY* worth building besides science vessels...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, this thread has inspired me- once this thread dies down some and I get in all my entries, and probably once 0.24 is released and everybody\u0027s used to it, I\u0027m thinking about creating a \u0022Flying Duna Mk3\u0022 challenge, one rewarding cargo capacity, low-maintenance (a point penalty for using nuclear reactors instead of solar power, and no use of reactors beyond fission allowed- fusion isn\u0027t sustainable on Duna, and antimatter isn\u0027t sustainable without massive infrastructure), and low part-count, rather than Kerbal capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for altitude- well it\u0027s of obvious use for spaceplanes... Also, the higher a plane\u0027s altitude ceiling, the faster you can fly at medium altitudes relative to that ceiling (you can maintain a lower Angle of Attack). OR, the higher the theoretical cargo capacity at a lower altitude. So I\u0027ve found this challenge useful for working out some design principles to eventually use in my Duna heavy lifter designs...

The first being choice of engines. As I stated very early in this thread and again with my other post, the choices are limited. Since my last plane did... ok with a Kethane/Electric mix, I decided to stick with that logic. But, where my last one came in under par with the folding props, I went a bit overboard this time with 10 props. I also took the advice you guys gave and loaded up a couple of nukes. I only really needed one but I\u0027m into symmetry. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result: Level flying altitude - 6300m\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELevel flight speed: 140 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot exactly what I\u0027d hoped for but it stays above most of the horrendous terrain on Duna, not all, but most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENextly, another huge problem with Duna is that NOTHING is flat. Landing a fixed winged aircraft is like trying to roller skate on a gravel road. Since I\u0027ve been playing around a lot with VTOL\u0027s lately, it only made sense to me that anything that is going to land anywhere on Duna... should be a VTOL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then there\u0027s that atmosphere, or lack thereof. Anything that\u0027s going to fly above the terrain on Duna is gonna need lift, and lots of it. I\u0027d been playing with the X-wing tail-sitter design and thought it would work well on Duna, and it does glide exceptionally well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also included 2 KJets on this. I thot about going full electric and I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t. With the props getting less than 5kn sitting on the ground, their thrust wasn\u0027t enough to takeoff. But, the 2 KJets running at about 15pct power plus the props got it off the ground easily. I used 25 Kethane to takeoff, out of 2,000. That leaves a lot for landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOk, so all in all, it flies, takes off and lands. The problems. Landing is terrifying. Getting spun around and getting the speed low enough for the KJets to kick in is rather tricky since the props can\u0027t do it alone. I included a bunch of air brakes and mighty glad I did. They easily slow things down enough to fire up the jets, spin around and do some reverse thrusting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, not a great score but better than my first attempt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals 7-2=5\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals Inside \u002B1\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECargo - There\u0027s a cargo hold in there but it\u0027s empty.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAltitude - Well, it depends on whether I use the jets.

Just entering the atmosphere and flying around can be done fairly easily. The real tricks are 1) being able to fly extremely slowly at high altitude so you can survive the landing, and 2) having met #1, getting the thing off the ground at Kerbin. Anything with enough wing to make a survivable landing in the 2000-3500m high dune fields that cover 80% or so of Duna is a real beast to launch because the lift wants to pull the rocket over or break it apart in Kerbin\u0027s thick air. The above DIRGE I posted had to be dragged up backwards so its wings functioned as the tail fins for the rocket, like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2814/12913981863_c2d713aff7_b.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002212913981863_c2d713aff7_b.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, if you want to do ion power, look in the leader board of the 1st post.

It\u0027s just a lot more difficult than it is on Kerbin. My D\u0027OH, for example, the turn radius of my old D\u0027OH was about 5km combined with a loss of 2-3km of altitude. My new DIRGE, however, can do a U-turn only about 2km wide and not lose any appreciable amount of altitude, but it\u0027s a much lighter plane with a lower wing loading and rather more control authority for its size.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EControl surfaces, like wings, are much less effective on Duna because there\u0027s less air for them to work with. So you need beaucoup control surface area, way more than for the same plane on Kerbin, to get any real control authority. But even with lots of control authority, you don\u0027t want to use a lot at any one time. Your plane is more or less riding the edge of a stall most of the time it\u0027s flying so you want to avoid sudden maneuvers. Also, fixed vertical tails are less effective at keeping the plane pointed forward so you need more of that than on Kerbin, too. Finally, there\u0027s a much greater tendency to lose lift when banked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last 2 things hit you from both directions. Banking causes altitude loss but keeping the wings level and trying to kick your nose over with rudder just makes you fly sideways because the tail fins neither weathervane you back prograde nor force prograde to match your new heading, unless you\u0027ve got ridiculous amounts of both. It\u0027s thus usually best to make coordinated turns in segments. Bank about 20^ and then give it a little up elevator and inboard rudder at the same time. This should swing your prograde path around 10^. Check your vertical speed and altitude. If they\u0027re OK, keep the bank the same and blip elevator and rudder again. Otherwise, level off and regain some altitude before turning a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll these control issues get worse the bigger and heavier the plane is. The heavier the plane, the more momentum it has, so the more it wants to keep going in the same direction despite controls angling the nose in a new direction. And also the more altitude it will lose in turns, and the harder it is to stop.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DaMichel","CreatedById":93697,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-14T08:54:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi there.

Should you end up tied with somebody, I\u0027ll give you the edge on looks. And should anybody say this is pure subjective favoritism, hear me out. Back in Desert Storm, an over-zealous A-10 pilot killed several of my friends so I still move (quickly) towards cover whenever I see one flying in my general direction. But I\u0027ve never held that against the machine itself--guns don\u0027t kill people, it\u0027s the guy on the trigger. I can\u0027t help it if the A-10 combines an enviably austere and elegant, totally Cold-War-for-now-but-come-the-day functionality with the timeless machismo of a battleax.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, i\u0027m sorry. Have my condolence. The plane ended up looking like an A-10 by - well, i guess similar design goals. The cockpits makes up half of the planes weight, so the engines went rearward to balance the weight in the front. High aspect ratio straight wings give good low speed performance. Playing with FAR, i learned that vertical stabilizers are a good thing so i added two of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think with FAR it might be a little bit more difficult to land on Duna because FAR tends to apply less drag than stock and planes can stall which IIRC is not possible in stock.

But landing is super hard. It gets thrown around very easily. Perhaps the problem is with the landing gear or the fact that it sits on the runway with an angle of attack. It is also prone to tail striking when things go wrong and it has little control authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI increased the size of the control surfaces for better maneuverability. I tried to shorten the wing span also but then it wasn\u0027t able to fly high enough any more. Maximum altitude is around 7800 m with two kerbals on board. It sits straight on the runway which should result in reduced lift once touched down. The tail was redone so it can pitch up properly and with little risk of tail striking. It actually works much better for the landings. I manage landings between 2500 und 3000 m most of the time now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDue to a bug in Pwing control surfaces i will probably either relaunch either the K10 or use the Kulta-Light Mk2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-19T03:39:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E@ DaMichel: Making progress I see.

Here is a STOL tiltrotor craft. Not only does it look cool, it actually works. I think it can hover below 2000m. Above that, it still has nice short takeoff and landing capabilities.
