Kinda like moving a mass on a seesaw lever. The farther you are from the fulcrum, the less force it takes to move the same mass. Just be careful, as without proper supports or solid design you can create some nasty vibrations if your craft is too long or too wide.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"marko dash","CreatedById":1584,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-07T13:57:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eor just not use them at all, since the ASAS was released i haven\\\u0027t needed a single SAS\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ydoow","CreatedById":10165,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-07T15:34:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI like placing my SAS/ASAS at the bottom.
