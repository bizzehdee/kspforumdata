This is why fuel tanks change your CoL/Aerocenter (I like that. I\u0027m using it now) in FAR. They don\u0027t produce lift, but they do produce drag in a crosswind. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you\u0027re ascending, and lets say Jeb jumps out, and pushes your rocket off-center a bit. this motion will rotate around the CoM. In other words, the CoM won\u0027t move at all, but the opposite ends of the rocket will move quite a bit. If your aerocenter is above the CoM, once you go past 0 angle of attack, the drag caused by your speed through the air will want to increase your angle of attack further. If your aerocenter is behind the CoM, the drag forces will push it back into line, making the rocket self-stabilizing to an extent. This is how I\u0027ve come to understand the workings through many single-stage-to-terra-firma designs. The same principles apply to spaceplanes, which is why huge, narrow delta wings and large canards don\u0027t work well. Once I started designing my planes to take advantage of that self-stabilization, I had much better luck. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThink of it this way: What\u0027s easier to do, balance a long pole by holding it at the bottom, or by holding it at the top? The directions are reversed, because your hand is serving as the thrust and not the drag, but the principles are the same. I can draw you some pictures with physics on them if you wish, but I think you\u0027ve got the hang of it even without my post. I just find sometimes that people benefit from my weird style of explaining things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother example would be the historial ancestor of rockets: The arrow. We\u0027ve had thousands of years* to sort out the arrow, and the design is pretty much a heavy thing at the front, and some wide things at the back. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I have no idea\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the metrics, here\u0027s my terrible explanation\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the \u0022static\u0022 tab, set the upper bound to about 80, the mach number to .2, and click \u0022sweep AOA\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will show you various things and how they change as your angle of attack increases. The blue line, which is the coefficient of lift, will rise until the point of stall, and then fall off sharply. The yellow line, Cm, is the pitching moment, and this describes how much your plane/rocket wants to pitch. Ideally, you want this to be negative and decreasing: This means that as your angle of attack increases, it becomes more difficult to pitch the plane. What results from this is that the further you go from prograde, the more your craft wants to point itself back to prograde. The alternative, a positive and/or increasing Cm, causes plane/rocket to suddenly flip straight up and inevitably go into a flat spin for even the slightest divergence from 0 AoA. Of particular desirability is for the Cm to decrease further in a stall. This means that the plane naturally recovers from stalls very readily. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, do the same thing again, but set the mach number to 2, or 5, or whatever you\u0027d like. This will show you how your craft will behave at supersonic speeds, where the characteristics change a bit. Many planes that are quite unstable at subsonic speeds will become much more well-behaved above mach 1.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that helped!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T08:48:02Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 08:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Torminator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"egreSS","CreatedById":75821,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T13:51:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I got it working, and flawlessly too but the fix was so simple i\u0027m almost ashamed to admit it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt just needed payload fairings =P\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I should feel good though since it\u0027s a large, sophisticated rocket powerful enough to put a small moon into orbit.

The Center of Pressure is the location where all aerodynamic forces can be modeled as lift and drag forces (that vary with angle of attack) and no other forces or moments whatsoever. Any asymmetry in the vehicle\u0027s design that would cause a pitch-up or pitch-down moment to be produced (like a negative incidence angle on the tail to help pitch the plane up) will cause the location of the Center of Pressure to shift as a function of angle of attack, sometimes outside of the vehicle itself. The Aerodynamic Center does not move (at least not significantly) as a function of angle of attack (unless stalling occurs), making it much easier to use in aircraft design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Center of Pressure is a somewhat archaic aerodynamic property; I\u0027ve only seen it used in old data from the time of Otto Lilienthal, Samuel Langley and the Wright Brothers back before most of the basic work in aerodynamics had been done.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Van Disaster","CreatedById":58876,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-31T20:45:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s appeared in some 50s documents I was reading resonably recently also ( which is I guess also somewhat archaic \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ).

The first is that I think there are a great number of inefficient parts of the current FAR code that could be removed if it was rebuilt from the ground up. The second is the I have a better understanding of how C# works and how the code works with KSP, so rebuilding the code with that in mind will allow for greater efficiency. The third is that I want to switch from a part-based aerodynamic model to one that groups parts into bodies and wings and determines the aerodynamics of the aggregate instead, which should allow me to implement more features (like proper induced velocities, some multithreading and more real-life accurate simulations) while keeping the CPU workload down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, the idea is that if you have a 200-part plane, with a central fuselage, a wing, horizontal and vertical tail, FAR will only have to do the heavy math on 6 aerodynamic objects (fuselage, each half of the wing, each half of the horizontal tail, and the vertical tail) and then that will be put into temporary look-up tables used by the correct parts so that FAR doesn\u0027t cause as much physics-based lag.
