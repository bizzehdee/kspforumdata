It seems I had just enough fuel to land and I had to save the mission until next time I visit that one. I found the gravity there fluctuates badly, I thought it was a bad load up of KSP or my computer was acting up but I think that is what KSP that designed it that way for more challenges and fun. I\u0027ll post it when I do land if it is possible to land there not sure.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
