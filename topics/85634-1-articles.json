And it is quite heavy, like 10-20t. To do the Experiment you need a Craft containing lets say 5 of these Parts and all need to be manned. And if activated it needs to stay manned for around one Kerbal Month before yielding the Science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a big and unhandy modular part like that it would give you reason to build a Space Station or a Base, since you\u0027d probably bring not all the modular parts at once. Espeacially with a Base it\u0027ll be probably easier to Land the Modules seperatly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- Changing the Seismic Accelometer to the \u0027impactor science\u0027 function it has in KSPInterstellar\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- A Surface transition observation Experiment : Once activated it needs to cross the line to 2 other biomes than the one it has been started in. Gives a Task to Rovers (at least on Kerbin, Mun, Minmus) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4- An Ice Core Experiment: Works only on Ice (Kerbin Poles, Vall, Eeloo , maybe Minmus) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5- A measure the Site Experiment: modular Experiment, needs 3 modules at least 1km apart from each other and each has to be activated (aligned) by a Kerbal on EVA. Gives something senseful to do to move more than 3 feet away from your touchdown place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(6- an Alternative to Nr. 3, an \u0027interesting place\u0027 Experiment: once Activated it shows your current and close by target coordinates on rightclick. When target reached it shows randomly a new close target, this for 3-4 times. Maybe simply reconfiguration of the PressMat for this new function, after all we already have a atmo-clickfest-science with the NoseCone. Purpose for Rover) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7- change the Mystery Goo to a \u0027live form behaviour Experiment\u0027 , pretending it contains some mixture of micro organisms. It needs to stay a certain time in the Enviroment before yielding the Science, time depends on place,(fast in Space, because it affects the organisms very fast, slow on lets say Laythe or Eve, which may be not so harmful to some resistant organisms) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-03T10:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBasically, more science experiments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn no particular order;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There is a mod that will yield science points through station parts and some other things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54774\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/54774\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso check out; \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972-0-23-5-DMagic-Orbital-Science-New-Science-Parts-V0-8-%284-28-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/64972-0-23-5-DMagic-Orbital-Science-New-Science-Parts-V0-8-%284-28-14%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis one include a core drill thingy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the multiple biome experiment idea and the triumvirate experiment. The impact recovery science would be nice as a stock experiment too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI personally link my experiments to action groups so I don\u0027t have to click on anything.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far, I haven\u0027t used any of the science mods myself and I\u0027m guessing you have but if you haven\u0027t I suggest you give the science tab on curse a visit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest is just a change in form from other experiments. Interesting but probably not worth the trouble. Just adding new experiments might also break the progression a bit so that would also need a tweak.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
