From there it\u0027s only a matter of addig moar boosters for more payload, balance wet-dry CoM so the plane won\u0027t flip upon re-entry and finding the perfect ascent path for any given plane. That last part is the trickiest, as the ideal flight path depends on the power of the engines (most likely it\u0027s different in the jet and the rocket phase), the weight of the craft and it\u0027s drag profile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, you want to climb to ~10km without exceeding ~320 m/s only on jets. Depending on your TWR it can be achieved by having full throttle with a 10-30\u00B0 angle of attack. If you need more AoA than that to keep under the desired speed, it signifies that you probably have too much jet engines (needless weight).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you get to ~10km, you can start gaining speed by lowering the AoA to ~10\u00B0. Turboramjets or Rapiers with shock cone intakes should be able to take you to ~1200 m/s on about 18-20km. Ultimately you\u0027ll reach a point when you can\u0027t accelerate anymore. That\u0027s the time you can fire the rocket engines (or switch mode on Rapier). Once there, you can pull up - but do it slowly as a too fast pitch will bleed your precious speed. If your rocket \u0027stage\u0027 has high TWR, there\u0027s nothing wrong with a high AoA. 40\u00B0 will get you out of the atmo fast and than you can circularize. But a lower TWR setup can also be good at this point, you just need a lower AoA. If you burn with nukes at this point, it can be as low as 10\u00B0 - you\u0027ll get the escape velocity slower, but you won\u0027t overshoot your desired orbit height by raising your AP too fast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope I could help a bit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AeroGav","CreatedById":152027,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-27T18:27:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThis is a bit of a cut n\u0027 paste from a tutorial i\u0027m working on, \u00A0so sorry about the wall of text, needs breaking up with some pictures. \u00A0Hope it helps anyway..\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming you\u0027re not using aerodynamics mods like FAR, \u00A0performance doesn\u0027t come down to all that many factors actually. \u00A0Wing planform and placement don\u0027t matter at all, \u00A0four unswept, rectangular wing sections arranged like a biplane have\u00A0the exact same lift and drag characteristics as a highly swept, supersonic delta of the same area.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat counts -\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1. \u00A0Engine selection. \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003ERapier and NERV are the best, because NERV has the highest ISP of all non-airbreathers \u00A0and RAPIER works in jet mode to the highest speeds and atltudes. \u00A0And the \u0022power play\u0022 method is not to use any oxidiser at all, and just let your NERVs boost from 25km up.

\u00A0 The tail cone connector, flipped 180 degrees so the pointy bit is forwards, appears to be the lowest drag selection, though it is somewhat heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4. \u00A0Trim drag\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last design factor that influences performance, is Trim drag. \u00A0 Namely, how much drag do your control surfaces generate while holding the nose up. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrecting a trim drag problem is tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a great believer in playing things very safe with the centre of mass and centre of lift, placing the former well ahead fo the latter in a space plane. \u00A0 \u00A0It won\u0027t win any awards for agility, but space planes are subject to huge shifts in centre of gravity as fuel burns off and cargo gets unloaded. \u00A0 \u00A0So, this means a lot of force is needed to hold the nose up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, \u00A0we only want to be generating this pitch force with canards. \u00A0 \u00A0Passive tail fins that add stability are fine, assuming there is any room left at the rear of the plane not used for wings or engines. \u00A0 However, keeping the nose up with control surfaces mounted behind the centre of gravity means generating downforce to lift the nose, and that means creating negative lift which the main wings have to overcome in addition to the vehicle\u0027s weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, \u00A0wherever you place them, your pitch control surfaces will generate drag themselves as a result of the force they generate. \u00A0Just like the main wing, the drag is proportionate to the angle it meets the airflow. \u00A0If you only just have enough pitch authority to hold the nose up, chances are your canards/tailplanes/elevons/whatever are deflected at a large angle and making huge drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could make your canards larger, so they don\u0027t need as much deflection angle, but this will also add lift ahead of your CG and make the plane less stable. \u00A0Also, by the time you\u0027ve added enough control surface to have low trim drag, you \u0027ll have added so much it is easy to snap the wings off with an inadvertent pull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the best thing you can do is check the max deflection angle on the \u0022right click for more info\u0022 screen \u00A0when you select a control surface \u00A0to use. \u00A0Lower, obviously, is better. \u00A0The standard canard and tail fin deflect to 30 degrees, \u00A0but some go to less, the Advanced Canard is especially interesting at only 10 degrees, \u00A0however in addition to having the small deflection angle it is also tiny, and you might need two or three pairs of these to be enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight Profile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow should one fly a space plane ?

Subsonic Initial climb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter takeoff, adjust rate of climb so that you\u0027re near the optimum 2 degrees angle of attack. \u00A0Angle of attack too low, climb steeper to slow down. \u00A0Angle of attack too high means we\u0027re stalling, nose over a bit. \u00A0Try to do this with pitch trim, if possible, it will save holding the same joystick angle for the next 20 minutes and getting cramp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0Bust the sound barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally at or above 10km, \u00A0i\u0027m finding that @ 2 degrees angle of attack my air speed is starting to come up to 240 m/s. \u00A0 There is a high drag region between 240 m/s and 440 m/s representing the sound barrier, you want to spend as little time here as you\u00A0can. \u00A0 \u00A0So i often turn SAS on and set prograde assist to dive through the sound barrier ASAP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u00A0Supersonic climb\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the sound barrier your Rapier engines gain thrust rapidly, \u00A0you find yourself pitching up hard to avoid getting too fast too low and overheating. \u00A0 At the same time, \u00A0start nosing over at 15km so you don\u0027t find yourself in thin air at 20km without the power to accelerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u00A0Milking the airbreathers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove 18km, \u00A0there is little risk of overheat , so flatten out and increase speed to mach 3.7, where your RAPIER\u0027s power output is at its highest. Once you have attained this speed, climb at whatever rate stops the speed from increasing further. \u00A0 \u00A0When the climb rate is becoming negligible, \u00A0start up the NERV engines. \u00A0 \u00A0At 29.5km the RAPIERs will flame out completely, this phase of flight is over.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5.

mach 1, so your RAPIER engines want you to go through the sound barrier ASAP, which works best with a really small wing so you can do that at sea level. \u00A0You\u0027ll \u00A0have huge AoA and huge drag at altitude, but before long you\u0027ll switch closed cycle and be thrust borne and orbital velocity borne rather than wing borne.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA large winged design works best if you\u0027re flying to orbit wing borne with the low thrust to weight of nuke engines only, but the initial climb at subsonic rates will be sluggish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, don\u0027t try to apply my flight profile to a high wing loading design. \u00A0 \u00A0When attempting to mimic my profile you\u0027d surely have noticed you were flying a much higher angle of attack than i was recommending, \u00A0due to your small wing not liking low speed. \u00A0 Small wing design gets the rapier into the sweet spot faster and has better TWR \u00A0in the climb, particularly the first part. \u00A0Large wing design works better up high. \u00A0I prefer the large wing because re-entry is easier -stay higher longer and avoid the worst heat - and off-airport landings

30 Ton mark 2 plane with 2 NERVs and only one RAPIER. \u00A0 \u00A0It did take ages to climb to 10km \u00A0because the single RAPIER was only making 90kn of thrust subsonic, \u00A0which is enough for only 5 degree climb angle. \u00A0 What I saved from having a really high lift drag ratio i lost by having so little thrust,\u00A0that most of it was being swallowed up just to stay airborne for the 15

nuke and 2 rapiers is the way to go , or at least give the single rapier a boost in the shape of a pair of juno or panthers in the sluggish subsonic part of the flight

\u00A0 The tail cone connector, flipped 180 degrees so the pointy bit is forwards, appears to be the lowest drag selection, though it is somewhat heavy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E4. \u00A0Trim drag\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne last design factor that influences performance, is Trim drag. \u00A0 Namely, how much drag do your control surfaces generate while holding the nose up. \u00A0 \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCorrecting a trim drag problem is tricky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am a great believer in playing things very safe with the centre of mass and centre of lift, placing the former well ahead fo the latter in a space plane. \u00A0 \u00A0It won\u0027t win any awards for agility, but space planes are subject to huge shifts in centre of gravity as fuel burns off and cargo gets unloaded. \u00A0 \u00A0So, this means a lot of force is needed to hold the nose up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor starters, \u00A0we only want to be generating this pitch force with canards. \u00A0 \u00A0Passive tail fins that add stability are fine, assuming there is any room left at the rear of the plane not used for wings or engines. \u00A0 However, keeping the nose up with control surfaces mounted behind the centre of gravity means generating downforce to lift the nose, and that means creating negative lift which the main wings have to overcome in addition to the vehicle\u0027s weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, \u00A0wherever you place them, your pitch control surfaces will generate drag themselves as a result of the force they generate. \u00A0Just like the main wing, the drag is proportionate to the angle it meets the airflow. \u00A0If you only just have enough pitch authority to hold the nose up, chances are your canards/tailplanes/elevons/whatever are deflected at a large angle and making huge drag.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could make your canards larger, so they don\u0027t need as much deflection angle, but this will also add lift ahead of your CG and make the plane less stable. \u00A0Also, by the time you\u0027ve added enough control surface to have low trim drag, you \u0027ll have added so much it is easy to snap the wings off with an inadvertent pull.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo, the best thing you can do is check the max deflection angle on the \u0022right click for more info\u0022 screen \u00A0when you select a control surface \u00A0to use. \u00A0Lower, obviously, is better. \u00A0The standard canard and tail fin deflect to 30 degrees, \u00A0but some go to less, the Advanced Canard is especially interesting at only 10 degrees, \u00A0however in addition to having the small deflection angle it is also tiny, and you might need two or three pairs of these to be enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlight Profile\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow should one fly a space plane ?

Subsonic Initial climb\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter takeoff, adjust rate of climb so that you\u0027re near the optimum 2 degrees angle of attack. \u00A0Angle of attack too low, climb steeper to slow down. \u00A0Angle of attack too high means we\u0027re stalling, nose over a bit. \u00A0Try to do this with pitch trim, if possible, it will save holding the same joystick angle for the next 20 minutes and getting cramp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. \u00A0Bust the sound barrier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGenerally at or above 10km, \u00A0i\u0027m finding that @ 2 degrees angle of attack my air speed is starting to come up to 240 m/s. \u00A0 There is a high drag region between 240 m/s and 440 m/s representing the sound barrier, you want to spend as little time here as you\u00A0can. \u00A0 \u00A0So i often turn SAS on and set prograde assist to dive through the sound barrier ASAP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. \u00A0Supersonic climb\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter the sound barrier your Rapier engines gain thrust rapidly, \u00A0you find yourself pitching up hard to avoid getting too fast too low and overheating. \u00A0 At the same time, \u00A0start nosing over at 15km so you don\u0027t find yourself in thin air at 20km without the power to accelerate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. \u00A0Milking the airbreathers\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbove 18km, \u00A0there is little risk of overheat , so flatten out and increase speed to mach 3.7, where your RAPIER\u0027s power output is at its highest.
