This leads to (and that\u0027s surprising to many) rubbery or overflexible joints. But those joints don\u0027t break (usually). Now, what the reinforcement tries to do is, that it makes the joints realistically stable. And this sometimes means, that a reinforced joint does now break. Which means, that the part which forms the connection is not strong enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, there could still be a problem or a bug with the algorithm... but it is also possible, that the part in the middle (which is breaking) is not strong enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, what does the \u0022reinforce inversions\u0022 do. It does try to find joints witch will likely behave like wet spaghetti. And this is done by searching configurations in the ship which tend to behave like this. And then it tries to fix those by adding a joint which should simulate what the intention of the rocket builder was (e.g. if you have 2 heavy tanks and a light decoupler in the middle which is intended to be strong, then the systems adds a joint with a given strength between the tanks directly... but: if the strength of the decoupler is low (that\u0027s a property of the part), then this newly created joint will also be not too strong... and when this then breaks, the original joint will break as well)).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helps to find out if there is a problem with KJR or if there\u0027s something else going on...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ngx","CreatedById":184821,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-30T00:39:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for explanation.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe problem in my case is, that not only decouplers fall apart, also some totally unrelated parts go off. In example, after re-enabling \u0022reinforce inversions\u0022, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thruster parts from upper stage (two stages ahead of current stage) fell off. Or, decouplers of first stage fall apart after manual deployment (not decoupling!) of last stage fairing.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIndeed, I do have rockets that cannot hold together without KJR.

Then I disable \u0022reinforce inversions\u0022 (pressing apply), nothing changes (in fact, now i could fly the rocket without any problems). THEN, still on launchpad, I re-enable \u0022reinforce inversions\u0022 option and after pressing \u0022apply\u0022 rocket falls apart (along with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters falling off). In testing, I also used very simple vessel, just two big tanks on sides of center big tank coupled with TT-70. It holds together fine even without KJR at all (not in GameData).

I just need to know whether future versions of IR will not work with new KJR version (4.2.x) only.
