Why not use the same picture for both? I mean, granted, I like my photoshopped Astronaut picture, but I definitely enjoy my David Bowie space oddity profile picture, and can probably live with it, but having one picture for both places would make it easier to keep track of people in their blogs or stuff like that. At least that\u0027s my opinion."},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T12:45:08Z","Content":"It all about model sheet, cara. design , may be ; ) or not ; )"},{"CreatedByName":"Norpo","CreatedById":113342,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T13:14:23Z","Content":"*Someone got confused and duplicated the code for avatars by accident.*\n\n**Serious answer:** Probably so avatars didn\u0027t have to be scaled up and get blurred. That way, if you\u0027re getting avatars from a site that has them in a proper size (say, 64x64 and not 512x512 for an avatar), then you could use that avatar and the profile picture wouldn\u0027t be blurred. I imagine the intent was that people would use the same image for both (but they didn\u0027t), and it would be too hard to remove at this point, so it stuck."},{"CreatedByName":"Ethanadams","CreatedById":136913,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T16:05:29Z","Content":"Look at my profile I like that there different"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T04:29:26Z","Content":"Its to synergize the ROI within the socil tweet sphere.
