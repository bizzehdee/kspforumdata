I always wanted a config that converted the stock kerbin system to a realistic system that can exist in our universe. I started out making my own config that kept the stock kerbol system flavor, but with realistic density values of each planet. I noticed my numbers were matching jsimmons\u0027s numbers that I just decided to use his values for the mass and radius. However, I simulated the physics on all the planets for about 700 years using universe sandbox so they would settle down into stable, realistic orbits. To keep the orbits tight to the star like in the stock game, I modified kerbol to be about 57% the radius of our sun and changed its mass so it is bright enough to allow kerbol to keep its same orbital period as in the stock game and stay at a comfy 20C (actually kerbin ended up settling into an orbit where it it should be at 19.6C... close enough \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E). So, if kerbol was a real star is should shine only at 15% of the brightness of the sun and have about 57% of the radius of our sun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe moons of the planetary systems have changed a bit as well. Minmus is no longer inclined because the gravity from the mun pulls it into a orbit of low inclination over time. I didn\u0027t make that many manual changes for the jool system, but I did push out tylo and vall a little bit. If I didn\u0027t vall would crash into laythe every time. This minor modification forced vall into a neat orbit that would change in eccentricity over time due to the gravitational influence of laythe and tylo. When vall got dangerously close to laythe, tylo would eventually pull it back and once vall got dangerously close to tylo, laythe would pull it back. Vall follows this pattern ad infinitum, but since ksp doesnt simulate gravity that way I just put the moons where it is in the middle of this cycle. Bop also crosses under pol\u0027s orbit and says hi to pol every so often, which can make for a very easy transfer between the moons. If principia gets to a mature state, moon hopping in the jool system may become interesting with its n-body physics (the moons should stay in a stable orbits, though).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also modified the scale heights and atmosphere cutoffs a bit to be at the same atmospheric pressure that the K\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1rm\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A1n line for earth is defined at (1/2200000 atm). Again this was another spot from where me and jsimmons came to the same numbers with so I kept them mostly the same. However I messed around with eve a bit. Wanted to contain iodine in its atmosphere, so I came up with an atmosphere that is composed of 80% Iodine, 10% Hydrogen, 80% Iodine, 9% CO2, and 1% mystery gases. No idea if such a combination can exist (maybe that 1% mystery gas is what makes all the difference) but it works nicely with the numbers I wanted to achieve. Eve being composed of mostly iodine makes it interesting as the oceans may be iodine liquid since the pressure at the surface at eve is so great. Or maybe eve\u0027s oceans are made up of litium instead. If this is the case, Lithium iodide will exist in great quantities on eve, allowing the kerbals to easily make batteries for machines that will filter out the CO2 from the atmosphere into oxygen, which allows them to stay on the planet for indefinite periods of time. So leaving your kerbals stranded on eve isn\u0027t as bad anymore!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI didn\u0027t change jool\u0027s atmosphere, though. I figured since you cant land on jool, the height of the atmosphere doesn\u0027t matter that much. I also dont know of a gas that would make such a green color and has a melting point that is at about -150C. Chlorine gas is green, but at the temperatures jool should be at, chlorine will be solid. However, some crazy electrical action may be going on at jool which may be causing some gas to glow green, giving jool its color. Or maybe the tidal forces of the moons causes jool to warm up (I used that as an excuse to keep laythe at a temperature of about 8C, to allow for its water oceans).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway here is my config file for rss:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://pastebin.com/p0Qq6qVH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://pastebin.com/p0Qq6qVH\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso for you guys who have universe sandbox this is the system I used to get the orbital values for (if you don\u0027t use the most accurate setting, weird stuff will happen like gilly being shot off into its own orbit and jool\u0027s moons doing wtfever they want to do):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17644930/kerbol%20system.ubox\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/17644930/kerbol%20system.ubox\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-02T03:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJool is green because the souls of the departed (Kerbals) eventually find their way there where they are condensed and filtered and osmosiate throughout all the Joolian layers giving it its nice rich green texture.
