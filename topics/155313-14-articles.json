Basically, some ships are intended for short-term stay only (anything from Vostok to Space Shuttle), from a few hours to a few weeks. And some are designed for long-term/indefinite stay: e.g. you could theoretically live at ISS for years (if we discount radiation and bone loss), the same applies to a future interplanetary spacecraft. It is not like your regular life support mod where you should take this much food to stay alive this long. Health can degrade and repair itself depending on the situation.\u00A0I imitate this in the mod by adding Recuperation parts, which supposedly have various stuff to mitigate long-term health issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoreover, consider that \u0022indefinite\u0022 stay is not guaranteed even with recuperation. With Kerbal Health, you can have accidents, sickness or you may need to do a long EVA, which is an additional risk. The kerbals also collect radiation and their health is slowly, and irreversibly reduced. You need to take it all into account. Future updates will add new things to take into account like individual characteristics of your kerbals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, real human health is much more complex than anything we might ever have in KSP, but I want the mod to provide a manageable challenge with multiple ways of achieving your aim. In the next release (which, besides, you may download from a link a few posts above), Recuperation will receive crew caps.\u00A0So\u00A0you won\u0027t be able to simply spam 3 or 4 cupolas and forget about everything. You\u0027ll still have to manage living space and other factors.
