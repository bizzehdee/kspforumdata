How MUCH heat depends on the densities of the respective. At higher altitudes, sure the air is thin but so is the canopy. And the larger it is the more heat it can collect. So it can heat up fairly quickly. My guess is that it will fail from melting (or decomposition; Kevlar doesn\u0027t melt.

The only tasks are to tweak space plane shielding which is tricky because passive heat shields no longer use a dedicated heat shield module. Instead they require tweaking of the part\u0027s various thermal related parameters. Interestingly I\u0027ve found that drastically REDUCING thermal mass of the skin causes significantly less heating. I\u0027ve never been able to actually get that to work so there\u0027s clearly a sweet spot in there where thermal equilibrium can occur. (this is actually how the shuttle tiles worked. They really couldn\u0027t hold very much heat, so they reached their maximum temperature very quickly very high up which meant that they basically could hold no more and would reject the rest. In KSP that actually tends to cause things to blow up but I accidentally achieved that when testing the SDHI heat shield trying to find the best configuration for Sumghai)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo long story short, things are mostly fallen into place and I just need to finish things up enough for a basic release.

If you are decelerating then your kinetic energy is being reduced. That energy has to go somewhere and that somewhere is in heating the air around the chute which heats the chute itself. Remember that the shock temperature in Kelvin is roughly equal to the speed of the craft and parachutes have a large area for thermal transfer and very low thermal mass so they heat very quickly.\u003Cp\u003EThen there is the fragility, take a look at the supersonic chute on the LDSD test.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe theory (higher drag early in the descent can lead to lower peak heating) worked in principle for SpaceShipOne with the feathering wings. Remember that Earth\u0027s orbital speed is about five times faster than Kerbin\u0027s. From a suborbital trajectory with similar speed to a Kerbin re-entry, there might be a window of conditions where it would be possible to use an early drogue.

(I\u0027ve heard that some versions of FAR would fall for a heat shield clipped into a command pod bottom node to bottom node, and I personally found a collider issue that would cause a 6S service compartment to shield a Mk1-2 heat shield attached directly under it).

Then when you hit lower layers you\u0027ll have lost quite a bit of energy already which means less heating up at that point..

The contribution of air temperature is useful mainly in knowing what the precise density of the air is at a given altitude so we know how much heat to transfer to your ship during reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Svm420\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Svm420\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGetting a ton of NREs upon luanhcing a sounding rocket.
