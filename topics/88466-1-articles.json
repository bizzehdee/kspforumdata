Make absolutely sure you cancel your horizontal speed, 1-2 m/s at the most.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Widen your suspension. If your footprint is thinner than your lander is tall, you will likely tip over. You can easily widen it by mounting your legs on small fuel tanks or the modular girder segments.
