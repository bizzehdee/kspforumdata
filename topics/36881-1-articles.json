Just because they claim something does not make them right. I can\u0027t unmute my laptop now, so I can\u0027t watch the videos, but there is some evidence on the moon that confirms there were landings. For example, Apollo crews place retro-reflectors on the surface for the purpose of measuring the distance between Earth and the Moon. Also, I\u0027m sure that with a powerful enough telescope, you could see the decent stages for the LEMs. If we never landed there, how would such equipment have wound up there? I think this case is still an issue of private national disbelief for the Russians. As said in the article, they were the pioneers for the majority of space exploration. We (the U.S.) only managed to beat them to the Moon. Nothing else before hand.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"andrew123","CreatedById":46719,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T05:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s the method the Russian Federation uses to keep on getting views for their ad revenue.
