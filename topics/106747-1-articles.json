On my first launch I put the parachute in stage 0 and solid fuel engine in stage 1. When I tried to launch stage 0 went off first deploying the parachute, which indicated the staging system was working in reverse from what it was when I last played in v0.9. Thus, I tried swapping the staging to put the engine in stage 0 and parachute in stage 1. This worked for igniting the engine, but after launch the parachute moved itself to stage 0 with the engine and would not deploy with the staging button, because stage 0 had already been activated to ignite the engine."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:23:34Z","Content":"Well, that\u0027s odd.

I then loaded the career where the bug happened and again staging worked correctly. So I wasn\u0027t able to repeat this bug after closing and relaunching KSP. \n\nBefore I started this thread I tried multiple launches and kept having the bug. So I think maybe something didn\u0027t load properly when I launched KSP. I guess shutting down KSP and relaunching the game fixed it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-02T02:54:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2015 02:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Monthar**"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:51:01Z","Content":"Looks like your log cuts off.

Oh, wait, I relaunched the game just to the main menu when I was creating the post to get the build number, so it probably overwrote the log from when the bug occurred."}]}
