On my first launch I put the parachute in stage 0 and solid fuel engine in stage 1. When I tried to launch stage 0 went off first deploying the parachute, which indicated the staging system was working in reverse from what it was when I last played in v0.9. Thus, I tried swapping the staging to put the engine in stage 0 and parachute in stage 1. This worked for igniting the engine, but after launch the parachute moved itself to stage 0 with the engine and would not deploy with the staging button, because stage 0 had already been activated to ignite the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-02T02:23:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, that\u0027s odd.

I then loaded the career where the bug happened and again staging worked correctly. So I wasn\u0027t able to repeat this bug after closing and relaunching KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I started this thread I tried multiple launches and kept having the bug. So I think maybe something didn\u0027t load properly when I launched KSP.
