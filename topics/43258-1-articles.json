Personally it hasn\u0027t bothered me the least bit, I just plop the flag down and that\u0027s it, but hey, I like testing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, feast your eyes on this, then I\u0027ll tell you my discovered...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ec8Xgu6.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022ec8Xgu6.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, without testing it on multiple locations several times over, I conclude that flags are placed facing north or south (future testing should show if it depends on location or a planet\u0027s tilt as well). First I tested if distance from your manned module mattered, it doesn\u0027t seem to do so. Then I tested locations, if it was by \u0027grid\u0027 or similar, doesn\u0027t seem to be either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut here\u0027s my major discovery. I think most of us know you can get a new flag by returning to your craft (hence all my flags, kept going in and out with Jeb). However, what I didn\u0027t know, and what I haven\u0027t seen mentioned before, is that after you plant the flag you can right click it and \u0027take down\u0027. If you instantly rightclick your kerbal the \u0027plant flag\u0027 button won\u0027t be there, but if you move a step or a couple, you can once again plant the flag. So it\u0027s sort of in the kerbal\u0027s \u0022inventory\u0022 and you can reuse that same flag over and over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, anyone complaining about \u0027randomness\u0027 can simply put the flag down, if it\u0027s facing the wrong way take it down and move a bit, then retry. Alternatively, if it points in a wrong direction (not just facing) you\u0027ll have to move to the appropriate side of what you want the flag to be in view of when taking your screenshot (or similar).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes yes I know this is a workaround and it\u0027d be nice to be able to control the exact facing of the flag, but right now we can\u0027t. I do however conclude that it isn\u0027t \u0022totally random\u0022, so test it, learn it, then use it to your advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: PS I did timewarp a couple hours in the middle of the test, enough that the sun passed overhead from one side to the other. No apparent change in flag placing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: After testing it on Moho I\u0027m fairly certain that flags will face (close to) north/south when placed, no matter where.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-20T23:22:36Z\u0022 title=\u002208/20/2013 11:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 20, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Johnno\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdditional info\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mercy","CreatedById":69034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-20T21:44:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhy does it matter?
