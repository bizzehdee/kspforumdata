Decoupling the aft gear will result in an inability to land. The upper stage separation motors will not harm the lower stage, and are to be used when the upper stage runs out of fuel or in an emergency. Failure to attach separation motors will result in parachute, wing, and engine discorporation, and death soon after. Do not fly above 8 kilometers, but feel free to replace engines with higher altitude models. However, the plane is more stable when configured like it is here. Can fly straight off the runway until it encounters the continent in that direction, at which point you will likely have 1 and a half fuel tanks left on your lower stage. The picture is of the final form landed safely with plenty of fuel left after crossing the Kerblantic. Requires the latest NovaPunch and Mechjeb.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
