Yeah, it\\\u0027d be easier if I weren\\\u0027t so OCD about landing gear placement, or if the gear were just a little longer, but as it is, it\\\u0027s either adding canards up front to provide a naturally lifting nose, or wait until your engines won\\\u0027t smash into the ground. The C7 SAS helps with a gradual accent though.

It seems they tweaked the atmosphere again, or maybe the official wings vs. the original mod\\\u0027s wings, but this plane used to handle a little better (not much), but my X-31 clone is no longer able to perform the Herbst maneuver, it just goes into a series of Kulbit\\\u0027s.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cardgame","CreatedById":12317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMake sure to test this plane at higher altitudes, guys, the engines on it aren\\\u0027t meant for low altitude flight. \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cezary","CreatedById":5396,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T23:13:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOutstanding design.
