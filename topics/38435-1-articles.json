I\u0027ve decided to join this community of space explorers, ship architects, and rocket scientists. I\u0027m new to the forums but I\u0027ve been playing KSP on and off since July of 2011. I can\u0027t believe how much it has changed over the years since it first came out. I\u0027m getting better and better at the game and continue to learn every time i play it. I\u0027ve learned a lot of scientific things as well that I had never even thought of. I had no idea that there was such a thing as an apoapsis and periapsis. I hope to build relationships with the community members and learn more and more about this spectacular game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKind Regards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENicholas\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzzkil88","CreatedById":62134,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T10:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewelcome to the wonderful wild world of the KSP forums.
