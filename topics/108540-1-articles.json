I may be interested in developing another in-game tree editor (mostly for the sake of my own sanity) so that nodes can be moved and parts can be sorted easily. However, I have not written a .dll for Kerbal before and I\u0027m wondering if there is a reason others have not attempted to make another in-game tree editor.\n\nDoes anyone know what problems/difficulties I may encounter if I attempt this? At this point, I don\u0027t know enough to judge how much time this might take."},{"CreatedByName":"rabzoue59","CreatedById":89075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T10:21:30Z","Content":"At this time, the better thing someone can do, is a .exe with library of KSP. A program to create a tech tree sheet, which we can save in .cfg format.

It makes sorting lots of parts and fine tuning the node positions much easier."},{"CreatedByName":"rabzoue59","CreatedById":89075,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-10T12:38:02Z","Content":"I agree with this"}]}
