Obviously KSP2 is very early access and rough around the edges at the moment but I\u0027m defo seeing the potential.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAre there any plans to improve atmospheric effects? Or is what we have currently it? I\u0027m talking proper cloud cover and plume effects based on weather and atmospheric conditions, Kerbal still looks a little cartoony from orbit and it would be nice to see proper big plumes of exhaust on lift off so we get scenes like this...\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rocket%20plume%202.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022132.50\u0022 height=\u0022693\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.clanlawrence.co.uk/images/ksp/rocket%20plume%202.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rocket%20plume.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022177.76\u0022 height=\u0022935\u0022 width=\u0022526\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.clanlawrence.co.uk/images/ksp/rocket%20plume.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazooka","CreatedById":226666,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T10:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs its Early Access, I imagine it will be improved in the future, this is version 0.1 after all\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe new effects are good, but I get what you mean, especially the with rocket\u00A0exhausts as they are a bit short (KSP 1 had longer ones)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe launch plumes need to stay there longer and be bigger, I agree\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
