I\u0027m very happy with the direction things are going in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe change to the style of the staging system is nice, it feels more in line with the rest of the UI style\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEven just from glancing at the main menu, the clouds on Kerbin look much better!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFrom places like low Munar orbit, I\u0027m seeing some nice FPS improvements.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRover wheels are a fair bit more practical now, glad to see the tweaks\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI\u0027ve noticed that some scenarios where I used to see orbital decay without any craft movement are no longer occurring. Not sure if this is a new patch thing, but I\u0027m glad for it!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlanetshine from Jool onto its moons is such an awesome effect, love it to death\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust to offer a bit of feedback:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI feel it\u0027s difficult to read the numbering of exactly how much fuel is in a given tank when the reading is in the \u0022negative\u0022 part of the bar, being grey font on a grey empty bar. At 1440p, the pixellation and blockiness of some of the UI elements is tough to take in.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe new boot system for the game that\u00A0 slowly fades between production logos, epilepsy warnings and copyrights would be well served by a \u0022press any button to skip\u0022 functionality.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI know aerodynamics are VERY much a work in progress, but I noticed one of my planes that flew pretty decently before the update now can\u0027t get off the runway without flopping to the ground. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m specifically having problems with inline parts, but this thread feels very relevant\u00A0\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022226996\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed5382219681\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/213954-massive-drag-bug-with-basically-every-inline-auxiliary-part-tests-results-and-pictures/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=4247933\u0026amp;embedComment=4247933\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment#comment-4247933\u0022 style=\u0022height:294px;max-width:500px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen launching the stock K2, I had a largely well-performing flight... until about 20km in the air, at which point I ground down from maybe 40-50 fps to around 10. Occurred for about 30 seconds, maybe less, then went away.

The large rover wheels such as on the stock crater jumper not having full hitboxes and being very jumpy once the vehicle starts flipping is something I\u0027d love to see redone!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you guys for all your hard work.
