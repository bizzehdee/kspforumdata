When two craft are docked and strutted\u00A0together, undocking the spacecrafts wakes the Kraken. In KSP 1, I believe struts linking two docked crafts would automatically disappear, and if not you had the ability to manually break the connections through the part menu. This addition is overall not extremely important, but with the lack of autostrut, we are ever more reliant on struts being helpful, not hurtful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, I\u0027m really impressed with what the whole KSP 2 team has produced as a starting point. I\u0027m really excited to see some of the performance kinks ironed out and interested to see how much depth is added to the game over time.
