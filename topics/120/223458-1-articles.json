measurable results, so you only actually need to calculate out one of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSlowing down universal time doesn\u0027t actually make much sense in practice.\u00A0 This is because it won\u0027t matter that time on Kerbin is running slower from the ship\u0027s point of view, in order to know that time is running slower on Kerbin the crew of the starship will need to turn around and in the process of accelerating they will Lorentz transform Kerbin into the past from their frame of reference such that by the time they return they will find that more time passed on Kerbin than passed on the starship.\u00A0 Simply slowing down time for the moving starship as I suggest would have an identical outcome.\u00A0 Same with any light speed signal sent from Kerbin containing the time, the signal travel time is different in different reference frames due to lightspeed frame invariance and length contraction such that both reference frames agree on what the clock of the starship will be once it gets the message from Kerbin.\u00A0 There is no point in calculating both reference frames, especially for the effort that it would take to overhaul the physics engine to such a major extent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do like the idea of changing sim speed to match the Lorentz factor of the active ship, but that might add some more complications both in theory and in implementation.\u00A0 The definition of meters and seconds is different in different reference frames, so which one does the navball show as your speed?\u00A0 I do really like the idea of burning an engine for ages and watching as your speed gets closer and closer to\u00A0299,792,458 meters per second without ever reaching it, which would be measured from an external reference frame.\u00A0 But then from the ship\u0027s perspective that speed would be a lie, if you don\u0027t simulate length contraction you would see the distance to a distant star ticking down faster than what your speed says.\u00A0 If you do simulate length contraction it will seem like distant stars spontaneously get closer as you accelerate towards them, and then the distance would tick down slower than what your speed would suggest once you stop accelerating.\u00A0 That\u0027s the tradeoff you\u0027d have to make.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it would just be so much cleaner to have the player camera always operate in the \u0022stationary\u0022 frame of reference.\u00A0 Ships at relativistic speeds would just have their clocks slowed down.\u00A0 Length contraction of the ship itself doesn\u0027t matter in the context of the game, good luck trying to stage an actual Barn Paradox scenario to prove that it\u0027s not being simulated.\u00A0 If I end up modding this into the

all and see what comes of it.\u00A0 My ultimate goal is to show that it\u0027s possible, and maybe I can convince the developers to implement it.\u00A0 If not, at least there will (hopefully) be a mod
