I loved playing with that setting as you were really forced to eke out every bit of science from each stage in the tree. Whether its forcing you to visit every biome on a planet or moon, or returning with each new set of instruments. The new minimum is 50% which feels SUPER fast still, I would love to see that number able to be reduced to as far as it can be while still successfully completing the tree.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn that same note, the ability to track what experiments we have performed in each area/biome seems like something that really SHOULD exist. Perhaps I am just missing it or it\u0027s planned for a later date, but it doesn\u0027t seem like something that would make sense to omit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for listening and I hope there are others that share my same sentiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n-Numi\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
