The burn during timewarp makes a \u003Cstrong\u003EHUGE \u003C/strong\u003Enumber of missions, crafts and profiles possible. I\u0027m excited for interstellar travel, and this post is looking forwards to that feature, so that we can make huge burns in a reasonable way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPrograde and Retrograde Hold During Timewarp\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLove the new burn during timewarp feature. However, with very slow crafts, such as large, or even modest, ion ships, we need to have the ability to make a spiraling constant thrust maneuver, as depicted below:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Optimal-Earth-Moon-transfer-trajectories\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002273.79\u0022 height=\u0022290\u0022 width=\u0022393\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Young-Joo-Song/publication/264103094/figure/fig1/AS:296535289024529@1447710930885/Optimal-Earth-Moon-transfer-trajectories-using-constant-low-thrust-E-EME2000.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know it\u0027s kind of against tradition, but allowing the vessel to rotate on rails, as it were, would massively, massively improve Ion Engines as a player-viable technology.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/868964191774605344/1089230175146872872/image.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis craft is *almost* viable as-is, with a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E way, way south of 0.001, but it\u0027s just a bit of a pain while still in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, since you have to cut timewarp to 1 very frequently for attitude adjustments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EManeuver Editing\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNext, we need a popup window or something for maneuver editing. It\u0027s absolutely untenable to make interplanetary course plots with draggable handles. That\u0027s enough for the Mun, but it\u0027s an absolute bear for anything farther out, especially with the new non-impulsive thrust. The final KSP 1 system was sort of able to do this, but it was still quite half-baked. If I was to list the features of an ideal maneuver planning system, it would be something like the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA list view, from which you can select a maneuver node, in order of execution, without it being visible on screen.\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s almost impossible to fine-tune a maneuver when trying to get a clean planetary intercept, because misclicks cause the node to vanish from view, and you need to pull map focus away from the target, find the node, click the node, which, often as not, is occluded by things like Periapsis, Ascending Node, other craft, etc., then you need to refocus on the target planet, swivel around your view to keep the node and the trajectory in view at the same time, and ever-so-gently pull on the node, all without a single misclick that will dismiss the node again.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDiscrete buttons to change a maneuver by a predictable amount.\u003C/strong\u003E Perhaps 10m/s normally, and 1m/s with CapsLock on, or maybe 10m/s normally and 0.1m/s under CapsLock. This would allow you to test the effect of a small change in angle or magnitude, while being able to easily undo the action if it throws you in the wrong direction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EManual entry of values.\u003C/strong\u003E This is the biggest part that KSP 1 got right, though it was still quite annoying to do, due to the above issues.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EInstant Timewarp Cutoff\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe way in which timewarp ratchets slowly to the next setting is absolutely disastrous for precise burns. At the very least, I need \u0060/\u0060 to cut straight to 1x, bypassing the normal ratchet steps. It\u0027s useful that timewarp isn\u0027t fully on when you increase it, but the slow decrease has caused many, many quickloads and reverts for me.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
