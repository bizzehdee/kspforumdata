It would help reduce the number of bugs posted (as I\u0027m sure there are a lot of duplicates of the same bugs being posted multiples times) and would give an idea to the community of where the devs are what they are doing and what they plan to do and their priorities. What do you think about that?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T21:25:36Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 09:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by XavBell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T22:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbsolutely agree with having an official bug tracker. Submitting through the PD launcher was OK and having a subforum here is much better, and I\u0027m sure the devs have very comprehensive internal bug tracking, but, given the state of the game currently, it really does feel like we\u0027re all contributing in an open beta, and so a more custom-tailored bug tracker feels appropriate in this case. If not that, then I also agree about having some kind of weekly update about what\u0027s being prioritized. Patch notes are all well and good, but those are after the bugs have already been addressed. Call me entitled here but this is the kind of radical transparency I feel like we need now that actual money has been spent by consumers, and I think it\u0027d do a ton to help assuage concerns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mgzsman06","CreatedById":196027,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T23:15:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething along this would be pretty neat.
