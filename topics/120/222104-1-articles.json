Are you considering to add this feature to the fairings and maybe to the long cargobays, too?\u00A0 Right now I have to use a couple of the small cargobays to do so, and it increases the part count which is (at some point) bad for peformance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-26T14:45:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPut small separators between payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snips","CreatedById":209433,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-26T17:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, that\u0027s an idea. But as long as the whole seperators/decouplers are not always working as intended, it\u0027s not the best solution. And you can\u0027t put a decupler/seperator on every other part, for example not on the top of antennas. In KSP1 for example, I use an engine plate on the fairing intersection and then place my cube-sats on top with a hinge.
