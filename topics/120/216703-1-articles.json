The stock KSP1 resource scanner is ridiculous. I want things to do, and setting up probes with various scanners then putting them in a proper orbit to scan is part of what I want. Exploration should be a part of getting ready to build colonies. That exploratory data being used to harvest resources, etc. is something I want as part of making colonies interesting and interactive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thewhitemetroid","CreatedById":202561,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-20T00:25:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nScansat was one of my favorite mods in KSP 1.

My favourite:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake bodies that have not been visited low res. And I mean\u00A0 really low res, like a very roughly textured, visibly pixelized, coloured blob. You can send probes there and do stuff, but only when you send proper scanners or even small cameras there, will you get a progressively better view, scansat style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you send manned vehicles, you will get better visuals, but only as long as there are Kerbals there, it will get worse again when they leave.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen you will want to get elevation data as well, then biome scans, resource scans, possibly temperature scans, you name it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will give you proper space exploration vibes. And finally a very good reason to visit all bodies, even several times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[Edit: ScanSat has a nice export function for the maps. That would also be very cool to have in KSP 2. I would even imagine one computer generated info-graphics poster pdf per body or the whole system, which will be updated when new data is available, including biome names, a small temperature map etc. A bit like this, but with more focus on the scanned map data:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022planet-Mars-in-numbers-infographic-1024x\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002266.70\u0022 height=\u0022683\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.marssociety.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/planet-Mars-in-numbers-infographic-1024x683.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMan, that would be a cool feature.]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the dev team did not do a very important thing: Go through the old forum entries for good ideas.
