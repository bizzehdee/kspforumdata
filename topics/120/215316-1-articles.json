It is already confirmed that we will have at least one superkerbin in the form of Ovin in KSP2, but what about mini-neptunes? Consider what this would add. A brand new kind of planet, with a new damn near impossible challenge (Eve times 1 000 000 000) and a great deal of uniquety to its star system and the game as a whole!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-17T14:55:29Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2023 02:55  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Maria Sirona\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wilolino","CreatedById":227654,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-17T21:32:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis sounds like a pretty cool idea.
