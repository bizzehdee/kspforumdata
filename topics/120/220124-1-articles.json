This was extremely useful when you were trying to be precise with your burns for whatever reason (achieving a precise geosync orbit for example). I tried this is ksp 2 but the throttle doesn\u0027t respond at all. I\u0027d like to see this make a comeback for ksp2 as its a useful tool in my piloting arsenal and hopefully wouldn\u0027t take too much coding work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-21T22:55:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wasn\u0027t even aware that was a thing!!

That way, normal controls would still operate properly including a faster throttle up to X% , but in finer controls mode, we would be able to tap shift for a short enough time period to get a 0.5% throttle setting, or 1% etc (currently about 3% if you are really fast, and usually about 5-7%. Have seen 1% once ever). Also, I tried the \u0022hold CTRL and tap SHIFT\u0022 as well; would love to see that make a comeback!!! Thanks for a great game, and all the improvements so far! Looking forward to it becoming more enjoyable as time progresses!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
