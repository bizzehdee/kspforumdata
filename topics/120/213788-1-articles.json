While you can run a jet engine on liquified natural gas (which is basically liquid methane with enough impurities they don\u0027t want to call it just \u0022methane\u0022 since liquified natural gas is more than 90% methane with the rest varying amounts of other light combustible gasses ethane, propane, butane, and some impurities like heavier alkanes, and nitrogen) and this was demonstrated by the soviets\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-155\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-155\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0so it definitely works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s some issues with the density here, and a large portion of the Tu-155 was a big cryogenic tank because LNG or Liquid Methane would both require significantly more room for a given amount of energy. I don\u0027t have enough info yet to work out if they factored this in to the tank sizes and fuel burn rates. Airplane design in KSP1 (and KSP2) usually has way more fuel tank volume than you normally see, since we end up using tanks as big structural parts which in normal planes would just be cabin, cargo or fuselage, (I know some get fancier with plane designs, I\u0027m just speaking in generalities) and so its hard to say from my own experience that they didn\u0027t faithfully swap the \u0022fuel economy\u0022 of the jet engines over to properly match the Methane fuel. If not then I see no point in relabeling monoprop, since if they didn\u0027t adjust any of the numbers for jets then one of the major fuels is still just a generic made up liquid hydrocarbon that works roughly like how the \u0022liquid fuel\u0022 (which is basically what kerosene is) did but this time called \u0022Methane\u0022. If the names still dont mean anything in real life why bother giving monoprop a real name?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo clarify that a bit... (ignoring the more specific Xenon in ion engines)\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo in KSP1 we had \u0022Liquid fuel\u0022 \u002B \u0022Oxidizer\u0022 in rockets and \u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022 in jets, which given you fill jets and rockets with (admittedly different quality/grades, but still \u003Cem\u003Emostly\u003C/em\u003E the same stuff) the liquid fuel \u0022Kerosene\u0022 this broadly makes sense and seems like a simple abstraction to hide science details out of the way while the game focuses on other things. This didn\u0027t make a lot of sense for the nuclear rocket engine in KSP1 but hey, its a game, lets not overthink it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP2, we have the more realistic sounding (because they are real things) \u0022Methalox\u0022 which is short for methane and liquid oxygen and is our rocket fuel, we have Hydrogen for nuclear rockets now, and we have Methane (presumably liquid) for our jet engines... which means our rockets make complete sense, and sound more scientific, but now our jet engines are kinda whacky experimental contraptions. While yes you can build a jet to run on liquid methane, and yes its cold as heck up in the atmosphere so some of the cooling issues aren\u0027t as bad as you might think, generally speaking, \u003Cem\u003Eliquid methane\u003C/em\u003E is a bad fuel for fancy fighter jets and other general aircraft and while sure you can probably do piston prop planes with \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ecompressed\u003C/strong\u003E natural gas\u003C/em\u003E like you can also make cars, between the lower fuel density and the heavier tank mass, I don\u0027t know how well it would work. \u0022Methane\u0022 as a jet fuel only makes sense on big \u0022wide body\u0022 style jets where you have room in the middle for a respectable size cryogenic liquid tank to keep the fuel in... which is how a lot of kerbal airplanes get designed, so its not a complete write off.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the thing is, all we did was fix the glaring issue with nuclear by giving it its own fuel type, otherwise we swapped one kind of \u0022handwavium\u0022 fuel for another. Our not very realistic fuel just \u003Cem\u003Eswapped\u003C/em\u003E from being our \u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022 rocket fuel in KSP1 to our \u0022Methane\u0022 jet fuel in KSP2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo unless they really went deep and adjusted all the combustion efficiencies and everything else to make the methane fueled jet engines realistic (which I doubt, because what\u0027s the benefit the game design to make the jet engines worse?... and from the limited flying I\u0027ve done the jets seem more powerful than in KSP1?) then there\u0027s not a lot of point to just for the sake of appearance, make Monopropellant into something more realistic sounding.\u00A0 Which is far from a simple choice, since we\u0027ve got different kinds of hydrazine, is it \u0022normal\u0022 Hydrazine? is it Dimethyl Hydrazine? Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine? Is it Nitrous Oxide? Hydrogen Peroxide? Something new like Hydroxylammonium nitrate? Perhaps we get one of the not entirely \u0022mono\u0022 monopropellants like Cavea-B (more technically\u00A01,4-Diaza-1,2,4-trimethyl bicyclo[2.2.2]octane dinitrate dissolved in white fuming nitric acid)\u00A0 which had to use a little bit of UDMH each time to light the engine, but was otherwise a monopropellant as the Cavea-B burned in the engine by itself after ignition. All of these with different densities and performance, and all of them valid choices, except maybe Cavea-B...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, is it even worth it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe still have a level of \u0022don\u0027t worry about the details\u0022 when it comes to our \u0022Methane\u0022 jet engines...\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003EI\u0027m all for realism (huge Realism Overhaul fan, cant wait to see how KSP2 goes for mod makers, because I\u0027m already imagining how good Realism Overhaul might be as a KSP2 mod) but its still a game, its meant to be fun, and getting too technical in places probably hurts more than it helps because it leads to people being distracted by details and complaining about things like \u0022you cant get that much thrust from a hydrazine monoprop thruster, it would have to be UDMH\u0022.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T05:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s Monomethylhydrazine usually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T07:07:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nid do it just for consistency because all the other engines use actual chemicals rather than an ambiguous name like \u0022liquid fuel\u0022. i generally like this move because it takes the guess work out when it comes to modding other engines, and will help declutter mod contributed resources.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224248363\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213788\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677647224\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022129408\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kerbiloid\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, kerbiloid said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s Monomethylhydrazine usually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndoes that work as a monopropellant, because i can only find references to its use as part of a hypergolic bi-propellent (the wikipedia article kind of sucks).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-01T07:12:18Z\u0022 title=\u002203/01/2023 07:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 1, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T07:36:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224248418\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213788\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677654473\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002210883\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Nuke\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n27 minutes ago, Nuke said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndoes that work as a monopropellant, because i can only find references to its use as part of a hypergolic bi-propellent (the wikipedia article kind of sucks).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s first of all an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E monopropellant, used as a component of bi-propellant to simplify the hardware.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T09:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022205123\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2059783260\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200486-show-and-tell-colony-fuel-factories/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0026amp;comment=3928960\u0026amp;embedComment=3928960\u0026amp;embedDo=findComment\u0022 style=\u0022height:320px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T10:46:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBecause there\u2019s only \u003Cb\u003Eone\u003C/b\u003E\u00A0monopropellant, while we have two kinds of rocket propellant.
