This is a bit of a downgrade from KSP1 in which loading a file simply requires a double click on the slot. It\u0027d also be nice if this was implemented for saving over earlier versions of the same workspace in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E as that\u0027s another point of slowdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would suggest implementing this to bring it up to parity with KSP1 in terms of file management flow.
