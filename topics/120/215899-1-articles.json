In KSP 1\u0027s Persistent Thrust mod it lets you just hit X as a sort of \u0027full stop\u0027 where it stops both time warp and your engines, and I feel like KSP 2 would benefit from similar behavior, which would also make things more user friendly and convenient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-25T17:04:20Z\u0022 title=\u002203/25/2023 05:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by spacemanmike\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"twich22","CreatedById":110030,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-29T13:08:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nagree\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-29T14:26:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was so used to X stopping time warp that I did not realize it was actually a feature of Kerbal Alarm Clock, rather than the game itself.
