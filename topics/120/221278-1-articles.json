At least a cab with a lot of buoyancy and wheels that work in liquid but slowly\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso, what about a cargo cockpit to maximize payload space in freighters, or if the rear is needed for more fuel and engines?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncould a camera part be added to enable players to view planets, the surface, and space from more of a first person perspective? not IVA view, more thinking of unmanned craft where IVA is not possible.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nparaglider for pods. (kind of like what was going to be on the Gemini spacecraft) enables long glides for suborbital flights and for appropriate planetary bodies\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nalso, don\u0027t know if no news is good news but nobody has replied to a post I made earlier about atmospheric science in the form of atmospheric telescopes, but I guess the devs did add other forms of atmospheric sciences I mentioned in that same post so I\u0027m not really complaining as I have something non-rocketry to do (as I suck at flying anything but aircraft)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlastly, I don\u0027t know why but in my install the mk3 to large adapter is invisible in both editor and launch, but not in the parts selection area. the nodes are visible however.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-22T21:01:42Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2023 09:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 22\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Kerbal410\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
