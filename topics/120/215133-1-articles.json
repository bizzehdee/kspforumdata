Possible a sun or moon button that appeared next to the time warp display.\u00A0 At the very least this would be super nice to have when at the space center, but optimally it could be done on any view and planetary surface. Though I\u0027m not sure what these buttons would do while in orbit. They might go away when not valid. Or they would warp until the point at which the planetary body is no longer eclipsing the star from the crafts point of view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn any case, the main problem I\u0027d like to solve is when I\u0027m trying to launch at day time, so I use time warp while sitting at the space station, and either have to wait a really long time, or overshoot. I only do one or the other. I never successfully time warp to morning.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:blush:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_embarrassed.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:blush:\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KrakenBait","CreatedById":226058,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T16:39:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have occasionally warped successfully to \u003Cstrong\u003Ea\u003C/strong\u003E morning.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T17:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis was a feature in KSP1 (added rather late but still \u2026) so hopefully it will be brought to KSP2 as well eventually.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
