You might briefly see my spreadsheet in this video. I had a craft that seats up to four with a two stage launch from Eve\u0027s surface. I made use of the refueling tech to allow me to burn retrograde entering the atmosphere so I could top off my tanks after landing. Upon launch from the surface, of course I left the refueling rig behind.
