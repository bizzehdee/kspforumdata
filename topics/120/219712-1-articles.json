There are all kinds of places you can walk your Kerbals to. In KSP2, not so much. Pretty much none of the staircases have colliders and you\u0027ll sink right through them. It would, for instance, be so much fun if you could get off the launchpad using the stairs, walk over to the launch tower, and climb it all the way to the top, to watch a launch. Or explore any of the other buildings with external staircases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
