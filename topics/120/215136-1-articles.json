In real life, space agencies commit to years of planning before doing any major mission: launches in particular are timed down to the minute. Having a series of systems that help players plan missions to other bodies and automatically fly their crafts there similar to systems that NASA uses to plan out its missions would make it significantly easier for new players to get into the game, and can be shed as players become better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
