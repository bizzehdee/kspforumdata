I\u0027m not demanding these things, and understand that the structure and affordances of the game at a basal level may already be set in stone in many respects. Still, now is the time to talk about what can be made, while it\u0027s still a bunch of ideas in all our heads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is KSP2 trying to surpass anyway? What is KSP1?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP1 is a rocket simulator at its core, the \u0022challenge\u0022 that the game entices the player with are the construction of working vehicles and the piloting of those vehicles to various destinations. There\u0027s never been much to \u0022do\u0022 at those destinations, except take in the sights, maybe send a rescue mission, or try to build the biggest thing you can there. There didn\u0027t need to be more than that - KSP is about spacecraft design and flight, and teaches players about the challenges of spaceflight and the thrill of getting from here to there while trying to avoid blowing up. The science system acts as a simple form of guided progression, and science instruments don\u0027t provide much practical purpose except as a source of a currency for unlocking more diverse spaceship parts as a reward for traveling to new destinations with limited technology. The mission system also provides a set of design and flight challenges that act as \u0022suggestions\u0022 if you\u0027re stumped on where you want to go next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat could KSP2 do that\u0027s \u0022more\u0022 or \u0022different\u0022 from that?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, KSP2 basically has all those things KSP1 does: The rocket simulator, the flight challenges, the unlockable parts, etc. It also has updated graphics to rival the best KSP1 mods, some slight changes to the UI, and an ecosystem of bugs almost as diverse as I\u0027d expect to find by overturning a log in the Amazon. So KSP2 is using KSP1 as a base so far, to hopefully metamorphose into a new and different experience. There are a few main \u0022new\u0022 aspects the devs seem to be working towards for KSP2, and while I see the beginnings of some of those inside the \u0027skeleton\u0027 of the game today, there are some things that have been carried over from KSP1 that I think don\u0027t help KSP2 grow to the greatest experience it can be and develop its own \u0022personality\u0022 if they remain as they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP1 was a \u0022rocket\u0022 simulator. KSP1 helped players answer for themselves \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Why should we build rockets?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, to the point that the story of KSP players enrolling in aerospace engineering programs because of the game has become somewhat common. For this reason, I consider KSP to be the best game. (I myself graduated as an aerospace engineer last year, though I can\u0027t say that KSP inspired it - I was already committed to becoming an astronaut long before I heard of the game. I\u0027ve had interviews with SpaceX for various positions in recent months, but no offers yet.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhere KSP1 was a \u0022rocket\u0022 simulator, I see KSP2 as trying to be a \u0022space program\u0022 simulator. In KSP1, the player could build powerful rockets and touch down on any body in the solar system, but it would occur in isolated missions or voyages. Where KSP1 asked players \u003Cem\u003E\u0022Why should we build rockets?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E, KSP2 seems to want to ask a question more like \u003Cem\u003E\u0022What should we USE our rockets for now that we\u0027ve built them?\u0022\u003C/em\u003E. The colonies, base-building mechanics, and interstellar destinations seem to point to a goal of letting players create a vibrant ecosystem of space travel. Instead of singular missions and tiny labs in space, we would be creating cities on the planets and trade routes between them, with complex exchanges of resources and technology culminating in the assembly of an interstellar vessel and the opening of the wide frontier. I think KSP2 has an opportunity to teach players not just about how rockets go from here to there, but about how they gather the information while exploring that leads to scientific discoveries and better informed designs of new vessels, and about the realistic challenges of living and building on another planet, and, \u003Cu\u003Emost importantly, about exactly what makes it worthwhile to go to all that effort of leaving our perfect blue marble behind and actually trying to live there.\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo that note, there are a few specific aspects of the game that are presently implemented in a way that I think will be detrimental to those goals (which I just made up in my head) if they continue to build directly off of KSP1 and the simple precursors in the game now. These are the main aspects that I think should be overhauled to make KSP2 a grand step forward from KSP1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ERealistic Science\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, science in KSP2 functions purely as a currency for unlocking new ship parts. The experiment modules themselves don\u0027t provide any useful information, and the game doesn\u0027t go out of its way to tell you what was learned from each experiment. The experiments are all packaged together in a mysterious bundle, and the only interaction from the player is a simple reaction to the blinking \u0022science\u0022 button, to click and receive science points. This is based directly on science in KSP1, which had the same function as a currency but allowed more direct viewing of the readings from some instruments like thermometers and barometers. I think KSP2 has an opportunity to embrace science in a more realistic way, and bring a taste of \u003Cu\u003Eactual \u003C/u\u003Escience for players. The repeated clicking on individual experiments from KSP1 doesn\u0027t need to return for this, but perhaps an \u0022experiment manager\u0022 window or some other form of more in-depth interaction would be warranted.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I mean by this is for the science experiments to act as sensors measuring quantitative qualities of the environment. Examples of this would be a probe dropping into the atmosphere of a planet with a barometer and thermometer and creating graphs of pressure and temperature by altitude for that planet, or a spacecraft orbiting a planet with LIDAR to map its terrain for the first time, while the player would not be able to see the surface detail up close in map view or with probes before doing that. The player could gather actual scientific data, and the game could guide them into understanding\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Ewhy\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0they\u0027ve learned something about the planet by doing what they\u0027ve done\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E(\u0022See the spikes in your spectrometer reading? Those prove that there is water on Duna!\u0022 \u0022You measured a dip in this star\u0027s brightness, that must have been caused by its planet!\u0022)\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0 I recall the devs mentioning the idea of not giving the player all the information about planets right away, and players having to \u0022discover\u0022 at least some celestial bodies on their own. I think this idea of the player gradually building up their own \u0022discovered world\u0022 based on their own measurements helps with that, and I hope science gains a lot more depth and realism in KSP2 in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of the science experiments I can think of:\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Magnetometers that can map planets\u0027 and stars\u0027 magnetic fields over time by orbiting them, and can help forecast solar storms\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Spectrometers that give spectra for stars, planet atmospheres, and surface samples, which the player can look over to characterize composition\u003Cbr\u003E\n-RADAR, LIDAR, and cameras that allow the player to record detailed maps of surface topography\u003Cbr\u003E\n-Telescopes with various specialized instruments and wavelength ranges for observation of deep space objects, exoplanet discovery, and mapping the stellar neighborhood\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPlayer-Driven Exploration\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith discovery at the forefront of the game, I think the player will have all the incentive they need to drive the direction of their space program on their own. Want to explore the Sun? Prioritize radiation and magnetic science parts. Made an unexpected fascinating discovery about Jool? Drum up the resources for a planetary probe. Prefer visiting Minmus over the Mun? Focus the game on that destination. Show the player the options, and let them choose their own goals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA big place where I feel the game falls short of this are the anomalies. Instead of encouraging the player to go to space to learn about their environment and place in the universe, about the natural beauty of the world, the game sets the main goal as learning about the ancient aliens who were in the Kerbol system. I think having those artifacts in the game is no problem at all, and can make for a really cool adventure, but\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Eno part of the game should tell us to go seek them out or visit them\u003C/u\u003E. I would implement them far more subtly, requiring the player to discover them through actual anomalies in the data they gather as they explore. For instance, mapping out the magnetic environment around the Mun with an orbiting probe and discovering a strong localized magnetic field that reveals the location of the Mun arch. No Keri Kerman telling us that there is an arch, no mission handed to us by the game - all the incentive and excitement can come from a pure \u0022What\u0027s THAT?\u0022 as the player discovers a tantalizing measurement. Then, visiting the arch (which should probably be covered up to begin with until excavation is possible) could allow discovery of an actual signal, a puzzle which would need to be deciphered\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Eby the player\u003C/u\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother example would be finding nearby stars and exoplanets. Once the player has the technology to do parallax measurements and light curves of stars, the game shouldn\u0027t tell them where to look in the sky. They should just be able to start a sky survey or point their telescope at whichever star they like, and see what they find. They might not know about all the same planets as some other player does, and when the time comes to launch their interstellar vessel they\u0027ll choose a different star to point it at, based on what they\u0027ve discovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EResources\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs the game progresses into colony-building, I\u0027m sure the focus on material resources will grow, as now it isn\u0027t there but I can see the place for it in the game. On extraplanetary bases, it\u0027s obvious that there will be a limited budget of raw materials, metals, oxygen, etc. with which to build rockets, buildings, and other machines, with that budget coming from resource extractors and mining of the surface through combing, excavating, and drilling the planets. Other planets would also have alternate materials available like regolith for buildings, roads, and launch pads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn Kerbin, presumably advanced industry elsewhere on the planet is able to supply \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with an \u0022allowance\u0022 of materials and parts, which don\u0027t necessarily need to be limited by cost in money units, but could be limited by quantity available, especially for specialized parts like probe cores and science instruments. For instance, \u0022There are 6 FL-T200 fuel tanks available\u0022 or \u0022There are 3 probe cores and 1 capsule available\u0022. Part of the player\u0027s directive for exploration could be the strategization of prioritizing production/purchase of certain kinds of parts and materials. Probes vs. space station modules, longer range antennas, different types of experiments...These would make every player\u0027s \u0022space program\u0022 unique and personalized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EConclusion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is basically my outline for what I personally imagine KSP2 could be like in the future. The main aspects I see in this \u0022speculative\u0022 version of KSP2 are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nScience experiments functioning in a realistic way, as sensors that observe the environment, and conclusions about the universe being drawn from those observations, as well as useful information for designing and piloting vehicles in those environments\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlayer-driven exploration, with much less direction coming from the mission system as to what to focus on or find important\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA focus on material resources for production of parts, vehicles, buildings, and missions that is adaptable to the player\u0027s self-determined goals\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are a few places in the game where I see gameplay mechanics that I think will prevent KSP2 from achieving these aspects if they are left as they are and taken for granted. Mainly these are copied from KSP1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe \u0022science point\u0022 system and its dynamic with the tech tree\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nExploration being driven by \u0022missions\u0022 where the game tells you where you should go and what aspects of space exploration you should consider important\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think those aspects from KSP1, which themselves were added after the core identity and function of the game were fairly well established, should be rethought and reworked to better fit the mission of KSP2. I\u0027m not demanding that they be changed or made to fit what I\u0027ve described here,\u00A0\u003Cu\u003Emy only request is that they not be taken for granted\u003C/u\u003E\u00A0just because they\u0027re the status quo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know this is just my idea, and I\u0027m sure the actual game could turn out very differently from what I\u0027ve described and still be a very good game. The devs have no doubt been thinking and shooting ideas around about these very topics for years longer than I have, too.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EDevelopers, thanks for listening to the community, and thanks for your dedication and commitment to trying to make something even greater than the best game ever.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-05T21:36:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to see randomness in every planets characteristics, which would only be revealed by using science experiments or observing their different orbits.
