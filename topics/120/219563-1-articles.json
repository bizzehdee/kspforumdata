This button would only be visible if another wing piece is connected to that end of the wing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you press the button, that end of the wing assumes the exact cross-section of the opposing end of the wing it\u0027s attached to. (i.e. pressing the \u0022Flush Root\u0022 button of a wing that is attached to another wing will cause the root of the wing currently being edited to match the tip of the other wing.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis way, smooth, multi-angle wings would be much easier to create.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lyneira","CreatedById":149515,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-20T11:54:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d like to add a closely related suggestion from an older thread to improve quality of life when editing procedural wings:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA way to resize the wing (or multiple attached/smoothed wing segments as suggested in this thread) in 2 dimensions while keeping the same aspect ratio and shape. Right now, when you\u0027re happy with a wing shape but you realize that you need more (or less) wing area, you have to do the following steps:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nchange wing span\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nchange root length\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nchange tip length\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nadjust wing angle to approximate what you had\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nReposition everything that was already attached to the wing\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would make plane building so much smoother if this process could be condensed down to just a gizmo or slider to scale the wing. It doesn\u0027t need to scale it up in 3 dimensions, just dynamically calculate span, root, tip and angle to maintain the same shape. If any one of them would exceed a limit for the wing part, don\u0027t let the wing scale to that size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-09-20T11:55:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/20/2023 11:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Sep 20\u0022\u003ESeptember 20, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Lyneira\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
