Let\u0027s say I want to attach a craft\u0027s fuel tank to a rocket\u0027s radial de-coupler. Typically, the game picks a point on the fuel tank and uses that as the anchor point, but what if I want the anchor point to be on the opposite side of the tank? In one instance, I tried attaching an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E to a rocket, but the game decided that the anchor point on my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E should be on the top of the plane, causing my top stabilizer to collide w/ the rocket. No matter what I tried, I couldn\u0027t get the game to use the bottom of the plane (unless I built the plane again from scratch after already being\u00A0coupled to the rocket)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestion:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt would wonderful if - after picking an anchor part - we could pick a spot on the part that would serve as the anchor point. Even if we were only given 4 options (i.e. front, right, back, left) - that would be better than the current system\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this feature already exists, please drop some knowledge on my addled brain!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-19T03:25:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can rotate and offset the plane to flip it over and move it away\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
