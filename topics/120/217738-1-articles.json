The arcjet would be unlocked pretty early on in game, around when you\u0027re getting your first serious electrical parts (stuff like deployable solar panels). This engine would also consume 10 EC, and have thrust in the 2-5 KN range, however it would only have an isp of around 1300-1200. This engine would serve as an early game gap to prepare you for the extremely low thrust of the dawn engine, and later on serve as an alternative to electric propulsion when you dont want to deal with the low thrust.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Haustvindr","CreatedById":218813,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-19T07:58:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m down for this.
