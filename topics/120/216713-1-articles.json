So if you flip the parts around, the \u0022order\u0022 (not sure what else to call it) of each struts location, is located on the target part automatically in a specific order that is reversed when you flip a part around, and I suspect similar behavior is happening with the weird targeting for struts to side boosters.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got screenshots if the \u0022order\u0022 symmetry stuff isn\u0027t entirely obvious and some visual help is needed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
