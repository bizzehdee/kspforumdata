There were a few milestone missions like Reach Duna, or task missions like Rescue This Kerbal who got stuck in orbit. But for the most part they felt tedious, like reaching this highly specific orbit, or flying your plane for about seven hours in real time to take the temperature at a specific altitude.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, just playing on science mode I tended to set out with the goal of reaching some distant planet I\u2019d never reached before, but by the time I unlocked all the tech to get there, there no longer felt like there was much reason to go, since I\u2019d already completed the tech tree. Plus getting to that point required about a hundred plus very similar launches from the same launch pad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlready I think there\u2019s been a lot of talk about improving career mode so the missions aren\u2019t so tedious. But I also want to hear what other driving forces might push us to continue to explore, even if we\u2019ve unlocked all the tech?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome of that could just be simply improving time warp, or adding autopilot (presumably as an unlock in the tech tree), to generally reduce the tedium. If I can prove a plane can fly then time warp/autopilot it to a given location, that\u2019s much less tedious then having to fly the entire mission in real time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSimilarly I expect orbital construction will reduce a lot of tedium, since you can launch closer to your destination. Whether that\u2019s making an interplanetary leap from Kerbin to Duna, or landing shuttles on Duna from an orbital base, not having to start every mission from the Kerbin launch pad will definitely reduce tedium, and make it easier to break the more ambitious missions into smaller more achievable chunks. Honestly this is one of the biggest reasons I\u2019ve been excited for KSP 2 in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah! This might actually be a problem that\u2019s already solved on paper. I just haven\u2019t seen it yet since those features aren\u2019t implemented.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThoughts?

It\u0027s my favorite. You can do it in Sandbox, Science, or Career.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe console version of KSP has a Mun launchpad option- I found that to be super rewarding and I was sad it wasn\u0027t a part of vanilla KSP on PC. At about the same time they had announced KSP2 (I remember Parallax Mod was about to come out too). My PC at the time was a laptop, so I was very limited in performance. I decided to wait for cololnies in KSP2 and get a nice computer in the meantime.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince then I\u0027ve been practicing all aspects of my supply chain method: \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E design, Mining, Stations, Comms, Etc. It feels like a larger Arc than KSP is capable of providing in a script, nor do I think I would like it that way. One of the things that keeps me in KSP is the ability to uniquely tailor the game experience in the same way you can tweak a ship- The all do the same thing, but it\u0027s how you do it that makes it fun for you. I suppose the basic script of \u0022Rocket Science and Extraplanetary Exploration\u0022 is good enough for me. Beyond that it\u0027s basically roleplay as a \u0022Space Program\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving said all that, I do think they have all of that down on paper, but clearly not in code tight enough to share (or maybe it is good enough to share, just not on top of what\u0027s currently ailing the game). Everything that KSP2 promises seems to me geared towards that play progression. I\u0027m also into the tedium though; I guess it offers me an opportunity to continue experimenting for optimization, quality of life, or style.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess don\u0027t really play for an endgame.

You could decide to set each unlocked mission type to \u0022automatic\u0022 and it would unlock that level of cost for later rockets, in the sense of: You were able to run a profitable mission with a rocket that cost [this much], so we will fund any future rockets of that cost, no question asked. The idea behind this is, that we are the designers of new vehicles and try the new stuff. Someone else is running similar missions with the craft we provided without us having to know, producing these vehicles for profit and we only have to fund further development. One could even opt for some monthly income to our budget, but that might collide with fast-forwarding. I would be fine for money/earnings to just expand our mission cost envelope.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEvery mission type could have escalation steps: (rescue from Kerbin orbit, Mun orbit, Minmus, Eve...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother way to expand your budget could be to set a mission type, that you would be willing to do:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLanding \u0026amp; return operation on Eve would give you a couple of generated missions: A rescue mission, a sample return mission etc., while orbital mapping operations on gas giants would give you exactly that. Maybe including some high-profit/high-risk mission like a low orbit mapping while within a planet\u0027s athmosphere or very low down, pushing you into dipping into a gas giant\u0027s athmosphere if just for a very short moment, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo, to make it short:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou have a vehicle budget and you play missions to expand that budget. If your mission is successful, your approved budget is raised. If you mission is profitable, your budget is raised even more. From then on you may repeat that kind of mission to get more profitable in that mission profile/type. You can simply browse mission by type and set them to not bother you anymore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhy?\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt removes grinding, but still incentivizes you for profitable missions and cost saving.

Heavily modded KSP is currently far more stable and playable than stock KSP 2.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my current modded KSP 1 game I\u0027ve flown multiple flights to Minums, one flight to the orbit of the sun and back, and built an space station around Kerbin capable of fabricating new ships in space using the Simple Construction mod. I\u0027ve built ships in orbit, sent them on trips to other planetary bodies, then landed them back on Kerbin. I have about 16 hours of playtime in this save with no signs of stopping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m playing with Mods for mouse control flight, automatic science collection, Kerbal attachment system for attaching new parts in real time, Kerbal Engineer, Mech Jeb for autopilot, Scan Sat for finding ore deposits ( a mod that complains every time I launch it, that it is out of date and will most likely cause errors), and of course Simple Construction, which is a updated version of Extraplanetary Launchpads, that I have further tinkered with to make building ships faster and cheaper. Over the course of this save I\u0027ve added new mods, and altered the configs with multiple flights in progress. There is every reason for my current game to be an unplayable mess, and yet I haven\u0027t had any game breaking bugs. Or even any notable bugs at all other then the one crash I caused when I added a typo in the configs, which was gracefully recovered from.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my most recent stock KSP 2 game I build a space plane, launched it, and the wings fell of immediately. Then I strutted it together as a workaround and tried again, and in my arrogance I also tried to add a rocket stage. This time it didn\u0027t fall apart until I staged the boosters away, at which point every part of the ship slowly drifted apart from each other while still flying. I got a total of 3 hours play time in that save before giving up and 2 of those hours were spent collecting data to submit bug reports.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe most I\u0027ve ever been able to do in KSP 2 is land on the Mun once, and that was a close call because I had to load a quick-save at least five times before I won the lottery and my ship _didn\u0027t_ disassemble itself when it entered the Mun\u0027s sphere of influence, or stage the drive segment, or open the landing gear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now I jump on KSP 2 every update because I have a deep love of the franchise and want it to succeed, but so far my experience has mostly been playing QA Tester rather than enjoying the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-10T17:10:04Z\u0022 title=\u002208/10/2023 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 10\u0022\u003EAugust 10, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by CiberX15\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VlonaldKerman","CreatedById":225683,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-10T17:39:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my newest modded save with ~25 hours, I have something like 95 mods.
