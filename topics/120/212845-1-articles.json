This grid was a global grid, but could be toggled to use a local grid aligned to your selected part, using a button below the move and rotate tools. This was a very useful feature for lining objects up in building a craft, which in KSP2 can be somewhat frustrating as things won\u0027t rotate quite to 0 using the snap options, or parts wont quite line up end to end. While turning off snapping and moving the parts freely can get you close, its very difficult to do perfectly due to lack of the snapping, or some kind of angle or distance measurement tool to tell you the rotation or location of the object.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps not everyone misses it as much as I do, but I really miss it \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith the way craft building works in KSP2 I understand it would be more complex since you have multiple crafts in play at once, which are all placed and moved freely, I believe the universal grid should follow the selected craft and probably be set to the anchor part, while the local grid should function how the building does now.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s also possible this whole post is a waste of time because this feature is implemented and I just don\u0027t know how to toggle it, in which case, please help\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dvrabel","CreatedById":226165,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T02:32:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe move/rotate tool has the same options snap options as KSP1.

To best see what I am talking about, try placing a couple of the long beams on the differently sloped sides of the Mk3-5 Cockatoo command module. Now, using the snapping mode and the F key, can you get these beams to point exactly parallel to each other and the centerline of the command module? Can you get 2 identical parts to clip into each other completely perfectly when placed at differing initial angles, using only a snapping mode? I cannot, because as far as I can tell, object snapping is only relative to the initial position of the part being moved - they never realign to a global grid no matter how I use the F key.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe only way to get parts closer to being in exactly the same position or exactly centered is by disabling snapping and moving them freehand, which of course will never actually be 100% aligned.
