One the major things that\u00A0 needs to be changed is the pixeled artwork and text on UI.\u00A0 Like yes some of the things i can understand the pixeled nature(time or stuff like that). But other things like menus and popups, icons. Like this is way too much. This is not an 8-bit game.\u00A0 It 2023 with people having high enough resolution screens to have full and sharp icons and text. It makes you focus so much harder on the ui than needed(can see people getting strained from trying to read and understand things). Some solutions either have this as a option in the game settings or redo the text and icons. Please!!!! I really dont want to have to find an UI mod in order to understand what im looking at.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gargamel","CreatedById":64714,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T05:16:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMoved to ksp2 suggestions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
