The desire to build more things naturally leads you to deep mines and the nether and what not without a list of quests.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo ultimately I would prefer just LS. There\u2019s nothing in the game preventing you from time warping 1 million, but your Kerbals will die/go dormant so the player is naturally led to not time warp too much while they are still in the \u201Cgathering resources\u201D phase. When enough resources are gathered for interstellar this changes a bit with the massive time frames required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the \u201Cdifferent play styles exist and therefore we can\u2019t punish one style\u201D angle, I agree with this too but this is where I think the comparison to the introduction of reentry heat is most applicable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome peoples play styles was to slam into the atmosphere of jool and pull a \u00A050 g acceleration to be captured. Introducing reentry heat did take away that, but it added a (to me) very enjoyable whole other level to gameplay that made it worth adding. Same with life support. The \u201Ctime warp all the time sequential missions only, I don\u2019t have to consider transfer windows\u201D playstyle will be hampered, but the game will get a whole new level of depth that is worth it I think. No one complains about having reentry heat anymore, rather it\u2019s absence is felt by how much simpler the sequel is without it. I think a similar story could happen with life support.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Royalswissarmyknife","CreatedById":216092,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-28T23:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224316486\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022219031\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221693209655\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n15 hours ago, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll the colony sim stuff is great, but what I\u0027m really looking forward to it having to build all the trucks, ships and aircraft needed to transport resources using delivery routes.

For players who don\u0027t want to deal with resources, sandbox mode is almost certainly hanging around. If it is still deemed to be a problem to \u0027hurry up and wait\u0027 on resources, the KSP gameloop is to build things to solve problems - So have colonies have resource storage limits, and colony buildings that provide storage. Players can timewarp to full if they want, but not to infinite. Simple solution that integrates into what they want you doing, without being annoying - its just another step in growing and building a colony, and makes sense. We\u0027ve already seen orbital colonies with piles of spherical tanks, so might just be that\u0027s how it already works.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d love to see life support added, and I\u0027ll definitely be using life support mods, but I don\u0027t blame the devs if they\u0027re not adding it themselves. Life support is hard - look at the modding space for it. On the extreme simple end you just have snacks, which are a thematic but uninteresting \u0022add another bar\u0022 approach to life support. On the other extreme, you have stuff like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E or Kerbalism that provide very involved life support that acts an interesting design challenge to missions - but also a relatively difficult and unintuitive one as you get into long term habitation and all its complexities. Satisfying both groups without making something very compromised that ends up making neither happy is a major design challenge. One that I believe is easier to leave open to the modding community, where bespoke solutions for all the various preferences are more easily compartmentalized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Siska","CreatedById":195997,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-06T12:56:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo much talk about colonies and interstellar travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t want any of these if the game is in a state like this.
