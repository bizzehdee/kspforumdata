I do make sure that I have more than enough \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E to ensure I can lift off the target body. And I try hard to make sure I bring enough fuel, but have always used Delta V to assess that. At least on KSP1, there are Delta V tree maps for getting to and from each body that are really helpful. I used MechJeb in KSP1 and am using Micro Engineer in KSP2 to give me my horizontal surface velocity and vertical velocity then work at killing those as I near the surface. Sometimes I come in a bit hot, but I have never really needed to see fuel supply in seconds. It\u0027s just a different way of looking at it, I have always understood things in terms of change in velocity and acceleration.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBTW, Happy Pride Month from a fellow queer and trans woman.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Davidian1024","CreatedById":210190,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-14T15:53:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI posted this somewhat hastily.\u00A0 I kept having this thought as I played that it shouldn\u0027t be too hard for the game to tell me how many second I have left in my stage as opposed to how much DeltaV.\u00A0 But I didn\u0027t know exactly how to articulate it.\u00A0 Now, I don\u0027t think I had a totally clear idea of what I wanted.\u00A0 Part of why I posted it was to see if others had ever wanted something similar.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince then I\u0027ve been trying to make mental notes of when I wanted something like this.\u00A0 And I\u0027m realizing it\u0027s more than just how many seconds of burn time I have left in a given stage.\u00A0 I think it\u0027s basically anywhere there\u0027s a velocity shown in m/s, I\u0027d like a way to be able to toggle that to be expressed in terms of the amount time it would take my craft to make that change in velocity.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get this number with the maneuver planner.\u00A0 But there are at least two ways where I think you wouldn\u0027t want that.\u00A0 The maneuver planner does alot more than just tell you how long to burn.\u00A0 If all you want is that amount of time, it\u0027s overkill and feels tedious.\u00A0 Not enough time to setup the maneuver plan.\u00A0 As a simple example, say you\u0027re coming up on a moment where you need to perform a burn, but it\u0027s important that you don\u0027t start too early.\u00A0 Bej\u0027s example of guesstimating landing burns is a good one.\u00A0 One recent situation was when I was trying to synchronize an orbit with my station.\u00A0 Instead of m/s difference in velocity between me and the target, I would\u0027ve likes seconds it would take to cancel that difference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo TheOrbitalMechanic\u0027s point.\u00A0 Yes, I can definitely see this making the readouts more confusing.\u00A0 But at the same time, I think if done right, it could be a big help.\u00A0 Making it so the user is unlikely to accidentally switch the display away from the m/s number to seconds could be done by holding alt and clicking on the number perhaps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut then Evelyn\u0027s comments about mods make me wonder if this would be better in a mod than in the stock game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, and I also want to say Happy Pride Month as a straight white cis male ally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
