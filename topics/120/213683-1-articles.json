There aren\u0027t too many aspects of the game that don\u0027t have glaring issues and given the slow turn around you all have committed to (and shown thus far) it makes it seem like we will be in this state for a very long time. I was wondering if you all have considered code bounties to offset this. Many issues in this game at the moment are junior dev level issues (like localization not working correctly) that just take time, but are pretty simple to do. Outsourcing those tasks to a bounty system would allow Intercept to focus on bigger issues and core functionality, greatly improve how quickly issues can be resolved, and frankly cost less than full-time staff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"S\u1D04\u026A\u0274\u1D1B\u026A\u029F\u029F\u1D00\u1D1B\u1D0F\u0280","CreatedById":69027,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T16:34:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be a bit embarrassing for a game published by a company with a market cap higher than the GDP of Malta to need to resort to using bounties to help fix the game they just released for \u20AC50 a couple of days ago...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pyritin","CreatedById":226592,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T16:49:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOutsourcing development work isn\u0027t a new thing for a company of any size. In fact the larger they are the more often it occurs typically. At this point I doubt the community cares about how they get the results, only that they see them. Having to a wait a month to see only some of the pretty egregious issues with this release solved is a pretty hard pill to swallow.

There\u0027s a significant administration overhead on the devs plate to facilitate any sort of come and go development model, where you have to review everything coming through by SME\u0027s from the relevant teams and possibly an architect. I run into this problem every time a company wants my help to set up Citizen development, thinking they can cut the core team and just have the business units take it all on. Rando\u0027s coming in to fix and add to the code means you have to corral them all, enforce standards, and review that they\u0027re not accidentally doing anything destructive to stuff in other branches - I might see this weird floating stub and useless verification operation as a weird resource hog and waste, and trim it while rewriting something to handle a bug. Only later for the devs to go to merge and find that I\u0027ve rewritten and deleted a key point for the new stuff they were building in a different branch and now we\u0027ve got collisions and bug fixes that need to be undone and remade.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering the small headcount, and the fact that only a portion of that headcount is actually programmers instead of artists or designers, they\u0027d almost certainly spend months setting up the groundwork for this only to end up fixing bugs slower as the devs spend more time herding cats and rejecting bad fixes. It would be cheaper and easier long term to hire on 2-3 contractors for 6-12 months as extra muscle for a dedicated fix team that can actually be trained up and trusted to be set loose. After all, we know all the other major features like colonies are half complete, those teams will still need to finish them, and odds are they\u0027re not super familiar or useful in the core stuff thats broken right now - The guy making colony resource management probably has minimal understanding of the physics problems underlying \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E going monkey mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
