Part selection has to be canceled so to use MMB for centering, then part reselected. This is inconvenient because the first thing that comes to my mind is that I need X component on my ship, so I select it. It\u0027s not until after that I begin to think about where exactly I\u0027m going to place it. As far as I can tell, MMB serves no other function while placing a part. If it does serve a function I\u0027m unaware of, having it be MMB doesn\u0027t work out well. Allowing MMB for focusing while placing a part would make building more seamless and enjoyable.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-26T00:54:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n100% agree, I have tried using the MMB multiple times for this purpose while holding a part.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-26T14:21:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy opinion is that Wasd or arrows should move and rotate camera.
