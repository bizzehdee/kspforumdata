And when I place a plane part in vertical mode first, it is horizontally oriented! This is different to KSP 1, where rocket parts were horizontal in the Spaceplane Hanger, and plane parts were vertical in the Vehicle Assembly Building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;\u0022\u003EMy Idea:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy idea is to let the \u201CWorkspace Orientation\u201D button rule everything! If you start in horizontal mode, every single part is horizontally oriented, be it plane parts or rocket parts, and vice versa.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:12pt;\u0022\u003EBenefits:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis allows more flexibility in designing rockets and planes, as I can start with a plane part in vertical mode and vice versa. This is also useful for spaceplanes, as I can start with rocket parts and add wings later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-22T16:06:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExactly that.
