Currently the FIFA23 price on steam is 650 Turkish Liras.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe current price tag seems so weirdly high (at least for Turkish citizens). It saddens me that as a very long time KSP fan, I will not be able to obtain and play this wonderful game I\u0027ve been so hyped about.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for consideration and I hope you\u0027ll integrate a proper regional pricing for Turkish players on steam.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope to see you ingame soon!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
