Alternatively, being able to see the objectives directly (like the tracker mid-flight) would help a lot here.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWindow positions/sizes reset frequently - e.g. when opening/closing the map in particular, that\u0027s jarring. On an aero flight I needed to open the map regularly to adjust my navigation, and then had to re-open and resize/re-position the part tracker again so I could monitor the air-sniffing science part. Several possible improvements here - maintain those window sizes/positions (and state), give me the ability to see science parts in a separate display, probably other options.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRelated note, this may be intentional, but you can\u0027t see mission waypoints on the navball. For those early sight-seeing missions, you only see the indicator in-world when you\u0027re close (\u0026lt;50km?). Being able to see the marker on the navball either all the time or when further out would make taking on a long flight more enjoyable. Adding custom markers (especially if marker range isn\u0027t infinite) would be a fun way to \u0022plot your course\u0022 to a distant objective, especially if you want to visit or even overfly biomes along the way.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe precision for planning a docking operation is much worse than KSP1 - I routinely aimed for \u0026lt;0.5km closest approach in KSP1 and even down to 0.1km when intercept speed wasn\u0027t too high. With KSP2, I don\u0027t get a numerical indication at all, that I can see.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen attempting a dock in KSP1, the \u0022target\u0027s relative velocity vector indicator\u0022 on the NavBall was crucial, making it straightforward to get close, nullify relative motion, then fine-tune approach. In KSP2 I\u0027m struggling to transition from \u0022plan a burn to get nearby\u0022 to \u0022ready to use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E for final approach\u0022. We get a target pro/retro indicator, but I really need that velocity indicator as well. If this is intended to be unlockable, it probably should arrive at or shortly after the first docking port unlock.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe burn timer still feels too imprecise (start/stop) relative to what I\u0027m used to for KSP1. I\u0027m _always_ making a correction burn in KSP2, instead of only sometimes needing to do so in KSP1. One simple change that might go a long way here is to have the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator in the burn timer count down instead of staying on the planned total (much like the current stage shows remaining rather than original \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSecondary mission objectives relative to their science reward seem to vary considerably. I had some fairly easy, early missions awarded as much as 400 science, and on the other end I\u0027m sitting on a mission to land _200 tons_ on Minmus for... 35 science? This one may actually be a bug, but my main feedback here is that mission difficulty and reward should generally scale relative to each other, granted that scale probably slides around as you move deeper into the tech tree. 200 tons on Minmus when I hadn\u0027t even unlocked the Mainsail yet felt...beyond daunting.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOverall, KSP2 feels like a real game now with Exploration Mode. I miss the challenge aspect of budget constraints, but not the tedium - hoping some of those other progression elements can find a way into the game in the future but only if the fun can show through without the toil. If it helps, the part of that I most enjoyed was trying to make more of my vehicles recoverable (imagining they\u0027d be reused, like SpaceX has proven is viable), so getting at that challenge with some other mechanic would also be rewarding. I know there are more major features coming down the line and I\u0027m especially excited for colonies and multiplayer (interstellar too).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
