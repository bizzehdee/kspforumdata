This is needed because the attitude of the aircraft as it sits on the runway can impact takeoff and landing. A tall nose gear will increase angle of attack, making takeoff easier. A short nose gear will produce negative angle of attack and can assist with landing. Additionally, I find that many of my designs end up with the landing gear being attached at different heights relative to the ground, and they typically need some adjustment to get the correct idle position for the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPerhaps we can also have active landing gear that can be adjusted on the runway or in flight as an advanced tech tree item later on. The benefit of such a part would be to allow the takeoff and landing benefits simultaneously that I mentioned. Active landing gear that can change height on demand may also be useful for loading and unloading cargo, and other tasks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T02:08:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely needed, or at the least 2 different lengths for each wheel size/arrangement\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lemon1324","CreatedById":1232,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T02:09:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMake the Adjustable Landing Gear mod from 1.0.5 stock!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ligator","CreatedById":226638,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-01T06:41:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.
