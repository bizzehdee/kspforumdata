For example, the Rhino had way too much thrust for an orbital engine and it looks more like a sustainer anyway, so its Isp stats were changed to fit the sustainer role. For the orbital role, the Labradoodle was introduced.\u00A0\u00A0This makes for better gameplay and therefore the deviation is justified. In most other cases though, engines have been kept pretty much the same as in KSP1, even where change is definitely in order.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EIn my opinion, the methalox category should just consist of a simple, balanced set of 12 basic engines. One per archetype of each size and nothing more . This is already true for the LG and MD sizes, but not so much for the SM and XS sizes:\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EFirst of all: the Reliant is terrible. While the Mammoth II and the Mainsail put out about 2.5x the thrust of their sustainer counterparts, the Reliant only provides 20% more thrust than the Swivel. It also still lacks any thrust vectoring, which already was enough reason to never use it in KSP1. However, like with all launchers, its sea level Isp has now also been nerfed to below that of the Swivel, making it utterly useless. The second design principle states that the Reliant should be proportional to other launchers, which means that it needs thrust vectoring and its maximum thrust should be increased dramatically to about 550 kN.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EWhile the TWRs of orbital engines are consistent across all size categories, the Swivel and Reliant TWRs are a bit low compared to their larger cousins. Their masses should be adjusted to about 1100 kg for the Swivel and 2100 kg for the 550 kN Reliant.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EIt\u2019s unclear to me what the roles of the Thud, Twitch and Spider are. Being radial engines, it\u2019s easy to attach a lot of them to a rocket , providing plenty of thrust. However, their TWRs are too low and their sea-level Isps too high to be considered proper launchers., while their vacuum Isps are too low to be considered good sustainers. I think instead of having dedicated radial engines, radial engine plates would provide a lot more versatility.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EIn the XS size there are no launcher or orbital engines. One option would be to refit the radial engines:\u00A0the Twitch could easily be repurposed as a launcher by nerfing its sea-level Isp to 255 and increasing its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to around 25. With 3- or 4-symmetry it already provides sufficient thrust, so its mass would be lowered to about 65 kg. Changing the Spider into an orbital engine requires a bigger overhaul: Isp needs to be 330/165 and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E about 12. Assuming 8-symmetry (because Spider), its thrust should be cut down to 0.75 kN and its mass to 6.5 kg.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003EAs a deep space engine, the Ant\u0027s Isp should be adjusted to 365/55 and its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E lowered to under 8. To keep engine ratios similar to larger sizes, its thrust should be doubled to 4 kN and its mass increased to 55 kg.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:transparent;font-size:11pt;vertical-align:baseline;\u0022\u003ELast but not least: the Vector is spectacularly overpowered. It outperforms the Swivel, the Reliant and even the larger Skipper in both thrust and atmospheric efficiency, effectively making all of them obsolete. Even though it\u2019s unlocked somewhat later in the tech tree, it brutally violates the third design principle and therefore has no business\u00A0in the methalox category. Advanced and specialized engines such as the Vector and the Dart need a different fuel and since hydrogen is already an existing fuel type, a hydrolox category would be an excellent\u00A0solution. This would also be realistic considering the real-world analogs of the Vector and the Dart.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-25T15:25:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/25/2024 03:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 25\u0022\u003EJanuary 25\u003C/time\u003E by MirageNL\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MirageNL","CreatedById":227554,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-26T14:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also made a pretty \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E vs. Isp graph to support my argument, showing all engine performances from sea-level to vacuum.
