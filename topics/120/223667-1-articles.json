Here the game could teach you a completely new thing: Layers of atmosphere and behavior of pressure, density and buoyancy. After falling trough different layers of Clouds (which would be their their own Biomes) slowing down more and more,\u00A0 depending on the Mass and buoyancy (density) of our craft, at a certain certain depth we should reach an ocean of compressed gas. To go deeper we need to have a craft that is even heavier (denser). Under that ocean i would love ANOTHER ocean of a different compressed gas.\u00A0\u00A0Beneath this, a solid surface should appear. And it would GLOW. Because it would be a metallic and hundred thousand degrees hot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EMy Suggestion:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
