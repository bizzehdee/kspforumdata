I\u2019m an old hand at KSP so I guessed that after the \u201Cget out of atmosphere\u201D mission, there would be a get into orbit mission. So I overengineered my space craft and managed to not only get out of the atmosphere, I also managed to get into orbit, then deorbited, then landed in the ocean.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I was a little peeved when I completed the get out of atmosphere mission only for the next two missions to pop up being \u201CGet into orbit\u201D and \u201Csplash down in the water\u201D sitting there, uncompleted. I had to literally repeat the mission I had just run because the game hadn\u2019t been tracking it when I did them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI actually like that the game doesn\u2019t present every possible mission to me at the same time. I think that\u2019s a good user experience especially for new players. However, I think missions should still be updated even when they aren\u2019t visible. In that way when a player manages to pull off future missions before they are even aware of them, they are rewarded for their effort, rather than punished by making them repeat their work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-12-23T19:13:41Z\u0022 title=\u002212/23/2023 07:13  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Dec 23\u0022\u003EDecember 23, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by CiberX15\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HebaruSan","CreatedById":156657,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-23T19:22:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAgreed.
