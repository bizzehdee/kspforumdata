rather it is more closely aligned to the center of the usable workspace area.\u00A0 Therefore, you have practically the same amount of workspace area to the left and right of your camera focal point.\u00A0 The UI Developers of KSP1 took note of the fact that the part picker menu unevenly removes potential real estate from the left side of the game window compared to the staging list on the right side of the game window.\u00A0 This is a concept that is used in pretty much all engineering cad programs.\u00A0 It provides a more pleasing and balanced workspace environment.\u00A0 The developers also minimized the surrounding UI elements such to reduce the overall deviation from the center divide of the game window.\u00A0 This too reduces the apparent imbalance between the left and right sides of the User Interface as the focal point is not too far away from the center of the game window. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow Lets Take a Look at KSP2\u0027s User Interface: Photo below is a game capture.\u00A0 Render Resolution @ 1920x1080p and UI Scaling @ 100% (although I do not believe UI scaling is implemented in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of KSP2).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r7N9g4S.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/r7N9g4S.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first thing you will notice in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of KSP2 is that the part picker menu is much wider, therefore taking up more potential real estate from the usable workspace.\u00A0 On top of that the menu is not snapped to the edge of the game window as in KSP1 which also takes more room from the usable workspace.\u00A0 Not only that but its completely dead space.\u00A0 Its not used for anything and serves no benefit to the UI what so ever.\u00A0 You will also notice that the tool icons along the bottom of the game window are all tucked out of the way to the left and right in KSP1\u0027s User Interface.\u00A0 Some even existing in the bottom portion of the part picker menu as to maximize space utilization.\u00A0 The current location of these tool icons in KSP2 take yet even more real estate from the usable workspace area. This time from the bottom.\u00A0 Here too, these tool icons are not snapped to the border of the game window.\u00A0 All of this boils down to a significantly reduced usable workspace in KSP2 compared to KSP1.\u00A0 I shouldn\u0027t have to remind us that we are meant to be building on bigger scales in KSP2 in the hopefully near future.\u00A0 having a more claustrophobic workspace doesn\u0027t aid in providing a comfortable and balanced experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow taking a look at the workspace, another issue becomes apparent\u00A0 in the KSP2 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E UI.\u00A0 The intersecting red crosshair lines represent 2 things: The center divide of the game window AND the focal point of the camera for your project.\u00A0 Notice how it is deviated to the left of the center divide of the usable workspace represented by the vertical green line.\u00A0 If we were to use the scroll wheel and zoom in on the workspace, the camera will zoom in on the rocket.\u00A0 Not the center of the workspace.\u00A0 This creates an unbalanced look and uncomfortable/awkward shift feeling when zooming in and out on your craft.\u00A0 It feels off, because it is.\u00A0 The deviation of the focal point from the center of the workspace is also much greater in KSP2 than in KSP1 due to the larger imbalance between the left and right elements of the UI.\u00A0 This also limits the usable workspace simply because the left side of your project has more limited real estate than the right when building as exampled below due to the part picker menu:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pLHeB0A.jpeg\u0022

part picker menu less wide, snapping the UI elements the the borders of the game window, and aligning the camera focal point and project location to the center of the usable workspace area would make a massive difference in the user experience while in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 I know nothing about coding, but being that these suggestions do not require any actual design changes, I would think that these implementations would be pretty straight forward and would have a profound ROI in terms of work hours spent.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCamera Controls:\u00A0 Now I will be completely honest here this is going to be a personal preference, but I felt I would mention it anyway.\u00A0 while the camera isn\u0027t a tangible part of the UI, the inputs with the keyboard and mouse directly connect the user and how they interface with the game and therefore I would argue that the controls of the camera would be topic of discussion for the User Interface. \u00A0 We can all agree that everyone has a personal preference when it comes to the DPI settings of ones mouse.\u00A0 Me, I like 500.\u00A0 I play FPS games when not playing KSP.\u00A0 I like low sensitivities when playing FPS games as it helps with tracing recoil patterns.\u00A0 As such over the years I have come accustomed to moving my mouse around on my desk.\u00A0 as time went on, I found myself preferring lower DPI settings overall on the computer as it was just more natural to me.\u00A0 In KSP1 you would zoom in on your project by using \u0022SHIFT\u002BScroll Wheel\u0022 and you would move the camera up and down along your project by simply using the scroll wheel.\u00A0 In KSP2, you zoom with scroll wheel and to move up and down along your project you have to click the scroll wheel and drag your mouse up or down respectively.\u00A0 Being that I am on a lower DPI this can mean multiple repetitions of this procedure to move up or down the entire length of certain crafts.\u00A0 Click scroll wheel, drag mouse up or down to edge of mouse pad, release scroll wheel, reset mouse on opposite mouse pad boundary, and repeat.\u00A0 This is made more difficult by the fact that while dragging your mouse with the scroll wheel clicked also allows left and right camera rotation around the craft.\u00A0 So if you do not drag your mouse perfectly up and down (which no one can do), translating up and down your craft will move your camera orientation around your craft as well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, it doesn\u0027t make sense why the Devs would change something from KSP1 to KSP2 for the simple reason of change for change\u0027s sake.\u00A0 As a player of KSP1 since 2012, it was immediately noticable in KSP2 the first time I went to build a rocket that the camera controls were different.\u00A0 This was very frustrating.\u00A0 as mentioned before, 60-80% of time is spent in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly

sudden, subconscious second nature actions don\u0027t have the expected results is just hard to break out of.\u00A0 \u003Cs\u003EAt least maybe make it an option to use Legacy camera \u003Cabbr

\u0022Scroll Wheel\u0022 as zooming in and out of your rocket.\u00A0 And bringing back the modifier of \u0022SHIFT \u002B Scroll Wheel\u0022 from KSP1 and make it move the camera up and down along your craft.\u00A0 My solution suggestion for the camera controls would accomplish a couple of issues.\u00A0 For one, it would retain a control modifier that existed in KSP1 that has no function in KSP2, and allow returning players a more familiar feeling by providing better parity between the two games.\u00A0 Second, it only really adds a control scheme rather than just saying \u0022bring back the old controls.\u0022\u00A0 This will mean that new players that have already \u0022onboarded\u0022 into KSP2 will not have to completely relearn controls.\u00A0 Plus I do have to agree after some converstation with \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/150811-the-aziz/?do=hovercard\u0022

is better suited for the base scroll wheel function as it is more intuitive and in line with practically any other design or cad application.\u00A0 And Lastly, it would free up the middle mouse wheel function.\u00A0 I propose that the middle mouse wheel should do what it did in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E of KSP1 and that was provide a free moving camera focal point translation tool.\u00A0 This is very beneficial for those building planes and spaceplanes as it allows more freedom in the placement of your camera while building large horizontal vehicles.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStaging\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003EUI:\u00A0 In KSP1 when you needed to \u0022Check Yo Stagin\u0022, the stage would move with your cursor while you dragged it. In doing so, you could see where it would go when you released the mouse.\u00A0 In KSP 2, the stage stays where it\u0027s at and a red dashed line appears in a position that your current cursor location would seemingly indicate a move to upon release of the mouse.\u00A0 however, its not very intuitive.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nlook at the picture below:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022OeK6hVg.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/OeK6hVg.jpeg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately I couldn\u0027t figure out how to capture my cursor in a screenshot, however hopefully this illustration makes sense.\u00A0 In this screen shot, I have clicked stage 5 and intend to move it to below stage 4 and above stage 3.\u00A0 If I release the mouse anywhere within the green\u00A0 box, this action is successful.\u00A0 If I release the mouse within the orange box (which is within the intended location to move the stage to as apparent by the dashed red line and red pointed arrow) nothing happens.\u00A0 Stage 5 remains right where it is and no change in staging is made.\u00A0 This just doesn\u0027t make any sense to me.\u00A0 Further more, it is currently impossible to separate symmetry parts in the staging list to separate stages.\u00A0 This makes the standard method of doing asparagus staging very difficult.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are my unique grips with the current state of the KSP2 UI.\u00A0 There are many other areas of potential improvements like the font choice being terrible, and the 8 bit theme to icons, and calculator like dot matrix backgrounds behind texts and numbers, etc.\u00A0 But these are all things that others have also mentioned many times so I see no need in going into detail on them as the Dev team is hopefully already aware of these opportunities for improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-28T15:49:51Z\u0022 title=\u002201/28/2024 03:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 28\u0022\u003EJanuary 28\u003C/time\u003E by DrCHIVES\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-28T10:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224362588\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022223308\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221706423726\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022220584\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DrCHIVES\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 hours ago, DrCHIVES said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo me, it doesn\u0027t make sense why the Devs would change something from KSP1 to KSP2 for the simple reason of change for change\u0027s sake.\u00A0 As a player of KSP1 since 2012, it was immediately noticable in KSP2 the first time I went to build a rocket that the camera controls were different.\u00A0 This was very frustrating.\u00A0 as mentioned before, 60-80% of time is spent in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 I\u0027ve got over 2K hours in KSP1 spanning 12 years.\u00A0 all of a sudden, subconscious second nature actions don\u0027t have the expected results is just hard to break out of.\u00A0 At least maybe make it an option to use Legacy camera \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E controls?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou forgot about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E.
