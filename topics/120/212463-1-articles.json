It helps me know if I\u0027m going to be passing in front of it, or behind it, which helps with gravity assists. When I try to focus the Mun for example, it doesn\u0027t show me the trajectory line, it just shows me that I\u0027m going to be passing through its sphere of influence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T22:17:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nApparently, according to \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112420-shadowzone/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022112420\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112420-shadowzone/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@ShadowZone\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s latest video, this is going to be fixed very soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"neilcomara","CreatedById":182529,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T05:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPhew thank god lmao\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
