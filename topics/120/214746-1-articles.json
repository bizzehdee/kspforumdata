(i picked that since it probably would speed up development since i doubt its easy to implement and its probably also not the first thing most people would try)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\na reduced scale probably could also help with getting 1.0 out sooner, get sales sooner and have a price point at which more people would be willing to buy and would expect less from EA? (i am sure ppl would be way less negative if the price was similar to other EA games in a similar state - so for exmaple 30 USD in EA)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Community Interaction:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nin general there need to be more clear and condensed channels for news about the game etc. - as it is now it feels like information is all over the place - a lot of it in a locked service (Discord) not visible to many and mostly having lots of users because ppl simply join a server and auto join whenever they are online doing someting else in Discord (i also think that Discord is awful for deeper community interaction and presenting information since verything is hidden from the public internet and everything within Discord just gets chaotic the more users join)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\ndo a Q\u0026amp;A with handpicked questions - just make a thread for people to ask questions take some and try to answer them officially?
