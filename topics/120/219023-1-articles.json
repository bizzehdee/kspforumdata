I also have craft already landed or in orbit around these bodies. When I am zoomed out in map view and I go to right-click on a planet to either focus it or set it as target (if not already focused), the right-click menu that pops up is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0for a craft in that \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, not the planet itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEg if Jool is not focused and I right-click on it to set as target (especially while zoomed way out), then even while hovering the cursor as it shows \u201CJool\u201D under the cursor, the right-click will always open for one of my craft in Jool orbitinstead (ie focus on that craft or set as target). So what I have to do is focus on the craft, zoom all the way into it until I can see Jool itself rather than the icon for it, then right click on Jool to finally set it as target, then zoom all the way out to plan my manoeuvre node. It\u2019s more cumbersome than it should be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just think that if you\u2019re zoomed out in map view to see ie the whole Kerbol system, then if you right click on any celestial body, it should always prioritise the body itself, not the craft in that system. I don\u2019t see why it should prioritise craft. I hope that makes sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-27T16:34:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think when you are zoomed out and right click a body it should give a pop up menu with first the body (with focus ans set target) and under it the moon(s) of that body\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigwhitey95","CreatedById":230373,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-09T05:56:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for the late reply, I kind of like that idea a lot actually.
