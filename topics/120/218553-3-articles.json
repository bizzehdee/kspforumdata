This is one of the advantages of deliberately leaving much of KSP\u0027s story undefined. This is another subtle disadvantage to getting into the money piece because however its structured it tells players what kind of organization they are rather than leaving that to their imagination. To me KSP is first and foremost an engineering sim, not a financial sim. I would argue thats the same reason it shouldn\u0027t bog players down too much in social management at colonies. A way to think of it is that as the player you are not the director of NASA. The director has a lot of boring jobs cajoling politicians and scrabbling for funding and weighing in on personnel and vendor decisions. You\u0027re more like the chief engineer and flight director. Your job is to \u003Cem\u003Ebuild\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Efly\u003C/em\u003E.

Bottlenecks are a potential pitfall for players, but they should always be given the tools to avoid them if they play their cards right. The really cool thing about KSP2 is that they\u0027ve talked about having different resources that are more or less available on different planets, so collecting what you need and making the best of what you find is a dynamic part of the game. It\u0027s not inevitable that you\u0027ll run into a bottleneck for Uranium. You could either go to a place that has Uranium and transport it to where you need or find some other non-nuclear solution for energy production. You might find that Minmus is high in a resource that can be converted easily into Methalox but the Mun is high in He3 and investing more heavily in bases on one or the other would shape the kind of program you develop. I don\u0027t think that kind of resource juggling, leapfrogging, and creatively living off the land should ever really stop, right up to developing late tier antimatter engines (or who knows what) in other star systems.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-07T23:33:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/07/2023 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 7\u0022\u003EAugust 7, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-08T01:42:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you say\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224309843\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218553\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691451172\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a game designer you\u0027re not purposefully creating unavoidable bottlenecks.

The \u003Cem\u003Epotential\u003C/em\u003E for being bottlenecked is solid motivator for players, and players will look to preempt or overcome it. There\u0027s a difference here though in what you\u0027re describing. What you don\u0027t normally see in games is a part or gamepiece suddenly changing its resource cost midway through the progression. You don\u0027t normally have a house cost 10 wood and then later that \u003Cem\u003Eexact same house\u003C/em\u003E costs 12 metal and 15 stone.

In my mind the goal of a good game is to take the simplest possible set of rules to produce the largest possible set of effective, creative solutions. Think of that as like a bang-for-buck ratio. Chess has incredibly simple rules but a nearly infinite possible gamespace. We already know that KSP2 intends to use a resource system from the late-early/ early-mid game on. If you\u0027re adding a wildly different set of rules on top of the resource system that only increases total system complexity. If all those finantial-sim rules are only applicable in the early game are they really paying for themselves in terms of actual player experience over the course of play? It seems to me like a very low bang-for-buck proposition.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224309870\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218553\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691458928\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201273\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skorj\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Skorj said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, in theory you could have multiple paths past a given stage in the game involving a choice of different resources, but that\u0027s just a lot more dev work to get to the same place.\u00A0 \u003Cstrong\u003EOne of those resources will be the most efficient path, and most people will do that and ignore the rest: that\u0027s just how most people play games these days.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I have a tank of something that slowly filled that limited my ability to do the fun part of the game, I would immediately assume my goal was to make that fill up faster, to get an unlimited supply of it.\u00A0 I\u0027d be looking for a way to build more mines, because in the language of games you just told me that was my goal.\u00A0 I just don\u0027t see how that would make sense to accomplish by getting my first Kerbal out of the atmosphere, or demonstrating my mastery of orbital rendezvous and docking, or any of the key early game \u0022learn to rocket\u0022 goals.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay a couple of things, and this may just be a difference in theory about what makes a game \u0027good\u0027. I don\u0027t think largely linear, rote, grind-for-reward gameplay is good, though yes many, many current games rely on gnawing at players\u0027 reward/dopamine response exactly in this way. Thats what\u0027s so important about game balance and allowing room for creative solutions. Stardew Valley is in some ways just a cutesy-bootsie farming game, but the specific balance between different crops is incredibly well tuned to ensure that its not the \u0022MAKE BLUEBERRIES\u0022 game. In my mind good games aren\u0027t about grinding through bottlenecks. It\u0027s about creating a dynamic set of strategic forks and potential synergies. Strategic forks are moments in gameplay where players have a choice: \u003Cem\u003E\u0022I can pursue this path and get X or I could pursue another path and get Y.\u0022\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EHold this in your mind as distinct from \u003Cem\u003E\u0022I can pursue this path and get X or I can pursue another path and get 10X\u0022\u003C/em\u003E. That latter methodology is fine in doses, but it doesn\u0027t give players real agency or true creative licence because as you point out all players will trend toward 10X. This is the problem with singular, infinitely transferable and therefore reductive resources like money.\u00A0\u00A0It\u0027s also kind of what I was getting at about Chess and large gamespaces. If instead of straight min-maxing you can create a number of strategic forks suddenly the possible creative solutions to success starts to multiply and then grow exponentially. In terms of KSP this would mean choices like investing in \u003Cem\u003Ebigger\u003C/em\u003E rockets vs investing in \u003Cem\u003Ebetter\u003C/em\u003E rockets. Players might choose to invest more in probes or devote more energy to crewed exploration. Those previous choices might sway them to unlock more tech related to Xenon or instead pursue H2 infrastructure. That decision might be guided by what resources they happen to find on Minmus or the Mun. To your point in your last paragraph one of those critical decision points could be to invest more in developing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E or instead devoting energy toward off-world \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E*. None of these choices need be exclusive or cut off the chance to change course if you changed your mind, but each tech unlock should really get players thinking about what they\u0027re most interested in\u00A0 doing and exploring next \u003Cem\u003Eand\u003C/em\u003E long term.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe next thing to think about are \u003Cem\u003Esynergies\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Synergies are potential focal points where cleverly combining a few different efforts results in a whole greater than the sum of parts. What could that mean in KSP2? It could be a simple as investing early in probes, xenon engines, and scanning, allowing a player to rapidly send out probes and assess as many worlds as possible for potential resource opportunities. Or it could mean moving from Methalox to H2 to He3 and skipping nuclear tech entirely to quickly get fleet of highly efficient fusion tugboats moving material around the Kerbolar system. Another player might instead go for Orion style propulsion and then parlay that tech and uranium harvesting investment directly into nuclear salt water engines. None of these solutions would be \u003Cem\u003Ewrong\u003C/em\u003E. They\u0027d just be different, clever paths to efficiently maximize your ability to move through space all based on what you happened to find and what you as a player \u003Cem\u003Echose\u003C/em\u003E to do with what you found.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n*To this last point there is one very critical thing to understand about the advantage of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E vs big-giant launches from Kerbin:\u003Cem\u003E gravity wells.\u00A0\u003C/em\u003EIf KSP2 could teach players one new thing that they wouldn\u0027t get anywhere else it\u0027s the power of gravity wells.

But I think this is a misunderstanding of the intended KSP audience. In my mind, the core KSP player is one who relishes in an interesting challenge. To reference another forum thread, many KSP players like the Lego philosophy for making fuel tanks as opposed to procedural tanks like those in Juno because it is a way of imposing structural constraints (though they don\u2019t want the fail state to be comical bending of the rocket). When I was an inexperienced player, I enjoyed having to accomplish increasingly difficult mission parameters with primitive Kerbal technology. I often set my sights too high and failed, but every now and then I did something like landing on the Mun with several fewer tech nodes than one might think they need. However, this type of challenge goes away pretty early in the stock science mode with default multipliers. You can easily unlock a huge fraction of the tech tree in the Kerbin system without the use of labs or without my completionist/perfectionist mission designs. KSP 2 can do better in this regard, and I think that available tech is a good constraint in the early game, because it also mirrors humanity\u2019s current state wrt. space exploration, which may one day give way to a resource constraint in real life. KSP 2 could mirror that progression without the tedium of funds and contracts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-08T15:33:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI definitely agree with the \u201C\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is at the bottom of a gravity well\u201D thing and think it should be emphasized.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking, for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, instead of having slowly-filling resource pools, why not have your contracts/science/whatever allow you to buy those resources?

There\u0027s a go-to argument against, and I think it\u0027s a good argument. Some players are going to want to play each mission all the way through to its destination sequentially and other players are going to want to send out a dozen or more missions simultaneously and juggle in between them. Depending on how you structure your time-based rewards and costs you\u0027re very likely to put a finger on the scale toward one or the other tendency because sequential missions are going to gobble up way, way more global clock time than running lots of things concurrently. I think this is part of the reason Chris Adderley is vehemently against stock LS, though maybe his opposition is more about punishing gameplay than time based mechanics. If he does an AMA I\u0027d love to know his thoughts on this. (I think he\u0027s wrong about LS in this instance, but that\u0027s a topic for another day.) The argument for time-based mechanics is more complicated because you have to sketch out a paradigm in which there are both rewards and costs to time-warping that balance themselves out in a way that allows for a broad swath of playstyles. I think this is tricky but not impossible, and the rewards in terms of depth of gameplay could absolutely be worth it if done well (and yes I think LS could be a key tool in this pursuit and omitting it would be a mistake.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027ll probably double back on LS so we\u0027ll put a pin in that. In regards to how resources are handled at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E my feeling is that resources should refill at a steady rate and then cap, and both the rate and the cap could be upgraded together. Or maybe it\u0027s just the cap that\u0027s upgradeable? Regex is right that a refresh/turnaround time that that\u0027s sensible for KSOI is going to be way too fast compared to interplanetary missions. There\u0027s a real gameplay risk here that players will naturally get bogged down building and building in KSOI rather than expand to other planets because not maximizing every minute and every kg of generated fuel is going to induce FOMO. I\u0027d be tempted to carefully scale Kerbin\u0027s resource generation rate to let players meet some of those key early launch windows to Duna, Moho, \u002B Jool, but I think the Sequential vs Simultaneous problem is going to make this untenable long term. Maybe it\u0027s still a good metric for the early game though? At some point I think you want players to get pretty comfortable just ensuring that their colony products are in the black and will rapidly cap and not worry so much about time warping for long stretches with full tanks. As a player you should have superseding drivers like science, tech unlocks, and boom events driving higher populations that push you to explore further and further and not sweat topped-off tanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-08-09T17:11:13Z\u0022 title=\u002208/09/2023 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Aug 9\u0022\u003EAugust 9, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-09T03:51:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224310041\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218553\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221691512433\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022225683\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022VlonaldKerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n10 hours ago, VlonaldKerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially, without funds, I\u2019m looking for a constraint that prevents players from simply launching many, many supply missions from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, even though it\u2019s \u201Cinefficient.\u201D If not funds, what is it not using efficiently?

Let\u0027s look at this under the assumption that either KSP2 doesn\u0027t apply time-based costs or that the costs are manageable by the player (*cough*cough*LS*cough*). If players can time-warp at will the overall game clock doesn\u0027t really matter so much. The exception to a certain degree would be launch windows but players might want to just fast-forward to those too. If thats the case all that really matters is player time--how long are you physically looking at the screen to accomplish the things you want.

When you do a supply run the game knows where you started and where you ended, and it knows what resources you started with and what resources you ended with. Any resources lost along the way, either fuel spent or stages dropped would just become part of the cost each time the supply route was re-run. So for instance I\u0027ve built a rocket with 2 expendable stages to deliver 2 tons of Uranium to the surface of the Mun. At \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E the vessel costs 60t of methalox, 20t of metals, and 2t of Uranium.

If you chose the first option any repeat run would cost 60t of methalox, 20t of metals, and 2t of Uranium at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and deposit 2t of Uranium at your Mun colony. You could also probably recover the scrapped value of your delivery stage--say 75% of 6t or an additional 4.5t of metals at the destination. If instead you refuel and fly your delivery stage back to Kerbin the cost at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E will be 60t of methalox, \u003Cem\u003E14\u003C/em\u003E tons of metals, and 2t of Uranium. At your Mun colony you\u0027d receive the 2t of Uranium but be deducted the 8t of fuel you added to fly the stage back to Kerbin.

I think you could do a demonstration run of just your first stage: fly it up to 30km, turn it around and land it near \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. Then that subcomponent would be rated up to 30km and when you re-used it on future missions it would be considered recovered if you dropped it anywhere below its max altitude.

When you do a supply run the game knows where you started and where you ended, and it knows what resources you started with and what resources you ended with. Any resources lost along the way, either fuel spent or stages dropped would just become part of the cost each time the supply route was re-run. So for instance I\u0027ve built a rocket with 2 expendable stages to deliver 2 tons of Uranium to the surface of the Mun. At \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E the vessel costs 60t of methalox, 20t of metals, and 2t of Uranium. Your start the run, drop your stages, and arrive at your Mun Colony. Here you could have a choice: save the run as a one-way delivery \u003Cem\u003Eor\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0refuel your vessel, fly it back to kerbin and recover it. If you chose the first option any repeat run would cost 60t of methalox, 20t of metals, and 2t of Uranium at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and deposit 2t of Uranium at your Mun colony. You could also probably recover the scrapped value of your delivery stage--say 75% of 6t or an additional 4.5t of metals at the destination. If instead you refuel and fly your delivery stage back to Kerbin the cost at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E will be 60t of methalox, \u003Cem\u003E14\u003C/em\u003E tons of metals, and 2t of Uranium. At your Mun colony you\u0027d receive the 2t of Uranium but be deducted the 8t of fuel you added to fly the stage back to Kerbin. If on the other hand you made a fancy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that flys all the way from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E to your colony on the Mun and back on repeat supply runs you\u0027d \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E be charged for the fuel you spent, not for the metals that went into building it\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this is a good idea, but there is one issue in my mind, and it boils down to launching ships and using resources to build them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe KSP 2 devs said that they intend the game to play most similarly to science mode. If it requires metal, methalox to build/fuel rockets, then you could reach a fail state where you run out of those. Or, maybe there\u2019s automatic resource collection on kerbin, but then the player would just be timewarping until their reserves are full. Either way, it\u2019s either not a very rewarding gameplay loop or an outright fail state which I would be okay with, but many others, including the devs, are not.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis issue of whether or not the player can build unlimited rockets is a fundamental one. It is especially important when it comes to automation, because with no restrictions imposed the player could automate 1000 supply launches a day from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. It\u2019s also an issue that the playerbase doesn\u2019t really know how to solve, I think, as you still see some people saying that rocket parts and fuel should be unlimited on Kerbin. So I\u2019m interested in brainstorming, for sure. Maybe it warrants its own thread.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
