Like many people on other communities stating they want a game to just use up more cores for better performance don\u0027t seem to understand that you can\u0027t simply distribute every calculation on all the cores to get more FPS. A graphics card sure is similar on that argumentation and sometimes the graphics alone isn\u0027t even the root problem. Because a code piece by itself can be a limitation too.

I think having potato setting would help,\u00A0 ie making textures very low and making water non-reflective. unless I am missing something this should be easy enough. even if it is under a warning that it might not work.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
