Just to have the vertical clearance alone, never mind weight. But each\u00A0Wallaby literally weighs a ton. The next smallest landing gear, the Wombat, only weighs a tenth of a ton, and only appears to be about half the size? Maybe a third? Accounting for the square cubed law, technically being a ton might make sense scientifically. except that the Wallaby is not a solid mass. It\u0027s mostly an empty casing for a still fairly skeletal leg.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nArguably more importantly, from a pure gameplay point of view, it makes me just not want to use what is kind of a critical piece of the game. At it\u0027s current mass the\u00A0Wallaby always loses the cost benefit analysis for me. I\u0027ll always just fiddle with adding more\u00A0Wombats and figuring out how to get them low enough to protect the engine then ever use the\u00A0Wallaby in it\u0027s current state.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"betaking","CreatedById":58281,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-15T19:55:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthey need to add procedural/adjustable landing gear, something that can \u0022stretch\u0022;\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthere should obviously be some limits, it shouldn\u0027t just be \u0022one type of landing gear\u0022, rather multiple procedural models differentiated by \u0022optimal size\u0022/\u0022sweet spot\u0022;\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-15T20:07:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe problem isn\u0027t the Wallaby, it\u0027s clearly oriented at heavy craft.

They\u0027re categorized by thrust and how they perform in vacuum vs atmosphere. There ARE obvious types of landing gear though, and none of them have the aerodynamic profile you want for reusable boosters. The Wallaby is massive and its shell has an angular profile. Meant for vacuum use for ships that would overstress smaller gear. The next smaller gears from the Wallaby are also meant for vacuum use judging from the lack of aerodynamic shell or profile, and realistically probably would crumple under a Falcon 9 sized booster. So the problem isn\u0027t people not being creative.
