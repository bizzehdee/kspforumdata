One thing that was missing in it, however, is to fine tune its position on the current trajectory. So every time a player plots an interplanetary burn, if he/she wants to slide MN a wee bit to the left/right, it has to zoom back to MN in and out constantly, because when you zoom out, a slight mouse drag produces a huge change.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdd additional two buttons that on click (mouse scroll) move the MN 5 seconds/minutes/whatever to the left or right, to make plotting burns easier. With options to adjust for how much time and in which unit of measure...
