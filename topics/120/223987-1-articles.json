I would also like to see things like ranches or small house in the more remote areas, as well as communication dishes scattered around, like in KSP1 (but with a better model than in KSP1).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso,\u00A0 I would like\u00A0a rover launch in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E with different types of terrain to test rovers on; maybe in the northwestern corner because that part is kind of empty.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bingmao","CreatedById":186983,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-07T04:45:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love your idea for the test terrains!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be really cool to have some testing facilities with different ground material and slopes like at\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/facilities/slope-lab/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENASA \u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-07T07:30:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCities and city light are cool, but something after the roadmap is completed and the game performes well.
