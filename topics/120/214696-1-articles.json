And the maneuver tool is a planning tool. Pausing the game allows for more planning. There\u0027s no reason to penalize the player. Other UI works just fine when paused. You can switch back and forth between map and camera. You can choose a target. You can toggle various controls on the ship, such as whether reaction wheels are enabled. So why single that one thing out and make it not work? It makes no sense.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe game is not about \u0022doing things \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ereally fast\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E and if you\u0027re not fast enough, you get a penalty.\u0022 This is not a twitch-reflexes game. Forcing the clock to run while you\u0027re figuring out your maneuver nodes is making it into a hurry-up game. For a game that\u0027s about thinking things through, how does taking away time to think help the player or make it more fun to play?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoing so would just make the game more of an ordeal without actually adding to the challenge. \u0022Challenge\u0022 in KSP is generally about thinking through more difficult problems (of orbital mechanics, engineering, aerodynamics, mechanical design, etc.) It\u0027s not about rushing the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also think it would lead to a poor initial user experience. If a user is new to the game, it\u0027s going to take them some time to figure out how to even work that UI. Giving them an experience where \u0022you\u0027ll die if you don\u0027t figure this out this complicated UI in the next 45 seconds\u0022 doesn\u0027t seem like it would make them want to come back to the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255193\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214696\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678318846\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210190\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Davidian1024\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/8/2023 at 6:40 PM, Davidian1024 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree that it makes sense a difficulty toggle.\u00A0 But \u0022use while paused\u0022 should be the default.\u00A0 \u0022Can\u0027t use while pause\u0022 should be part of an optional more challenging difficulty level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally, I\u0027m against it as a game option, even if the default is \u0022can use when paused\u0022. Rationale: Features are not free. UI complexity is not free. Any feature added is additional time that some dev is going to have to spend implementing, instead of implementing something else. Every extra bit of complexity added to to the UI is a learning-curve tax that introduces clutter and makes everything else incrementally harder to find. I\u0027m in favor of having options that are important and meaningful and really need to be there, but this doesn\u0027t feel to me like it meets that bar. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s worth the complexity that it would add to the UI, and I\u0027d rather the devs be working on something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short: I think they should just make it work the way the rest of the UI works, and therefore the way the player will expect it to work. Allowing interaction while paused is a useful quality-of-life feature for users, improves consistency, and in no way diminishes the real challenges that are at the heart of KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255234\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214696\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678325694\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022100188\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vallius\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/8/2023 at 8:34 PM, Vallius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought I heard somewhere in one of the KSP2 ESA preview videos\u00A0 that the devs actually meant for us to be able to do maneuver nodes while paused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat would make sense to me.
