But the maneuver nodes need some serious love, they are worse than in KSP 1 and much worse than if you used a maneuver node mod.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease consider the following:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI need to be able to see my post-maneuver node orbital characteristics at a glance\u003Cstrong\u003E without\u003C/strong\u003E having to deselect the maneuver node.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt\u0027s especially unreadable when trying to intercept another celestial body like the Mun. Please give my trajectory relative to the other body not Kerbin. Maybe there is some way to switch between various patched conics like in KSP 1, but if so it is hard to find and relative to the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E should be the default.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThose blue glowing circles showing where you cross into the sphere of influence are a nice graphic effect, but insufficient to plan trajectory.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt would be nice to see the burn time before you start your burn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWish-list:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlease have post-maneuver apoapsis and\u00A0periapsis clearly\u00A0visible at \u003Cstrong\u003Eall times\u003C/strong\u003E. Including numbers. Show the ones for the target if you plan an intercept and the one for the current body if your node is not leading to a change in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. Add a setting to also show other parameters like inclination or eccentricity, but just apoapsis and periapsis are fine for the start.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlease allow me to enter exact numbers for the nodes like you could with a maneuver node mod in KSP 1.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAllow me to precisely put my node on the apoapsis, periapsis, ascending node, etc. I don\u0027t want to eyeball to have to eyeball that.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFor orbital lines of bodies please show me the direction as in KSP using the color strength. We currently have it for your vessel, but not e.g. the Mun.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skorj","CreatedById":201273,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T18:21:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, please all of this.\u00A0 The absence of patched conics - how did that ship?\u00A0 And I\u0027m still chuckling that the \u0022Burn Time\u0022 box doesn\u0027t show burn time.\u00A0 Jeb\u0027s been coding again - we told him to stick to flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAbaddon","CreatedById":192494,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-24T18:25:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224240310\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022212329\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677262908\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022201273\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Skorj\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, Skorj said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, please all of this.\u00A0 The absence of patched conics - how did that ship?\u00A0 And I\u0027m still chuckling that the \u0022Burn Time\u0022 box doesn\u0027t show burn time.\u00A0 Jeb\u0027s been coding again - we told him to stick to flying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechnically there are patched conics, it is just that they seem to stuck in what used to be mode 3 in KSP 1.
