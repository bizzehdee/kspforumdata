On one hand I agree it would give us a lot more freedom to build, and use less parts to do so in cases where the existing parts aren\u0027t as big as we\u0027d like. On the other hand it can somewhat lead to choice paralysis and more confusion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike right now with the engines, each engine has a clear role, so it\u0027s like a multiple choice puzzle game picking the correct engine for each stage.

I say this having enough extensive experience with the mod to know youre wrong. The mod has infinite shapes (regardless if you use egg or conic shaped) that INSTANTLY form to a shape that fits your payload. It has multiple symmetry settings the same as regular symmetry mode. Place a fairing base, choose the number of fairing sections ie 2 or 4 as just an example, choose if you want a conic or egg shaped fairing and take that fairing nub and drop it onto a node and bam instant fairing. Done and dusted. Need to alter the payload? Shape/size change? Instant adaptability. No faffing about with multiple layers. 1 fairing nub onto 1 node and youre done. The only limitation is you. The stock \u201Cfairings\u201D do not have this ease or speed or adaptability.

Even (my opinion on the craft in the \u201Cthumb nail\u201D in your example) that hideous monstrosity falls into the egg side, if a bit pointed. The reason this is true is aerodynamics. Your fairing no matter how (im so not talking about interstage here, but if you insist, Procedural Fairings made them as simple as simple gets, but we are talking top of rocket so back on track) fat or thin, ALL will be either conic or egg, only differences will be just how anemic or obese the fairing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n034303022023\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T09:54:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022148094\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed1082475908\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/116807-stock-super-compact-bearing-made-from-fairings/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rpatto92","CreatedById":145732,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-12T22:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224248255\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213850\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677637720\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022188807\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022TechDragon\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/1/2023 at 2:28 AM, TechDragon said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think were missing a couple of obvious procedural parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProcedural flat panel\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWings are not a substitute, they are curved and look wrong, I like making rover bodies from the neat flat panel parts, but it would be a billion times easier with procedural ones, using procedural wings in KSP1 worked because you could make them flat, you cannot make the KSP2 wings look\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eflat\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nProcedural fuel tanks\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGiven differentiation of the designs, might be best to avoid the sort of all in one procedural tank stuff that we got from KSP1 mods, and to just give us a procedural tank per fuel type, so that the existing look and feel of each fuel\u0027s tank style can be maintained.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t like procedural parts to expand infinitely into other categories such as engines or pod/pits but if you\u0027re going to do fuel tanks.
