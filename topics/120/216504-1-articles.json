I know there are a lot of negative posts out there but those are I believe a vocal minority. The performance optimizations are a huge step in the right direction, as are the other fixes.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni suggest continuing in the same direction. I think performance and optimization still have a fair ways to go, including when a ship has multiple engines. This is a major bottleneck right now and will need to be fixed before the game can progress. Also other obvious optimizations.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthanks for all your hard work!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"twich22","CreatedById":110030,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-17T03:56:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter spending more time playing patch 2 I have decided the game is now roughly equivalent to very early KSP 1. The game is playable but there are frequent game breaking bugs.
