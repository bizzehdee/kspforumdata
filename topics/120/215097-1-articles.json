Basically, I would frequently not quite have enough fuel to make it back to Kerbin, but also didn\u2019t have any docking ports to transfer fuel because that wasn\u2019t supposed to be part of the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I would frequently fly a fuel truck out to the stranded ship and have a kerbal get out and hook up the hose like a ye-old-full-service gas station, and refuel the ship, allowing it to fly back home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEspecially considering that base building n\u2019 such will eventually be a part of KSP 2 I think this would be a really cool feature to have stock. Allowing kerbals to walk up to gas stations that mine and process their own fuel, and treat them like gas stations for rovers and space craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
