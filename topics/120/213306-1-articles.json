It feels clunky and inaccurate to try and click where you think it will be on your trajectory. It would be nice to have the game automatically take you as close to that point as possible with just a button click. Moving to apoapsis and periapsis is such a common maneuver that having an easy \u0022Warp to Periapsis\u0022 or \u0022Warp to Apoapsis\u0022\u00A0 function would be a great time saver and QoL feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
