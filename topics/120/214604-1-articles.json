I have seen a lot of people make planes with lift and mass close together and initially stable to later find after burning some gas the aircraft becomes unstable and crashes due to a change in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E. Having a tick box to see the dry \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E means you could place fuel tanks and adjust their loads to try keep the movement of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E to a minimum which is vital to good aircraft design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis feature could also be usefull for placing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters as keeping them close to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and understanding how it will change as fuel is burned.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nJust my two cents but think it would be a valuable addition\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chris_The_Crafter","CreatedById":227910,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-17T20:06:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, this is something we badly need.
