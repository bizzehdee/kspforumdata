I know that this is early access and do not expect it to blow KSP1 out of the water right away. But my hope is that the following observations will result in fixes thereof.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#c0392b;\u0022\u003ENOTE: This list is only stuff I have just experienced, but am certain that this is hardly conclusive.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNo launcher.
