This one is already beginning to annoy me in the Tracking Station, where someone (like me) has a lot of satellites that I launched from a mothership with no way to name them. Returning the re-naming feature would be a\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0LOT of help and de-clutter my object list.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- More vessel types. As I said, making satellites is already annoying, and that is not helped by the lack of filtering. The only options we really have are vessels and debris, and I\u0027d like some more customisation to my map screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- A transfer window planner. Like in KSP1, this was invaluable to me and others, so seeing its return would be amazing. Places like Moho, Dres or Eeloo are nigh-impossible to get to without one, thus having this back would save new players\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0a headache.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Mouse sensitivity in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E. A controllable slider for how sensitive it is, mainly for the middle mouse button so I don\u0027t have to feel like I\u0027m dragging a weight to go around to the other half of my craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Fairing see-through. The way the feature currently works is annoying, and the button never seems to want to work so I can\u0027t place struts before building fairings. Reverting to the way KSP1 deals with this seems more intuitive.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E predictions. I would like it if there was a way to see the PE of an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E you\u0027re entering, rather than having to blindly go through on the map screen.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Right-click keeps info. This feature from KSP1 was nice to have, and being able to make fine adjustments to manuevers while seeing those info readouts was eternally helpful on mid-course correction burns.\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Seeing fuel in the parts menu. I\u0027d like to see this, as sometimes it\u0027s needed for debugging spacecraft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks you so much, this game is amazing and looks promising!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
