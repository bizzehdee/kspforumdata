It doesn\u2019t impact gameplay much either way, so why not choose the option that is generally going to be expected by people?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere currently also isn\u2019t actually a pause time button. If you\u2019re warping you have to stop warp with / then lower it one more step to stop, or just spam the slow time key. so maybe just a single button pause time key would be a good addition too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-27T11:42:37Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2023 11:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Rodger\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baleine","CreatedById":131757,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T12:46:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224245638\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022213542\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221677491180\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153575\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Rodger\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, Rodger said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not in the bug report forum, but the suggestion/feedback forum\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh, I\u0027m sorry.
