I know you could use probes and not care about it but I think it would be cool if in multiplayer you and a friend could control a vessel at the same time and be assigned different vessels after separation. This is kind of just an idea I had and I hope the devs have thought about this. I also think if this was a feature we should be able to have a \u0022friend cam\u0022 that we can open, if a friend on the server allows it you can watch their craft from in game. It would open like a menu and it could just have a little screen that has capture cam on their craft, you can move the camera in the screen to your liking maybe. This would be cool because if we were working together for a stratolaunch I would love to watch them fly the rocket while I\u0027m landing the plane. Again just an idea and I know multiplayer is probably still 2-2.5 years away. also I realize that a friend cam might be rough on performance but hopefully by then they get to a point where they can handle that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flush Foot","CreatedById":193460,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-10T17:32:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuh... interesting!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have literally no idea how they\u0027d put two people \u0022in command\u0022 of the same [initially] vessel, but maybe if \u0027their\u0027 agency\u0027s crew was in a commandable craft that splits off from the main vessel, they\u0027d gain control over it...\u003Cbr\u003E\nSame \u0022problem\u0022 exists with docking your ship to a friend\u0027s station / base (who has control over what upon docking?), so it\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0something they\u0027ll have to figure out\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the stratolaunch was via dropping the payload like a bomb / missile, whatever \u0022docking to a station\u0022 logic they come up with could work if the crafts are launched separately on the ground but docked together before liftoff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Presto200","CreatedById":232857,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-10T18:06:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224379049\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224404\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221712770376\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022193460\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Flush Foot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n31 minutes ago, Flush Foot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuh... interesting!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have literally no idea how they\u0027d put two people \u0022in command\u0022 of the same [initially] vessel, but maybe if \u0027their\u0027 agency\u0027s crew was in a commandable craft that splits off from the main vessel, they\u0027d gain control over it...\u003Cbr\u003E\nSame \u0022problem\u0022 exists with docking your ship to a friend\u0027s station / base (who has control over what upon docking?), so it\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eis\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0something they\u0027ll have to figure out\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the stratolaunch was via dropping the payload like a bomb / missile, whatever \u0022docking to a station\u0022 logic they come up with could work if the crafts are launched separately on the ground but docked together before liftoff\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLots to think about, I guess we\u0027ll just get more information when we\u0027re closer to it. I play video games with my sister and if we are playing multiplayer KSP she would probably rather be doing something together rather than having 2 separate space agency\u0027s or separate missions. So this type of functionality would be important to me so that she could have fun getting into the game (KSP is not necessarily her cup of tea as far as singleplayer goes but she says she is excited to play with me when multiplayer comes)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
