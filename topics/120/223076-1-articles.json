It\u0027s possible - every one has their taste and imagination - but do you think building a rover out of the first rover wheel unlock, grumble seat, XS trusses (which seem the most matching size to the wheels) plus lamps and decoupler (because you have to deploy it somehow, and decouplers are what the player knows from the start) is that? I mean, I\u0027m not misusing the parts here, right?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-19T08:41:02Z\u0022 title=\u002201/19/2024 08:41  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 19\u0022\u003EJanuary 19\u003C/time\u003E by DailyFrankPeter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-19T11:28:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRovering needs better sounds.

The wheel friction feels wrong, the sliding around feels wrong, the centre of gravity is wrong, there are issues with the springs as per my bug report, as well as the other bigs mentioned. However, this is early access so yes it\u0027s frustrating to have the bugs, but they will go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe main reason that they are a poor experience right now is the lack of things to do. Even if you get them stable at 10m/s or more, driving between biomes is an epic undertaking filled with no interest. Science is a one button one location job for the entire biome and then thats it - this could be remedied with at least multiple scans giving diminishing returns. There is also no way to find POI\u0027s other than by \u0027cheating\u0027 by getting others to tell you where they are, so using a rover to find them organically is a lucky and long slog too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf science was tweaked for rover gameplay, or POI\u0027s could be found by either Satellite scans, or even a rover based radar system, then they would have a purpose. Hopefully they won\u0027t just be used to take Kerbals between colony buildings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
