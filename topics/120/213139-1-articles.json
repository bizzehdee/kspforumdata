Such a mode would allow us to pose Kerbals in different positions, which would enable us to create interesting scenes and situations. Players would be able to place Kerbals anywhere on the spacecraft and set them in different positions, allowing us to create great photos.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, the photo mode should offer players full control over camera placement. Players should be able to choose any viewpoint to capture amazing views from any angle. This would allow us to create original and interesting photos that would certainly impress other players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a fan of Kerbal Space Program II, I would greatly appreciate the addition of such a photo mode to the game. I hope that my suggestion will be taken into consideration in future updates, allowing me to enjoy the photo mode and create amazing photos in the future.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
