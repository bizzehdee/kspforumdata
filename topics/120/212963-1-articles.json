The bug locked me onto the rocket and i could not lock onto my lander for the landing. Using instruments only i was able to safely touch down. The only way to get camera close to the ship was to send a Kerbal onto the mun. once I gained access to the lander, I was stuck under the surface of Mun. I could not get to the kerbal that was outside the lander. Sent other two kerbals same thing now stuck on ship under surface. tried saves and restarts, nothing helped.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
