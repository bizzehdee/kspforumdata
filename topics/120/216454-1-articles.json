But we\u0027re also entering a phase where small annoyances start to pop up every now and then. Before it was the timewarp window visible after turning off the UI, now it\u0027s been replaced by staging scroll bar. There\u0027s couple more like the camera setting itself to orbital on the surface, the infamous already out of fuel maneuver lock, probably more. These are things I believe that are worth a hotfix, because they\u0027re effectively making the overall experience worse, making me (us?) want to play less. And with tons of improvements in the patch, these new things are as annoying as someone showing up and poking you with a stick every 3 and a half seconds all day. It\u0027s hard to deal with them for another 3-4 weeks knowing they weren\u0027t there before.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, hotfixes for widely reported \u003Cu\u003Enew\u003C/u\u003E bugs and design errors ASAP please very much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GGG-GoodGuyGreg","CreatedById":226561,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T11:53:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey were open about patches coming on when they are ready and not on a fixed schedule.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath for hot fixes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Buzz313th","CreatedById":149043,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T14:23:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou get to choose two outa three as a customer...\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFix it...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
