I guess KSP 2 has the camera called \u0022body\u0022 - but i think if we could get a camera that looks from the PoW from any docking port we put on a craft, with the option to cycle through them if there are more. And some interface like this we are in a good spot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI also often miss a mode were i can see my velocity compared to the target (If it exist in game.. i dont know how to get it up) - I tend to get my distance and relative speed from the map.. and its a lot of cycling back and forth to finetune my approach x)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway!

It would have made it a lot easier.. since you can set the docking port as the point of control.. and the docking port you want to hit as target. and then just make sure the two markers are on top of each other. This is still a mediocre solution compared to Flight of Nova.. as, like you say, you cant see how much your angle is off on all the axis and you have to think to correct drift by moving the marker counter to the target to count for drift.. where in flight of nova, you just have arrows on all axis showing you what way you drift.
