Auto-saves are generated unconditionally, and if the user loses a craft due to (say) the explode-on-docking bug, and the user does not wish for that state to be preserved, the only way to prevent a subsequent auto-save is to load immediately. Otherwise the auto-save bucket can gradually fill up with what the user would consider \u0022useless\u0022 saves, and older \u0022valid\u0022 ones are lost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nManual saves are immune from this auto-deletion; they endure forever. This\u00A0 makes sense because the user has specifically requested that game state to be preserved.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you exit the game, it prompts you to save before exiting (I cannot capture a screenshot because I\u0027m not in Windows at the moment). This raises a question: Is this a manual save or an auto save? The answer seems to be that these saves go into the auto-save bucket, which means that even though the user has specifically thought about it and requested that game state to be preserved, it can be lost later without the user requesting it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003ESuggestions\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTreat saves created when the user clicks \u0022Save and Exit\u0022 as manually created saves, immune from auto-deletion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
