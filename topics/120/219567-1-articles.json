I got round it by setting the OLED as my primary monitor and then moving the task bar to a secondary screen. With a black background there is nothing displayed on the OLED when on the desktop. Only issue I\u0027ve found is if the TV shuts off\u00A0 through energy saving or I forget to turn it on when I boot the PC up, it moves the taskbar back to the OLED.
