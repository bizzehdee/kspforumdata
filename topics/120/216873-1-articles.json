In KSP2, you can do this, but the distances are very limited.\u00A0 Also, when offsetting parts, there are some peculiar behaviors as you get to the sliding limit, such as parts shifting vertically when you are only pulling horizontally.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI used this constantly in KSP1, and am finding it increasingly difficult to work around the new limitations as I get more ambitious/quirky in my builds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be lovely to have that same functionality from KSP1 carried over to KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocoscacao","CreatedById":225696,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-26T18:07:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is very annoying to me as well.

A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E is pointing out is that you can only offset a limited distance, which I would estimate to be about 5 meters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a trick to go beyond 5 meters:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith the offset tool, and with snap enabled, select your part and grab one of the handles.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDrag the part past the maximum distance it will go, to approximately where you want the part to be.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNow, without moving the mouse at all, disable snap by pressing C and\u00A0release left click.
