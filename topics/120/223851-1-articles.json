Which is probably perfectly realistic, it\u0027s just not super helpful when trying to spot a good landing site. So I\u0027m thinking some kind of map overlay where different altitudes show up as different colours/shades would help?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-26T10:20:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003EThat would indeed be helpful. I would love to see map overlays for in the tracking station. I was thinking about elevation (like in your comment), temperatures (great for colony planning) and a resource overlay. This could be coupled with (orbital) scanning. This would make science also have direct impact on gameplay.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
