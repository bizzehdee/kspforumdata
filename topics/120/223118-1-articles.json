I just want to drag and drop a pod with a parachute and heatshield already attached instead of assembling that by hand for the hundredth time. And it\u0027s almost as tedious and time consuming to search through my saves, find the template file and merge it into my current craft as it is to just build the ship by hand again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
