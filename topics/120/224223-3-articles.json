I\u0027ve spent a good number of hours recently simultaneously working on three things in the game that are relevant to the above bug issues. One is my Eve 10 lander, which has three large orbitally docked modules, consisting of a big nuclear orbital\u00A0 tug with the crew re-entry vessel, the lander proper, and an intermediate sky crane stage to facilitate my Eve atmospheric entry.\u00A0 The second is a swarm of 5 remote probes, each of which is targeting a different body in the Jool system, all arriving in more or less the same timeframe, and the third is my Mohole mission, which I am gradually spiraling inwards towards Moho with a series of carefully timed gravity assists and DSMs. Trying to manage all these missions concurrently has raised a number of issues for me that seem like they should be quite high on the Fix or Implement Better Right Now list. For me, in order of priority, those would be:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1)\u00A0 What gives with the comically self-censoring pop-up windows when you want to see the info about when\u00A0a given craft will reach a specific AP/PE? The default, information-less designator, e.g. \u0022Jool PE\u0022,\u00A0 is always right in front of the critical information telling you when you will arrive at that spot when you click on it.\u00A0 D\u0027ooh! And I mean, how hard can that possibly be to fix? All you need to do is change the default arrangement of those windows in the display, or enable the user to bring the desired window to the front by clicking on it.\u00A0 It\u0027s absolutely maddening if you\u0027ve got 5 different flights making maneuvers in the same time frame!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) About half the time, when I\u0027m on an escape trajectory within some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, especially when I have just put myself on one, I have to play this ridiculous cat-and-mouse game with the pop-up window for maneuver nodes, because every time I click on the orbit to open the window and try to push the \u0022Make maneuver plan\u0022 button, the window\u00A0 disappears before I can click on it. If you were actually trying to design a bug to drive players crazy, I\u0027m not sure you could do better than that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) On the same subject, the display of patched conics and the placement of maneuver nodes is just not sufficient for anybody who is trying to plan things out into the future.\u00A0 I need to be able to place nodes in my next \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and I need to see where I\u0027m going further into the future!
