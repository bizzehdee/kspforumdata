ship, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E was on \u0027a different timeline\u0027 and thought it was after I had left the Mun \u0026amp; docked.\u00A0 (Or in actuality - it has its own save state that doesn\u0027t relate to the game save I made as a player).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAll of which is a long winded way of saying - it looks like once you break a game / have the Fuel Bug appear - the entire game is broken.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to go back and turn off KSP2, start a new campaign and see what changed... and Parts Manager still does not like the fuel tanks.\u00A0 Parts Manager in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E is functional - but not on the pad.\u00A0 Built a simple craft - pod tank and engine;
