Currently I can climb 20 degree slopes at best. I\u0027d like to request to have that number doubled (40 degrees). There are several things that we have access to in the Parts Manager to help but these max values we can adjust up to is insufficient or just aren\u0027t helping. The Drive Limiter (what manages the rover\u0027s speed or torque or w/e) is the most helpful parameter to climb with when at full 100% thus needs to probably be doubled.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3: Collision mesh is like the wheels are sitting on a thin plane circle so the rest of the wheels are just clipping in the ground, please make the collision mesh match the shape of the wheels or by minimum give them a cylinder shape?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n4: Kerbals are \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

It amazed me that wherever I placed the wheels on a craft it would know which way it should steer and also when docking with another rover the wheels would once again switch settings and knew which way to steer automatically, something that has greatly improved over the original KSP so good job to whoever did that!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-05T17:43:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n30m/s is about 100km/h.
