To do this, we currently have to select the same colors over and over again, which is tedious especially when coloring something different inbetween.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving a few configurable and reusable color scheme slots would be helpful here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hecatonichosachoron","CreatedById":84257,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T19:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust the ability to see let alone input the HSV or RGB values at least.\u00A0 Also the current UI doesn\u0027t allow colours with a value of 0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kartoffelkuchen","CreatedById":108501,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T23:04:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, having the option to copy and paste a certain colour set from a part, onto another part would be great! It\u0027s very tiring to paint a certain number of parts this way, then paint some other parts in a different colour only to see that you forgot to paint some parts with the first colour. Then you have to go back and try to get that first colour again, which mostly results in having to repaint everything because you can\u0027t 100% get the previous colour again with the sliders.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vallius","CreatedById":100188,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T01:39:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nObviously, this is way less important than fixing the decoupling bug.

It would be infinitely easier to find what you are looking for instead of trying to remember the color number value of the many possible colors a user might want to save.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbalBK","CreatedById":226862,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T18:47:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll good suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing able to save \u0022favorite\u0022 colors \u0026amp; color combos, copy \u0026amp; paste colors onto other parts, being able to see the color values, etc. I\u0027ve thought all of these things every single time I\u0027m making a new craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.
