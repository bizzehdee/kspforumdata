That isn\u0027t enough to justify the amount of dev-hours that would be needed to reimplement the entire KSP1 UI in KSP2 *and* maintain two options going forward. Instead, it would be more efficient for IG to tweak the existing UIs and add one or two new window types to KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think it would be nice for IG to create a \u0022KSP\\Music\u0022 folder structure in KSP2 for people to drop custom audio into. Then the game could automatically play their chosen songs in specific situations like orbit or launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mickel","CreatedById":229590,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-24T06:34:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to admit I am rather partial to the KSP1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E tune.\u00A0 I never seem to tire of it, which is pretty uncommon for me (the only other I tolerate being W\u0026amp;R).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-24T12:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNha, this is more something mods should provide.

They\u0027re not gonna drag and drop anything directly from KSP 1 into 2, that\u0027d be redundant for no reason. If you really want that then I think you\u0027ll have to count on mods.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPersonally I think the new music is an improvement, it\u0027s contextual now and way more cinematic.
