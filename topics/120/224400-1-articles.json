I did just have a thought though that would be fun to see in game, I think that if we could explode our space ships/planes that are controlled by probe it could be fun to watch from time to time. It would be cool to get to see more explosions when I\u0027m flying because I feel like I only see them when I\u0027m crashing into a surface. I of course don\u0027t want random explosions whenever but if I decide to press that button that could itch the \u0022blow something big up\u0022 part of my brain.
