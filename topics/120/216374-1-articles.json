We could then taper a big tank or even give a long tank a cool bulge in the middle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo: There will be these tech-tree included parts:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E- Simple procedural stepped/continuous tanks:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis will be a tank that can be changed in length so that it becomes multiples of the smallest size. This is as good as the lego-approach for new players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext iteration (unlocked in the tech tree) is continuous size: You can toggle that per-part in the context menu, or globally as a default in the advanced settings per game. Now we can use a tank that is exactly 1.41 times the base size.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGive us certain endcap sizes that we can select from the context-menu or even hook certain premade versions into the parts catalog. Allow us to remove presets at a later state to unclutter the catalog.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen putting a new part onto another part, it will take over the connected endcap size to allow\u00A0 easy building.

Then we will have a \u0022build tank\u0022 option like with fairings (in KSP 1). I can then build a tank like a fairing. Make it fat, slim, give it a mid-bulge or slim waist, end it in the selected size or even allow us to taper to a tip. Of course all that while displaying the amount of selectable fuel/liquit, which will be contained in it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNew end-cap styles and sizes can be unlocked in the tech-tree.

Currently KSP 2 is just KSP 1 with a slightly larger parts catalog. There are a lot of strengths in KSP 1 that should be taken over to KSP 2, but the huge mess of parts is none.

At the same time I\u0027m somewhat partial to the lego method of being able to quickly do stepwise additions to arrive at roughly fuel needed, so I would hope a procedural tank system will allow for this to quickly put something together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSince fuel tanks tend to have many connections to other parts (like radial parts or entire booster stages attached to them), some extra care needs to be taken with any procedural tank system that resizing it doesn\u0027t create too much of the \u0022now I have to pick up every part that was attached to it and re-attach it in its proper spot\u0022-problem.

Allow players to design a hull with a specific shape and then put things in it, up to its volume limit. Crew compartments, fuel tanks, batteries, docking bay, etc. The parts you put inside the hull would be protected from drag and heat so they don\u0027t necessarily need to be simulated individually with part physics, nor would it be possible to detach them with docking and staging equipment. They also would not need to weigh as much as a separate tank with its own protective hull, since the container hull is doing that job for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-13T08:46:24Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2023 08:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Lyneira\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EGrammar\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-13T10:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224272180\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216374\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221681375498\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022149515\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lyneira\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Lyneira said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the tank shape suggestion like a fairing, I wonder if this would not be better served by expanding the scope and looking at the design a bit different.

If you ever tried putting things onto the Mk3 stuff using symmetry (in KSP1), you\u0027d know that some of the things end up floating around the surface, rather than actually being attached, while some get embedded in the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027d also make it harder to make your ship flyable.
