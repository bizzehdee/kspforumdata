Whoever thought it would be cool to keep the KSP1 wobble was wrong. It\u0027s not reasonable. Actual distortions\u00A01% this severe would destroy parts.

I do appreciate the creativity on the changes to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E camera, specifically being able to aim it at different parts is very nice. However, but moving along the length of an assembly and then around the assembly are the two movements I need most often. And my most used \u0022mice\u0022 are trackballs and touchpads. None of them can do translation easily. Allow this to be customized.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFlight Camera.
