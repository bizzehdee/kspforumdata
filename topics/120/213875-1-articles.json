Which is quite unfortunate as a start since this EA was promoted as a way for players to say what it is good, what is bad, what can be enhanced, what are the good community ideas to implement, etc, not to debug the game, but that\u0027s another story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding suggestions, ideas, feedback from players, which are not bugs, we should have some proper platform to deal with it so that we can efficiently research if something as already been said (here is okay but not perfect), upvotes things, see what are the trends, etc. And it would be so much more convenient and efficient for team instead of trying to follow the rithm of random posts, repeating each other, etc. I feel like here, topics are going to drawn pretty quickly, this is a forum, not a feedback dedicated platform to help devs and official teams. And because it\u0027s a bit unclear so far, people are posting ideas, suggestions, bug reports, everywhere on social media, forums, discord, or through the InGame error report system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah, maybe I\u0027ve missed something, but is it really officially here for everything else than bug report ?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat about using the InGame \u0022Error Report\u0022 system, which quite suggest that they want specifically \u0022error feedback\u0022 while it should have been the occasion to gather around suggestions, ideas, what we want to see InGame, what can be enhanced, rather than hunting bugs and complaining about very bad performances ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-28T10:04:16Z\u0022 title=\u002202/28/2023 10:04  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 28, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Dakitess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vl3d","CreatedById":219348,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T10:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can also send feedback through the PD launcher.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T19:10:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, this is feedback rather than bug reports.
