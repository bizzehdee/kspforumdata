I don\u0027t like that right clicking fuel tanks doesn\u0027t show fuel contents, and that a separate transfer manager needs to be used for fuel transfer. I also don\u0027t like that it isn\u0027t easy to close the parts manager. Re-right-clicking a part should close it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4. Pausing is great, but please make it keyboard-remappable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n5. On start, my custom key maps appear to not work. I have to re-open Input settings, where I see my intended maps, and click apply again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n6. At first, I thought I could do burns while timewarping, because the engine animation continued, and fuel was being used up, but then I noticed that no thrust was actually being applied. This applied even at the x2/x4 timewarps, where KSP1 allowed burns.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n7. Unlike KSP1, I can\u0027t rotate the ship during x2 and x4 timewarps. This was very useful for re-orienting massive ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n8. Landing legs were disappointingly slippery when I landed on a moderate slope. This sort of thing was a major problem in KSP1, and I\u00A0 was hoping it would be improved upon. Also, the legs\u0027 springs didn\u0027t seem well tuned. The downhill legs compressed completely, whereas it would be better if the uphill legs compressed, to keep the craft vertical.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n9.

I had a similar issue with the trajectory lines. I sent a first vessel in kerbin orbit, after going to the map view and back, I couldn\u0027t see it anymore (camera issue). Impossible to focus on it again, so it was lost. I then sent a second ship in orbit to try and do the trip, but I couldn\u0027t see its trajectory lines (only the ones of the first vessel). I actually never saw it for my second vessel so it\u0027s just in orbit (I think, according to the AP and PE points altitudes).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

BUT, changing settings from low to high and resolution from 4k to 720p didn\u0027t change a thing, still 20 FPS.
