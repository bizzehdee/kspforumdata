Right now, you can click on a pod, probe core, docking port, whatever and all the button does is flash green as you click. But after the click, there\u0027s no way to tell which part in the UI widget is the control point. Changing the button color or making the button into a toggle switch instead would indicate clearly and instantly that the part is the control point for the current vessel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
