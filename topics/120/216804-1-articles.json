Making it stronger for planes. Cause planes keep breaking apart and exploding upon spawn cause nothing is sticking together, but if I connect same parts in vertical mode that work perfectly fine.

But even in the case of rocket fuel tanks, the tanks do need to be engineered to withstand all sorts of launch stresses and vibrations too, and plenty of Kerbal spaceplane designs do incorporate, by necessity or by choice, cylindrical tanks in them. So I\u0027d rather not the game give too much special treatment to aircraft fuselage node strength.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
