This is so you can be zoomed out on the main screen showing all the orbital bodies and projected path while still being able to adjust the burn position on the current orbit with out having to keep zooming in and out.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodger","CreatedById":153575,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T07:15:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr having a node editor window instead could help with this too, so you can stay focused on the intercept and adjust the node without aiming the camera at the node itself.\u003Cbr\u003E\nPersonally I\u2019m quite used to using a node editor window mod in ksp1 (Precise Maneuver, I prefer it to the stock ksp1 node editing system which is just some small tabs at the bottom left of the screen)\u00A0and I find it very convenient doing it that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoDude","CreatedById":226797,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T12:36:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes. We defo need something to solve the issue of being able to accurately adjust manoeuvre nodes while being zoomed out, or focused on the intercept portion of the flightpath.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
