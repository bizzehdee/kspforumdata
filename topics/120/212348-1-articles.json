As on/off again fan of KSP1, I have been excitedly awaiting this release. So a big thank you from me. From time to time, I am going to try to give some constructive feedback on what I see and am thinking as I experience your game. I am working through your tutorials as I learn this game.\u00A0 Great job so far on the tutorials btw.\u00A0 I am looking forward to the addition of science and multiplayer. I know this is most likely a one way conversation with regards to feedback, but is there anything in particular you devs are interested in hearing about specifically?\u00A0 Want to try and do my part and help where I can during this development.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-24T16:36:20Z\u0022 title=\u002202/24/2023 04:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 24, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by CaptainTXS\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EIm dumb, found the CC button.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
