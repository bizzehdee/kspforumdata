It was nice to be able to do that especially for more complex missions that required gravity assists or traveled to multiple planets.\u00A0 Sadly, you\u0027re not able to do this in KSP2 due to you not being able to make a new maneuver node if your trajectory goes inside of another bodies \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E until you\u0027ve completed the maneuver you set up to intercept that planets \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E. This makes making maneuvers beyond your initial escape burn from Kerbin or any other body basically impossible. It would be nice to have this added by either patch 3 or 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BowlerHatGuy3","CreatedById":222738,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-02T00:50:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUpdate:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can still do what I described what I described in KSP2 but you need to edit the actual trajectory line rather than the line that appears in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.
