Love being in Early access and looking forward to the journey with you to this game becoming what we all hope it will be.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I listed the things I enjoyed rather than suggestions it would be 10 times as long as the list below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt would be nice if my screen resolution was supported, not a show stopper but it would be nice. Mine is 5120 x 1440\u00A0 Samsung Odyssey G9\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen trying to put struts on in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E if you dont put them on one at a time there are lots of issues, I would select 4 and it would try to put on 8 nearly all going in the wrong direction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nif you build a ship that has 4 seats, but you only seat 3 Kerbals, if you save it and load it a Kerbal will sneak into that 4th seat, We need to lock spare Kerbalnaughts in their rooms so they don\u0027t sneak on board.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe orientation of the ship changes from E/W to N/S when going from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to the Launch pad, I got around it but it was often confusing in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E knowing how it will be sitting on the pad.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt is far too easy to delete a spacecraft in flight accidently when trying to delete a node.\u00A0 ( however I did finally find that little trash can and started using that )\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI could not find a way to see how much fuel was in an attached tank, the parts manager would not display the amount of fuel left in a tank. Many of my spacecraft use drop tanks and I was having to guess when they were empty\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAfter recovering a craft, any Kerbal on board would not be available for the next mission\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWe need a way to pin certain information in the maneuver line in map mode, specifically AP \u0026amp; PE\u00A0 ( I know you folks are aware of this one, with Scott Manley, Tim Dodd, Matt Lowne\u00A0 and everyone else saying the same thing, but I wanted to reinforce that desire )\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am sure there will be more, I did a Mun Landing and return on my first day in KSP 2 and am overall quite pleased.\u00A0 It is beautiful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKeep up the good work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
