Then add/revise/remove features to meet story development, incorporate mechanics/tweaks from popular community mods, and to meet new player expectations.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA sequel should aim to create a brand new game using it\u0027s predecessor as inspiration; incorporating features from the previous game that meet the vision of this new game and leaving out features that do not meet this vision. Adjust final vision to meet player expectations.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems most people, myself included, were lead to believe KSP 2 would follow the first school of thought. What we appear to be getting though is the second school of thought; a new game meant to bring in a wider player base while attempting to maintain the feel and essence of the original.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither school of thought is really \u0022superior\u0022 as there are plenty of excellent examples of both in gaming, but I think not making it clear from the start which school of thought the devs subscribe to has caused a lot of discord, infighting, and mistrust among the playerbase. This has been exacerbated by a lack of communication, transparency, and, to some people, honesty during EA development.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think KSP 2 will still end up being a good game, but perhaps not the game many fans of the original are looking for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHit the nail on the head really. Sure there\u0027s caveats like I don\u0027t believe anything from KSP1 should be removed, but rather reworked and expanded. A sequel is supposed to be an evolution. If you turn a space sim game into a linear storyline game where you require physics and base management to get from A to B \u003Cem\u003Efor the story\u003C/em\u003E, you\u0027re not making KSP, you\u0027re making Outer Wilds with a side of base building.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP2 should\u0027ve expanded on what 1 was, making it a deeper, more challenging, more encompassing physics and management simulator \u003Cem\u003Ewhilst also fixing the challenging onboarding of new players\u003C/em\u003E which was pretty much ignored in the prequel (and even then it sold 10 times what the sequel did).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea who asked for KSP2 to be what it currently aims to be, I know it wasn\u0027t me, and as it stands now, 4.5 million of original KSP1 purchasers didn\u0027t either.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steveman0","CreatedById":64580,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-31T15:24:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not sure I agree with the conclusions here.

You don\u0027t get a bulbous 7 meter long \u0022science thing\u0022 that you have to take to space, but rather payloads are designed with mission and more importantly launcher constraints in mind and that\u0027s why we don\u0027t have two probes of the same shape unless they were purposefully twins. That\u0027s failure zero of KSP1 and 2 when they wanted to become tycoon games, a basic misunderstanding of how spaceflight works in any aspect outside astrodynamics: launchers are hard to design, they take time, you can\u0027t just make a new launcher to hurl rover-2 to Mars, you make rover-2 as close as rover-1 because rover-1 almost worked and the rocket it\u0027ll ride there is still the same.
