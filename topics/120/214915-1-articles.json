The runway lighting has a VASI-2 approach lights already which is cool. However, the line of white lights leading up to the the threshold lights should strobe towards the end of the runway, which aids the pilot on direction of approach. Also the PAPI is missing, which would help with landings (Glide slope). One last thing to polish it off, taxiway center lines should be present and green. Just a fun suggestion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022oTdGEWs.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022101.39\u0022 height=\u0022730\u0022 width=\u0022720\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/oTdGEWs.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022ShZ0d9q.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u0022632\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/ShZ0d9q.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-13T21:20:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdding a PAPI would be a fun bit of flavor but, with the length of the runway, I don\u0027t think it\u0027d actually be practical (because you have so much margin for error in your glide slope as is).
