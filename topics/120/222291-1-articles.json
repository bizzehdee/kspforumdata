I was in a situation where I was launching a lander from the surface of the Mun to rendezvous with my command module in orbit. I had just enough liquid fuel to get into close orbit to the command module, and had plenty of monoprop left to adjust the orbit to rendezvous using only the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, but it would not let me use maneuver nodes. This is something I did all the time in KSP1, and was a little irritating when I discovered it here. It wasn\u0027t a game stopper for me - I just reverted to my Mun surface launch again and made sure to leave a couple of Delta V so I could use the nodes.
