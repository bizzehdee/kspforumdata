It captivated a generation of people and propelled them into STEM related fields. I have seen all kinds of weird and wonderful things across the many forum posts. These are the things that make us laugh, clap, face palm or what have you.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is not a thread to bash the crap out of KSP2 in the features it lacks or is needing tweaked. Let us raise our voices in positivity to celebrate what we each consider to be a hallmark of the KSP title. Mod functionality can make the cake. Over the years a great deal of content has been made possible through these mods, and it is only natural many of us will have had many hours of fun utilizing some of this *extended* type of content.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAgain, this is a thread of positivity. No harassment of another\u0027s post, bashing features others like, bashing KSP2... or general negativity in any way.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs overlap from stories reveal various contents and features, we all *ache* fore, perhaps we may find acknowledgement from the powers that be about how much demand certain things may have.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI will Start....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of my absolute favorite aspect regarding KSP1 is the stats \u0022Courage\u0022 \u0026amp; \u0022Stupidity\u0022\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf removal of these two stats was an approach to limit offense to certain peoples of the community. I suggest altering it to Brazen-ness or some other suitably synonymous vernacular.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis In my opinion does a wonderful job of illustrating just how these little green men have conquered the cosmos on so many computers across the globe. I weigh these factors every single time i launch a mission and select a roster. When making decisions about chow crazy I am going to behave ...THESE state are what help decide that ultimate end.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere was a point when i first discovered contract packs, and i was having the most difficult time completing a series of missions related to rendezvous. I was watching a ton of videos and having a blast in general with everything.. despite being unable to actually dock with another vessel.\u00A0 When it came time to something or another with the specifics a little fuzzy at the moment... I was a good 800 meters from the single launch lab it had send up.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI would never have attempted to cruise that entire distance in EVA without both those stats being maxed. Kelma Kerman was a boss. The lab started out as a tiny little spec barely highlighted. It was super tense moment as i juggled time warp back and forth with a tiny bit of corrective thrust to keep the NAV ball where i needed it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nUltimately i have become much better at navigating with only the NAV ball and can complete this type of maneuver without sweaty palms and pounding pulse.. but there was a time.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMan i get little adrenaline spikes just remember thinking i was gonna miss the Lab by more than a couple meters, but something to do with the TW juggle was distorting where things appeared.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBRING BACK - Krazy Kerbals\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flush Foot","CreatedById":193460,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-04T23:51:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224377686\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221712274568\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022227275\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fizzlebop Smith\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nJust now, Fizzlebop Smith said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBRING BACK - Krazy Kerbals\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll braves, no brains?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-15T16:54:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell.. there are other things I miss so very much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI know there are still missions, but I miss the *variety* introduced with contract configurator.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nConsidering most of the advanced feature content in store for KSP2 was (at least loosely) inspired by the many many mods of KSP1...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am hoping this lovely gem eventually finds its way into the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere were some aspects of missions thay could grow repetitive, but every real science endeavor requires multiple reading under various conditions.
