All I would add is I hope it would be done in a way that\u0027s at least mostly consistent with how our understanding of the solar system and exoplanets evolved irl. This would mean planets are somewhat fuzzy spheres (how fuzzy depending on distance), large moons would be completely featureless blobs, and small/far moons could be completely unknown before probes are sent there (Mun and Minmus would start with full info though). This could be a fun way for the devs to secretly add moons to Jool (we\u0027ve discovered at least 12 moons around Jupiter in the last few years), or other bodies in Dres\u0027s orbit. Space based telescopes similar to Hubble and Webb could be used to figure out the number of exoplanets around a star, as well as their orbits, sizes, and a rough idea of their compositions. I\u0027m leaving out ground based observatories because those aren\u0027t flown missions, but they could probably be worked into the colony system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot having it mimic real life would be a missed opportunity.

I imagine keeping it like the tracking station upgrades or asteroid hunter telescope in KSP1 just for simplicity\u0027s sake. Ground based upgrades would show more at each tier and reveal things as soon as they\u0027re purchased. The same for space-based, but they would reveal things once they\u0027re in the correct orbit. I think requiring line of sight and night/dark conditions would just make things too tedious, especially since for ground scopes you would just time warp until conditions are right, and space scopes would realistically want to be at lagrange points anyway which don\u0027t exist in game. For exoplanet hunting the size of the scope is much more important than distance from the star, though science points should be awarded for probes that are very far from Kerbol. Well after its Pluto flyby, New Horizons actually took images of the cosmic optical background because at that distance it could get more accurate readings than Hubble due to the much darker conditions.
