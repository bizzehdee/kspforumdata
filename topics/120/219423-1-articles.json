I know many of the Devs and players are skeptical but including LS with a depleteable resource like Snacks could be a huge boon to gameplay. I think the reason many are skeptical is that while many of the KSP1 mods were interesting none of them got it exactly right. There are also real pitfalls that must be avoided to make a system that the vast majority of players could learn and enjoy. First, the issues:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1) Life Support is too punishing:\u003C/strong\u003E This is true of most current mods and causes legitimate angst among many players. Some say its not life support if you aren\u0027t risking vessels full of dead or comatose kerbals while the very idea scares off most other players. There is a middle road here though: incorporate life support in a light-hearted way centered on bonuses to science values and mining outputs on normal-default settings and leave more punishing consequences like hybernation and death to higher difficulties or mods. As an additional challenge rather than a constant requirement it becomes something players can dabble in or focus on to max their payouts and can slowly adapt to rather than facing an early difficulty cliff.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2) Life Support is too complicated:\u003C/strong\u003E I believe this notion comes from experiences with TAC and to a lesser degree\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E which incorporated too many resources and variables and were much too opaque and unpredictable. Life support should be as simple as it can be while still leaving room for creative problem solving. Ideally it would focus on one primary consumable resource. It also requires tools in the engineering report similar to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E readouts which tell players in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E how long their LS will last on the fly as they add and subtract parts. It should also remain focused on science and engineering and follow a similar logic to other systems in the game like electricity, engines, and heat.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E3) Life Support doesn\u0027t scale well:\u003C/strong\u003E The real advantage of a consumable LS is that it makes time a more engaging part of the game. Unfortunately it could also cause problems for casual players and those with one-mission-at-a-time playstyles. You need a system that\u0027s flexible enough to handle everything from an early game trip to Minmus and back all the way to an interstellar mission. That tells me that LS can\u0027t be handled as just tanked Snacks or it becomes a linear mass penalty on longer journeys and the burden stacks up FAST. So you need ways both to generate it and to extend it over decades when need be.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBelow I\u0027ve sketched out a scheme showing how I think those pitfalls can be avoided and still achieve the things LS really brings to the party: making time a manageable consideration for mission design and making Kerbals and their wellbeing more important to the game. I\u0027ll be introducing it as players would be introduced as they get deeper into the game. The scheme takes a lot of influence from known mods like Snacks, Kerbalism and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E but I think it\u0027s a smoother synthesis.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EStep 1: KSOI and Snacks\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen players first start out the game they\u0027re doing short hops, first orbits, and thinking about mounting their first missions to Minmus and the Mun. I don\u0027t think they should really need to think about life support at this point because new players will have SO much else to learn and the mass of any stored resource is negligible anyway. But as you start to do slightly longer journeys--perhaps longer stays on Minmus, staffing your first stations and colonies and visiting asteroids we can start introducing the idea of life support and mission time. For simplicity we\u0027re going to assume that O2 and water are being 100% recycled by crewed parts and focus on one resource: Snacks. For my numbers I\u0027ve assumed Kerbals eat a little less than half what a human eats, simplified to 1kg/day for easy math. Having access to air and water each Kerbal can go about 10 days before they start to get hungry, and after that they\u0027ll become progressively more and more grumpy over 20 days until they become miserable and lose all bonuses to science collection. They can still fly, still collect samples, but they\u0027ll be worth half as much as a happy, fed kerbal would collect.\u00A0This in a way makes LS the Kerbal analog to Comnet for probe missions--an extra layer of difficulty that helps get the most out of your trip. Players respond strongly to incentives and I think this gives plenty of impetus for exploring the system without heavy handed punishments.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022WDF5sHV.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002261.58\u0022 height=\u0022734\u0022 width=\u00221192\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/WDF5sHV.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EStep 2: Inner Planets and Rehydrators\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOnce players have gotten their feet wet around Kerbin and start planning interplanetary trips things get a bit more interesting. They can of course choose to simply add more tanks of snacks, but if they want to save a bit of mass they can also add on a food Rehydrator. For simplicity we\u0027re going to assume their snacks are 75% water and that adding a rehydrator makes the snacks they\u0027ve packed last 4x as long. This creates a similar dynamic to using a more efficient engine: there\u0027s an up-front mass cost, but over a medium duration flight it pays for itself. I also like that it\u0027s a nod to real dehydrated astronaut meals and real life strategies for managing food preservation and payload mass.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022rQHnMLx.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022104.50\u0022 height=\u0022600\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/rQHnMLx.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbove: \u003Cstrong\u003EA)\u003C/strong\u003E Radial Rehydrator (0.35 tons, Supports 1 Kerbal), \u003Cstrong\u003EB)\u003C/strong\u003E 1.25m Inline Rehydrator (1 ton, Supports 3 Kerbals),\u003Cstrong\u003E C)\u003C/strong\u003E 2.5m In-line Rehydrator (1.8 tons, Supports 6 Kerbals)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EStep 3: Outer Planets and Greenhouses\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBy the time players are thinking about sending Kerbals to Jool or Eeloo they\u0027ll very likely have started small or even large colonies on Kerbin\u0027s moons and maybe Duna or other bodies. By this point they\u0027ll need a way not just to extend snacks but to generate new snacks. This same technology could be used for very long duration journeys, not just reusing the water but much of the biomass. Greenhouses use fertilizer, either mined at colonies or packed for the journey to provide 10x as many meals as tanked snacks.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00222ZWph6t.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022104.75\u0022 height=\u0022597\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/2ZWph6t.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbove: \u003Cstrong\u003EA)\u003C/strong\u003E 2.5-1.25m Greenhouse (2 tons, Supports 4 kerbals), \u003Cstrong\u003EB)\u003C/strong\u003E 2.5m Inline Greenhouse (3.5 tons, Supports 8 Kerbals), \u003Cstrong\u003EC)\u003C/strong\u003E 3.75m Inline Greenhouse (5 tons, Supports 12 Kerbals)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EStep 4: Interstellar and Nutrient\u00A0Reprocessors\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEven greenhouses wont be enough to survive the vastness of space. Once you\u0027ve entered the later stages of tech development you\u0027ll need heavy and power hungry nutrient reprocessors to reuse fertilizer and keep interstellar vessels fed for decades on end. In conjunction with greenhouses these are 99% efficient and produce 100x as many meals for the same mass in tanked Snacks.\u00A0These ideas are currently being explored by systems like ESA\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MELiSSA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EMELiSSA prototype\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022J3fVDca.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022108.67\u0022 height=\u0022709\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/J3fVDca.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAbove: A)\u00A0 2.5m Nutrient Reprocessor (6 tons, supports 12 Kerbals), B) 3.75m Nutrient Reprocessor (10 tons, supports 24 Kerbals)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBy staging these kinds of \u0027recyclers\u0027 into gameplay I think we can keep things interesting without overwhelming players, but also and most importantly make LS scaleable by giving players the tools to account for long periods of time without worry. Keep in mind that colonies and stations could equip greenhouses and reprocessors too, which with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and supply lines would make them 100% self sufficient and capable of generating stockpiles of snacks and fertilizer for future missions. These systems also drastically shallow the mass-penalty curve. Below are the estimated total LS system masses players would need for 3-Kerbal round-trip interplanetary journies to each planet . I think in the 1.5-3 ton mass range these systems aren\u0027t a huge burden given the potential payoff. The last example shows the total LS mass for a 24 Kerbal journey to Debdeb estimated at 40 years. 15 tons may sound like a lot but I don\u0027t imagine it will rate on the scale of an interstellar vessel with an 80m engine.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022T290oot.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002267.75\u0022 height=\u0022743\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/T290oot.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003EWhat We Gain:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think the real question at the end of the day is how could this actually change the way players play KSP in a qualitatively better way?\u00A0 What are we adding? The most important thing is \u003Cem\u003Etime\u003C/em\u003E. There are many existing systems like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and longer term experiments that take time, but as many have pointed out what does it matter if you can just time-warp? And conversely if you\u0027ve added a cost to time-warping aren\u0027t you necessarily hindering players from doing so when they want or need to? What this system creates is a cost thats both \u003Cem\u003Esoft\u003C/em\u003E and \u003Cem\u003Eflexible\u003C/em\u003E. Players are both given the tools to make time for themselves but also aren\u0027t being overly punished for mistakes. It knits together all of these other time factors and adds considerations for things like launch windows and slingshots. It even creates the incentive for players to start thinking about brachistochrone trajectories and advanced engines that can get players where they\u0027d like to go much faster than your average Hohmann transfer. I think this really opens up the way players will think about traversing space especially in the later game.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe other advantage is more subtle: actually providing for Kerbals\u0027 basic well-being becomes an integral part of designing missions and engineering vessels. You can still stick Val in a lander can and send her to Eeloo if you want, but you\u0027ll have to accept that she won\u0027t be at her best when she gets there. I think LS both keeps the focus on science and engineering but also creates an emotional connection to your crews and gives real drama to the experience of living and exploring space.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThank you for coming to my tedtalk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-09-11T22:14:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2023 10:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Sep 11\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pthigrivi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-11T20:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like it, and it gives a good reason to make big cool-looking interplanetary vessels instead of just a little capsule on a big fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-09-11T20:06:28Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2023 08:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Sep 11\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Sea_Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stoup","CreatedById":2804,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-11T20:17:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like it!

This is going to fundamentally change the game and, in-my-opinion, define what KSP2 is as a game. I think it is too soon to say how LS can be incorporated until we know more about what colonies will be as a core feature. It may make more sense to have LS buildings as a structured part of the colony buildings and not as parts of any vehicles. Developers mentioned colonies would be constructed in an interaction which somewhat resembles \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E construction - except it is outside and you are placing buildings instead of parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor KSP1 there was also a fundamental problem with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E (and therefore also LS) which mods couldn\u0027t solve. This dealt with the way resources were simulated in KSP1. Notably, no resources were gained or lost unless you were flying or within 2.3km or the vehicle. Whenever you switched back to a colony or ship it would attempt to approximate what happened over the interim based off the current rates. However, this causes two related problems: (1) if anything happens very slowly or in very small quantities rounding errors can often result in zero production of the corresponding resource. (2) When loading a vehicle it will attempt to use massive quantities of electricity based on instant generating potential. Accordingly, if your solar panels aren\u0027t correctly oriented you may find your entire batteries drained (or occasionally find other resources entirely drained). This is a problem which couldn\u0027t be solved in mods because the simulation loop didn\u0027t evaluate this. A core re-design in KSP2 was in re-doing how resources are handled to accommodate certain features which are all based off of fixing this fundamental mechanic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery cool concept art and I concur with your well thought out points above.

There are other gameplay loops (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E, crew health...) that can benefit from LS, but it\u0027s one of the two pillars of the \u0022time isn\u0027t free\u0022 mechanism, the other one being maintenance/failures.

You also cannot solve the issue of interstellar timescales without a magic food generator, which once available essentially defeat the whole thing.

It should be implemented in a not to punishing way that motivates players to build cooler and bigger crafts. For the first hops to orbit, mun and minmus LS should indeed not really be a thing players need to worry about much. Build in LS of crew capsule is sufficient and you are fine if you have enough electricity (LS would consume a bit of power). Later in the game (interplanetary or longer stays in space) it becomes more important. Letting life support have a effect on kerbal performance seems like a great way to do it. Bad LS could then result in kerbals making random errors (making controlling vessel and kerbal during EVA harder) and have a negative impact on science gain (less science for surface sample and less return of laboratory module). One variable that also (in my opinion) should be important is space/kerbal.

When colonies are introduced, the player will probably have to have multiple colonies running concurrently with missions being conducted on or around each. Eventually, the player will have to begin managing several missions at one time. This seems like a natural part of progression. It follows, then, that as the player becomes more advanced, they begin to use crew and therefore run multiple missions at once, which acts as a natural buildup towards colony gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I understand it, the goal with KSP 2 is the same goal that many sequels have: decrease or maintain the skill floor, while raising the skill ceiling.

And the fact that players may struggle, or even fail with it, maybe several times before succeeding, sounds like more of a POSITIVE for a playerbase like KSP\u2019s than a negative.
