You make release candidate builds and submit those for final QA, and when QA declares it\u0027s ready to go, you ship it. Sometimes you ship the actual RC build, but often you rebuild it with a new version number but no other changes, and then send it out. Sometimes even a trivial thing like this can break the build, like what happened with Larian and the Baldur\u0027s Gate 3 hotfix 4!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://baldursgate3.game/news/hotfix-4-redeployed_86\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://baldursgate3.game/news/hotfix-4-redeployed_86\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Basically, there\u0027s no reason to delay releasing a build once it\u0027s passed final QA.
