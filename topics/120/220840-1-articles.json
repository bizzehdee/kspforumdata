You already have easy ways to calculate this; somewhere appropriate in the physics pass, any object within N meters of the ground needs a check to verify that it is not BELOW the ground; if it is, it needs to STOP FALLING, and be placed so that its lowest-Z collider vertex is at something like ground-z minus 0.5m or so.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbals falling through the ground to infinity should be a *mathematical impossibility* within the physics engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGround Friction Physics\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- Everyone knows wheels are a bit bugged.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- But did you know you can take a single XS square plate, slap a seat on it, put four sepratrons in a pinwheel-pattern around it, and when you fire it off *the plate will never stop spinning*? It eventually goes up on one corner, and then it\u0027s an Inception top until the sun burns out of the sky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EPhysical Interaction\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n- I flip my little one-man rover-buggies *a lot*. It would be nice if, in addition to the \u0027climb up\u0027 action, there was some way to \u0022grab ahold\u0022 of a part lying within arm\u0027s reach of an actively-controlled pedestrian Kerbal, and the Kerbal could then apply forces to that part - perpendicular to the vector between the kerbal\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E and the part\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E - with the WASD controls. So I could, say, grab a corner of a flipped buggy, and hit \u0027W\u0027 to flip it back upright if it\u0027s light enough.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
