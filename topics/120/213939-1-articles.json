Those of you who have seen footage of the KSP 1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E vol. clouds mod know how beautiful the Eve\u0027s \u0022cloud palace\u0022 is- I would love to see this in KSP 2. I also like how in modded KSP Eve is usually blanketed by clouds, like Venus is in real life. It adds to the uniqueness and extreme-ness of Eve\u0027s look.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a matter of fact, it seems as if the devs may already have wrestled with this, but it\u0027s not in the current build.

It appears as if a 2nd layer of brighter green clouds are visible on the left-hand side of the screen.
