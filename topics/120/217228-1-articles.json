However, during my many many years of playing KSP and watching others do the same, I\u0027ve noticed that a common pain point is figuring out which key to press when rotating a part in place mode. It\u0027s easy to observe many players fumbling with WASDQE figuring out which key is the right one to press to get a part in the orientation they want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel as though some sort of helper or reference element would help curtain this frustration.

I feel like the challenge of implementing this would be instead ensuring that the UI element is clear without obstructing the view too much; perhaps the element is toggle-able in settings, or the user has to hold down a key (like alt, which coincides with forcing node snapping)\u00A0 to display the helper.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vHE1n5b.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022142.50\u0022 height=\u0022683\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vHE1n5b.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-16T04:31:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2023 04:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Kavaeric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-16T04:35:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nin addition boosting the spacing of the actual rotation gizmos might help, they\u0027re very fiddly and cramped at the moment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
