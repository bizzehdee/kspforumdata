Go to the site that I\u0027ve linked and use it to calculate the so-called \u0022phase angle\u0022, the illustration on the site shows you what this angle is. For now, don\u0027t worry about the other angle, that\u0027s something you can worry about when you\u0027ll do more advanced stuff. Launch your ship to low Kerbin (\u0022Earth\u0022) orbit and time warp until Duna and Kerbin approximately have the right phase angle, eyeballing it should be close enough. Then, you need to do your prograde burn on the dark side of Kerbin (the side that currently doesn\u0027t get sunlight), as always when travelling to a location in the outer solar system. Plan your prograde burn with a maneuver node.
