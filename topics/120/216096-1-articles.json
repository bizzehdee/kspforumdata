As for nudging it forward and backward, perhaps there\u0027d be a way to have a slider pop up instead of the velocity sliders, that works similar to the velocity sliders and moves the node slightly forward and backward on the orbit. That would allow for much better burn timing precision without introducing buttons and numbers into the UI.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: Just thought of another reason why this would be invaluable: The ability to \u003Cstrong\u003Etweak the burn timing of a node several orbits in the future\u003C/strong\u003E, as dragging the node in KSP1 would always return it to the current orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-02T07:36:29Z\u0022 title=\u002204/02/2023 07:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Lyneira\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
