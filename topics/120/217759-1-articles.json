The electrical output statistic already exists, so adding this seems trivial, and it\u0027d be super nice for electrical consuming spacecraft. Similar statistics for max energy storage and max energy consumption would be wonderful as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-21T16:08:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMax, as in, with solar panels 50km from the Sun?
