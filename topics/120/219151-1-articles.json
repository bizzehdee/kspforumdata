And I can only talk about problems with interface, but I\u0027m sure there\u0027s plenty more things that can be improved. Plus, if anything, the 0.1.4 made it worse.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022r2etwka.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/r2etwka.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLet\u0027s start from the top left. The \u0022hamburger menu\u0022. Known to exist in most mobile apps, but absent from most desktop applications, except some browsers. Alright, it\u0027s a good idea to have a button AND a hotkey (Esc), just like staging does, but does it have to be\u003Cem\u003E an actual icon of a hamburger\u003C/em\u003E? Probably a snacks joke, haha. Okay, it\u0027s there but... it only works one way. There\u0027s no button to go back from the menu. Not very intuitive, is it? Meanwhile, a button with similar function (opening a menu of options) in App bar looks entirely different.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext stop is on the right, the GFORCE window. Or is it a Gforce window? Maybe it\u0027s crew portait window? And if it is, why does it show empty seats? Where\u0027s that cyber Kerbal dummy that devs have shown us ages ago? Anyway, what matters is that the name has a hard time explaining what it is, because the GFORCE only applies to that thin strip on the left.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd I think another issue are the window names. Not only they\u0027re 8 pixels tall (at 1080p screen), very inconsistent in letter shape - look at any two same letters close to each other, they are not identical because the whole thing is badly compressed, but also inconsistent in letter size and style - for example, the resources window has the title made of 7 pixels, but also the separator isn\u0027t a dot, but a hyphen. And the whole theme makes it look like it\u0027s some placeholder codename, not an actual thing. Why is it \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003EORBITAL.INFO\u003C/span\u003E, and not Orbital Info? Why is it \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:\u0027Courier New\u0027, Courier, monospace;\u0022\u003ETIME.WARP\u003C/span\u003E and not Time Warp? There\u0027s no reason to have it like that in a product that\u0027s not a prototype available only for the dev team.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFont choices. On that one screenshot I counted 12 (\u003Cem\u003ETwelve\u003C/em\u003E) different styles, including changes in font size. That is the opposite of unified interface, feels more like a bunch of different bits made by 5 different people, glued together to make a UI. We\u0027ve got window names in two (at least) sizes, orbital parameters (also at least two sized AND styles), the navball there you can find another 3, timewarp window with 2 more, the resource window with another new size, and staging with at least two more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIconography. There isn\u0027t much here but there are two identical radiotelescope icons that do different things. One shows radio connection, the other is Tracking Station. That can be confusing. Also, all planets in the top left list have the same icon of Kerbin. I know it\u0027s an icon for \u0022planet\u0022 but it\u0027s the same for moons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Navball. Oh the navball. I should explain that I am slightly visually impaired. Wearing glasses, short sighted, astigmatism, recently fighting (without effects) focus/contrast issues in my right eye. And there\u0027s no other way of saying this, the new dark mode of the navball looks like crap and is unreadable for me without leaning in and squinting. The tiny, very densely packed numbers blend with the background, the center bird blends with the background lines, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E icons can be barely seen against what\u0027s behind them. You could say to increase the size of the UI - but I don\u0027t think I should. I\u0027m not that blind because, in KSP1, with roughly the same size of the ball, I had no problems reading the numbers. Here though, it\u0027s a complete blur.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022pixel-font-fun-old-style-pixel-art-font-\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022106.25\u0022 height=\u0022255\u0022 width=\u0022240\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.xxl.thumbs.canstockphoto.com/pixel-font-fun-old-style-pixel-art-font-in-blue-and-pink-colors-retro-gaming-design-eps-vector_csp28966249.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly, the most readable thing in this whole screenshot, is the FPS readout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MechBFP","CreatedById":184845,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-08-31T23:54:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree completely.
