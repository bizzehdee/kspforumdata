I think it would be a neat addition if fields were\u00A0navigable by pressing the tab key. I understand that some fields won\u0027t be that easy to do, due even to visual cues about their focused state (checkboxes, toggles, radios...), but I guess it should be doable at least for text input fields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was attacked by the \u0022pumping sim once\u0022 issue so I cannot test if the fields in-game share the same behaviour (or lack thereof here), but I guess they will.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot a critical suggestion, but I think it would be a \u0022nice to have if time allows\u0022 one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
