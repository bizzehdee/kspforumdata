In KSP 1, it was possible to extend the reach of my communication network by bouncing the connection off of satellites w/ large radar dishes. Now, if my Tylo lander does not have a ridiculously large radar dish, I won\u0027t be able to transmit data down to Kerbin (even though I have satellites with sufficiently large radar dishes in the immediate area).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs this a bug?

I really hope CommNet is implemented soon, at least as a toggle in the game settings at start. Deep space missions are hampered by every vessel needing to carry very large dishes. I feel having drone satellites lose connectivity and be uncontrollable due to poor mission planning or lack of creating a CommNet network both makes things feel more \u0022Kerbal\u0022 when it goes wrong, and incentivizes and rewards careful planning and good play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EngineeringWaffle","CreatedById":218949,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-22T19:40:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/231674-brooklyndamoth/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022231674\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/231674-brooklyndamoth/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@BrooklynDaMoth\u003C/a\u003E I wouldn\u0027t worry about needing to toggle it on in a menu.
