And damn fustrating to aaaaaaalways look for that damn specific very logic tank. The size-mass-price-whatever filter are no help, they don\u0027t work as intended.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, in KSP2, what would be a huge step forward in ergonomics for both beginners and experts player, is a UI assistant that would just highlight parts in the library accordingly to what you just used as the previous part. As I said, no pics, sorry, I\u0027ll try to add them later, but stay with me, it\u0027s really easy and straight forward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou choose the nice 3 crew pod which as a top M diameter and a bottom XL diameter (don\u0027t remember exactly haha). Then the game automatically highlight the relevant parts in the library : parts that can be stacked with the good diameters, including adapters of course. Tanks, batteries, engines, parachutes, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get it \u0022simple\u0022 as is, or go a step further : if that\u0027s a pod, then you\u0027ll want below some \u0022mandatory\u0022 (i.e. very logic) Fuel tank OR Decoupler OR HeatShield.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it\u0027s a tank you just added, below any other part, then only the bottom part is free, so it will highlight part according to the diameter and the nature : decouplers, engine, other tanks, adapters, and so on.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can feel that the first step that ignore the nature of part and just highlight according to the accessible stack diameter is sufficient, since pretty much anything is possible in KSP, it\u0027s not that benefitable to process that above a pod, you won\u0027t often use a tank. Except that, well, skycrane, and so on, so let stick to the \u0022easy\u0022 main option ^^\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt feels quite \u0022simple\u0022 to implement (no dev here, haha) and very worthy ergonomically speaking. It would streamline well better the design, helping the user to identify the good diameters, especially when adding simple tanks, decouplers, heat shield, etc. Of course, the other diameter remain totally here, visible, clickable, usable, it\u0027s just a highlight diameter compatibility and that\u0027s it \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Of course it would totally ignore the parts that don\u0027t stack vertically, but whatever, you would not need / want recommandation about thermometers, legs, etc, would you ? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EYour opinion about it ?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-11-21T10:33:22Z\u0022 title=\u002211/21/2023 10:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Nov 21\u0022\u003ENovember 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Dakitess\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-21T14:33:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the freedom of construction, it would be the opposite of smart.
