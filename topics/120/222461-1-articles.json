Visually, it removes the windows and suchlike, but functionally, it lessens weight, removes the crew capability, and makes it a probe control point instead. If you want to send probes first, you can send a non-crewed boilerplate capsule that would allow a realistic progression. If you prefer the kerbal way, you can simply send crew up. Since it\u0027s up to the players, it can satisfy a larger group of people about the matter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-01T14:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nprobes first because colonies comes last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
