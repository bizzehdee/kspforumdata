But the kerbals in KSP2 are very rigid. Its not a bad thing. The clumsiness from KSP1 had its difficulties when it came to climbing ladders and such. But at the same time for the kerbals themselves it was part of the charm. I tried VERY hard to get a kerbal to fall over on the Mun just now and its not possible. They just plant their feet no matter what.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBring our derpy kerbals back!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TomKerbal","CreatedById":222333,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T01:45:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope.\u00A0 Not for me, sorry. Clumsy is nice if done right, but that was... rather annoying. So ok, but better than in KSP1 please. But more funny animations of our beloved Kerbals, yes please. But don\u0027t take the control from me of their movements. Clumsiness or not. Lost too many of them when falling down somewhere... goes like a stab through the heart each time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ultragamer2000","CreatedById":175452,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T07:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like how they have funny animations but yeah, have to agree, I don\u0027t want them to be clumsy hard to control annoyances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazooka","CreatedById":226666,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T10:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe idle animations and IVA screens for me are very Kerbal and I enjoy watching them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the walking movements I find very ridged, especially on low gravity bodies like the Mun where it seems they move too fast.
