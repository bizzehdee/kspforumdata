If those are Steam\u0027s rules, I feel like 1. TT/PD likely violated them with their motivation for pushing IG into an EA they weren\u0027t planning for (if that\u0027s what happened), 2. the \u0022worth the current value of the playable build\u0022 part is probably violated right, no matter how much of a fanboy I am (the gap there will probably close a lot with tomorrow\u0027s patch), 3. I have been wrong in preaching that EA is a \u0022Pre-Purchase\u002B\u0022. I do think it is *literally* that, but if Steams rules say it is not that, then it should not be on Steam. Still fine for them to sell this EA directly and such, but...if Steam\u0027s rules say \u0022you can\u0027t price an EA like it\u0027s a discounted pre-purchase if the EA build is not worth that discounted price\u0022, they shouldn\u0027t have sold that version on Steam. Again, tomorrow\u0027s patch may bring the whole thing into a much better position, but as of right now, reading those terms, I\u0027m happy to admit my perspective has been mostly wrong (as it related to selling on Steam).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"didkodidko","CreatedById":226055,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-16T05:27:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe\u0027re already testing the experimental branch\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
