I don\u0027t know how other people have played ksp, but I like speeding up time warp fast and then if I\u0027m over zealous, I mash \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026lt; fifty times. I do use \u0027/\u0027 occasionally but it\u0027s not as simple of a transition in different situations if you were to do an observational study. There\u0027s certain things that I find creating a maneuver node really wasteful for. If I\u0027m just making small adjustments to smooth out the circularization of my orbit, I\u0027m not going to open a node for that, or left click in the map mode and click \u0027time warp here\u0027...I\u0027m just going to eyeball it because it\u0027s easier. Same with matching orbital planes...no need to go through the trouble of creating a maneuver node for that. I just fast forward with \u0027\u0026gt;\u0027 but then as I get closer I mash \u0027\u0026lt;\u0027 repeatedly. But then I may have slowed down to 1x speed a little too soon, so I have to hit \u0027\u0026gt;\u0027 again. For these kinds of situations, going back and forth between \u0027\u0026lt;\u0027 and \u0027\u0026gt;\u0027 is just a much easier interaction for the user than to keep going back and forth between \u0027\u0026gt;\u0027 and \u0027/\u0027.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027/\u0027 is the equivalent of slamming your car brake down as hard as humanly possible, and for that reason, I only use it when I absolutely know that I\u0027m intending on stopping on 1x speed, and I plan on staying there for a while. If I ever need to pause the game, that\u0027s what the escape key is for.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI might be weird though, so it would be interesting to conduct some more user testing to see what other users find more beneficial. On my end, it just makes more sense to have repeated mashing of \u0027\u0026lt;\u0027 only knock you down to 1x speed instead of completely pausing the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EGain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe speed transitions of speeding up and slowing down time warp feel so smooth, I love the way it transitions...feels way better than ksp 1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI love the way engines are working in sped up time warp. That one developer talked about how she would do those mega long burns on the nerv engine and how the team was working on fixing that in one of the Dev insight videos, and wow you guys actually pulled it off. I\u0027ve just been flying around in a tiny little xeno engine thing and those time warp burns are a life saver.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also can\u0027t believe how smooth the x4 time warps in the atmosphere are now...ksp always went full kraken on me when I tried to do x4 warps in the atmosphere but you guys crushed it and it feels awesome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EI Wish\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know what you guys have planned for transfer window tools...my guess is you guys have some tricks up your sleeves. That may come wayyyy down the road though, I mean it took KSP 1 forever to add transfer window tools, and IMO they still weren\u0027t very good. Here\u0027s a feature you can implement quicker to ease players\u0027 pain points right now while you\u0027re working on transfer window tools:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the bottom of the UI, it shows the date: \u0022000y ,00d, 00:00:00\u0022 If you give users the ability to double click these numbers and fast forward to a specific year, day, and time, they can just fast forward to exact times that already existing transfer window tools are already giving us. It would ease the pain of inaccurate time warping to certain dates, and simultaneously ease the pain of having to wait several minutes to time warp hundreds of days\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for a very fun day 1 in KSP 2, Fly Safe! \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
