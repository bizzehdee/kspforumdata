If I have 3 radially attached hydrogen tanks, and I want to attach 3 solar cells radially to each of those tanks, selecting 3x symmetry only puts 1 cell on each tank. Can be worked around, but a more clear solution is in order.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPressing escape doesn\u0027t put the game on 0x timewarp.

If I have outer booster stages feeding into a central main booster, all tanks are draining as the flight goes on, instead of only draining the outer booster tanks. There appears to be no way to control this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T13:41:35Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 01:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Stoup\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
