Id like that to still be around. You could even use the same generator it just lists science\u00A0 points not money for the reward.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sumeee","CreatedById":105622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T14:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy guess is that after Colonies update we will get some sort of Career mode. I think that the devs have said that they will want to get rid of money system from KSP1 and use gendered resources for progression. This will incentivize players to go to different planets/moons and biomes to gather those resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-03T16:43:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think there\u0027s a general sentiment that, although missions with goals are nice, the KSP1 implementation was a bit too random and grindy. I recall in my career mode, just doing dozens of \u0022bring 2/4/6/8 Kerbal tourists to the Mun\u0022 missions for money and science. The missions should feel purposeful and rewarding, maybe unlocking technologies or decals? Leading you to anomalies? Mission \u0022campaigns\u0022 that have you set up a scanner, scan for anomalies, find one, and visit it? Also, you don\u0027t want the missions to get too all-encompassing if you want KSP2 to really be a sandbox game...most sandbox games make sure you can ignore the missions/story.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
