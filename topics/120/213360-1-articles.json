It happens after each using of timewarp. Also when craft rotates using only reaction wheels its orbital and other parameters, like apo/periapsis, target distance, change while it rotates. Also there was bug when craft with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E starts rotate on surface after kerbals left it, maybe problem was in not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003Esas\u003C/abbr\u003E I don\u0027t know\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hecatonichosachoron","CreatedById":84257,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T20:17:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a craft rotate out of control after activating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E after re-docking.\u00A0 A friend had a similar out of control rotation after re-boarding a Kerbal onto his ship on the Mun\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
