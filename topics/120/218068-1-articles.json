This is a great resource for small scale news, but it only works for people who use discord. It would be great to have a way for people of any platform to easily see this small scale news, without having to join the discord. Whatever replaces it should also be easy for CMs to implement and manage as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s why I suggest a dev tracker twitter account. Linking this twitter account to both forums and discord would be trivial, and adding new stuff to it would be as simple as making a twitter post. For people who dont use forums or discord, if they want to keep track of this small scale news, they can just subscribe to this twitter account.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
