Each body having a unique sound is something that should have been in from day one as it is adding so much to the atmosphere and character of the body\u00A0 . The music is the reason I visited the planets again . I think the texture on Val definitely needs some work too. Overall I can see where the games going and I\u0027m liking the direction ,keep up the good work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grounder","CreatedById":175867,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T15:10:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to be able to insert the music of my choice in the game.\u00A0 Docking always makes me hear Space Odyssey 2001, would love to be able to toggle that on in-game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
