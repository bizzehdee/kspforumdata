Having the rocks (and trees on kerbin) have collision would bring slightly more challenge to landing on each planet or moon and would make driving around on rovers and such more realistic. I don\u0027t like driving straight through a giant bolder on the surface of Duna, even if it makes the trip a little quicker.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis raises the question: \u0022Why wait until the colony update?\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think being able to build colonies is very important before turning on scatter collision because with colonies we can make our own flat runways for space planes as well as large landing pads if we need something flat to land our lander. There is enough flat land around a planet to land a lander that can build your colony and then after that you can make it much easier for the next mission to said planet.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think collision would be a welcomed addition to the game but I appreciate not having to worry about the rocks in the sand while landing a plane on laythe beaches while I can\u0027t make a runway for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-13T09:15:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyhea but there is a lot of terrain scatter so it would have an impact on performance. i think it would be better if some planets had rougher terrain. i mean theres no cliffs every planet is basically a hard desert\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Presto200","CreatedById":232857,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-13T15:22:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess that is true but they would only need to calculate the scatter within a couple meters of your vessel to detect if you run into it, its not like they have to calculate every scattered rock on the planet/moon at once.
