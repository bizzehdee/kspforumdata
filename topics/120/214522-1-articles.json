I feel like its a no brainer idea, plus it really fits the whole military hierarchy thing that is closely related to space industry. There could be medals/ribbons, plaques, promotions, suits/helmets etc.. I think it could add a valuable intrinsic gameplay arch that could fuel 100s of hours. And this really should be NATIVE, not a mod. Good art and implementation is a must, I think.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone out there agree ?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-06T02:02:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis suggestion for KSP2 has been moved to the KSP2 Suggestions subforum.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeb x Valentina","CreatedById":217306,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-07T01:48:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
