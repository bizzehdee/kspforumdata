I\u0027ve also found myself wanting to create interstages without sealing off the top with an engine plate, and tubes would be perfect for this. I believe both trusses and tubes would both greatly benefit from having interior nodes available, much like cargo bays and saddle trusses. There\u0027s plenty of open space within these parts, just begging to be filled.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
