It would also be helpful to have a scrollable list of color schemes used on the active vessel along the side of the color manager that you can expand and contract like a sideways window slider. Then we would more easily be able to select color schemes that are hidden by a shroud later in the build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
