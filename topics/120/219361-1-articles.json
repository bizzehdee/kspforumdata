I\u0027ve read some descriptions about how the devs could regulate the length and thickness of tips and roots of successive wings but, even with all that additional code in place, you\u0027d still have to fiddle around matching the slope and angles of the two sections - assuming you had a particular shape in mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith all that fiddling around it struck me the suggestion I\u0027ve seen, to just add the option for a second set of control surfaces to a wing, was a lot more straightforward. As I said, the default could be set to \u003Cem\u003Eoff, \u003C/em\u003Eso it would make no difference to building a wing\u003Cem\u003E \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eunless \u003C/em\u003Eyou wanted to go into the wing shape editor and turn \u003Cem\u003Eon \u003C/em\u003Ethe second set of control surfaces.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would restore the functionality we had in KSP1 where you could add two control surfaces to a wing.
