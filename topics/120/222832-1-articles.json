Let\u0027s say I have a core stage with eight boosters added around it using 8x symmetry. Now I want to add four stabilisers. I switch to 4x symmetry, drag the stabiliser over to the boosters... and instead of putting a stabiliser on every second booster it adds four stabilisers to each of the eight boosters, which is decidedly not what I want. I get that I can achieve what I want by making two sets of 4x symmetrical boosters and then adding wings to only one of them, but it\u0027s just very annoying when I\u0027m designing the rocket as I go. It\u0027s especially bad for adding asparagus staging. It would be really nice to have a toggle that switched between the current symmetry mode and the KSP1-esque symmetry that only respects the symmetry of the entire active craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizzlebop Smith","CreatedById":227275,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-28T14:06:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen making a Vessel in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E with the new Symmetry mechanics, it works better to remove the section you are wanting to \u0027work on\u0027 from the larger craft as a whole.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe various parts are not arrayed in weirdly exponential progressions with each subsequent outward expansion.\u00A0 Once you have fully designed this component to the Visual / mechanical combinations you desire...
