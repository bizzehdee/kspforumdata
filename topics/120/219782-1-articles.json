If we want to minimize wobbling between two parts, we increase joint strenght between those two parts, and that joint will weigh heavier. Or if we want to save weight, we reduce the joint strength at the cost of wobble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWeights of each joint should be calculated by the parts in which it connects. Heavier the parts results heavier joints. Then the player\u0027s adjustment of joint strength would modify the weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf this is not a viable suggestion. Make the struts (and autostruts in the future) weigh according to the parts they connects. If struts connect heavier parts, they should be heavier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-10-04T18:42:48Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2023 06:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Oct 4\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by CanOmer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
