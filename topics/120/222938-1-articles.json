Update for KSP2.","CreatedByName":"Planterium","CreatedById":223507,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-12T07:39:40Z","PageNum":1,"Articles":[{"CreatedByName":"Planterium","CreatedById":223507,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-12T07:39:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Science! Update started off with a blast and I was eager to play it upon release! Once it released, I loved it instantly considering it levels the Game up to not only a sandbox simulator but to a full-fledged game playthrough!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E However, despite the many awesome and fun moments I had with this update, I feel like there is a lot of work to polish the new Science \u0026amp; Mission Mechanic alongside the already implemented tutorial system which I really wanted to talk about for quite some time now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, let\u0027s start off with the Tutorials,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am personally not very good with Kerbal Space Program itself; I couldn\u0027t really understand how to create a rocket properly and usually ended up having stacks of them not launching from the pad or barely making it into orbit, let alone past Kerbin. And despite the help I got from the in-game tutorials, it did not significantly help as much as online tutorials. The section about rocketry feels obviously lacking, sure it mentions how a rocket works and the types of engines and other space components, but it does not help on how to make a proper rocket or at least understand how to make one for any specific task such as landing on the Mun or Eeloo. This can also be accounted for orbital mechanics; it leaves questions in my mind such as: \u0022How much do you need to slowly turn your rocket over the horizon?\u0022 \u0022Does it apply to every rocket? If no, how do I know when and how?\u0022 This is normally a major obstacle for new players like me (Kind of, started in 2016 but never really got past the Mun in KSP1 and never properly learned rocket design) because it forces us back into the drawing board by watching a couple of tutorials made from the Internet, although it isn\u0027t any bad either, it reinforces the fact the in-game tutorials really need more work. In summary, using this experience of mine, I would really like more tutorials about rocketry and an improved version of how to put your rocket past the atmosphere and prepare the steps for an orbital maneuver.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecondly, let\u0027s continue with the Missions in Mission Control,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Missions itself aren\u0027t bad, I actually found it as huge upgrade its original counterpart in KSP1, but it definitely needs more polishing. The first noticeable flaw I encountered was the mission briefing themselves, they seem way too centered on a specific scenario (mission briefing specifically) and less dynamic, by example, your ship ends up in a catastrophic failure when doing a specific mission, you absolutely do not get any major consequences rather than the loss of a crew, which normally under the default game difficulty, usually just respawn and probably also a couple of science points that you might have lost. I really wish upon a system where the missions actually do not cancel themselves when failing them, but give negative consequences such as more flavour text signifying the gravity and effect of the situation but at the same time balancing and incentivizing the player to keep continuing.\u00A0 Secondly, if your rocket launches, completing the first mission, and immediately goes to the atmosphere, I would really like it, instead of going again back to Mission Control and then going back to the ship to complete the second mission after the first, to simply have some way or form to complete both missions when you\u0027ve done both already through one rocket launch at the start. To simply brief this, Mission Debriefing should get a separate system when the player fails the mission and you should be able to complete two missions at once without needing to go back to mission control to track the second one which went available thanks to completing to the first one in one rocket launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, the Science Mechanic, which is the one here with the most need of polishing,\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could also say the same for this one, the new Science mechanic is a massive overhaul to its original counterpart in KSP1. However, it definitely needs more polishing and balancing to make it less of a \u0022Simple Magic Click and Reward\u0022 button which actually loses the value of it being a \u0022Reward\u0022 as it gets too easy. I noticed the reports did not really have any unique flavour to them compared to KSP1 where crew observations and utilization of science equipment had unique flavour text depending where you did them (Also make the flavour texts larger and readable \u003Cspan\u003E:D), I would actually really like if they weren\u0027t all generic and had an interesting one. I also found it quite boring when all a Kerbal can do and is meant for in a mission is simply to steer a Rocket when it\u0027s out of signal with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, do flags, generic crew observations and surface samples. I really wanted them to play a role on organizing Science like KSP1 rather than one magic click and it\u0027s all stored. Kerbals should perhaps have the ability to take the science reports or surface samples and store them in the Command Pod or Science Juniors. Both elements, describing flavour text and the further usage of Kerbals, would really incentivize the Player to do more frequently EVAs and learn more about science itself generally through flavour text, with some funny element in it considering Kerbals are Kerbals\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0Anyways, apart from my feedback on how Science Points are acquired and Flavour Texts, Science Points should really get some sort of balancing because unlocking technology feels way too easy and feels really less of a reward. Maybe decrease science points on more generic tasks such as crew observations and regular planet scans or any other thing those science parts can do.\u00A0 Alternatively, increase the cost of the technologies in R\u0026amp;D. In conclusion, I would really like more flavour for generic scientific tasks and further usage of Kerbals alongside balancing on the ridiculous amounts of Science Points you\u0027d get from 1 mission.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EThanks for reading my Feedback and Suggestions if you have come this far down, I really want to hear what others think
