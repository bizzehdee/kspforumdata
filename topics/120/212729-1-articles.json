So the plume would adapt to the ground by getting wider or interacting and breaking up once touching an object. This could also work with parts by the plume going around or destroying the part. Another thing is no wheel clipping which means that the wheel does not ever go below the surface. Plus, Kerbal head clipping. Whenever the kerbal responds to the G-force, it moves in a direction away from the force. Sometimes, the Kerbal\u2019s head clips though the glass or spacecraft and it is very immersion breaking. I also think that the camera transition, whenever you dock or undock, is too rigid. When this happens, the camera just jumps to the ship with no smooth motion there. In KSP 1 the smooth transition was present. Finally, UN-ALIVING THE KRAKEN! Who likes the Kraken. We get deformed spacecraft, the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in space, bendy rockets, wheels flipping under surface and sending your rover to an escape trajectory, and so much more. This is my list I got on hand. I wished for vapor cones, but I am incredibly happy that it was confirmed by the devs about a week ago.
