There are a few with a better power per data ratio that make them worth considering if you will be power limited, but there isn\u0027t a clear pattern of progression for this. I feel like it should be pretty straightforward to design tradeoff options between size, power, weight, efficiency, and tech tier but in scrutinizing the numbers they all seem to be all over the place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
