In both those cases a lot of thrust is needed over a very short amount of time. What we get now feels like a solid five seconds or so of fairly weak thrust. So to get the rapid acceleration I\u0027m looking for to move an ejector seat or push boosters away as I\u0027m staging, I need to attach a bunch of sepratrons, when it feels like I should only need one or two since that\u0027s like their only job.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whatsEJstandfor","CreatedById":220814,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-14T20:23:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVery agree. Even with 4 on a Clydsedale, it comes dangerous close to clipping the rest of my craft after staging. I don\u0027t actually know offhand if the behavior is any different from KSP1, but it does seem like it should burn, like, half as long with twice the thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-20T22:59:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think in KSP you could set the thrust of SRBs.
