The critical UI interface that serves as the primary interaction point between the player and their craft\u0027s parts is hideously slow for vessels with even moderate part counts, let alone vessels with high triple digit part counts;

The KSP 1 interface was so much more compact to fit a lot more information and control into the same or even less space. There were so many useful functions all in one place. I would love to see that in KSP 2, too. I personally find the font in the new UI too large but the most \u0022waste\u0022 of space in my opinion are the separating lines between each section. They are not there in the KSP 1 interface and yet it is still very clear any easy to navigate. I hope there will be a future iteration of the new interface, especially when (e.g. via science, staring and gathering experiments) we get many more options to control from there. To be completely honest, if a mod named \u0022KSP 1 interface\u0022 existed I would be downloading it the moment it is released.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut: I know there are so many features still missing that require UI interaction that I am confident the devs will take a good look at it and rework it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQuestion for modders (I have no knowledge of the complexity of modding): Are the UI elements easy to adjust? Not just like building own dialogs with the same font and style like some mods already do but I am thinking of completely re-styling them? Or is that not possible with the given framework.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-04T23:55:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have been agitating for this since day one.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-05T09:36:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nkeeping the PAM as a button and adding \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Part Action Window\u0022\u003EPAW\u003C/abbr\u003E for right clicking a part seems to me as the best option\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
