Also This may just be because I play at a very low framerate a lot of the time. But when setting up the vehicle for docking. It would be nice to double click on the NAV ball and the ship be like \u0022sure I can point 10\u00AD\u00AD\u00AD\u00B0 away from target so you can move around it and still be near the target docking port.\u0022 without me having to manually point the ship.

Right until I have to land a craft. You see I, like I assume a lot of other people, use landmarks to make sure I get the runway lined up or the landing pads. But I cannot see these landmarks when its night. Also on the way down it can be really hard to see where you\u0027re going. I placed little drones at the end of the runway and landing pads respectively.. but I would love to be able to toggle night vision at night for landings etc.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003EThe ability to show atmospheric bands on the vehicle path.\u003C/b\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI made a poor\u00A0example of what I mean here:\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ecolour correspond\u00A0to the atmosphere bands shown on the altitude indicator on the Navball\u00A0\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022QG8UdCe.jpeg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/QG8UdCe.jpeg\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI have a second stage that drops like a stone once its through the dark blue part of the atmosphere ~32-17km - Which means I am most interested in knowing when I\u0027ll hit that part of the atmosphere, so I can aim that to be right above target.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther times I fly a glider, and I know that ~32-17km is the atmospheric band where I can extend or shorten the glide in accordance to what I am trying to hit by changing \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Angle of Attack\u0022\u003EAoA\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and Bank angle.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe actual path is worthless once you hit the atmosphere.

That would certainly help with docking, but also with landing adjustments.\u00A0Too often that devolves into turning and toppling all over the place while continuously trying to make correction burns.
