I have tried to keep this post containing only things that are already in the game, which should remove accidental bug reports, and requests to add new features.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUSER EXPERIENCE:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFLIGHT UI:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe flight UI imo, is lacking a lot of key information, that would make flight both easier, and also allow for more complex mission profiles. It needs a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator for each stage, as well as burn time left for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E in the stage. Orbital inclination under the AP/PE values would also make precise orbits possible like they were in KSP 1, with its \u0027advanced orbital info\u0027 tab. Another key piece of information that can be very useful for most missions, is suicide burn information; like a countdown, distance, and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E required. I used that info from K.E.R in KSP 1 for pretty much all landing missions, which allowed for thrilling, cool to look at, and efficient missions. One last piece of information that I found useful in landing, was horizonal and vertical speed read outs, which made precision landings a little bit easier (something that could be very valuable with colonies). (Also the trajectories mod made precision landings on atmospheric bodies significantly easier, but that gets well into the realm of additional new features to the game, which this whole section is already bordering on). TL;DR: port \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E to the flight UI lol\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other part of the flight UI that I think needs to be changed, is the tapes on the navball, and specifically the units they\u0027re in. Currently, they\u0027re both in km and km/s, which is not particularly useful in any scenario. The times I would look at the tapes for info, is for landing and sometimes taking off. With the units in km, the tapes move very slowly, to the point where they don\u0027t provide useful information to the flight. Most landing speeds will range from 2000-0 m/s from orbit to the surface, and with them in km/s, they barely move two units, often less. The tapes should either match the readout units (i.e. the same way the speedometer/altimeter units adjust depending on how large/small the value is), or it should be a log scale. That way, the tapes can provide useful information during critical parts of a mission, like they were intended to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EMANOUVRE NODES:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe big one with this point is the \u0027out of fuel\u0027 message that prevents the player from making manouvers past their ship\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E. This design choice has always baffled me, as the old system worked perfectly fine. Especially with the buggy \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E readout, which can often read zero despite a fully fueled ship, this change unnecessarily limits the player. Other applications of plotting past a ships capabilities could be to determine how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E a rescue vessel would need to successfully return to Kerbin, if the readout breaks after rendezvous (happens frequently, even in KSP 1, after rearranging a ship), or simply if the player has infinite fuel turned on. The bar going to read to show that the player was going past the ships \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E capabilities informed them well, and could even be improved if it still displayed the \u0027out of fuel\u0027 message. Returning to the old system, the same system KSP 1 used, is what I and most others would certainly appreciate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing I would like to see is the return of the \u0027plot to next orbit\u0027 feature from KSP 1,\u00A0 which was useful for checking for chance encounters (very useful at Jool), or seeing if the next orbit would have a closer approach with rendezvous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ETIMEWARP:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EFor timewarp, allowing the player to access all levels of timewarp once in a stable orbit (out of the atmosphere, or 10km above all surface terrain) seems like a no brainer. Waiting for rendezvous transfers for 15 minutes irl, or having to go through a craft switching frenzy to get higher warp for interplanetary transfers, makes interplanetary missions more painful than they ever need to be. With mods already doing this a few weeks after launch, I hope this gets fixed soon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing that needs a return is the ability to switch to physics warp when holding alt. For larger crafts, waiting whole minutes for them to slowly turn around is not fun. Physics warp exists already in the game, but being able to hold alt to access it at any point in flight, perhaps turning the timewarp bar red to indicate this, would be a great improvement.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EQUICKSAVING/LOADING:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EI don\u0027t like how making f5 saves creates a new quicksave. It should override the previous f5 save if one exists. Currently, manually made saves get lost in the swarms of f5 saves, which makes it difficult to pinpoint critical points of the mission. It\u0027s annoying to find the quicksave titled \u0027orbit\u0027, amongst the sea of quicksaves 1-57.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other thing I don\u0027t like is the lack of option to load a game save to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Currently, the only option is to load to a quicksave made, which prevents the player from opening the game to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E unless they made a save for it. If the player forgets to make such a save, or perhaps ended their last play-through not at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E (stations/bases/rage-quits), then they have to load the game to that point, and then load back to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Fixing this would reduce the time from opening the game to entering the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, which the load times already do so well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003ELIGHTS:\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003C/b\u003EThis is just a minor one, but I think that the range of most of the lights should be increased. often lights don\u0027t light up the ground early enough for them to be useful, and this is one of their main uses.

The atmospheric engine plumes for methalox engines don\u0027t look good. I honestly think stock KSP 1 plumes look better, and waterfall plumes look orders better, which I found surprising for obvious reasons. they appear as an almost solid colour, with variations being hard to see, even when zoomed right in. The plumes should be much more transparent, and show those beautiful shock-diamonds, like those in the waterfall mod. They don\u0027t look \u0027powerful\u0027 compared to waterfall, and the jarring differences in beauty from all the other fuel types\u0027 plumes is very strange. They look stunning in a vacuum, so I just hope that someday the atmospheric plumes can match it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other issue is that some of the vac plumes appear to be more concave than convex, contrary to irl. The poodle engine is the worst offender of this that I\u0027ve seen. most of the other engines get it right, but it sticks out like a sore thumb for those that don\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EThis point is quite nit-picky, I\u0027ll admit, but I\u0027m just not a fan of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. I think having it downrange of the launchpads and runway was a very odd choice, and having it crammed in between the runways and launch pads limits the size of the buildings. It feels like the runways and launch pads were added first, and then the rest of it was added after. Having it on the other side of the runway (west side) would give it all the room it could need, which could let it have have a much larger R\u0026amp;D and tracking station buildings, which I think would match that of an interstellar species well. I think having 1 major, and 3 minor dishes for the tracking station like in KSP 1 would be neat, and buildings like wind tunnels, and engine test stands added onto the R\u0026amp;D would make the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E feel more alive, while giving even\u00A0 more opportunities for some challenging-to-fly under bridges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EBeing able to past in hex codes for colours would be very nice to keep a consistent colour pallet across saves, or if the user wants to return to the colour they made at a later point in their build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso we need a return of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E for each stage, and the ability for it to be calculate it on different celestial bodies (and the same for \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETERRAIN:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003ENot sure if the coming CBT system will fix this (I really hope it does), but I\u0027ll put it here anyway. The terrain in some places is very flat/boring. Obviously most of the terrain is really beautiful, but in some places its just not, specifically on the dark patches of the Mun, and large patches of terrain on Duna. I\u0027m not saying that terrain can\u0027t be flat, I\u0027m saying it shouldn\u0027t be Minmus Flats II. Just some rolling hills or even the odd minor crafter to break up the land to make it more interesting to look at, while still remaining \u0027flat\u0027. I think the large craters on the mun in KSP 1 do this really well, as in they look flat from orbit, and are still generally flat on the surface, but the rolling hills and craters bresk up the terrain enough so that it doesn\u0027t look jarringly flat.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EACTION GROUPS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EGroup communication deployment with the solar panel action group. every single time i use them, in both games, I\u0027ve always put them in the same action group, so putting them together just makes sense to me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EREFLECTIONS:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003C/strong\u003EReflections are too strong.
