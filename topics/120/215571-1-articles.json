This would allow for very fine adjustment of maneuvers, to make planning exact intercepts easier to do and less finicky.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T23:50:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe might get something basic, as we ended up with in KSP1 at the end, but in the meantime,\u003Cstrong\u003E \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/214244-maneuver-node-controller-004/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethere\u0027s a mod for that\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E and it works very well.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022S2Xtvk7.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022120.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/S2Xtvk7.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
