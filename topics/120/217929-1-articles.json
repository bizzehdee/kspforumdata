In the original KSP, going to each of the science biomes to unlock my full tech tree was one of the major things that kept me innovating throughout the game.\u00A0 I could only milk so much science from Kerbin so I had to branch out to the Mun and then Minmus. However, in the original game there were so many biomes on those two moons that I could easily max out the entire science tree without ever leaving the Kerbins sphere of influence.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo counter this I would propose less science biomes,\u00A0 so the Kerbin system runs dry faster and require players to have to branch out to more distant bodies.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlternatively it could also be a mater of order of magnitude. Where more advanced part science unlock costs increase exponentially, so getting basic rocket tech can easily be unlocked with missions on and around Kerbin. Orbital and interstellar mission parts can be unlocked with missions to the Mun and Minmus but would be a x5 - x10 grind if you tried to unlock them with exclusively Kerbin based missions. And so on from there. Full interstellar parts requiring missions to other planets to gain enough science quickly etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdmittedly there\u0027s a lot of potential problems with these ideas mostly about making the game too tedious or too difficult if they require missions that are not fun to run. My hope is interstellar missions will in general be less tedious in KSP 2 where we can potentially launch from orbital assembly bases and have better long term time warp controls etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
