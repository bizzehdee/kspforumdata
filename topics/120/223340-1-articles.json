The old skybox looks more crisp and clean to me along with the greenish-blue tint that gives off a kind of \u0022alien\u0022 feel. I can see why people might prefer a less visually noticeable and more realistic skybox, though I think it would be neat to see this return in a mod or optional setting.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fuO16TF.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002258.00\u0022 height=\u0022591\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fuO16TF.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022t5TUXiK.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002255.00\u0022 height=\u0022555\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/t5TUXiK.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jeq","CreatedById":172375,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-30T15:06:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least skybox needs to be different when traveling to other star systems.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me biggest problems with skyboxes is that some starts looks very big and bright circles, because i play with high res big television.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
