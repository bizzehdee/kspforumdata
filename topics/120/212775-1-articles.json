All the struts will change their attachment points to the first merged craft. So if I merge 3 boosters with struts onto an existing craft, all boosters will be strutted to the first booster I merged, regardless of distance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nAt this point, there is NO way to maintain struts across craft or across copied parts or when editing a vessel or in any reasonable manner. This means that, in order to build a stable vessel with struts, you need to first start with a completely unstrutted version, and only at the very end, when you are ready to launch, do you add all struts one at a time by hand to the whole vessel. Its not safe to use symmetry mode with struts. Its not safe to copy parts with struts. Its not safe to merge craft with struts. its not safe to add or delete parts with struts on them. Its not safe to undo an action while struts are in place. And the best part is, if you want to continue editing a vessel after struts are placed, you are probably safest by starting with the unstrutted version, editing the vessel as you like, and then again at the end strutting the whole craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022background-color:#f9f9f9;color:#2d3134;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nAs you can see, struts are completely broken and useless at this point.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T20:42:53Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 08:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by twich22\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T00:58:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni always saw struts as a hack to fix the problems with softbody physics, this was replaced with autostrut and ridged attachments, because space tape was hard to work with. but then woe to anyone who forgets to autostrut their structural bits. rather why not make this automatic based on node type and size. put 2 big parts together, it stands to reason you want them to not flex too much.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T00:58:58Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 12:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
