Mainly for the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E part focusing, up/down panning, and part favoriting. The ksp1 \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E was perfectly usable without a mouse on a laptop, due to using modifier keys with the main mouse buttons and scrolling. So even if not rebinding (as what do you use instead of MMB then? There\u0027s not always a good option for clicking tasks), adding secondary modifier key based controls would be good.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
