The developers have talked about this and are not satisfied with the way it is coming across to players.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I have gathered from interviews and such is that the original idea was that vehicle name is the name you want it to be called, but workspace name is for you to be able to save versions of the same vehicle. So you can have different workspace saves for V1.0, V2.0, V3.0 ect... having a name for each can allow you to recognize what was added each time or what was changed. Anyways it was made to have a separate save for each time you need to improve your design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is how the craft file saves work currently:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Capture.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002283.07\u0022 height=\u0022800\u0022 width=\u0022963\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/G3TQr9Lr/Capture.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you can see if I had many more versions of this ship (I just made this craft to explain this post) the screen gets very cramped and seems wasteful. Also it isn\u0027t shown in the save but I named the vehicle name \u0022My Ship\u0022 for all of these but it just shows the workspace name. Another thing to point out, It puts them all in alphabetical order instead of order they were created, you can see the \u0022design process\u0022 throughout but they are placed randomly in the craft file folder. This could be done so much better.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I think the idea behind the system is great but the implementation is lacking as stated by a lot of the community. My idea to improve this system is to instead of making a new save space for each implementation, it would be a drop down with the vehicle name as the base name and then the drop down will show each workspace. It would look something like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Capture1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002268.73\u0022 height=\u0022800\u0022 width=\u00221164\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/GtYYw81p/Capture1.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know how to make something legitimate so please use your imagination.\u00A0 It would pretty much be something that looks like a single craft file above that would have the vehicle name and image/date/time of the most recent (or selected default version) and then you could click a drop down on it to reveal all the workspace names/ versions of the craft in the drop down you could also set which workspace you want to be your default load. The idea would be if you click the large image vehicle name then it loads your default workspace.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would be the best way to go about organizing all the craft files while keeping the functionality of getting to save\u00A0 multiple versions of a craft without changing its vehicle name\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt should also let you rename your vehicle names and workspace names\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"steveman0","CreatedById":64580,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-18T20:58:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this and wanted to add that it\u0027d really help clean up all of the autosave workspaces that get saved as separate copies that inevitably get saved over as the original, but not actually the original such that they get retained as permanent duplicate copies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Presto200","CreatedById":232857,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-18T22:27:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224373667\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224163\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221710795509\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002264580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022steveman0\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, steveman0 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like this and wanted to add that it\u0027d really help clean up all of the autosave workspaces that get saved as separate copies that inevitably get saved over as the original, but not actually the original such that they get retained as permanent duplicate copies.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI completely forgot about autosave when making this post, thats a great point!
