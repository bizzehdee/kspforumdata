Key word, to me. An obvious flaw of the \u0022best of both worlds\u0022 compromise (barring optional difficulties) is that you\u0027ll get extreme pro players complaining that the feature is too light, and if you then nudge the compromise in their favour, you\u0027ll get newer players who don\u0027t feel as invited to improve their ability to play. This is a convo that has happened a million times before, so I\u0027ll just advise you that this is a road that\u0027s been walked down before and that the devs themselves have likely had hundreds of conversations about this very balance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GluttonyReaper","CreatedById":59429,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-23T09:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs with many things in KSP2, the trickiest bit of life support is bridging the gap between interplanetary and interstellar - how do you deal with the fact that decades might suddenly pass as you\u0027re time-warping to another solar system, and your space station that needs resupplying every six months runs dry after half a second?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not an unsolvable problem (automatic resupply missions comes to mind) but it\u0027s a heck of a large development investment for an optional feature.

The implementation needs to work from short moon trips to interstellar trips. Implementations will also need to work for colonies as well and not require to much background progressing. Also predictability and advanced planning options will then be needed. In the forum (could not find it) was a topic were someone described a good way for this and which parts are needed for this.
