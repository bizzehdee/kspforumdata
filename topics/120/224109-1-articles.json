I had so much fun I even changed my feedback on Steam to positive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have played KSP2 for a while and here are my main issues I had during playthrough. These are not bugs, but my personal experience or obviously missing features. Hope this list can help you prioritize some of them:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe main difficuly for me was fiddling with maneuver plans when you plan interplanetary transfers. There was a feature like \u0022precision planning\u0022 or something which made the arrows actually available near the navball in KSP1. So I instinctively just click the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E corresponding buttons for this purpose (and obviously fail). Clicking the plan in real space is a big issue and dragging the arrows is nearly impossible at some angles if you focus on the target which is most likely what you want. Second part of it is impossibility to move the node along the orbit without focusing and zooming into the source planet which is, again, impossible when you want to see target results.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe second most annoying issue is that you can\u0027t click on the part of the orbit that is displayed on a focused encounter planet (in most cases, seems to work occasionally), but you can do it on the effected part in a real world. So the simple task of planning a maneuver node at the periapsis of your target encounter can only be planned when entering the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E which is very inconvenient.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDefinitely missing those \u002BN orbits indicators when planning encounters/randevouz.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI do not like the way your time warp is limited based of your distance from bodies. I did find myself switching to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E so many times to perform waits while being in\u00A0a really safe orbits. I do propose this to be changed based on what you FOCUS (on the map)\u00A0as opposed to the distance of your controlled vehicle from bodies. The only exception that I see might be being in an atmosphere which has a real unpredictable impact on your trajectory. Just to let you know - from my personal experince I have lost a real ton of time and excessive clicks namely on this.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI had an issue multiple times where you can misclick your trajectory for the second part (changed after encounter). I am not sure how to solve it, but it is a bummer resulting in the requirement to reload the save.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSaving crafts in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E is a pain resulting in multiple copies of the same crafts, and the overall confusion between workspace and craft names. I think you should really get rid of one of them.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI am pretty sure that it would be best to bind craft name to a control module which would really allow you name parts of your complex crafts before they separate or dock/undock. It is really inconvenint to see all those \u0022Default name-2\u0022 stuff all around.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe craft won\u0027t stage if you are on any time acceleration, and it does not indicate the problem accordingly. I had the issue multiple times when I was on a very low time warp (like x2) which does not let you to easily visually determine it, and I just missed the staging resulting in reloads/catastrophes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYet again, default settings for landing legs make crafts bounce like mad, fall over etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFairrings should default to a much more force (like half or\u00A0max) as on default settings it barely moves. It seems not to have collision so it was never really an issue for me, but visually it is a disaster unless you manually change it to max.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI would appreciate if \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in vertical position would not automatically turn off when touching down for stabilization purposes. It generally lets your craft fall over when it is crucial to stabilize.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nMerging subassemblies in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E results in\u00A0a pretty chaotic staging plan. It would be cool if they could be\u00A0 more natural like consequential or something.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI do not understand why you can\u0027t plan maneuvers during game pause. Is this a decision? I do respect some realism but I do not think it adds any positive experience. So my personal vote goes for allowing it or at least making it a part of a possible future difficulty setting.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIt seems KSP2 went a different route for the maneuver burn duration - it is planned to start exactly at the planned point as opposed to KSP1 making it extend equally both ways, so we are getting a lot more unpredicted orbital changes. I am not sure if it is a good idea, but it is up to you devs to decide. But the best example would be like periapsis burn with a weak engine - would result is a nice AP change in KSP1 but in KSP2 it will also result in a slight ellipse rotation. This is not a really big issue, just a remark, as the game provides you with actual results on your maneuvre nicely.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere is a feature which was never in KSP1 so this one is an idea. When planning gravity assists on say Jool moons, you can\u0027t predict their positions so you blindly fiddle with your maneuver waiting if you will get a pretty random\u00A0encounter. It would be cool if you could see the ghosts of planets when you hover over any point of your trajectory, seeing their positions when you reach said point on the trajectory. It would be absolutely awesome for planning encounters.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn the tracking station when looking at planets there is a load of info on them, however they all miss the height of the atmosphere used for planning atmos experiments so you can enter said atmo and not burn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIn research tree you are given XL fuel tanks as a root node in Tier 4 but you do not get any engines/engine plates\u00A0up until the farthest node. I do not see this remotely balanced.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI did not like that you get miniaturized versions of the same experiments which makes no sense. You might provide dirrerent form factors but they should have their ups and downs.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe long range (parabolical) antennae do not snap\u00A0to connection points like noses etc and only have freeform placement. I think they should be able to snap.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll of the \u0022delete\u0022 options should be highlighted red. Especially those for deleting savegames or whole playthroughs. Save with deleting crafts. Btw it was really hard to find option to delete the craft in tracking station. You get the easy option for obvious debris, but for working crafts it is really hard to find\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBugs that made issues for me:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe most annoying one was issues after savegame load. Had some vehicle parts be randomly shifted on the vehicle (at least visually cause the craft seemed to hold like they are there), but sometimes still resulting in catastrophic events like kraken or something else.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E even with the help of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E provides a lot of wobbliness and sometimes turns a vehicle in a \u0022curve\u0022 (if you let it draw a line on the compass) leading to very long turns and bad stabilization. Maybe it\u0027s me and the actual placement of said wheens and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters, but I do not think it is convenient in any form. It also often did impact my trajectory, so again, seems pospositioned but it should be explained better I guess.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen fiddling with symmetry boosters the game breaks fuel lines/struts attached from said boosters to the main body.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFairring stays in Staging plan even after it was deployed\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s it for now, wanna sleep.
