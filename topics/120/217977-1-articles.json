I don\u2019t recall) but I really hope it\u2019s much sooner than that. \u00A0Being able to use a joystick, or a gamepad with sticks to have smoother precise control while flying would make this game soooooo much better. Flying a plane using keys on a keyboard feels very awkward to me.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would make wobbly rockets much less wobbly as well. Currently when you are controlling your rocket you are pressing the WASD keys on your keyboard. Which is basically like going from 0% input to 100% input. That sudden change in motion certainly causes a lot of wobble on your rocket. \u00A0Using a gamepad or a joystick to be able to slowly ease into a turn would be much smoother and rockets wouldn\u2019t wobble as much. Plus it would be more realistic rather than the sudden jolts of movement tapping the keys on the keyboard.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand the devs have other priorities like bugs and performance and other things they are working on.. but being that this is a game about flying planes and rockets, having the best options for flight movement should be a higher priority than where it currently is imo. \u00A0 \u00A0So please devs\u2026 please implement this into the game sooner rather than later. \u00A0I love this game and im having a blast playing it. \u00A0But I really wish I could have smoother controls.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Capt.

Nate is actually a huge fan of HOTAS, so it is something we talk about occasionally.
