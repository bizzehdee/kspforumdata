We have introduced a number of mitigations to address aspects of that issue (altering inertia tensor values to decrease joint issues that emerge when high-mass and low-mass parts are connected, introducing various bespoke multi-joint augmentations to areas of known over-flexibility), but we still see this as an area where major improvement is needed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor whatever reason, a large number of people I\u0027ve seen discussing this topic believe that the devs aren\u0027t interested in changing the joint system as it stands now in EA KSP2/KSP1, and operating off of this misconception.

Nonetheless, I\u0027ve tried to best condense my own reasons why I think wobbly rockets (as in, flexible, elastic joints, not breakable joints; see above if you need a reminder) are detrimental to KSP\u0027s gameplay visions as they stand now (again, acknowledging that the final iteration in KSP2 is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E going to be how it is right now), based on my experiences of KSP1:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EFlexible joints are frustrating particularly for new or inexperienced players, as it is an unintuitive and difficult-to-mitigate barrier to launching early rockets.\u003C/strong\u003E In my time helping new players on various servers and communities, one of the biggest sources of difficulty for getting into orbit for the first time is wobbly rockets, and not in the ways more experienced players playing modded or tweaked versions of the game might expect. I\u0027ve seen it happen many times where a new player in a Discord call has designed a rocket that seems perfectly capable of flying straight and stable, but the small deflections caused by springy joints can lead to a cascading instability. The most common example in my experience helping new players is when micro-oscillations suddenly compound into an unrecoverable situation:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022image.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002245.88\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 style=\u0022width:800px;height:auto;\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1039965578754007060/1126306366303240283/image.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s a big source of frustration because it\u0027s almost impossible to really account for until it\u0027s too late: the fluctuations are so small that new players can easily miss them, and once they become obvious it\u0027s often too late. Newer players early in Science or Career mode often also have only a limited selection of parts to help control and stabilise. Additionally, inputs via keyboard or even through overcompensating \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E can make the oscillations worse.

One of the odd things about structural stability is how much on \u0022vibes\u0022 it goes off of in KSP1: the game will calculate things like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E in or out of atmosphere or how much \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E each stage your rocket has depending on payload and fuel/engine properties, and countless details about mass, fuel consumption, and even impact strength are exposed in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. My assumption was that this was meant to ensure that any failures the players experienced were due to mistakes on their fault and not because the game obscured information it had. Hence, it\u0027s always been strange how it was difficult to answer questions like \u0022how heavy can my radial boosters be before these radial decouplers give out and I need to consider adding reinforcing struts?\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI realise it\u0027s probably not possible now given how joint stresses are simulated on the fly and not an inherit property of each part\u2014nonetheless, maximum loading capacity for critical attachment points like radial decouplers not being listed feels like a very strange departure from what a player is led to expect from in-game parts documentation.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESpring joint simulations are very taxing on hardware and is difficult to program\u003C/strong\u003E. This one I admit is more guesswork based on limited experience of how games are programmed, but from my understanding simulating a lot of joints as flexible soft-body springs is very expensive, at least as described by the devs themselves. From what I know it also often lends itself to cascading problems: some users have reported how the small gap created in between two parts that are bent from each other causes increased drag, compounding situations like the one mentioned previously. I can also imagine it leads to a lot of headaches regarding collision boxes and krakens.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo reiterate, I understand that KSP2 devs share many of these concerns and that they are aiming to change this joint model for KSP2; this is merely my attempt at zeroing on the specific problems of the current model.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe case...\u003Cem\u003Efor \u003C/em\u003Ewobbly rockets?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s also worth pointing out to ourselves that there are certain gameplay opportunities to wobbly rockets that we need to keep in mind, even if they are compromised in the current state of KSP1/2. I want to take a nuanced approach to these though and try to drill down what these benefits are, though, since it will inform how a new solution can be designed for KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWobbly rockets provide feedback to the player as to the viability of their craft design\u003C/strong\u003E. In addition to watching many new players fumble with the micro-oscillation problem, I\u0027ve also noticed a lot of players who discovered the importance of structural stability for large craft through the flexible joints. There have been times when I\u0027ve watched a new player strap two SRBs to their core stage with a single decoupler each and watching them bow inwards due to the amount of thrust they are dealing with. Aside from them finding it funny (which we\u0027ll get to in a bit), it does also provide visible (if exaggerated) feedback to their design: you need a heftier joint or more reinforcement.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis does get diminished by how the joints can feel \u003Cem\u003Eso \u003C/em\u003Eelastic that they seem unbreakable, because it suggests your rocket is made out of indestructible bundles of rubber bands, which may undermine attempts to suggest limitations in the structural strength of joints. Nonetheless, I believe that any new solution should at least retain (and improve) how this system is valuable in the form of feedback.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIt\u0027s fun and funny.\u003C/strong\u003E This point might be more contentious, but I think in hyperfixating on this specific point from June 16th\u0027s upnate the community (and maybe even the devs) failed to find the nuance in the statement. See my above distinction between having wobbly rockets vs having destructible joints: here, I don\u0027t think that wobbly rockets and flexible joints themselves are necessarily part of KSP DNA, but rather the experience of trial, error, and comedic mishap. Having played this game for very long and seeing players of different intents and backgrounds play, I don\u0027t think I recall much in the way of people finding fun in how rockets act like slinkies, but more with watching their designs fail is spectacular or unexpected ways, with boosters spinning rapidly or what not. I think this sense of finding joy in the sandbox of failure can be preserved without necessarily having flexible joints!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:20px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EArmchair game designer Kavaeric hypothesises a solution\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is the point where I go into armchair video game designer mode and try to come up with a concept that satisfies the points, which summarised are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe new solution should be intuitive to understand and not cause unexpected or unforeseeable vehicle failures for new players.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe new solution should work with the game\u0027s intent of giving players as much (or as little) information as they desire when constructing their rockets.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe new solution should be performant and scale well with many parts.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe new solution should provide avenues for the player to discover design flaws in their designs, both for players who prefer to scrutinise their craft in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E and for players who like to experiment and watch what happens in flight.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe new solution should not run counter to the game\u0027s spiritual and aesthetic/comedic tones of failure and mishap on the road to success.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInterestingly, my source of inspiration for a possible design solution is from the KSP Early Access cinematic launch trailer.

I\u0027m a fan of the film The Wind Rises (2013), which has a few moments where aircraft shake themselves apart from the stress. Miyazaki exaggerates the stress, bending, and motion of the aircraft, which could be a source of inspiration on how to depict structural failure of a craft in KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vlc_nXcedL57Tv.gif\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002253.80\u0022 height=\u0022269\u0022 width=\u0022500\u0022 src=\u0022https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1107055131511488723/1126382669446525018/vlc_nXcedL57Tv.gif\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAdditionally, my modded KSP1 game includes \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/188027-112x-shipeffects-continued/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003EShip Effects Continued\u003C/a\u003E, which adds to the soundscape of the game by introducing rattling and vibration sound effects when a craft is experiencing significant structural forces, such as during launch or re-entry.

This will not only add depth to the game for those looking to endlessly tweak their designs, but also can expand the potential of Kerbal Space Program as a STEM educational game by providing an approximation of static linear truss analysis, a concept very common across all areas of mechanical and aerospace engineering.

More stress fills the stat faster, and when the stat reaches a maximum threshold the joint breaks. Increased strain could then be tied to a random deflection transform to represent the deformation of the joint.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn conclusion I think shifting to this static joints system in lieu of the spring joint system currently implemented in both games will be an improvement in terms of a gameplay, aesthetic, and programming/performance overhead perspective.

The developers have already said that raising joint stiffness alone is not an acceptable solution. Further, when it comes to science and exploration mode, now an identical vessel can behave differently from game to game based on what technology you happen to have unlocked. This adds pitfalls for both players and developers alike when sharing vessels and/or bug reports.

That said, if wobbliness is to become a feature it needs to be reliable and controllable, and not an wild stupid random thing that is only there for annoying reasons and to impede you to make the rockets you want. I mean, if wobble is feedback for a too long rocket, or a poorly designed aerodynamics, or you forgot to configure the stage and one of the four planned thrusters didn\u0027t ignite, or if you misaligned something something, if its used as feedback for something useful that is bad if you do with an rocket and its possible to understand and avoid it from happening because there is a physical based gameplay plan for it to be happening the way it happens I think is acceptable to have it in the game, and even could be a fun opportunity for game youtubers to generate content.
