This is not trying to be a negative post, I\u0027m just saying that on ksp1 crashing felt almost tragic when attempting a real mission, however on ksp2 the game immediately shows you a fun little quip and basically pats you on the back for essentially a complete mission failure.

Go too far in either direction and you lose fans on the other side completely.

I don\u0027t care either. I like the \u0022freedom\u0022 to do that kind of stuff. If I want to dive more or less straight down from the Mun to Kerbin, why not? Orbiting the sun in a craft with windows, yeah, why not, if I want my craft to have windows? That\u0027s just freedom and nobody \u0022has to do\u0022 these kind of things, you can work out a smooth re-entry curve, build an (imaginary) fully-shielded craft to orbit the sun, whatever makes the player happy. And the \u0022seriousness\u0022 can be added via mods. I guess no one who plays KSP 1 with all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System (mod)\u0022\u003ERSS\u003C/abbr\u003E/RP-1 stuff (and whatever all those realism mods are called) is complaining that the game does not take things serious. There will hopefully be a time when KSP 2 reaches that state where all those mods become available and then the quesion is a non-issue anyway. But for now the level of \u0022seriousness\u0022 does not really matter and if the light-hearted tone it uses right now helps attracting a few new players, all the better (unfortunately new players will leave the game at the current level of quality very quickly).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I really DON\u0027T LIKE however: Ingame over-sized messages that state VERY obvious facts and can\u0027t be switched off yet (without mods).
