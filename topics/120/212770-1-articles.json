In the end, their miscalculation looks more complicated.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI did a test with MY size items. We would have to test with the other elements to find out if this is a problem that concerns all the elements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I\u0027ve seen, if you put a tank with an engine on a TT-38X side decoupler, that items is ignored in the deltaV calculation. If we connect tank directly to the central piece, it is counted.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you put a powder booster on a TT-38X decoupler, its fuel and weight seem to be taken into account. If it is connected directly to the center piece or to another powder booster, the calculated DeltaV decreases slightly. It\u0027s as if the weight was taken into account but not its fuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey have really weird bugs in this version.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
