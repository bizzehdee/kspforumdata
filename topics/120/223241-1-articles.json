There\u0027s a decent selection of methalox adapters so really just having methane and structural (e.g. no fuel) versions of those adapters would be nice, as currently the only option is to use a methalox with no oxidizer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFairly minor but also seems like it could be pretty easy to add.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: also I realize tubes do offer a good \u0022procedural\u0022 adapter solution for structural only.
