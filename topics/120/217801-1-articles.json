I agree it\u0027s weird that the Kerbals begin working on rockets well in advance of having mastered powered flight, and I\u0027d like to have the ability to build planes and explore the area surrounding the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E from the beginning of the game. Especially if science works anything like it did in KSP 1 where you can gain science from nearby areas.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOn the other hand, does that create a weird first time user experience. Since building planes is actually one of the harder things to do, since you really need to understand at least the basics of aerospace engineering to build anything that can actually take off. Would having plane parts unlocked from the beginning set new users up for failure? They\u0027d open up the game, see plane parts and think, \u0022oh I\u0027m supposed to build a plane first\u0022 and wrestle with that for an hour when they could have just stuck a single booster on\u00A0 a capsule and been on their way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
