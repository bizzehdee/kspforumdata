Often, it\u0027s hard to gauge a vehicle\u0027s proportions when I make it in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, in another piece of software I use frequently (Bricklink Studio, a digital Lego-building tool), they have the ability to import images as objects that you can then move around, adjusting size and orientation as you see fit. You can then use the image to get sizes/proportions right.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like such a feature would be very useful to those of us who build realistic vehicles, especially with the new flexibility offered by procedural wings (getting accurate sweep, dihedral, etc.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattihase","CreatedById":73161,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-09-20T15:48:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve certainly done the reverse in blender (using various construction games\u00A0 to rough out designs kinda gives me a better sense of proportions for things than defaultcube or even rough sketches, so for some things that kerbal is suited to, I\u0027ll slap a bunch of wings together, screenshot in ortho, and bring it in as reference), so a 2 way thing would be handy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
