What it would need the developers to do, would be to have the multi-player, but each player runs their own space agency. It doesn\u0027t really matter where each one is placed; but it would be better if they were on different planets, or solar systems, even, but that doesn\u0027t seem realistic. And that\u0027s it really, each player could now play in new ways. The way I imagined it would be like a \u0022Civilization\u0022 type thing. Where each player would try to expand their borders, setting up new colonies, try to conquer other players, or join together to make a new larger country. No matter what you do with it, I thought it sounded fun so I wanted to submit it, for the developers, and any players who might want to try it.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
