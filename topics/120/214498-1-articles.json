So much value to being able to see all parts on the vessel in one place, no need to hunt around in the dark trying desperately to find the correct part to click on. The ability to open the part manager in map mode (unless I\u0027m mistaken?) is so useful - de-rate your engines in the map while planning a manoeuvre, open your solar panels, adjust your parachute deployment settings, etc, all from one central menu. Just brilliant to have this built into the game in such a slick way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut! It really should \u003Cstrong\u003Enot\u003C/strong\u003E be what opens when you right click on a specific part. By clicking on a part you\u0027ve made an explicit choice that you want information about that part, not all the parts on the ship. The ability to see the details for exactly, and only, the part you clicked on has also got a ton of value. And I feel like this is where the disconnect comes from in the comments I\u0027ve seen in Youtube videos - people frustrated that they don\u0027t need to see all parts on the ship when they right-click the engine. And really, you don\u0027t need that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo totally support the suggestion in this thread - was going to make a similar one myself. Please don\u0027t remove the new part manager, but improve it by implementing a part-specific version for right-click. You could maybe go even further by having a \u0027pop-out\u0027 or \u0022up\u0022 button on the right-click display to open this out in to the full part manager or something. The mods that added central part lists in KSP1 were always really useful - but crucially they didn\u0027t remove the standard \u0022one part right click\u0022 method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-08T21:21:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224252685\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214498\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678042772\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022150811\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Aziz\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/5/2023 at 6:59 PM, The Aziz said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll it needs is to open the manager window resized to whatever part is picked, not full screen height.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as it scrolls to show the desired part automatically\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt would be a real pain if you needed to find it yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sea_Kerman","CreatedById":226149,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-08T21:45:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the current implementation does not allow you to have multiple parts open and onscreen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Picard2","CreatedById":227404,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-09T10:05:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224255120\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022214498\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221678311926\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022226149\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Sea_Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n12 hours ago, Sea_Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso the current implementation does not allow you to have multiple parts open and onscreen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah this needs addressing.
