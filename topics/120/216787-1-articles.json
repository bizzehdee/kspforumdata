Likewise, parts are sometimes more detailed information visually than necessary in an effort to look great. Frequently, it appears that more digits are used than necessary in both things. The extra precision is a great option, but a problem for mega structures, time warps, etc.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do not think it would be that hard to add a mega engineering game setting that basically rounded everything today fewer digits.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFurthermore, I think it would be helpful to allow players to build both stationary features on planets and linked structures. This would greatly help players build mega structures. Please let me explain.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStationary features would be built either with existing parts or a new expansion building pack. Once built, the structures wouldn\u0027t be able to move and would just feature like existing structures and planets. They would allow players to attack stuff to them, drive on them, etc, just as if they are part of the planet or whatever they are placed on. Players can load the structures on a rocket, fly then to where they want, but once deployed, they would forever lock into place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLinkable structures would be able to combine to each other and other parts. Again, they are built and moved to their final location. Once their they are deployed and locked into relative position. They can move internal parts, but they stay locked together in position.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor example, if someone wants to build a space elevator, they can build a tall thing as a stationary figure, and and another on top of it, and another and another and lock each on top of the other to make the core. Then, can place a series of linked structures along it\u0027s side.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf someone wanted to build a massive Colony base, they could build the immobile parts with features and the functional parts with linked structures. The game physics would lock the attachment points and keep the physics so it doesn\u0027t wobble or anything because these types of things would be set stationary except for internal movement.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHuge space stations could be made this way with the only movement being everything rotating. Once locked in place, no new external acceleration or movements beyond everything just following the orbit.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis would basically allow for huge structures where the game doesn\u0027t need to calculate physics for individual parts after they are deployed.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI understand that this can be used to hack some stuff, so maybe only allow it as a cheat in sandbox, but I feel like it would really allow creativity and be a good thing.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have one more suggestion that I want to add, an engine designer. Obviously, this would be a future expansion for ksp2. This would allow people to literally design an engine. Ksp2 would then simulate the physics of the engine in a special simulator. It could be tested in that. Afterwards, the engine would be assigned statistics based on simulator performance and from then on function based on those stats.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, the player would design the size, fuel intake, cooling, nosel pressure, and everything. 3d design it. Then the game software would analyze that and create stats. This not just the player entering numbers and making stuff bigger and smaller, but designing it like a real life engine. A great design should be able to actually perform better than the existing designs, but the vast majority of early player attempts should blowup or provide little thrust. This isn\u0027t easy, but it would be fun and educational.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeally, plane engines could be designed also, as well as plane fan blades and rotors. As well as dual engines. Players could add turbines for power generation capabilities for engines or do the reverse and make them hybrid or electric.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe great things is that this would allow the game to process the engine once when it is designed and free up resources after. Thus, allowing for the game to increase max rotation speed substantially. For example, say that a fan blade plane engine design has a clockwise 8 blade rotor followed by a counter clockwise 8 blade rotor inside a fan. Behind that, the engine injects fuel through 16 ports into an chamber and so you have basically 3 sources of propulsion in the one engine. The engine simulation would just simulate that and calculate the engine stats like isp, thrust at various speeds, drag, etc, and once these are calculated during design, they become the engine stats. Thus, they are not taxing the game engine during flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe total effect is much, much better game performance and also the ability to do previously impossible stuff. Basically, working around the problem that physics are resource intensive to calculate.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now, anything like this is calculated in the game and blows up. By basically allowing players to build new parts like this, you give players the best of both worlds.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realize that this is something that would take years and a new expansion, but I think it is worth discussing and consideration. Thank you for making the ksp series and considering my awesome ideas.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
