This would allow two things. Firstly it would allow cheat launches where the player can just spawn a craft in orbit or on the Mun or whatever, just to verify that a craft works or has enough fuel to land etc. And secondly it would allow testing launches without fear of killing Kerbals when playing with quick loading disabled. So just like the real world, our kerbal engineers could run simulations before launching actual rockets.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs an added bit of realism, once science and/or career mode has been implemented, being able to preform test launches could be limited to places that have already been visited, or require the player to run a particular test in each area to unlock them. For example, a player would need to have made it into Kerbin orbit to be able to start test launches in Kerbal orbit. Then reach the Mun with a real launch to start Tests in orbit of the Mun, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
