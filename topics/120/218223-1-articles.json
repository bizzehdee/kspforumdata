It is very annoying!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) When I am using Map mode to plan a maneuver, it is sometimes necessary to rotate around Kerbal (or the planet I happen to be orbiting) to find the right position, but using the mouse to rotate around it spins the image so fast that it is impossible to easily get to the desired position. The rotation function is way too sensitive!\u00A0 There needs to be a scaling factor in settings to allow more precise alignment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPaul\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-06T06:15:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224299934\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022218223\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221688545011\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022189849\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Paulyuk6\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n21 hours ago, Paulyuk6 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen I swap view between my craft and map mode, then swap back again, it has forgotten the level of zoom so that, often, the camera is right up again the side of the craft (or even inside it!) , so I have to zoom out to get a full view of it.
