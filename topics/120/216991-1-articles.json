It appears it is being art-driven, not tech-driven, but it is supposed (at least many forum users thing so) to be a space sandbox/vehicle builder first, a vfx-feast last. Maybe I am wrong. But in no project of mine (not a game dev) would I have set the artists to polish up every little detail before the software was as good as ready. Even in pre-releases that you run parallel to existing to-be-replaced sytems for testing you see to that the UI works and systems are working and not too ugly to use, but polishing everything up is simply not necessary in that phase and would even work against the processes, as throwing UI systems, assets etc. is harder when many hours have been spent on them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the community is ready for a reset - freeze up everything, reduce scope to something new (interstellar travel), work on the foundation properly, without having sacrificing expensive assets again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-05-02T10:55:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/02/2023 10:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMay 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by dr.phees\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stephensmat","CreatedById":200752,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-05-02T11:49:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA few stranded Kerbals, who need to go home; but it\u0027s a project that takes decades.

Interstellar travel opens up the way back home but also to other planets. The story\u00A0 could provide a \u0022choice\u0022. Once the technology is developed, the Kerbals can go home or simply decide to send a probe with that technology to Kerbol system and explore other systems. Depending on how KSP will handle it, you might be able to send two ships, even. Or make a quick visit at Kerbin collect resources, Kerbals, equipment and move on to somewhere else.
