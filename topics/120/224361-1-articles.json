I had a feeling that it might have had to do with the bug where the game thinks your ship is landed, but it\u0027s actually in orbit, and your orbital line is missing. I found a fix on another thread where you edit a .json config file somewhere, and that seemed to have fixed it, but my theory is that that bug breaks the mission conditions, causing the mission not to be marked as completed when you return to Kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI installed the \u0027Community Fixes\u0027 mod, which fixed the landing condition bug, and also has a fix for missions not marking as completed correctly. Not sure which community fix was the actual solution, but I re-flew the mission, and it was marked as completed this time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks like the developers are going to be releasing an update soon that will address some of these issues, so if you\u0027re having trouble with this mission, it might be best to just wait for the next game update.
