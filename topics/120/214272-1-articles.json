I\u0027d judge based on the state of the game when they announce a Science Update date...if they\u0027ve made leaps and are done with 80% of the functionality bugs and are starting parse through visual quirks, robotics would be likely. If they\u0027re still dealing with a lot of functionality stuff, I\u0027d imagine they\u0027ll punt robotics if possible, and minimize the number of complex core functions to bug fix in the next update to give the team more time to focus on core functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
