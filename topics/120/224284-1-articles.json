Pre-release: got it, but I can\u0027t highlight the strengths of the missions/story up to that point if I don\u0027t observe the as-is is stony cold dead at that point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat I specifically want to point out are three major weaknesses I see recreated from KSP1 in KSP2 as it exists now:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1- Auto-fear: Resistance to adding rails for fear of \u0022spoiling the sim\u0022, (e.g \u0027auto\u0027 things, docking pilots, etc),\u003Cbr\u003E\n2- Too flimsy of a tech tree,\u003Cbr\u003E\n3- Inherent reward for risk only,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuto-fear:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve returned from Minmus and are eyeing the next planet, there are two reasons you might fire up KSP and and launch a rocket. 1/ To start a journey; Duna, Eve maybe, Jool? 2/ For the sake of launching a rocket and experimenting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRewind a second. \u0022To start a journey\u0022? Yep - you were with me, too. But that\u0027s not what the game is going to let you do. The game is going to make you go through all the same rookie slog involved in getting your vehicle to orbit. While that\u0027s not the worst thing, if KSP2 wants to be more than just a launch sim, it needs to break the vice-like grip of the fear of automation. Why do we allow you to start with a fully loaded vehicle, why don\u0027t we make you wait for tanking? Why doesn\u0027t the game ship with bad weather so you might have to wait until tuesday next week (real time) to launch your rocket?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not proposing that launch needs to be skippable, but by the time you\u0027re ready to start heading to Duna/Eve, you ought to be able to play passenger on your kerbin launches.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn MMO terms, KSP2 forces you to start every level by walking back to Stormwind/Orgrimmar, doing kill-10-rat quests for all the vendors/random npcs, before finally working your way up to a single quest you will now be able to get 1-2 quests for the zone you now have to walk back to.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf I\u0027m in the mood for flying each and every one of my launches to assemble my manned trip to Jool, I can do that. Having an autopilot doesn\u0027t prevent me doing it, but it does reward me for my work so far by allowing me to spend more time on the next part of the gameplay. Hell, sometimes I want an auto-feature so I can just *watch* kerbal space program.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFlimsy-Tree:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of the purposes of tech-trees is player-teaching. \u0022Try this engine\u0022, \u0022you\u0027ve tried a solid engine, now try a liquid engine\u0022, \u0022and here\u0027s a parachute\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSPs tech tree is one of the worst in the industry. Near random gluts of stuff, sometimes with no obvious relation. And the way they\u0027re mixed makes it real hard to forge your own path, and the jumps in sc-cost tends to lead people to completion-spend. Which means they never experiment with those science-spends.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere need to be way more nodes, more layers and more options. Infact, maybe we, as players, don\u0027t need to see the tree at all. You could visualize various different vehicles and highlight the parts that scientists are currently \u0022experimenting\u0022 with as a way of showing what\u0027s currently available to research.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIMHO almost every single upgrade - except variants - should be individually selectable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut won\u0027t that require a lot more science?

But doing things *can* be inherent - KSP already relies on that fact heavily, it just doesn\u0027t leverage it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWatching stuff explode or crash is fun, but it\u0027s also punitive: you get nothing for it. KSP ought to \u003Ci\u003Ereward\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0failure to properly integrate it as part of gameplay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs long as parts of crashed vehicles are recoverable - and you could build around that - they could produce science, for instance. You should be able to get 1 science point from every single component in the game by launching a launch-clamp holding one and dropping it from \u0026gt; 100ft. \u0022crash tolerance\u0022. Another point for burning one up in every atmosphere? How about some science for overheating and destroying engines? Blowing up a tank with a badly placed separatron?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLook at this way:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlayer has two vehicles in orbit for their first attempt at docking. The game autosaves, and they begin docking, but they\u0027re not watching their mp and when they finally get an accidental roll under control they realize they\u0027re out of fuel and the two vehicles are going to crash at unsurvivable speed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDoes the player:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na) let the vessels crash, return to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E and launch 2 more ships?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nb) hit esc and avoid the annoying mistake?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy would anyone select a?

When it launched, you could spawn at any friendly forward base alone the front line, and drive, ride, or walk, towards the nearest \u0022enemy\u0022 town. The dream come true. Do you know how fun it is to talk 15km in a video game with birds tweeting in the distance, only to find an empty, poorly modelled village? Or to crawl thru ditches towards one for 2 hours only to have your screen go black inexplicably, because the bullet reaches you before the sound of the shot. Well, that\u0027s one of the reasons not many people have heard of the game (even tho it is *still* running, lol).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOne of the biggest cluster-fs in the game was finally realizing the melding of the naval aspect of the game and the land aspect: cargo ships. But, not wanting to break the spirit of the simulation, every troop and vehicle that the ship was going to carry had to be loaded onto the ship. That is:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Spawn the ship,\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. Convince people they want to ride a freighter to the battle happening _right now_ in Kaalmthout or Antwerp or somewhere,\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. Sail the ship into harbor and line it up against the dock,\u003Cbr\u003E\n4. Raise the crane and turn it out over the side of the ship,\u003Cbr\u003E\n5. Get a tank/atg/truck to drive in under the crane,\u003Cbr\u003E\n6. Lower the crane, find the hitching point, get the vehicle hitched,\u003Cbr\u003E\n7. Raise the crane, carefully, swing it over the hatch,\u003Cbr\u003E\n8. Gently lower the vehicle without damaging it and place it onto the cargo bay,\u003Cbr\u003E\n9. Unhitch the vehicle without dropping it,\u003Cbr\u003E\n10. Have the vehicle find the parking spot and \u0022mount\u0022 the ship,\u003Cbr\u003E\n11. Repeat,\u003Cbr\u003E\n12. Sail a WWII freighter vessel across a half-scale English channel, while the players stay connected to their in-game troopers/vehicles,\u003Cbr\u003E\n13. Hope the fight remains at a coastal town you can reach during the *2 hours sailing time*,\u003Cbr\u003E\n14. Try not to get bombed/strafed/sunk by enemy air patrols who have a reasonably good sense of where freighters would be launching from,\u003Cbr\u003E\n15. Try to reach a piece of coastline sufficiently far away from the fight that you won\u0027t get shelled/bombed before you can unload,\u003Cbr\u003E\n16. The freighter didn\u0027t have a cargo ramp, so ... find a spot where you can use the crane to unload vehicles without dropping them into the water. Use the life boats to lower troopers down and hope you\u0027re not too far out...\u003Cbr\u003E\n17. Despawn, because f**k sailing back.\u003Cbr\u003E\n18. Never do this again after all the complaints you get from people who disco\u0027d, sank, drowned, or who didn\u0027t get to the target until after it had been captured and the frontline moved away.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt absolutely made sense that there be a player-investment in the loading of the vehicle, so that it wasn\u0027t just a magic firehose-for-one whereby if one player can get a boat into position X they could spawn an entire army on the enemy; but the vice-like grip of the auto-fear meant that there was no willingness by certain team members to even consider ideas where any part of that process wasn\u0027t entirely manual/humanized. My concept was for to add supply trucks/engineers who could execute sorties to the docked ship, the ship would operate its crane to take loads onboard, and then when it reached the opposite end it would be able to provide/deploy an amount of resources corresponding to the amount of effort that went into loading.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBecause on the rare occasion when people were insane enough to mount actual coastal assaults, almost invariably the outcome was that the reduction in number of combatants *at* the fight ended up killing the fight. You might be willing to spend 2.5 hours boarding a ship and sailing to 50km away from your planned destination, but will the enemy wait there or despawn and go someplace else?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhat I\u0027m aspiring to here for KSP2 is that it be possible in some game modes to earn additional launch assistance so that you can *feel* you are moving your focus onto the next stage of gameplay.

This system could be also cool for a career mode, were you on background launch stuff for customers (instead of launching all costumer satellites by hand as in KSP1) \u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mattihase","CreatedById":73161,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-04T17:57:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224376386\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224284\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221711831126\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153177\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kfsone\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/30/2024 at 8:38 PM, kfsone said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nall signs so far are that the engine won\u0027t be any better at keeping a billion ton mass stationary on the surface of a planet than KSP1 was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought ground colonies were going to be a type of semi-static surface feature, not vessels (hence the change of the editor\u0027s name from vehicle assembly building to object assembly vehicle).

I think one of the issues with KSP2 missions is that you get side missions only once you complete main story missions (if I\u0027m remembering that correctly), this makes there be a feel that those missions are going to stop coming even before you complete the main story mission.
