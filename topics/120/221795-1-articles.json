It would be incredibly comfortable. You will be able to easily keep track of which locations you have visited and which have not yet been explored. This reduces to zero the chance that you will make a mistake and fly to an already visited location a second time. There will be no more confusion and no need to memorize what you have visited\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is very sad to see scientific reports only \u0022once in a lifetime\u0022 in case you fly to a faraway place. Now It\u0027s very easy to accidentally skip the science report and not see or understand something in the game\u0027s story, the content created by the writers is only visible to the player once. With the archive you will be able to read again any report you have done to understand the lore, to remember something or just for interest sake\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen you have an archive, the feeling that you are discovering something and increasing knowledge about the world increases many times over, you feel like a researcher. Your discoveries can be viewed at any time and they are expressed not only in the number of science points. The fact that you have an archive of lore knowledge increases the immersiveness of the game\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
