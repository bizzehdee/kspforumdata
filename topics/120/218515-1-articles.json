I know these are designed to protect us from ourselves, but I\u0027d like the option take off the bubble wrap so to speak. I admit I\u0027m perhaps a somewhat impatient person so I tend to play the game in as high a time warp as possible. And yes sometimes that leads to me smashing into things without the reaction time to stop it. But I never blame the game for that. So I\u0027d really like the ability to just disable the \u0022you can\u0027t time warp under this altitude\u0022 feature in the options. Or have options to\u00A0set all the altitude limits so it would still automatically decrease time warp below given altitudes, but do so based on my preferences rather than what is safest.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"joratto","CreatedById":218497,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-22T12:33:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe biggest issue for me is that you can be in a completely stable low orbit and still unable to timewarp quickly without VEEERY slowly switching back to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, and then to the tracking station. In KSP1, it was really nice to be able to skip many orbits quickly when you\u0027re trying to intercept two vessels, and especially when one vessel is in an inclined orbit and you need to wait for that orbit to pass over a point of interest on a planetary surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn particular, extremely slow timewarp in low orbit makes Gilly a pain in the butt to fly around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this is just a temporary band-aid for unintended orbital decay. If orbital decay isn\u0027t fixed soon, I hope they\u0027ll remove that band-aid regardless.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-07-22T12:35:34Z\u0022 title=\u002207/22/2023 12:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jul 22\u0022\u003EJuly 22, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by joratto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CiberX15","CreatedById":68461,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-23T02:39:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly in KSP 1 I just modded the heck out of the game so I could time warp at much lower altitudes to achieve the same effect. The mod also let me physics warp a lot faster than the game really wanted me to be able to do. Se aforementioned impatience.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill I think it\u0027s a fair concern. Basically any mission past simply getting into orbit is going to have a lot of long time gaps in between which is why we need time warp in the first place. If the warp is so low and slow that it\u0027s still tedious to get through those periods, I consider that sub optimal game play.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually another similar potential solution for this would be for the \u0022Warp to this point\u0022 option to bypass the time warp limits. Like, once we are on non-physics time warp, and we click a spot on our trajectory that we want to be at, assuming the trajectory is being correctly calculated, it should be a simple math equation to nearly instantaneously jump us forward in time. Or if the goal is to fully reliy on simulation, simply have the computer carefully calculate the time warp to avoid overshooting. Right now the auto time warp seems very tentative about speeding up, when it really should be slamming on the gas and breaks because it is a computer with millisecond reaction time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
