For example, Matt Lowne encounters confusion here:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/2E2jScl41w8?t=2245\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/2E2jScl41w8?t=2245\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0at around 37:30 when ascending from the Mun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ESuggested implementation\u003C/u\u003E: An octagon is not yet used as a symbol - perhaps an orange or white octagon icon can indicate target prograde and the same symbol with bisector hash-marks can indicate target-retrograde. There is a little bit of space between the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E controls and the time-warp controls so two additional symbols should fit. These can be context dependent and only show on the user interface after a target is selected to avoid clutter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are some advantages to displaying redundant information across different modes. A previous UI improvement in KSP1 was to show map information (apogee, perigee) when not in map-view. Showing \u0022target\u0022 mode information when in surface/orbital mode is a similar improvement where target-prograde and target-retrograde information would be useful to see while launching back to orbit - and to avoid some current confusion which exists between switching between different modes. The target mode would need to continue to exist because that mode shows additional information like target location and adding all information from target mode into the other modes would create too much UI clutter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
