They all look the same in the orbital view because they have the same icon, in KSP1 there was many icons this was very useful in organizing stuff.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso if I clear the filters the entire list disappears but... everything still shows in the orbit view. I can see myself playing this for 30 days... 2 ships per day... and the orbital view is a big mess. The list does not recognize different types of stuff like rovers, space stations, probes, satellites, ... and I think this is important for any KSP player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for icon bar at the top (KSP1) vs the text list (KSP2)... Our brains can process that icon bar in a fraction of a second, what is on or off, is very simple and effective. The text list not as easy not even in alphabetical order and I think the list will increase with all the landers, stations, pods, .... just does not work for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbtw: debris delete bug... many posts about it... skip\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u002220230228185433-1.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.ibb.co/89Sdc9V/20230228185433-1.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
