Or even being able to choose a control point. I\u0027m building a rocket that carries 8 satellites/relay probes. For whatever reason every time I go to launch my ship is at a 45 degree angle on the nav Ball. My relays are placed in the rocket at a 45 degree angle so I assume my root part is being forced onto one of my probes instead of my main probe for flight orientation of the rocket.
