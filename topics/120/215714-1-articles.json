A variation of this idea could be to randomly select a spacecraft in orbit around a celestial body, and automatically generate a main menu screen featuring that craft.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother tangent - perhaps the pre-existing main menu crafts could be in orbit around other bodies in the various systems in KSP2. It would be amazing to see a space station orbit Jool, or Glumo on the main menu screen\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazooka","CreatedById":226666,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-22T09:18:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027d be a pretty cool feature\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt could also work for landed craft, like bases or landers.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMaybe to reduce bugs and disappointment it would select craft in a specific size, so its not too small (like a single core probe) and not too big (like a station) that may crash the game on start-up\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
