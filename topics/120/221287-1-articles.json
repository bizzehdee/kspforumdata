I\u0027m not making a bug report yet because I don\u0027t feel like I have much information about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut over the last few days I\u0027ve been launching a handful of ships and leaving them in Kerbin orbit. Sometimes when I switch back to them after doing something else, I\u0027ve found them throttled up to full, burning fuel and changing their orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I\u0027m 100% sure I shut off the throttles before switching away from the vessel. This might be because I\u0027m launching a bunch of ships one after another, sometimes returning to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E to build another, sometimes reverting after a failed launch, sometimes switching to the tracking station or directly to another ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt always seems to be only the throttle. I\u0027ve never had a deactivated engine, activate itself. It doesn\u0027t seem to happen regularly or even that often. I can close and save the game and return to a vessel that was affected and it won\u0027t happen the next time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it\u0027s because I\u0027m switching away or leaving the vessel right after cutting rhe throttle? And the throttle down isn\u0027t saved by the game when I leave it? I\u0027ll try waiting a bit after throttling down before switching away or doing a bit of time warp at zero throttle first in the future to see if that stops it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt might even throttle up, or forget that I throttled down shortly after switching away from a vessel. As on two occasions I\u0027ve returned to a vessel after a while to find its throttle at full and it has burned more than half a tank of fuel I left it nearly full with. Though strangely without the change in orbit I would have expected. These were both huge hydrogen nuclear tankers, with between 200 and 400 tons of hydrogen. When I left them, their engines were off and the tanks were almost full. When I returned the engines were on full and the tanks were half empty. But they were still in stable circular obits of kerbin.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll try and experiment with it after the new update tomorrow.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-19T04:50:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had it happen to me the last time I loaded a ship from the Tracking Station.
