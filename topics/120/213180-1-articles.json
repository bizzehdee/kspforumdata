The text that apparently says \u0022KSP2\u0022 is unreadable at taskbar scale (and also unreadable on my blue taskbar), and it\u0027s hard to make out what the logo is even of unless I go to windows explorer and set it to use large icons, and I basically use details mode in everywhere but my artwork folders. When I had it and KSP1 both open when I was doing comparisons I kept on accidentally always tabbing in to KSP1 as the much more distinctive icon and honestly when I initially downloaded the game it took a couple seconds to work out what file the executible even was.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGiven the branding I think it would be really appropriate to make an icon based around the red 2, or at least that shade of red, in other iconography for the game. To give it credit, the logo does look like it\u0027d make a nice mission patch if you embroidered it onto a polo shirt or something but it doesn\u0027t feel fit for purpose as a PC file system/taskbar icon, at least on windows.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
