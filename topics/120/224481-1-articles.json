This nature has been implemented since launch for many players due to the broken promises and broken time frames which has decreased the trust in the developers. If our dreams were filled, we would have photos and in-depth conversations about upcoming updates and regular communication.

You wouldn\u0027t even need to put in a bunch of details about the bugs, just a range based on the current \u0022dev-version\u0022 of the game that is being focused on to give an idea of progress in development to the community. You could put a disclaimer that the number can fluctuate upwards and downwards because of different \u0022dev-versions\u0022 of the game being considered the focused version, or because some changes broke something and now you are fixing those things while keeping what the original change fixed (this is what I imagine is happening right now and why its taken a while longer for this patch). Anyways I think this would be good because then the community would have a constant feeling of progress as the weeks go on.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E2. I think more engagement in the individual forums would be nice, not just when we ask but kinda closer to how the interactions on discord are. It would be nice to see everyday at least one thought given on a thread somewhere about something. It wouldn\u0027t always have to be serious stuff either, right now I am realizing a lot of the community gets a bit upset at the \u0022joking\u0022 and more \u0022fun-oriented\u0022 posts being made right now but that is more because they don\u0027t have much communications and want quality/qualitative posts when they happen. After getting over the hump, and when seeing CM posts are much more common, then the forums will feel more like a conversation with CMs than complaints to them constantly. Really just like once a day would be enough, even if half are joke/fun posts.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E3. I think that suggestions or things that CMs cant talk about should not be met with radio silence, but instead with a \u0022heard*\u0022 or a \u0022there is no information we are able to give right now*\u0022. This would give us more communication and make it feel like we aren\u0027t just talking into the void hoping that something sticks. (the * would be to indicate that these communications are not a direct \u0022this will be in the game\u0022 or a \u0022this will not be in the game\u0022).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways these are my thoughts on improvements to the current communications (as far as patch to patch goes). All of these suggestions/criticisms come from a place of respect and excitement for what is to come next both in the game and in the community.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-04-17T02:09:40Z\u0022 title=\u002204/17/2024 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Apr 17\u0022\u003EApril 17\u003C/time\u003E by Presto200\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Presto200","CreatedById":232857,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-17T02:11:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope to hear from CMs in the morning, maybe y\u0027all can talk a little about the improvements to communication that y\u0027all have come up with to deal with keeping the community up to date\u00A0\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/222601-nerdy_mike/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022222601\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/222601-nerdy_mike/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nerdy_Mike\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/225122-dakota/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022225122\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/225122-dakota/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Dakota\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ChadDude","CreatedById":229755,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-04-17T02:39:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224380690\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022224481\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221713318362\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022232857\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Presto200\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n45 minutes ago, Presto200 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am going to start my comment with a question for the CMs and then I will go into my further suggestions\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy question to the CM comes from the conversations that \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/222601-nerdy_mike/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022222601\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/222601-nerdy_mike/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nerdy_Mike\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0was having in the discord, he was talking about the roadmap and how development will follow it and all milestones will be fulfilled.

I think a good idea could be a \u0022next patch bugs squashed counter\u0022 (the name needs some work \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u00A0) somewhere on the forums that updates each week. You wouldn\u0027t even need to put in a bunch of details about the bugs, just a range based on the current \u0022dev-version\u0022 of the game that is being focused on to give an idea of progress in development to the community. You could put a disclaimer that the number can fluctuate upwards and downwards because of different \u0022dev-versions\u0022 of the game being considered the focused version, or because some changes broke something and now you are fixing those things while keeping what the original change fixed (this is what I imagine is happening right now and why its taken a while longer for this patch). Anyways I think this would be good because then the community would have a constant feeling of progress as the weeks go on.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E2. I think more engagement in the individual forums would be nice, not just when we ask but kinda closer to how the interactions on discord are. It would be nice to see everyday at least one thought given on a thread somewhere about something. It wouldn\u0027t always have to be serious stuff either, right now I am realizing a lot of the community gets a bit upset at the \u0022joking\u0022 and more \u0022fun-oriented\u0022 posts being made right now but that is more because they don\u0027t have much communications and want quality/qualitative posts when they happen. After getting over the hump, and when seeing CM posts are much more common, then the forums will feel more like a conversation with CMs than complaints to them constantly. Really just like once a day would be enough, even if half are joke/fun posts.\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E3. I think that suggestions or things that CMs cant talk about should not be met with radio silence, but instead with a \u0022heard*\u0022 or a \u0022there is no information we are able to give right now*\u0022. This would give us more communication and make it feel like we aren\u0027t just talking into the void hoping that something sticks. (the * would be to indicate that these communications are not a direct \u0022this will be in the game\u0022 or a \u0022this will not be in the game\u0022).\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyways these are my thoughts on improvements to the current communications (as far as patch to patch goes). All of these suggestions/criticisms come from a place of respect and excitement for what is to come next both in the game and in the community.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo starting off from the start:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAddressing the change for the road map here is what \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/225122-dakota/?do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022225122\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/225122-dakota/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Dakota\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0replies to somebody asking: \u0022Dakota, any chance the roadmap could be changed to deliver more requested features(colonies, interstellar) earlier, also, will all \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E need to wait for \u0022Resource Gathering\u0022 or will we see KSP1 style fuel production a lot sooner\u0022\u003Cbr\u003E\nDakota answers: \u0022though it\u0027s possible the roadmap could be changed, right now that\u0027s the plan we\u0027re sticking to\u0022.. hope that answers your question!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnto the communication suggestions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) This is probably unnecessary although I do not understand your idea fully due us having monthly kerb now which states every single massive bug they are focusing on.
