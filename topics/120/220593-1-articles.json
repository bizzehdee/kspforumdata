I always wonder why Valentina or Tim C disappear only to find them in my other assemblies that I\u2019m not going to launch. It\u2019s a bit of a hassle using workspaces with multiple assemblies because of this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14pt;\u0022\u003ESolution:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy solution is to remove kerbals from non-launch assemblies. This means that the launch assembly will have kerbals, but the other assemblies won\u2019t, and if I change the launch assembly to a different one, the kerbals of the first one gets removed from it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14pt;\u0022\u003EBenefits:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis will save me the hassle of hunting for my kerbals in different assemblies, which makes using workspaces easier!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope you like this!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTechieV\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-07T21:03:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter typing for some time trying to decide how this suggestion can be improved, I decided that it\u0027s fine as is. The game silently moving kerbals from assemblies you\u0027re going to launch later to assemblies you\u0027re going to launch now sounds like it could get confusing, and also prevents you from pre-assigning kerbals to different assemblies before saving the assembly file and sending them up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barrackar","CreatedById":197197,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-09T07:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe a small change to the interface where Kerbals who have been assigned to a command module remain in the list of unassigned kerbals - but are greyed out and moved to the bottom of the list. Then you could re-assign them to a different command module without having to find a command module they are currently in.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KUAR","CreatedById":229322,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-10T07:05:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBetter - scrap the current method and have a kerbal placement dialog after hitting the launch button.
