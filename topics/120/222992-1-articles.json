At 165km I started seeing plasma effects that lasted literally 10 seconds, stopped at 135km, halving my velocity without much else happening. another 10 seconds later the velocity was a mere 1000m/s, and at 120km I was going at 500m/s. From there is was pretty much a very slow, vertical descent at constantly reducing speed, slow enough to keep the solar panels open without breaking them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore it overheated and exploded in 3 seconds around 12km (just above the cloud layer (why even make the clouds if I can\u0027t get to them?)) I was going about 35m/s. Pretty underwhelming. I\u0027d expect a loooong reentry that would make me hold to my pants, scorching most of the ablator off the heatshield until not far above the clouds where it would begin slow descent, and then be crushed by pressure somewhere below the clouds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EVideo evidence:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/applications/core/interface/file/cfield.php?storage=form_Fields\u0026amp;path=atmd.mp4\u0026amp;fileKey=%5B!AES128GCM%5BIGDQA1Nto/MgKsbpDja3O2nNwp%2Bmqwn/5fV4BJah5Fg5e5cga5j41xl2ztyP%2BnPSmeXHvDSqPRIbC5dp9A==%5D%5B09c62f7c9b0a72da6326bafa%5D%5B8af61d35f612c53a18b94e3b4519a499%5D%5D\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eatmd.mp4\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-14T14:53:29Z\u0022 title=\u002201/14/2024 02:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 14\u0022\u003EJanuary 14\u003C/time\u003E by Spicat\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
