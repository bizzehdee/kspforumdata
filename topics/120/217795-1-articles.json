In KSP (without DLCs), you just press the \u0022give science\u0022 button, and in, at most, two seconds (other than the EVA science pack), you have extra science. Now you cat get it back to Kerbin, or transmit for less. With the temperature, pressure, Goo feelings (and some more) on and around Ike, you can unlock the all new 5m fuel tank for first stages. Having only one number to unlock the tech tree with makes it kinda bland. Just going somewhere you haven\u0027t been in that save, and pressing the \u0022give science\u0022 button for the same experiments until you can unlock what you want.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 (now for the ideas)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 - Have multiple science point types: In the tech tree there\u0027s a \u0022spectrum\u0022 of science types: for technical stuff (for probes, more science experiments, better antennas, etc), for Kerbal stuff (command pods, habitation modules, and other stuff that Kerbals use, etc), and for propulsion (engines, fuel tanks, etc) (if the fuel and engine systems are complicated in KSP2, these could be \u003Cspan\u003Eseparated\u003C/span\u003E into two types, but maybe not worth it).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 - Each science point type is gathered in a different way: the technical type can be unlocked trough scans, like the magnetometer, atm. analyzer, seismic scans, gravity scans (the KSP2 equivalent of those). The Kerbal type can be gathered with temperature and pressure scans (on that note, being able to scan the pressure in space, especially around planets without atmosphere, multiply times and still getting valuable science doesn\u0027t make sense), and especially successful flights with Kerbals in different environments. The propulsion type can be unlocked, reasonably, by using them, in different environments, with more expensive/complicated engines giving more points.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 - Data transmission \u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#7f8c8d;\u0022\u003E(and processing?)\u003C/span\u003E: I think data should send full science if it sends numbers (temperature, pressure, etc.), but with more complicated experiments (eg. atmosphere analyzer), it should send less than full, and like in KSP, you can transmit less science the worse your connection to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E is. For samples and observations, you shouldn\u0027t be able to transmit data at all (the breaking ground mystery goo ground experiment cheats since it has a camera). Data from a mobile lab should be sent at 100% (after the lab multiplier is added), since the scientists inside have realistically watched the image of goo enough to declare that \u0022the goo feels at home here\u0022. Of course the Kerbal science type should only be collected back on Kerbin. Maybe an engineer and a lab could go together to be able to transmit this type of data (engineer to see how the vessel \u003Cspan\u003Edisintegrate\u003C/span\u003Es, scientist to analyze). And for the propulsion type, you still need to get the science back, but based on the complexity of the engines and experience of engineers on board you can transmit/get more science when recovered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is what I think I would like to play (now, just because \u003Cem\u003EI\u003C/em\u003E ranted about this, doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s good or that even I\u0027ll enjoy it, but I hope the ideas are good)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-06-21T06:23:31Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2023 06:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Pi0neer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAccidentally sent the post\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
