As they make these changes, they\u0027ll be adding more science available and more tech to spend it on. It would be impossible to design for all players at every stage of progression unless they make all tech unlocked and points earned static regardless of where you got to up to that point. This makes sense given their stated goal for all players to keep playing their existing Exploration saves through updates. The difficulty scaling probably works on the same principle for consistency.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
