If it exists please merge this posting or delete it as redundant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you planning to create a separate widget for planning manoeuvers on the map screen (like in KSP 1, this was perfect)?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason I am asking is that when I focus my target (other ship or planet) and want to zoom in to get precise plannig this means I can\u0027t see my current orbit and the node with the controls that I need to manipulate in order to adjust the manoeuver. In KSP 1 I had the widget with all controls (and the slider to change their sensitivity -\u0026gt; genius design !) separately from the one on the current trajectory so I could easily manipulate the manoeuver node and still stay in the zoomed in view of my target to see the effects without having to make sure I can see the current orbit with the node.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs that already in the game and I just have not found it or does it not yet exist? If it is the latter, are you planning to add it or do I need to wait for the first \u0022precise manoeuvers\u0022 mod (which I believe already exists but I would love to see that functionality in stock KSP 2 as I don\u0027t want to add mods yet while the game is in EA and I want to write bug reports for unmodded scenarios).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spicat","CreatedById":228085,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-06-29T22:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, it would be neat, I believe they answered this question in today\u0027s ama saying it\u0027s planned.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor now we have a mod that do this:\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedauthorid=\u0022227189\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed4181112069\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/214244-maneuver-node-controller-080/?do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:197px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
