It is also nice to see detailed readouts of current vehicle stats side by side like mass, speed (surface/orbit), thrust to weight ratio, etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think having the option to open a details pane, like the parts manager, that has value readouts of \u0022Vessel Info\u0022 and \u0022Orbit Info\u0022 would be immensely useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
