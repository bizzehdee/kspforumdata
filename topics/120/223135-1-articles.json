I thought it would be cool if KSP2\u0027s soundtrack was put on some music streaming services, such as Spotify or Apple Music. One of my major things with large video game studios is that sadly, they frequently don\u0027t release their soundtracks onto these services. A lot of indie game developers do this, and I think it would be cool to listen to some of the KSP2 OST on my phone without using something like YouTube.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-01-19T20:43:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe, when it\u0027s completed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
