(picture below)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuddenly - especially looking into the Sun, it felt .... MUCH more realistic. Like watching actual space livestreams where you cannot see stars while the vehicle is very brightly lit, or the Sun is in view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat might be very easy implemented via camera exposure, that reacts to the actual light intensity - that would also allow for more realistic lighting at far away bodies like Eeloo. (It feels wrong that the Kerbols light intensity there is the same as on Moho.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne exception, in complete darkness - like in the shadow of a planet, i would keep the soft shine that\u0027s on everything, its still a game and you need to see what you are doing. (But maybe that would be also manageable via camera exposure?)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the speed the camera reacts to the light conditions is a matter of taste and maybe could be configurable...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022StarsNostars.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u0022166.67\u0022 height=\u00221200\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://fracturedreality.de/images/ksp/StarsNostars.jpg\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jastrone","CreatedById":208489,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-03-07T09:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nyhea sometimes the reflection and sun is just way to bright aswell. defenetly need this\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
