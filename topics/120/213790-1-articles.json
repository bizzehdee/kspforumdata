Each body having a unique sound is something that should have been in from day one as it is adding so much to the atmosphere and character of the body\u00A0 . The music is the reason I visited the planets again . I think the texture on Val definitely needs some work too. Overall I can see where the games going and I\u0027m liking the direction ,keep up the good work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"skogs","CreatedById":226458,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T00:35:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ndupe\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lekiffer","CreatedById":190778,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-28T00:36:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAm using 1660ti with an i5.
