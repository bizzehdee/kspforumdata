This is no stylistic overhaul suggestion (since I have my doubts that the developers will consider significant art style changes in the near future) but rather smaller things which are relatively easy to fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA lot of the UI elements are not properly aligned: most elements have a margin to the screen edge (and it is also inconsistent) while some elements are put right at the border of the screen. Either stick everything to the screen edge or give every element a consistent marign.\u00A0 Also especially in the lower right corner there are a lot of unaligned elements which is quite unpleasant to the eye. See the following screenshot with added guidelines and colored margins:\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler\u0022 data-ipsspoiler=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_header\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003ESpoiler\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsSpoiler_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022problems.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/YSnmTdw5/problems.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAddionally, the stage button is bit big in my opinion. Why not take some space of it to integrate that arrow button?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe time warp and game view panels in the lower center are too cramped considering they are shown in two distinct panels. Add a small margin in between.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe deltaV readout for the individual stages is too\u00A0 close to the stage number. Seperate them better by adding the unit and amybe also a small divider.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAs often criticized, the new navigational instruments take up a lot of screen space. Especially the new \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E controls panel is just unnecessarily large. If the devs don\u0027t want to take the KSP1 route with semi transparent buttons, I suggest a smaller bar with the most important buttons (lock, prograde, retrograde, maybe also maneuver node) while all the other rather rarely used buttons are hidden in a drawer only shown when the mouse hovers over the panel. (But of course it should also be able to be pinned and kept open). In addition to the most prominent buttons mentioned the main bar should also show the last used button from the extended list. With that, the current \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E direction is always visible and it\u0027s easy to quickly toggle between the main directions and one additional dynamic direction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe navball is also quite massive. Two things I suggest here: Remove the heading tape. It\u0027s unnecessary because you already get that information by the navball itself. (It is basically a 2D tape.) Use that new free space for other stuff which allows my second suggestion: Push the orbital info panel a bit into the navball panel to save even more space.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAlso it would be cool if users are allowed to reposition all elements freely to their liking.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe following screen shows how I imagine the screen to look like if all these things are integrated\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022proposal.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002260.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.postimg.cc/qBnzGJzV/proposal.png\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T15:37:19Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 03:37  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Lorion\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
