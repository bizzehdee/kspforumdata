It\u0027s just extra clicks compared to the KSP1 system, when the old alt\u002B worked fine. I wouldn\u0027t mind adding functionality to make alt\u002B to fine tune the Time Warp and regular increase to jump straight to 5x, 10x like in KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-04-21T14:05:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/21/2023 02:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EApril 21, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by MagicCuboid\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EvelynThe Dragon","CreatedById":227182,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-21T19:15:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe default keymapping for resetting time warp is the \u0027/\u0027 key. it\u0027s the fastest way to get there, but unfortunately, it is still slow enough that it can mess you up.
