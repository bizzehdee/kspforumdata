It could happen randomly when you crash or after some calculated value. The game will secretly record the past like 5-10 seconds and save it. After a year or so in game the player gets a prompt saying \u0022The annual failure report is in\u0022. If the player clicks on the prompt, they\u0027re taken to a fun presentation in front of a bunch of kerbals. The presentation is just a bunch of your \u0022highlights\u0022 throughout the year \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI guess this could also be done with accomplishments as well. It would be a neat feature to think about. Plus, playing into the kerbal personas is something KSP2 should do in my opinion.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you for your time!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zeekzeek22","CreatedById":223169,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T19:02:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI second this sort of feature (which could all be lumped into a category that can be toggled in settings with one click, for those who like their simulator without the silliness). This is definitely a long-future, probably past 1.0 feature, but these kinds of things would be really fun and could be exported as shareable videos.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027d be down with a vertical split screen: one side shows the crash, the other side shows the Kerbal audience who has great reactions to the crashes, including a cheer for a successful landing or something.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMaybe it could be a tab in the training center titled \u0022Debriefs\u0022 or something, and you can click in and it will have a few autogenerated ones...an achievements debrief, a crashes debrief, and maybe other tools for sharing recorded footage, with features accumulating to make it the social media menu, with maybe even a clip editor to add filters and effects (add a retro film countdown to some grain-ified moon landing footage)...a not-real-time video-editor analog to the common photo modes. At the very least, modes like this makes people\u0027s shared content into better autoadvertizement for late-stage sales, which is probably why these modes are so ubiquitous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah this idea spiralled out from a small feature into a long-term major feature suite. I don\u0027t even use photo modes, I just know the community would love this. Or I may be wrong, and all these features are a waste of time to integrate, since video editor already exist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheOtherDave","CreatedById":32305,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T19:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy not save all inputs and random events?
