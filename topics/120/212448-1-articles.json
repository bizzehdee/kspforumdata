The Iconography is vague, lack of colors and details on different parts and side icons make it hard to tell at a glance what I\u0027m looking at, whereas in KSP 1, the iconography made it very easy to tell just by looking at it, what category I\u0027m clicking on, what part I\u0027m selecting etc.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
