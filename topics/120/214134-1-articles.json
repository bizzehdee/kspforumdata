I know that this might be a fun new feature, but for start at least a toggle would be nice to use a standard steel\u00A0fasteners to make rockets more rigid ! Also rubber\u00A0fasteners tens to loose their tensile strength while exposed to near 0 kelvin temps. Another good reason is that at the moment launching any rockets looks (paraphrasing from YT) \u0022one blue pill short of a party\u0022.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I know that this a worked on problem, but I thought that this post had to be made for posterity)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-02T03:00:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\ni think some of the kerbals are using chewing gum to attach parts.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nand i totally expect kerbals to do that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-03-02T03:01:54Z\u0022 title=\u002203/02/2023 03:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 2, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grounder","CreatedById":175867,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-19T15:04:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.\u00A0 This post had to be made!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
