Most early access games would ha e been updated, a few times by now(take Son\u0027s of the forest, the game came out in ea a day before ksp2 and has already had a few updates, other early access games like subnautica below zero had updates when they were released).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022But Kerbol!\u0022 I hear you say \u0022The devs said that they are going to fix them in a big update!, be patient!\u0022 And to this comes my suggestion, an experimental development branch, where users can test the latest changes to the games code. That way the impatient users(me) can get the bug fixes earlier, but also catch new bugs and\u00A0 issues before they hit the main branch(and we have to wait a month for a bug fix).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nExperimental branches are common on early access, Ravenfield, Stranded Deep and both Subnauticas used them(Subnautica\u0027s received daily updates with the stuff the devs did that day) Microsoft flight simulator, while it is a complete game, uses a beta branch to test new updates(the devs had a history of breaking half the game after an update).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTL:DR: Add a separate branch for users that gets updated more frequently and with minimal testing, users get the bug fixes earlier and find new bugs before they reach the main branch, win win)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rpatto92","CreatedById":145732,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-14T03:28:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think this would actually make a ton of sense, however I also think they should do multiplayer testing on an experimental branch concurrently with the stable branch.

So you want them to change their schedule based on your impatience haha. Releasing more updates won\u0027t fix the game any faster. It\u0027ll likely only make bug fixing take longer when they have to work on patches more frequently. Creating a patch out of fixes is work too.
