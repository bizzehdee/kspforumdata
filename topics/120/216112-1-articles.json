These flight-surface contrails don\u0027t show up at low speeds and only at wingtips. If they can\u0027t make that work, they should leave them out or give the player a way to activate them per-part.

The dev team says they take an iterative approach to elements in the game, so it may be that the current implementation is an early iteration.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomewhat on topic, I pray to the kerbal gods that ksp2 fixes the shock heating on launch oddity from ksp1. It\u0027s one of the biggest issues that dampened my love for ksp1,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yes, these small visual effects have a massive impact on the game experience and I really hope that the developers don\u0027t sidelines this detail. If the devs do recognize these effects as the low hanging fruit that they are, we may see a nice spike in ksp2 quality sooner than later.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
