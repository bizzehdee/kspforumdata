For more realistic heating/cooling conditions, for example, you could add blackbody radiation for cooling which would be a simple exponential decay function modified by\u00A0 an emissivity factor if you wanted to really dig into it (maybe make this based on color so the color of ships can matter? But Id prefer cool looking ships over realism here). Heating would be a positively shifted negative exponential decay with an albedo modifier multipled by the incident power based on what solar panels already have built into them (the detection for incident light).\u00A0Something like this would add to the complexity of the build puzzle as radiators and now heaters which would have a power draw would need to be kept in mind. Volcano lava could even give off heat as light\u00A0 possibly though it might require more source points which could be fairly computationally expensive but I wonder if there\u0027s coding tricks or fancy math to skirt that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings like moisture in the atmosphere could be added as a scaling factor with atmospheric density as that\u0027s the only way it would really affect the physical aspect of the game.

sound excessively realistic for KSP.\u00A0 The nerd in me screams, \u0022Yes!\u00A0 We need all the realisms!\u0022\u00A0 But the KSP player in me says, \u0022I don\u0027t really want to have to consider 90 things every time I do a mission.\u0022\u00A0 I think if some of these were implemented, they would need to be carefully balanced as not to make the game frustrating or\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etoo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0complex.\u00A0 Ultimately, KSP is about space travel and that\u0027s an important fact to

different biomes had different temps, you could perform temp studies at each of them and get different data.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYes, this could connect with life support, but this might add that \u0022too complex\u0022 element to KSP.\u00A0 I think that temperature life support\u00A0should only extend to protecting Kerbals from radiation/heat on ships with radiators (honestly radiators were kind of underused in KSP1).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EAtmospheric Dynamics\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI really like the idea of wind when flying craft.\u00A0 I think it could make aerodynamics even more important to consider in KSP.\u00A0 However, I don\u0027t want KSP to become MFS.\u00A0 If wind effects mean I can\u0027t build a ridiculous single-launch space station with a massive fairing because it falls over on the launchpad, that\u0027s a hard no from

gameplay?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe tricky part of adding atmospherics is balancing them with gameplay.\u00A0 Lightning strikes would be visually cool, but I wouldn\u0027t want my vessel destroyed every time there\u0027s a thunderstorm and it gets struck.\u00A0 I think weather should also be purely visual and only affect gameplay in that your vision is impaired during

and beauty to bodies of water.\u00A0 I\u0027d love to build a nice seaside resort on Laythe for Kerbals to vacation at!\u00A0 Tsunamis and floods would be cool, but might be overkill for KSP.\u00A0 Having a budding colony I just built last week be swept away by a giant wave would be more frustrating than fun.\u00A0 Plus, the devs said they want colonies to function mostly autonomously\u00A0and endangering them with floods would require too much player maintenance.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWaterfalls would be nice to have, but the terrain system would have to be good enough to support it.\u00A0 I don\u0027t think this is reasonable.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003ETerrain

after I spent hours getting it there.\u00A0 I do think varied surface friction and lava could be added without much issue, though.\u00A0 Lava is easy to avoid when landing/building colonies, and varied surface friction adds strategy to rover driving.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAgain, the terrain system is likely just not there to support landslides, quicksand, earthquakes,

be too much of a gameplay hassle.\u00A0 Having distance from a star affect the productivity of solar panels is enough imo.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EGlobal Weather

great idea.\u00A0 Having your vessels\u0027 power systems/communications be temporarily down because of electromagnetic storms or solar flares would be a unique gameplay element.\u00A0 The key word there is \u003Ci\u003Etemporarily\u003C/i\u003E.\u00A0 This should be something that\u0027s easy to recover from, not something that compromises your entire

these extra effects are implemented.\u00A0 I\u0027m no developer, so maybe there\u0027s an optimized way to do it, but I don\u0027t want to compromise playability at the expense of (ultimately unnecessary) environment systems.\u00A0 Thanks for the intriguing topic though, Vl3d!\u00A0 This was a lot of fun to consider and write about.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022

seem to hit performance. Maybe KSP3 when they really develop the game from scratch using a different engine, preferably their own engine written in C\u002B\u002B. By adding such features or any features you always have to keep one thing in mind: Multiplayer. How does that feature work when two people share one world but have separate\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0time warp.\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0Aka, one player could be fast forwarding while the other remains in real time.

It would be cool to transform planets with resource extraction and what not. I just don\u0027t see that being in the scope of KSP2. Maybe said future KSP3 that is built from the ground up with a dedicated engine for such space games.
