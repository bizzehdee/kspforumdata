I mean charge like 5 bucks, people would probably buy it, and the sound/music is definitely a strong point of KSP2. The devs must be hurting for some cashflow, and the goodwill would go a long way to show that even though they are not sure what decision you want to make re: wobbly rockets, etc, this would be a sign of goodwill that they are hearing that they are seriously not delivering on KSP2 as-is, and here is something to tide us over until we they some progress they are proud to show us. I know I\u0027d be down to pitch 5 bucks for some solid sound design. What do you guys think?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-05T21:05:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis suggestion has been moved to Suggestions.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Meecrob","CreatedById":104543,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-10-05T21:11:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the move, duh.
