Broken ships lead to gamebreaking errors/krakens. For example, struts bug out on your build. you now have a kraken ship. Docking ports dont connect right or disengage right, you now have a kraken kruiser. Symmetry errors cause a part to flip or rotate or clip with another part: Kraken. Weird bugs with fairings or landing gear: Kraken. Structural instability: Kraken. \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E bugs: Kraken. etc etc. All these things have to do with either fatal flaws in a particular part or class of parts (docking ports), or a fatal flaw with the way these parts are put together in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E, or a fatal flaw with the UI of the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E that causes bugs, or some variety of these things.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe point is that these bugs will persist as long as these errors persist.
