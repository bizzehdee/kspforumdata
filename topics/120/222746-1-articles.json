The camera just jumps around any time I try to change the angle. I really really would like to be able to use arrow keys to move the camera up, down, left and right with respect to where it is pointing, and hold right mouse button (RMB) while moving the mouse to change the rotation of the camera up/down/left/right and the then RMB\u002BScrollwheel to move the camera forward and back. Then, while interacting with parts or after placing or detaching/deleting parts, I would like for the camera to not jump anywhere. I\u0027m in space plane mode because I\u0027m working on a rover to be able to unload from the tube after it lands and lays down.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
