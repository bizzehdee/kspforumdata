If I put the small landing legs in the same spot, I would not get the fuel crossfeed bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- This only occurred when I had boosters in the first stage that I dropped off. Steps would be 1.) Ignite boosters \u002B medium engine at launch. 2.) Radially detach boosters with medium engine still burning. Once this happened the total fuel for my medium engine would jump from 7.7 tons to 8.5 tons (because at this point the crossfeed of my decoupler in the next stage failed and it combined this fuel tank with my first stage. If I launched the rocket without these boosters, then the crossfeed would hold even with the medium landing legs still on my lander.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- I still had the same bug when I put the landing legs on a small strut connection instead of directly on the fuel tank.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- The only thing that fixed it for me without drastically changing the purpose of my rocket was to attach the landing legs to some radial decouplers, and then only activate those decouplers in the stage after I was done using that engine (effectively the stage that I am dumping the lander engine anyways). My guess is that the bug only occurs when the medium landing legs are a part of the same stage as the engine in question that will have all of its fuel stolen with this bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T20:19:12Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 08:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Kleos\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EMinor clarification\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
