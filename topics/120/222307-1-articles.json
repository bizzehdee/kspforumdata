It\u0027s not game-breaking or anything, but it\u0027s a small annoyance that adds up over time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are also two small tweaks to the trajectory interface that would be very welcome:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Being able to create a maneuver *precisely* at \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Apoapsis\u0022\u003EAp\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E/other important points of the trajectory.

I understand that this is probably a lot more challenging on the programming level, but literally every time I want to set a deceleration burn when going to the Mun after setting up the encounter, I go to the local trajectory (the one shown inside the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E) to do it, then remember I can\u0027t and have to wait until I timeskip into the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E (because trying to set up a deceleration burn around the Mun in the Kerbal-centric frame of reference just doesn\u0027t work since all the maneuver node directions are in relation to Kerbin).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
