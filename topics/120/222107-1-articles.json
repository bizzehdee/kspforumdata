In KSP2 the time warp stays at the current settings, and more than once my vehicle passes the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E or the PE of the celstial body.

At higher warp values the ships often ended up in incorrect trajectories than planned. There\u0027s no need for that in KSP2, and the solution for your problem is quite simple. Use \u0022warp to point\u0022 instead of doing it manually if all you\u0027re doing is \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E transition.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snips","CreatedById":209433,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-12-26T17:37:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou are basically right, but after almost 7 years of KSP old habbits don\u0027t die... And I never managed to get the \u0022warp to point\u0022 exactly to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E change. So it warps somewhere before the point, you want to speed it up manualy, do it to fast and it\u0027s all over. So an automatic fallback in time warp would be nice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
