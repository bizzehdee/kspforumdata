Forcing the little Kerbals to be stranded for future rescue missions. After making the burn to descend and land. I separated lander only to find out it has 1/2 fuel capacity. Rockets were used somewhere from liftoff to separation for landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hutsul228","CreatedById":222672,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T07:11:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust disable fuel transfer in docking port.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Periple","CreatedById":225622,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T07:18:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u2019s a known and bizarre bug. Try removing the landing legs from your lander to see if it stops the draining.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf it does, put your legs on something other than a fuel tank, and put a decoupler between that part and the tanks. That worked for me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope they\u2019ll fix it soon. They said they\u2019re working on fuel flow at top priority so maybe this will get addressed at the same time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nuke","CreatedById":10883,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-26T07:25:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nive seen this too. seems your fuel will pass through a decoupler, ignoring the setting, if there isnt also an engine above it in the stack. i already posted it on bug reports. you can try putting another part above it, like a battery or something, or use a single engine instead of some spiders.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-26T07:27:28Z\u0022 title=\u002202/26/2023 07:27  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 26, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Nuke\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
