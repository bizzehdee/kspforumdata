Not only that but the models for the different ships look so high tech and shiny. But then you look at the interface and see this pixelated pukey colored crap all over your screen and it just doesn\u0027t make sense together. The marketing for the game also has that upgraded high quality look and feel to it in addition to the logo refresh. I\u0027m not saying that the look and feel of KSP2 should completely drop the awesome silliness and charm of KSP, but it should definitely make a statement that: \u0022Hey we\u0027re still those goofy green dudes, but this time we\u0027ve got better tech, better graphics, better plume, sound effects etc. and we\u0027re about to take this thing to the next level.\u0022\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s not just the mood and the overall ugliness of it though, it\u0027s also really brutal to read. That typeface with those colors are so pixelated and garbly looking that it\u0027s a really rough read in the map mode, and in the UI. When you open up a save file and see the typeface above the loading bar it\u0027s like night and day and you\u0027re just like: man why can\u0027t the UI look as clean as the loading screen lol.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe iconography is supposed to go with these other design elements, and there definitely is uniformity between the two. The icons are also pixelated intentionally to look outdated along with the typeface to the point where I can\u0027t always tell what the icons are supposed to represent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think it\u0027s possible to add elements of cartooniness to the UI without making it ugly, and I feel like KSP 1 did a phenomenal job at that. Right now in early access, I feel like the graphic design elements in KSP2 don\u0027t have a subtle cartoony charm; it just looks bad on purpose.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MickG","CreatedById":62651,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T10:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree, it feels like an afterthought.

But they are indeed not very well integrated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn some cases it\u0027s worse than others. For instance I find the navball okay overall except for the pixelated shade around the ball which makes it look more like low res unfinished graphics rather that a style on his own. Also in the map view in space, especially when you zoom out or focus on another body than Kerbin, say the mun for instance, you can see the space center and other icons taking all of the space (there\u0027s obviously a scaling problem there) and overlapping one another to the point where you can\u0027t see [Snip] from some distance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T11:54:24Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by James Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ERedacted by a moderator\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"danfarnsy","CreatedById":67183,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T15:51:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe blocky pixelated text next to smooth, readable text in flight UI elements and map clashes, and there\u0027s no need for the blocky elements.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Baleine","CreatedById":131757,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T16:15:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI totally agree.

Since the mentionend navball mockup is from me, I can elaborate on it a bit. For some more explanation see my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/210240-the-new-ui-for-ksp2-improvements-and-regressions-from-previous-concepts/page/4/#comment-4195892\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eoriginal post\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI doubt that the 3D ship in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E control panel really adds any value for new players. I think it\u0027s safe to say that even in its current form the navigation UI is not\u00A0self-explanatory for a completely new user who has never seen a navball before. So a tutorial which explains the UI is needed either way. And when a user understands the navball (which is essential for the game) he does not get any value from the 3D ship because the ship\u0027s orientation is already shown with the navball in a much better way. But then again, it\u0027s only a guess and you can\u0027t be sure unless you do a real UX test.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe displays for speed and altitude where simply adopted from the devs\u0027 UI iteration at that time. (I did the mockup before EA launch and in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/210240-the-new-ui-for-ksp2-improvements-and-regressions-from-previous-concepts/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eoriginal thread \u003C/a\u003Eyou can see a screenshot of the devs\u0027 UI at that time on which I based my mockup) So I didn\u0027t change anything there. The bars were indeed mode indicators which were apparently ditched by the devs which is fine I guess. Unit size is (or was meant to be) the same like in the current UI. And while I agree that 6 digits may be a bit tight, that\u0027s what we also currently have in the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe top 3 bars are the mode indicator\u00A0 for the entire nav panel. It is indeed related to the icon right below it which represents the current navigation mode (Navball, 2D horizon, docking).

Since the mentionend navball mockup is from me, I can elaborate on it a bit. For some more explanation see my \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/210240-the-new-ui-for-ksp2-improvements-and-regressions-from-previous-concepts/page/4/#comment-4195892\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eoriginal post\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nI doubt that the 3D ship in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E control panel really adds any value for new players. I think it\u0027s safe to say that even in its current form the navigation UI is not\u00A0self-explanatory for a completely new user who has never seen a navball before. So a tutorial which explains the UI is needed either way. And when a user understands the navball (which is essential for the game) he does not get any value from the 3D ship because the ship\u0027s orientation is already shown with the navball in a much better way. But then again, it\u0027s only a guess and you can\u0027t be sure unless you do a real UX test.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe displays for speed and altitude where simply adopted from the devs\u0027 UI iteration at that time. (I did the mockup before EA launch and in the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/210240-the-new-ui-for-ksp2-improvements-and-regressions-from-previous-concepts/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eoriginal thread \u003C/a\u003Eyou can see a screenshot of the devs\u0027 UI at that time on which I based my mockup) So I didn\u0027t change anything there. The bars were indeed mode indicators which were apparently ditched by the devs which is fine I guess. Unit size is (or was meant to be) the same like in the current UI. And while I agree that 6 digits may be a bit tight, that\u0027s what we also currently have in the game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThe top 3 bars are the mode indicator\u00A0 for the entire nav panel. It is indeed related to the icon right below it which represents the current navigation mode (Navball, 2D horizon, docking). You know that it does something different, because it changes the whole appearance of the navigation panel. (see the 3 pictures for the 3 modes. I also explained it in the original post.)

But I will engage this time because I need to \u003Cu\u003Ethank you for not taking those points as an attack, as it was not the intention\u003C/u\u003E. The amount of vitriol I\u0027ve seem in the forums these days is astounding, not like the rest of internet is much better though!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs I said, I like many things about the mockup, and I think it\u0027s generally okay. What I meant about \u0022designed for the visuals\u0022 is that it looks like visuals were prioritized when a conflicting point was found (e.g. the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E positions), at least in some points. It is not a \u0022bad\u0022 thing either, after all it is all about finding the right balance between ergonomics and visuals, and the hard part is that not everyone have the same standards.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think... I would had tried to set the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E buttons in place of temperature and signal status, and setup the mode change and its icon within a box-button, much alike those in speed and altitude. Writing also the selected mode text (orbit-surface-docking) along the icon and it should eliminate the disconnection between the selector and the icon, providing enough visual reference to the user.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAbout the 3d attitude gizmo, I can\u0027t say for sure since I couldn\u0027t play yet, but I \u003Cem\u003Esuppose \u003C/em\u003Ethat the little ship is showing the current relative orientation against the direction of the orbit (represented by the gizmo). In that case, yes, I think it should be a very good visual cue for new players to learn about the different attitudes, and how it will change when you lock into one of them. If it does not work like that, then no, the gizmo is not that useful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, take my comments with a grain of salt, I\u0027m not really an expert at UIs. I work in the web side of the developer world, and I\u0027m simply way too accostumed to work with existing UIs and build some more, therefore my experience is both tuned for the dumb(er) public and for extreme pixel-peeping (because clients won\u0027t forgive a 1px offset).
