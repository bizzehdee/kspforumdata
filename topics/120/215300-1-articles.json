That said, all their description of \u0022interstellar trajectories are threading a needle\u0022 seems like they are going to give us more precision tools. The current throttle is way too jumpy too...needs a way to fine tune it. Or maybe it will come down to challenging the player to have a combination of thrust regimes...using an SEP engine to do hyper-fine tuning. And the automation of supply routes that they\u0027ve described cuts into that argument...if you can automate that, what\u0027s the logic of not automating any single part of player flight control?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think they want to avoid a pitfall of players \u0022learning\u0022 KSP2 by just always hitting \u0022automate\u0022 buttons...they want players to learn the nuance of flying a spaceship, and if you give a human a shortcut, most will take it. There is something special about having your manual drop into a 101x99km orbit and having to know how to correct it to 100x100. give a player a single button that guarantees a 100x100 every time removes some of the uniqueness of every flight?
