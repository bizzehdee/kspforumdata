Congratulations!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWe as a committed community (or at least those who purchased KSP2 around the time it was first released) have seen the hard work the Devs have put in to making the game playable, with working features and to be honest, a magnitude greater graphical and music design than it\u0027s predecessor.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo far, I have not had any game crashes running a system that sits right in the middle of the specs. So far as I am conerned, it\u0027s stable. No broken promises when it comes to releasing a playable game. In terms of the price, it\u0027s worth it in my eyes and many would agree.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ENow it\u0027s time for major updates for the Devs to get busy with.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey have received feedback from the community and, according to the content creators at the ESA pre-release, they have listened to this feedback and understood the main issues; \u003Cu\u003Ebug and performance updates.\u003C/u\u003E The priority map should be clear for what to do next.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is not about PR triage, there are few among us hardcore KSP enthusiasts and even the lesser casual kerbonauts who will lose faith in\u00A0 the product - even if we theoretically did get more than the average number crashes for an early access release, we would still be here, waiting patiently for the fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWe know they\u0027re not silent.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo often game developers have done exactly this; gotten feedback, figured out to work on, and then got busy working on it. Almost too busy. The community teams are so busy trying to figure out how to keep their audience calm that they forget to communicate with the devs and do their job - inform the community.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nInformation is paramount. While we know they cannot divulge the inner workinga of the game, they will almost certianly have a priority updates list, shared internally so the devs can pick up the module where a bug / improvement is needed, and when that job is completed and committed to the next build, that informations is written into the release notes. Which sits there. Doing nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDon\u0027t be them other game publishers!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAll I ask is that they let us into the lobby.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing able to hear the internal gossip between the receptionist and the security guard (metaphorically speaking of course, we don\u0027t want to actually come to their offices);\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E \u0022I hear Jeb is working on the fuel system\u0022\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Eis like making orbit for the first time.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing able to hear that from the magazine table is like gold dust. Reassurance that the issues we are frustrated by are, at least, being handed to the team that can do something about it. It\u0027s better than silently flicking through the internal news bulletin on the table, reading about the internal awards party from 6 months ago. Eventually we will get fed up of the bugs and will wait in that lobby until the next build comes out, by which time some of us will have left. Even seeing a Dev walking across the lobby to get a fresh cup of water from the cooler is better than nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThey trusted the content creators before, they can trust them now.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSM, SZ, EA, ML and many, many others.\u00A0 They are practically employees - we won\u0027t judge the Devs if they handed out unfinished patches and updates to test them, and they won\u0027t judge the Devs - certainly not paint them in bad colours if it somehow doesn\u0027t work - if anything, they\u0027ll highlight all the great work they doing - on the basis it\u0027s strictly what \u0022could\u0022 be coming, not necessarily what \u0022will\u0022 be coming. Even if the community team have to vet their work, it\u0027s worth it to keep the community informed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EIf not specifics, show us where to look for progress.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike the progress bar, it moves, stops, jumps, gives us witty banter and entertains us while we wait. We need this for the patches and updates. Even if it\u0027s trivial banter, it\u0027s something evolving. They need to give us an indication of progress, it\u0027s missing and it needs to be invented - then placed somewhere obvious. maybe put the Launcher to good use?\u00A0In any case, they should make it clear where we can get information about they\u0027re progress. I promise it can only be a good thing. I\u0027ve never heard bad feedback on work being done.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EA final thanks.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd not just for the game. The Dev\u0027s were there years ago telling us about some of the features being worked on. They were there just before release, watching intently at the pre-release and feeding back that they heard about the issues. The community team were there to provide clarity about the hardware requirements.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey deserve the patience of the community. They deserve to be motivated by us, cheered on, encouraged. They even deserve to ignore this post if they wish and do whatever they need to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027ve earned it so far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pickezzi","CreatedById":226278,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-03-10T20:56:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/205123-nate-simpson/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022205123\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/205123-nate-simpson/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Nate Simpson\u003C/a\u003E!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can only guess you read paragraph 5 above and adapted it, or your interview with SZ was exactly what I was hoping you would do!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlmost 100k kerbonauts saw it, and almost 4k liked it, so I\u0027m hoping this is evidence about community market demand for progress feedback.
