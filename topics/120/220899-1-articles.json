I tried to do the last one of starship, everything was going well until you try to save quickly, when you load the game again the rocket falls apart by itself, parts fall off and it only happens after loading an autosave. Fixing bugs like that are essential before releasing the science update otherwise it will be adding more bugs to a pile that is already quite large.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bej Kerman","CreatedById":182413,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-11-20T13:20:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027re not adding features that quickly, and the features they\u0027re adding are at least small and useful, like grid fins for instance. If you\u0027re worried that they\u0027ll accumulate technical debt at a rate similar to Squad, I\u0027m confident they\u0027re not.
