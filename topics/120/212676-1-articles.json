And if you save another vehicle in the same workspace, the previous vehicle will be overridden.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso you can\u0027t load those vehicles shown in the saving ui, but only the workspaces. I don\u0027t know, if this is intended or a bug, but it feels very inconsistent.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EEdit:\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0Clarification:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0While saving, you see vehicles listed by their vehicle name. For all workspaces, but only one from each.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0 \u00A0While loading, you see only workspaces with their respective names.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ELoading: Workspace takes up a lot of space\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m not 100% sure how i will use the workspace system, but for now i\u0027m likely to save many crafts in seperate workspace files.\u00A0 Because of this it would be nice, if they get much more compact.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe idea of an image from the workspace is nice, but i think it would be fine, if it\u0027s smaller. Also there is a lot of dead space.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThere are many playstyles. Maybe some have only a few workspaces, which works for them more like folders, collecting all vehicles of the same type.\u003Cbr\u003E\nOther ones might use them only for big projects and want to save normal vehicles in separate files. The system should support both playstyles.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESubassemblies\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI know the workspace concept is a replacement for subassemblies and you can merge two workspaces together.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut is there a way to copy only one vessel from one assembly to another? Let\u0027s say i have a workspace with all my launch vehicles and a workspace with all my probes.\u003Cbr\u003E\nHow do i copy a probe to the launch vehicle workspace, to launch it into space?\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m very excited to see how the game develops in the coming months.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222023-02-25T12:11:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/25/2023 12:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00221 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 25, 2023\u003C/time\u003E by Gurkonier\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MarcAbaddon","CreatedById":192494,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-25T12:14:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think the workspace system is an improvement we need for certain large builds.

When you get started with the game, workspaces are mainly making the situation more complex than needed.
