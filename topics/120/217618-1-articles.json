This IS however resource intensive and would need to be ONLY accessible while the game is paused, this would allow options to increase the LOD of objects temporarily, knowing that full max settings will take multiple minutes to render out in some cases, and as soon as getting out of photo mode, you would go back into normal settings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would REALLY like this to be implemented, there are way too many small details that get \u0022lost\u0022, and details that are not even in the game yet.
