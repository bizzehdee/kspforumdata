For a long time I had to launch mun rockets who had an 2.5 meter core stage but then go down to 1.25 m for the fairing and the diameter of lander was well above 2.5 meter.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oak7603","CreatedById":232078,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-03T10:21:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIts the same as the last two rover wheels being unlocked at the same time on the last rover node in tier 4.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biggen","CreatedById":173719,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-03T12:47:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree. \u00A0The tech tree needs some work.
