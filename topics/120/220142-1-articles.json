Seems to be made up about first getting science to explore everything in kerbins sphere of influence, later for close by planets and after that the outer planets (and after that of course interstellar). I do not think that approach is wrong. While in the science/career mode of KSP1 the tech tree was the main focus for completing it, for KSP2 that focus probably shifts to building colonies and finding resources. This will give way more challenges having, to launch stuff from colonies with each having its own challenge. This also gives opportunity for unique missions and shifts he focus away from the tech tree\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
