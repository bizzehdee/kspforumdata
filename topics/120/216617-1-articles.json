There are two main reasons why I think we should not be banned from an \u201Cimpossible\u201D maneuver.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E1. Planning a maneuver, even if it\u2019s beyond the vessel\u2019s capability, is the most accurate method to gain information on how to traverse between celestial bodies.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou will learn a lot about the timing, the trajectory, and most importantly the delta-v requirement by just playing with the maneuver planner. This practice cannot be replaced simply by a delta-v map. The current in-game Trip Planner is Kerbin-centric, meaning that it only provides information assuming you are starting from Kerbin. For example, if you want to land on Tylo, you will know that the total delta-v requirement staring from Kerbin\u2019s surface is about 9 km/s. However, if you are doing a Jool V mission, and want to transfer to Tylo from a low Laythe orbit, the current Trip Planner will not give you an accurate result.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP1, if a player is presented with a new celestial system without a delta-v map, this practice is the only way for them to obtain the delta-v requirement and plan their trips ahead. Blocking access to imaginary maneuver nodes makes it harder for player to obtain delta-v information from a new system or in a new situation. Even if your mission failed because you ran out fuel, you still want to know how much delta-v you are short on, so you don\u2019t fail the next time!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E2. The current delta-v calculator is already a mess, and you are building a game influencing mechanics on a disaster.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe delta-v calculator does not always return you the correct delta-v for a vessel, so now you won\u2019t be able to plan an actually possible maneuver simply because the system thinks \u201Cyou can\u2019t\u201D. Veterans from KSP1 won\u2019t just rely on the displayed delta-v to travel, because there are numerous cases where the in-game display just aren\u2019t correct.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirstly, your staging must be correct for the systems to recognize the correct delta-v. In a complex vessel, such as a satellite hub with many satellites designated to be dispatched in different orbits, you will want to use the part menu to manually release the payload, because staging every satellite in its correct order is just tedious.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn addition, the current delta-v calculator does not recognize any docking port at all, so if you have an Apollo style spaceship, you are doomed. In a more complicated design, such as a mothership docked with several landers and/or shuttles, the current delta-v calculator will never consider the fact that these payloads are detachable! Not to mention the fact that the timing and order by which these payloads are dispatched and returned will dramatically influence the final delta-v outcome of the mothership.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, there are also various ways a player can generate delta-v besides the main engine. For example, you can use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E or separator to generate a small amount of delta-v that may just be enough to send you home. You cannot simply place a hard limit on maneuver planning based on what the system thinks the limit is. This is just absurd.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI honestly don\u2019t understand at all why this \u201Cfeature\u201D went into the 0.1.2 update. This feature is awful and stupid. KSP2 is a sandbox game, and force a player to play in a certain style is the last thing you want from a sandbox game. Remember, maneuver node is only a \u003Cstrong\u003Eplan\u003C/strong\u003E! Nobody expects a space travel will go according to plan! If you truly want this feature so that \u201Cnew players\u201D will not accidentally plan an impossible trip, please at least makes it an \u003Cstrong\u003Eoption\u003C/strong\u003E!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"18Watt","CreatedById":198538,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-16T22:47:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne comment I have regarding the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E calculator: \u00A0Right now there does not appear to be a way to specify the environment you would like \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E values for. \u00A0For example, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E on the surface of Kerbin, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E in vacuum, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E on surface of Eve. \u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E is the same. \u00A0I\u0027d like to be able to see my \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E for various conditions. \u00A0It\u0027s basic math, so I\u0027m sure this will come eventually.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"\u673A\u68B0\u4E3B\u655971\u53F7","CreatedById":208023,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-19T08:15:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCan\u0027t agree more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dr.phees","CreatedById":32383,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-19T18:03:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo true, completely bonkers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Blue_Point","CreatedById":218509,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-20T04:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have no idea why the team added this\u00A0terrible feature at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JIKL04","CreatedById":226665,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-20T14:44:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am now playing KSP 1 , just trying out one of the far future engines (I think its from the far future mod, not relevant though) and it requires manual activation a deactivates completely when the throttle is set to minimum.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis means that the game can\u0027t properly calculate the actual deltaV of the ship = doesn\u0027t show any.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, what I am trying to say.
