In map view you can click on an on rails vessel and select control or focus. When I switch control of a vessel I almost always want to focus on that vessel too. It would be nice to have the control option also focus at the same time. I do like that the map view doesn\u0027t change to flight view when control is clicked as I often want to check the orbit/maneuver node/etc before going to flight view.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lowi_Sace","CreatedById":224820,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-07-05T09:49:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EWhile on the map view topic, a few suggestions.\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen rightclicking a planet we now get the options \u0022focus\u0022 and \u0022set as target\u0022.
