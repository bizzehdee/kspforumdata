This would add a lot in terms of possibilities withoud having to add a lot of parts\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003Efeul tanks:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EJust having the feul tanks be procedural in lengt would be very cool. It wouls also be nice if you could change the ratio feul/oxidiser (less oxidiser means more room for feul). Another nice improvement would be if you could also choose to what size the end adapts (for example LG feul tank with Mk2 end pr 4 engine mount) for easy transisioning between sizes. Having for every size of feul tank a normal (ruboster) tank, vacuum tank (looks like liquid hydrogen tankin KSP2,\u00A0 and is lighter, but less stable) en droptank (side atachments, light and cheap) version would also be handy. Last nice option is being able to choose wich feul type you do in the tank. For liquid feul that would be hydrogen en methalox (and maybe later kerosine). Hydrogen is easyer to produce (only water needed) and methane easyer to store, so depending on place of colony other liquid feul can be used. Adding kerosine would also be nice since it would be logical jet engines running on it and it is one of the 3 most used feultypes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEngines:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003Ebeing able to make more adjustments to liquid feul engines would be cool. Like being able for engines te let them run from Methalox or hydrolox (or even keralox). This will be very handy for future crafts with colonies (on moon there is unlikely to be a lot of carbon, so hydrogen better). Engine and feul tanks would not be able to just switch between feul types mid flight (select wich feul type for both in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E). An other cool engine upgrade would be changable nozzles (maybe even procedural). Depending on te nozzle the engine works better a different pressures and also being able to intall a retractable nozzle like the nerv engine is already getting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003ESolid rocked boosters:\u00A0\u003C/b\u003EHave one solid rocked booster for de diameter s, m and l.

Why not allow us to use the fairing building procedure to actually form tanks to our needs? Why not really go for a KSP 2.0 instead of another KSP 1 with different graphics?\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:9px;\u0022\u003EThis is so frustrating!

It would also reduce the amount of searching for your feul tank. A lot of more feul types will be added in the future and we already have to do much scrolling for feul tanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey should get some inspiration from juno. Custamizable parts just make the game perform better en let you build better crafts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also am a big fan of choosing wich liquid feul type will be in the tank (hydrogen, methalox of kerosine) and being able to change oxidisor feul ratio (less oxidisor means more room for feul). It gives experienced players more ways to make specialized crafts and for the beginners they could leave keep the current system as optional\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224271079\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022216364\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221681167749\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002257710\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022K^2\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 4/11/2023 at 1:02 AM, K^2 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S. That goes for solids as well, yeah. It can make sense to go in fixed increments for either or both of these, rather than a continuous slider, but the lengths of fuel tanks and solid boosters should be adjustable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ncould also be done for cargo bays, cones, solar panels and maybe even crew parts.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHope they did do that already and just add it with the procedural structural parts.
