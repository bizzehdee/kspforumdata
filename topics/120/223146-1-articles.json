It could be really cool when you approach station, select its docking availability from pop up window and it will show you approach hud needed to docking procedure to kick in. Hud could be something like fighter pilots helmets has.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I watched chinese sniper landing animation and i think it did look so Kerbal style that even i know what went wrong :,D )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222024-01-20T10:53:55Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2024 10:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u0022Jan 20\u0022\u003EJanuary 20\u003C/time\u003E by Jeq\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
