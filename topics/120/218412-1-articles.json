I am pretty sure that after a while of playing we know that solar panels do not produce EC when in the dark. Having a window pop up every time (and in such large size) is very distracting and very annoying.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSuggestion: Some kind of option to disable certain or all notifications for more experienced players.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
