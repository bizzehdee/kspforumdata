Speaking of Holden, the mag boots in Expanse were toggleable, and the characters frequently did that on screen.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think it\u0027s an awesome feature. Mainly, I look forward to having my kerbals able to walk around on, say, the deck of a ship going 20 m/s (if I can get boats to work, the water physics are... perplexing), or even better, maybe even inside a cargo bay of an aircraft going 100 m/s (though that may be wishful thinking). Also, it would make proper gravity rings possible (I mean like, big ones, made out of cargo bays). In KSP 1, although grav rings do technically work, because its a moving reference frame (just like the boat or the cargo plane), the kerbals would just ragdoll against it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut on non-metallic surfaces... Like the surfaces of planets... It feels off somehow. And yeah, half of not only the fun, but the learning, for the younger generations, is the literal experience of different gravities. There are times on minmus or gilly where I\u0027ve wanted something like mag boots, but more often than not, I prefer walking on planets without them. And I feel like EVA packs fill that niche anyway. If the gravity is light enough to make long distance running annoyingly slow, then it\u0027s light enough to zip across the surface in a fuel efficient hover... I\u0027ve actually never ran out of EVA fuel doing that (I mean, jesus, for most of KSP 1\u0027s history, you had like a 500 m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EDV\u003C/abbr\u003E EVA pack), and nowadays in KSP 1, you can carry extra EVA fuel with you (presumably a feature eventually coming to KSP 2). I also tend only to do this in like, odd scenarios or emergencies. Normally if I know my kerbals will need to hoof it, I just send along a rover. Or in Minmus\u0027s case, I like sending along an ion powered hover car that can hop into parabolic arcs to get around long distances.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think mag boots should work on roads however, if that really is going to be a thing in the base building mechanics.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tazooka","CreatedById":226666,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-02-27T10:24:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B1\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI find the movement on other moons/planets very ridged and I miss the sense of different gravity like on the Mun and Minmus when walking around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor EVA on ships mag boots are a great feature.

In defense of the Expanse\u0027s writing (I wont defend the acting, they do play it deadpan, and its not everyone\u0027s thing), of the crew, only Jim and Alex have any prior military background, and both of them are from different (opposing) militaries, both disenfranchised with them for different reasons. Meanwhile, Naomi has terrorist baggage with a mob boss for a side kick.\u00A0 Besides that, theyve had at various times, Jim\u0027s assassin, a cyborg spy, a detective, and an ate up marine who ended up defecting (now thats a turnaround), in tow, and thats all before getting to the predicament theyre stuck in.

I was a USAF jet engine mechanic for over 5 years, and I cant talk about it without it sounding like a crap soap opera. The military likes to present itself as hyper disciplined as a recruitment tactic, but all I ever knew was a crappy work culture surrounded by drama queens, squabblers, and people with actual drama mixed in (like my buddy who got brain damage from a jet fuel allergy the military doctors refused to diagnose for 3 years). So I never found that aspect of The Expanse particularly unrealistic. By n\u0027 large, I thought the internal squabbles of the crew in that show were pretty tame compared to some of the crap that actually happens IRL.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
