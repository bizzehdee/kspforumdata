Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E there has a point, but I have my own take on it and at this point, I think it\u0027s worth making a new topic.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo KSP1 and 2 both have exploration in the sense that they have a great big sandbox for you to travel around in, but I think an \u0022exploration game\u0022 is a game where exploration is 1) interesting and 2) challenging. And neither KSP1 nor KSP2 had interesting or challenging exploration. Now, don\u0027t get me wrong, both games are challenging. That\u0027s a fact. But exploration isn\u0027t. Go to Map view and you can see everything in as much detail as you realistically ever will. Yeah, you can\u0027t see every rock on the Mun, but it\u0027s not like you can do anything with those rocks. And yes you can\u0027t see every hill and valley, but none of those hills or valleys are dramatic enough to matter to picking a landing site and you don\u0027t get science for exploring deeper-than-average valleys or higher-than-average hills.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you\u0027ve ever played Minecraft and finally found an ice spikes biome after searching for days and mapping every ocean in a 1K block radius, you know what the joy of exploration is. It\u0027s the joy of searching, scanning the horizon, hoping to see what your looking for. Rationing food, creating outposts, running out of resources and having to return home only to go out again to search more. That\u0027s exploration. I\u0027ve never felt that playing KSP, not even close. Because I\u0027ve always known exactly where I was going, and pretty much exactly what I was gonna find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, there is no actual need to have exploration be a major feature in KSP. But I do think it\u0027s something that could raise KSP2 to the next level and create a kind of joy and challenge that we have so far not been able to experience. Below I\u0027ve listed some general ways that I think it would be possible for KSP to incorporate exploration in a more meaningful way. I\u0027d love to hear what you guys have to say about it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E1) Reward variety\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinecraft actually provides a reason to go to a desert or a jungle. Different resources, different structures, different locales to build bases. It\u0027s not just that deserts have more loot than jungles, it\u0027s that they provide different value. You can\u0027t get pandas from deserts and you can\u0027t get cactus from jungles. KSP1 and 2 both suffer from all biomes being essentially the same. At best you might get slightly more science from the poles or from a monument, but that\u0027s not an exciting difference. If, instead, you could make a munar discovery that allowed you to build a special new type of engine by gathering a sample in a specific region, that could be an actual reason to explore. It\u0027s a reason to be excited that you finally found a munar valley so you can finally build that probe exactly the way you want to. Even something as simple as unlocking certain paint styles by visiting certain celestial bodies would give you some reason to go to some of the less visited bodies. Rewards that are just science or money become stale when you have lots of both. Rewards that are non-fungible, that are actually unique, those can be really inspiring.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nideas for adding this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSamples from certain biomes give you non-tech tree discoveries, e.g. a new compound found on the mun unlocks a special side-mounted engine or a smaller more powerful satellite dish.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSamples from Certain biomes unlock special paint jobs for rocket parts\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSamples from Certain biomes allow you to upgrade certain parts. e.g. the Reliant engine gets an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E boost because of asteroid debris found in a munar crater.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSamples from Certain biomes advance the kerbals understanding of the universe, allowing you unique abilities. e.g. you can now use all maneuver capabilities without a pilot (I know it isn\u0027t in KSP2 yet, whatever).\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease keep in mind that while it may sound dull to have to go to a specific munar biome to unlock a particular paint job, some of my subsequent ideas might help with that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E2) Variety in Challenges\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRight now there is an element of tedium to going to each biome on the mun. You can see\u00A0 them all from orbit so you just have to do 5 identical missions landing in different spots. They are all essentially the exact same mission, and that is pretty tedious. Something that could spice things up is providing different challenges for different biomes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIdeas:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCertain parts of Duna have major windstorms that blow you to and fro\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOther parts are very\u00A0 rocky and therefore difficult to land flat in.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn the mun you could have basins in the bottom of caves that can\u0027t be flown to but require a speedy rover.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou could have munar sand beds that are spongy and therefore easier to land on.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nCertain areas on the Mun could have a ground covering that\u00A0 messes with the ranging meaning you can only use sea-level altitude and not height from ground, making landing more challenging.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEven features as simple as steep mountains mean you need to either execute a high-precision landing right on the peak, or make a craft that won\u0027t slide down the steep face.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese kinds of unique challenges are a nice compliment to unique rewards. If you want\u00A0 a special engine, you have to design a special craft to overcome a unique challenge. It also means that landers cannot be as frequently re-used. You actually need to re-tool your ship for each new destination.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E3) \u0022Randomness\u0022 in environment\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething else that is difficult is that you can see the whole mun in stunning quality immediately. You always know exactly where you are going to land from the start. Having some kind of fog-of-war where you can\u0027t see the landing site in detail (perhaps it\u0027s all pixelated) until you either scan it with a satellite or get close enough would mean you would need to be prepared for the unexpected. Combined with the variety above, it could mean that you need to build really adaptable ships, or do preliminary scouting, both of which would be exciting and rewarding missions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing that could be done is adding features that simply do not appear on the map view until they are discovered. So perhaps you can see a crater, but you can\u0027t see if there is a meteor remnant in the middle, so you need to do an expedition to find out. And then if there is one, you can unlock a unique part or a science reward or whatever. This would encourage people to build a lander with a rover that\u00A0 can go explore. More detail on this kind of stuff below.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EI should note here I don\u0027t think a random or procedurally generated map would be a good idea. Rather everyone should have the same Mun, but you just can\u0027t see details of it in the map view until you actually map it.\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003E4) Rules and science connecting environments and informing randomness\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething that takes exploration to the next level for me is when you know that there are rules governing your exploration. For example, a Minecraft Savanna will always border a desert. And Ice spikes are often found near cold oceans. So when you are looking for a desert and you find a savanna, you can go around the perimeter, and when you are looking for ice spikes, you can get excited when you see a cold ocean because you know you might be close to\u00A0 your quarry. Being much more science based, KSP2 has an even greater opportunity to do this. On the Mun, give some mares asteroid debris fields on their borders that can be scanned for a chance to recover pieces of a meteor. On Duna have mountains form ranges where some mountains will, on close inspection, turn out to be volcanoes that can be used as a source of geothermal energy. This is the reason you might build a serious all-terrain rover, one that can challenge Duna\u0027s mountains to efficiently scavenge them for Volcanoes. Or perhaps it may justify you building a Duna plane with high-res cameras and sensors so you can fly over the mountain ranges hoping to pick up heat signatures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese kinds of connections mean players can get excited at finding a large thing that they can explore, searching for a small thing. And that is the sort of exploration people can really get invested in. It\u0027s a problem that is possible to solve with brute force, spending 1000 hours in EVA, but encourages creative problem solving. Creating mega-rovers and spy planes that can automate the tedius tasks.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that these sort of additions could make KSP2 a true exploration game that rewards and encourages the development of a huge variety of vehicles to overcome equally varied challenges across the galaxy. I don\u0027t purport to know exactly how such features would specifically fit, but I hope this is a direction the devs give consideration to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
