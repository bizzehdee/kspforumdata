This would allow for easier and more precise wing alignment and positioning.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen trying to place 2 wings end on end, it is very difficult to get them to line up properly, and it involves going back and forth between the move tool, and adjusting the length of the root/tip until it looks good enough. This is also an issue when trying to judge how long a fuselage is, or when the exact centre of it is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nbeing able to make the leading edge longer without it affecting the trailing edge would improve the quality of life when working with the procedural wings.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing able to edit the values manually would also help improve with designing wings.
