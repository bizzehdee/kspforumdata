I believe this has now been bundled with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E. Current available parts (if my memory does not fail) are as follows: Resource Drill that extracts water, hydrates and not much else I believe; Licquefaction Array, which liquefies gases such as Oxygen, Hydrogen, CO2, Methane, and maybe some others (its config file is very easy to understand, so you could tweak it to get your desired substance in there); Mars Atmospheric Scoop that captures CO2 from the atmosphere; and then there is a Water Electrolyser, a SABATIER unit, a Fischer-Tropsch unit, and I think that\u0027s pretty much it (again, I might be missing something).\n\nIn conclusion, with the mod in its current state you are able to mine hydrates at the Moon or Mars and get drinking water; you can produce Lqd Methane in Mars for fuel, and I believe (never tested) you could produce Kerosene at Titan as well. Again, these are only the limited uses I gave the hardware, but I\u0027m almost certain there are more resources to be produced.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-10-01T18:54:33Z\u0022 title=\u002210/01/2018 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 1, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by hypervelocity**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwaster","CreatedById":71262,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-10-02T01:59:23Z","Content":"[@etheoma](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/69258-etheoma/) [@hypervelocity](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/136426-hypervelocity/)\n\nAs to the state of the mod, I\u0027ve been going over recipes and making sure that they are consistent and accurate as best I can.

There needs to be another tank to receive the gas. Then just use the liquefier to turn it back to liquid. Best used in conjunction with MLI (multi-layered insulation) and radiators. Except you would need to upgrade to RF for KSP 1.3.1 as we don\u0027t have an official release for 1.2.2 which supported player added MLI insulation.\n\nYou can patch the tank system to add boiloff gas production to any tank with the following patch. (it\u0027s a little brute forcish with no conditionals but it does the job)\n\nOne caveat in doing this is that any boiloff gas that is captured is NOT used for propulsive venting which is used for settling tanks.
