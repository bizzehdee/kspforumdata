Just happened across a Scott Manley video where he talks about a one hour munar mission challenge or something. And he built a large ship.\n\nIt got me thinking. Why one hour? Could it be done in fifty minutes? Forty? Thirty? Can I hit the Mun with a direct, high speed ballistic trajectory? What if I accelerate as hard as I can halfway there, do a 180, and spend the whole rest of the way decelerating? Can I do this?
