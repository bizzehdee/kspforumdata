A rover that was tride and true, had flipped, which destroyed all but the command station. The rover, a \u0022Bee\u0022 Bull No. 1 had gone too fast and initiated a violent turn, which caused the weight to shift and make it flip. Mission Control, commanded by non other than Gene Kerman, had dispatched Jeb, Val, Bob, and Bill to rescue Dosy Kerman, an egineer returning to the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E after a meeting at the R\u0026amp;D facility. Dosy was unharmed but the rover was totaled. Dosy had a long history with mishaps and disasters, starting just days before, with his first assignment, which he, Ensel, and Dilvan, were lucky to have escaped. The placement of the decouplers was wrong, causing the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s to fall inwards, hitting Fuel tanks and engines, exploding on impact. The abort stage saved them, if Dosy had hit the button an split second later, he wouldn\u0027t have helped save three Kerbonauts. Hendred Kerman came in \u0022Bee\u0022 Bull No. 5 to pick up the survivors. On the way back, with Hendred and Ensel, two old friends, catching up on the Comms, Hendred hit a bump at 66 M/s and hit the water tower closest to the runway, killing Hendred instantly. Jeb, Val, and Bill, went to pick up the three double crash survivors and took them to the hospital wing of the Kerbonaut Complex. The three were clearly shook up. Dosy was sent to the hospital wing for the second day in a row!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, the new head of passenger plane development, Delman Kerman, was at a meeting which worried him. The topic of the meeting, who should become the chief rover test pilot. Malus had elected that his friend, Ensel do it. Hendred was the chief test pilot before. Delman stated to the group,\u0022 Ensel is a great rover pilot and plane pilot, but he has since given up his flying status, both regular flight and spaceflight. And he has started driving rovers because of his friends death, but I have no real objections to him being promoted,\u0022 The group voted on the matter, Jeb:\u00A04, Ensel: 11.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt was the 5th hour of the day, when the promotion ceremony was preformed, and Ensel was proud to head a group of individuals in such an important matter. When it was over, he had authority of 10 other test pilots. Ensel was to test the new \u0022Goose\u0022 rover, which was able to carry 36 Kerbals around \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E. Most would be reserved for evacuation of larger residential\u00A0 areas or complexes. He would also be testing \u0022Bee\u0022 V2 later.

Malus responeded to that, with the highly unstable \u0022Moose\u0022. A thin rover, contrary to its name, the \u0022Moose\u0022 was a open air rover, capable of unintended flips, and other, highly deadly in air\u00A0maneuvers. Top speed was only 45 M/S. Ensel immediately took it for a spin, to the hills north of the Space Center. He only\u00A0 went about 10 KMs because he needed to recharge the two\u00A0 batteries, even though, they didn\u0027t have to fold up or unfold. Malus hopped in \u0022Moose\u0022 Bull No. 2, and left to join Ensel. Just 0.2 Kms from Ensel, Malus\u0027 rover flipped, luckily, he survived. Malus didn\u0027t know how, because the command seat is the highest point of the viechle, and the first to hit the ground. Ensel contacted Jeb, who brought out a \u0022Bee V2\u0022 for extraction, picking up Ensel and Malus on the ladders, where they got in the hitchhiker can and got transported back to the Space center.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMeanwhile, Dr. Von Kerman had created a new rocket. Called the ComSatLx, the small rocket was to launch five times, each time carrying a single Comms probe to orbit. After launching and rough circularization, the probes would extend their Communotron16 and receive transmissions from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShortly after the success of the ComSatLx, Dr. Von Kerman wanted a large version of the probe sent up for a polar orbit, something like one of the previous probes had tried to do, but failed because it ran out of fuel before the full maneuver could be completed.\u00A0 Shortly after launch, the cargo area came off the rocket, (I was using 1.875M parts from the Making History DLC and encountered a problem, I couldn\u0027t find a core or AGU that fit the size, so I went with the 1.5M size, and that happened\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:(\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E.).
