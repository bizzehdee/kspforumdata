I\u0027ve installed the latest EVE and Astronomers Visual Pack V2. I\u0027ve also found a new skybox texture because the stock one looks really bad in 4K. But I\u0027m still not impressed. I\u0027m sure these mods look great in HD, but in 4K they are just not spectacular. The clouds look just so-so and the skybox texture I\u0027m using (Oinker) is nice but is not pin-point beautiful as it should be on a 4K. \n\nAny suggestions?

KSP will never be a good game to show off your system. The visual mods help a lot at any resolution but even at higher resolution they will always look so-so compared to modern \u0027graphic centric\u0027 games. \n\nOn my decent system the visual mods make almost no difference to the FPS. Any newer GPU will not be taxed by KSP. And the game is severely limited by the single core physics. \n\nIf you want to show off the system buy the new witcher game or GTA IV or BF4 or something like that."},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T16:52:59Z","Content":"I definitely suggest looking up WindowShine and AVG\u0027s cloud pack in my signatures.
