I had a few vessels on the go and thought it would be nice to have some information on which performs certain tasks without actually having to have the vessel loaded and active; so decided to write this little plugin. The window is currently only available in the Space Centre scene, though I\u0027m trying to figure out how to have it run in the Flight scene too. I\u0027ve found it useful, I hope you will too.\n\n***Features:***\n\n- See a list of vessels containing harvesting and/or conversion equipment, with handy info on active modules, etc.\n\n- Click the ship name to instantly switch to it.\n\n- Runs in the Space Centre scene (for now).\n\n***Changes \u0026 Updates:***\n\n- [08/05/2015] Initial release.\n\n***Downloads:***\n\n- Download from [Dropbox](http://bit.ly/1Quc5H3).\n\n***Source:***\n\n- Download from [Dropbox](http://bit.ly/1ALBra5).\n\n![88x31.png](http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-nd/3.0/88x31.png)\n[This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-08T21:41:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/08/2015 09:41  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by udk\\_lethal\\_d0se**"},{"CreatedByName":"Clythoris","CreatedById":116254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-08T21:10:58Z","Content":"Cool."},{"CreatedByName":"udk_lethal_d0se","CreatedById":62149,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-09T12:24:41Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Cool.\n\nLet me know if you have any suggestions, they are always welcome."}]}
