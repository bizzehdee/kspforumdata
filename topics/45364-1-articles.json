Rather than yall complete a challenge I make, I complete the challenges you make! The Kerbal Launch Alliance is a private space tourism company fresh on the market, and we need your help to get us to be number 1 out there. But first, some rules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Rockets used must be a replica of an existing launch vehicle. Alternatively, launch vehicles can be non-replica if they conform to modern rocketry standards (so limited cross feeding, no asparagus, nosecones and fairings mandatory).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1a) SSTO shuttle aircraft are exempt from the realism restrictions laid out in 1. SSTO shuttles may not use air hogging in any way (intakes cannot be clipped into one another). SSTO aircraft (or any craft for that matter) may not fire nuclear engines within the atmosphere of any planet. Additionally, nuclear engines may not be fired towards a planet\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s surface below 5km altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Aerodynamic realism must be upheld (even without the use of FAR). All payloads must fit within fairings and all boosters must have nose cones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Crew ferry vehicles and tourist ferry craft must be different. Tourists are more picky and require better amenities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) All bases and space stations must provide enough amenities. For tourists, this means two kerbal crew slots per person and for normal crew, just one. In order to maintain comforts, stations must keep at least 5000 units of electric charge to power AC, interior lighting, life support, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission submission guidelines:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) It must be completable within 1 week (of on-and-off gameplay; no colonize the entire Jool system at once missions). It must also be completable given the current lifter tech I am using. For examples, see the ULA Delta IV series and the SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon 9 heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) It must forward our goal of being the premiere provider of space tourism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) It should be a proactive challenge, go here and do this, not a reactive one in response to some event like a space station accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) It should make sense. Explain in detail and make it very clear what you are suggesting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMission reports on the status of missions and our hardware will be posted on weekends. I try to stream on Saturdays so you may even find my stream focusing on this from time to time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA variation of this was quite popular over in the fan works so I decided it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s time to take my spin on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome suggestions for challenges, people, would be a space station hotel, a Munar observatory resort, zero G spaceplane, etc. Or even have me do some stuff infrastructure wise to prepare for greater missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn this main post, I will make note of my current launch hardware and my infrastructure so people know what I have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHardware:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENone ATM\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInfrastructure:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbin ground based radio communications\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbal01","CreatedById":57322,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T16:38:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow about a replica of the CASSIOPE launch that will happen to day, using the LazTek SpaceX F9 1.1?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Sierra","CreatedById":74666,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T21:50:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI refuse to use replica craft mods but I do have a Falcon 9 replica using mostly stock that I could use. let me do some research on that launch and I\u0027ll see if it fits the criteria.

I gotta watch the weather at a tourist resort anyways so a satellite to monitor space weather could be useful (I\u0027m aware this isn\u0027t how it works, thats a bit of RP for sake of how the challenge works).
