Is there a solution to put every part from a specific mod inside a \u0022tab\u0022 to show up when i want? Like: \u0022oh now i need some interplanetary travel engine, let\u0027s open the *nearfuturepropulsion* tab and let\u0027s choose an engine\u0022, instead of having 23526345234 engines all together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you \u0026lt;3\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbas_ad_astra","CreatedById":126593,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-15T15:47:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou need \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/104231\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFilter Extensions\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E.
