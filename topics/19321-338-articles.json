Currently I\u0027m waiting on a stripped-down parachute module from stupid_chris (who was gracious enough to offer one) to replace stock behavior. For obvious reasons, I can\u0027t release a FAR version that results in pods impacting the ground at 180 m/s. Also, I\u0027m too sleepy to make a good judgment call about its release state.\u003Cp\u003EFor those wondering exactly what nuFAR / voxelFAR / vesselCenteredFAR does compared to previous versions, it basically does away with the part-centered operation of the previous FAR versions (the same behavior that powers NEAR and newStock) in favor of a vessel-centered approach. Instead of the part-centered complications of determining the interactions between parts (which are never done exactly right) it\u0027ll create a voxel model of the vehicle to work with, like these guys:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/th6Jd6z.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/th6Jd6z.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/fkxx9ON.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/fkxx9ON.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom this, I can get a lot of data about how the vessel will behave in flight. Most importantly, I can implement a long-awaited feature: area-ruling. Basically, it\u0027s a requirement for transonic and supersonic flight that states that for minimum drag, a vehicle\u0027s cross-section must vary smoothly. And very small changes in cross-section can have a surprisingly large effect on transonic and supersonic drag. So for ease of use, you\u0027ll get a nice graph of cross-sectional area over the vehicle so you can see where to mess with things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/L3ZcDkV.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/L3ZcDkV.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe yellow line is the 2nd derivative of cross-sectional area, which actually goes into the math behind drag. Green is obviously cross-sectional area. Transonic area ruling consists of fiddling with the cross-section curves until you smooth out the curve to get minimum drag. For obvious reasons, some people will find this unfun given the limited design choices we have for shaping things, so there are difficulty options that include various multipliers to the total drag and smoothing functions for the area to deal with the noisiness of the voxel model itself. But to give you an idea of how this makes things go, getting supersonic is an exercise in flying through a brick wall that may tear you to shreds. I\u0027ve actually had to throttle down near Max Q to prevent a very nasty, very large rocket from coming apart and destroying itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that fun, the voxel approach also allows better resolution of body lift, which can give bodies their proper forces, rather than a simpler approximation from parts. Another benefit of the voxel approach is that cargo bays and payload fairings are emergent from the system. Rather than being defined top-down like in FAR, NEAR, or newStock, \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E collection of parts in a hollow arrangement will be tried as shielded from the airflow. Although the current wing model is the legacy oldFAR wing model, I also expect that the voxel approach can be used to calculate wing shapes and provide a much more accurate model of the wings as well as the fuselage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah. Enjoy newStock for now or stay on 0.90 and keep oldFAR. nuFAR will be out soon, when I will battle the demons of what version to give it. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, you are awesome.

Now I have ksp 1.0 just sitting here, waiting to be launch. I can\u0027t do that without nuFAR. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EMKAY","CreatedById":119954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T08:41:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not very familiar with aerothermodynamics, nevertheless my idea is: voxel based shapes to calculate reentry heat-flow (and connect it somehow to DR or to the new stock system).
