I haven\u0027t tried \u003Cem\u003EKSP TOT\u003C/em\u003E with Wine yet, but I think it\u0027ll work ok.

And that\u0027s the Ejection Angle to Prograde/Retrograde. Maybe that can be calculated from the provided data, but I\u0027ve no idea how, and besides, there\u0027s another tool that can tell us, when we give it the data provided by \u003Cem\u003EFlyby Finder\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to alexmoon\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELaunch Window Planner\u003C/a\u003E, and plug in the details of the planet you want the flyby for.

To calculate the burns and starting Ejection Angle, Red Iron Crown\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109670-Precomputed-Low-TWR-Interplanetary-Transfer-Burns\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPrecomputed Low-TWR Interplanetary Transfer Burns\u003C/a\u003E are brilliant. As I needed to do a modified version of his transfer burns, to avoid running into the Mun\u0027s SOI, I extended his spreadsheet to get the Ejection Angle data I needed. Anyone who wants a copy can download it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlj81n29xby7frd/MyMultiburnEscape.xlsx?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you will probably want to have a few mods installed. At minimum, you\u0027ll want \u003Cem\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/em\u003E, because it takes some real fine-tuning to achieve flybys. \u003Cem\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/em\u003E is nice to have, if only to keep track of SOI-changes, so you can nursemaid your ship across them. \u003Cem\u003EMechJeb\u003C/em\u003E is very handy to have, for the simple reason that it makes for easy setting up of nodes for the multiple burns involved, and it is better at timing burns than any human. (And it isn\u0027t fooled by KSP\u0027s wildly inaccurate burn estimates.. it gets burn durations \u003Cstrong\u003Eright\u003C/strong\u003E.) If you think that\u0027s \u0027cheating\u0027, then consider this.. NASA \u0022cheats\u0022 all the time. Their burns are computer controlled, because human reactions aren\u0027t quick or consistently reliable enough for accurate results. So you\u0027ll be in good company. If you install \u003Cem\u003EMechJeb\u003C/em\u003E, install \u003Cem\u003EMechJeb and Engineer For All\u003C/em\u003E as well. That way you don\u0027t need to add a part to your craft, all your craft will automatically have \u003Cem\u003EMJ\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003EKER\u003C/em\u003E available. Speaking of \u003Cem\u003EKER\u003C/em\u003E, that\u0027s another helpful source of data. If you\u0027re following along with the rest of these steps, you\u0027ll also need \u003Cem\u003EHyperEdit\u003C/em\u003E to get the Hermes into orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight.. with that out the way, let\u0027s get down to the specific methodology/steps needed to set up the Kerbin-Duna-Kerbin free-return trajectory for \u003Cem\u003EThe Dunatian\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECreate a new game-save, then exit the game without going any further. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOpen the save\u0027s persistence file with a text editor (not Notepad, it adds invisible characters to files, that may mess things up).

I haven\u0027t tried \u003Cem\u003EKSP TOT\u003C/em\u003E with Wine yet, but I think it\u0027ll work ok.

And that\u0027s the Ejection Angle to Prograde/Retrograde. Maybe that can be calculated from the provided data, but I\u0027ve no idea how, and besides, there\u0027s another tool that can tell us, when we give it the data provided by \u003Cem\u003EFlyby Finder\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGo to alexmoon\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELaunch Window Planner\u003C/a\u003E, and plug in the details of the planet you want the flyby for.

To calculate the burns and starting Ejection Angle, Red Iron Crown\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/109670-Precomputed-Low-TWR-Interplanetary-Transfer-Burns\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EPrecomputed Low-TWR Interplanetary Transfer Burns\u003C/a\u003E are brilliant. As I needed to do a modified version of his transfer burns, to avoid running into the Mun\u0027s SOI, I extended his spreadsheet to get the Ejection Angle data I needed. Anyone who wants a copy can download it \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlj81n29xby7frd/MyMultiburnEscape.xlsx?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, you will probably want to have a few mods installed. At minimum, you\u0027ll want \u003Cem\u003EPreciseNode\u003C/em\u003E, because it takes some real fine-tuning to achieve flybys. \u003Cem\u003EKerbal Alarm Clock\u003C/em\u003E is nice to have, if only to keep track of SOI-changes, so you can nursemaid your ship across them. \u003Cem\u003EMechJeb\u003C/em\u003E is very handy to have, for the simple reason that it makes for easy setting up of nodes for the multiple burns involved, and it is better at timing burns than any human. (And it isn\u0027t fooled by KSP\u0027s wildly inaccurate burn estimates.. it gets burn durations \u003Cstrong\u003Eright\u003C/strong\u003E.) If you think that\u0027s \u0027cheating\u0027, then consider this.. NASA \u0022cheats\u0022 all the time. Their burns are computer controlled, because human reactions aren\u0027t quick or consistently reliable enough for accurate results. So you\u0027ll be in good company. If you install \u003Cem\u003EMechJeb\u003C/em\u003E, install \u003Cem\u003EMechJeb and Engineer For All\u003C/em\u003E as well. That way you don\u0027t need to add a part to your craft, all your craft will automatically have \u003Cem\u003EMJ\u003C/em\u003E or \u003Cem\u003EKER\u003C/em\u003E available. Speaking of \u003Cem\u003EKER\u003C/em\u003E, that\u0027s another helpful source of data. If you\u0027re following along with the rest of these steps, you\u0027ll also need \u003Cem\u003EHyperEdit\u003C/em\u003E to get the Hermes into orbit around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight.. with that out the way, let\u0027s get down to the specific methodology/steps needed to set up the Kerbin-Duna-Kerbin free-return trajectory for \u003Cem\u003EThe Dunatian\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECreate a new game-save, then exit the game without going any further.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOpen the save\u0027s persistence file with a text editor (not Notepad, it adds invisible characters to files, that may mess things up).

I should make any required course corrections for the Duna portion of the journey, before attempting to return to Kerbin. Otherwise, I wouldn\u0027t know if Hermes actually carried sufficient delta-V.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn reaching the flight\u0027s mid-point, I checked for the close-approach markers, and as expected, they were gone. Hermes would pass 900,000 km ahead of Duna. A little under 80m/s of prograde correctional burn would be necessary to get a suitable flyby, though this would naturally result in Hermes missing its\u0027 Kerbin encounter later. I was expecting this, as the same thing happened on my first attempt. Crossing orbits ahead of Duna was a nice bonus (my previous attempt passed behind Duna), as it would make things a little easier for the DAV to rendezvous. Experimenting with various approaches, I was able to get to within 2,500km of Duna\u0027s surface, along the way spending 9 hours in Duna\u0027s SOI. A nice side-effect of passing through Duna\u0027s SOI was that the gravitational pull nudged my trajectory back 50,000km closer to Kerbin\u0027s orbit, saving me a little fuel on my later correctional burn to rendezvous with Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a result of this testing, I was able to determine the factors that would be necessary for a successful rendezvous with the DAV. At the 2,500km periapse, my slowest surface speed relative to Duna was 2,900m/s. By the time I\u0027d left Duna\u0027s SOI, that speed was in excess of 5,450m/s. Though I didn\u0027t think to check, when I entered Duna\u0027s SOI, my speed at that time would have been similar. So ideally, a DAV launch should be timed to encounter Hermes at periapse. Once we have some idea of the necessary flight time involved, this will simplify the setting of a KAC alarm for the DAV launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter departing Duna\u0027s SOI, I course-corrected for a Kerbin encounter, and set off in pursuit. On entering Kerbin\u0027s SOI, I set up a burn to bring my periapse down to around 100km. On setting up a circularisation burn, I discovered that I was approx. 800m/s short of what would be required. Deciding that a wildly eccentric orbit was better than none, I fired up the engines to see what would happen. The orbit closed with literally only 40m/s of delta-V remaining! My final orbit was 145km x 15,000, with dry tanks. Had I not been able to save 40m/s due to the Oberth Effect when departing Kerbin, I would have failed to gain a capture, and the crew would have been doomed to orbit the sun, somewhere out near Duna\u0027s orbit. Talk about cutting things close!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor my next experiment, I\u0027m going to try a mid-course correction that will allow me to pass behind Duna, instead of in front. The delta-V penalty for the DAV should not be too severe, and I\u0027m curious to see if it will prove to be more fuel-efficient for the Hermes. The main problem that I can see at this stage is that Duna\u0027s gravity will nudge my orbit 50,000km in the wrong direction if I make the same kind of close approach on the opposite side of Duna, than I did this time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T11:33:56Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 11:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by JAFO\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JAFO","CreatedById":132901,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-09T11:30:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI will trust you on this, I was just repeating something I saw on another thread.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a feeling you\u0027d gotten the idea elsewhere.. Think of it this way.. you\u0027re in a lander above Duna. You\u0027re dropping towards the surface, and you have a proper west-east motion of 100m/s. Duna has a west-east motion of 30m/s. Your effective motion relative to Duna\u0027s surface is 70m/s.

If you also fly west-east, that 30m/s gets added to any sideways velocity you feed in from your engines. If, on the other hand, you took off east-west, your true sideways vector is 30m/s less than your relative surface velocity would suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022 data-cite=\u0022selfish_meme\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it still a flyby at the edge of the SOI of Duna?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo.. my fear of entering the SOI turned out to be unjustified.

Think of it this way.. you\u0027re in a lander above Duna. You\u0027re dropping towards the surface, and you have a proper west-east motion of 100m/s. Duna has a west-east motion of 30m/s. Your effective motion relative to Duna\u0027s surface is 70m/s. So if you cancel 70m/s of your sideways motion, relative to Duna, you are now stationary and falling straight down.\u003Cp\u003EIf, on the other hand, you have 100m/s of east-west motion, your effective motion relative to the surface, which is moving in the opposite direction to you, is now 130m/s. To become stationary relative to the surface, you now need to not only cancel your 100m/s of sideways motion, but you need to dial in 30m/s in the opposite direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you launch off the surface of Duna, because you were previously in contact with the planet, you have 30m/s of west-east motion automatically added to your sideways vector when you lift off. If you also fly west-east, that 30m/s gets added to any sideways velocity you feed in from your engines. If, on the other hand, you took off east-west, your true sideways vector is 30m/s less than your relative surface velocity would suggest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo.. my fear of entering the SOI turned out to be unjustified. Because of the relative closing speeds involved, a few hours spent in Duna\u0027s SOI has only a relatively small effect on Hermes\u0027 trajectory. In fact, as my report above shows, if passing ahead of Duna, it can even have a positive effect on Hermes\u0027 course. This means we can get much closer to Duna, which I\u0027m expecting (pending empirical testing) to make the DAV rendezvous easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the suggestion..
