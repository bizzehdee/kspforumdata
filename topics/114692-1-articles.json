Unless you can fix your old install there\u0027s no way to get it. Maybe you can identify the bad files and ask some people to send them to you."},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T22:54:11Z","Content":"Hmmm... I\u0027m pretty sure I had a seperate install, but deleted it. I\u0027m gonna go look in bin for it."},{"CreatedByName":"robopilot99","CreatedById":102126,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T23:27:36Z","Content":"Have you actually found any mods that were not compatible? Since it\u0027s just a miner update I don\u0027t think there would be any issues."},{"CreatedByName":"xXIndestructibleEVAXx","CreatedById":110214,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T23:51:57Z","Content":"Quite a few, actually. They were mostly smaller ones, but with these mods now than get a new version and wait. Also, I did find another version in my computers trash bin, which was unused IIRC."}]}
