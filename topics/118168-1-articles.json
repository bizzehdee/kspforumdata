(A megaparsec is about 3.26 million light years.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe researchers looked at a small slice of the sky across almost the entire electromagnetic spectrum \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 from the far ultra-violet range, through visible light to the far infra-red and the edges of radio waves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while the section examined may seem small \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 just 0.56 per cent of the whole sky \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the data from the 220,000 galaxies is sufficient for the astronomers to be very confident of their findings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That sounds like quite a small amount,\u0022 Hopkins said. \u0022But if you look at the simulated flight through of the galaxies you\u0027ll get an impression of just how much information there really is.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo will our descendants of the far future eventually see the stars and galaxies go dark?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, says Hopkins, but probably much earlier than at the time of the energy death of the universe. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It will be due to the accelerated expansion of the universe that we will eventually stop seeing stars and galaxies.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Because the universe is expanding, eventually the galaxies will get further and further apart until ultimately \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 on the scale of hundreds of billions of years \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 the universe will be a cold, dark isolated place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We won\u0027t be able to see any other stars or galaxies and any sentient beings alive then will be very, very isolated indeed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut Driver says death may not be the end of all things: \u0022There is one tiny glimmer of hope.\u0022 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022We may have been here before,\u0022 Driver says. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Theorists believe the early universe also went through a period of inflation (which we\u0027re in again now). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022In that case it is argued that it suddenly stopped and dumped the dark energy driving this inflation into normal energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022This is highly speculative but it is possible that we\u0027re in a recursive universe, which periodically goes through periods of inflation followed by periods of activity and evolution, which eventually dwindle as we enter the next inflationary phase.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo that\u0027s something to look forward to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E - SMH \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E=====================================================================\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot really news, we always knew the universe was going to die....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T00:37:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENothing ever really changes.

When the sun was born it produced a brief period of more intense sunlight, but then it declined and has been steadily rising. I think that the authors are trying to point out that galaxies are sort of fizzling out, the effect of merging galaxies and massive central black holes is ejecting gas into intergalactic space which is basically starving the galaxies of material for new star formation. As a consequence many galaxies are loaded with red-dwarfs and old stars in which the spectrum has shifted to red. But the gas that ended up in intergalactic space is in an equilibrium, because these x-ray jets are heating the gas which is keeping it moving, once gas stops being fed from other galaxies it will cool down and can condense to form new galaxies and other stars. This could go on for a while but it will eventually stop. Our milky way is enjoying a sort of happy life as a young vigorous adult, however once it merges with andromeda there will be a brief period of star formation but then all the gas will get sucked into and shot out of the central vertices leaving it rickety old man.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rtxoff","CreatedById":107622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T13:34:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s just a hypothesis so somehow i won\u0027t accept this opinion that all is meaningless and that someday all will went to oblivion.
