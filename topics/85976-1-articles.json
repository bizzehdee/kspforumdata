For some reason this contract was giving me 2.2 million funds for completion which is massive in my experience (I have only just started playing in .24 and missions to Duna, Eve etc. are all for only a few hundred thousand). Do the funds offered increase as you go on?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway I made a pretty basic design, emptying the LFB KR 1X2 and attaching two S3 KS-25x4 with the appropriate tanks. I also added probes, SAS batteries and solar panels, and Kerbal Engineer parts. \u002B6 Long boosters\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll was going well when I got to low kerbin orbit and I transferred nearly all the fuel from the side tanks to the test tank so I could deorbit the side tanks and have enough in the test tank to reach Munar orbit.

Also, Kerbin had \u0022disappeared\u0022: not one of those ones where it goes completely or turns into a small blue disk, but it had turned mostly white with clouds (I have the enhancement mod installed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI switched to map and everything was fine there but same situation when switching back. I switched to another craft orbiting Moho and then back to the test craft and then\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBug 2\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESame story as last time, but this time pressing buttons like Exit and Space Center don\u0027t work: there is an animation but nothing happens.

Switching to map mode I can see Kerbal but twisted to one side and off centre, also the background stars are visible and if I zoom in far enough I can see a different craft (my space centre). This is where I really start to worry as maybe my whole save is corrupted, and I did nothing to provoke it. I kill the program again, restart and delete the craft from the Tracking Station.

The money I earned is still there as is the reputation, but I\u0027m worried that come a few years\u0027 time I will lose 2.2 million funds for not completing the mission that started all this off.
