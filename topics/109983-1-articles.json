Now I know how to make a rocket or jet engine work, and I know there is a Helicopter add on at Kerbal Stuff, but I am looking to make this bird fly As is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022\u0022 alt=\u0022\u0026lt;a  href=\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 alt=\u0022%7Boption%7D\u0022\u003Ehttp://i571.photobucket.com/albums/ss157/Niles_Ferrier/screenshot117_zpslparialk.png\u0027 alt=\u0027screenshot117_zpslparialk.png\u0027\u0026gt;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes its the OH6 LIttlebird, or commonly known as the LOACH.
