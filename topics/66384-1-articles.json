A wise person drives around the craters and cliffs but this requires several legs to be plotted on your course. The problem is there is no way to plot legs to a journey on land. It would be very helpful to have the ability to place waypoints and plot out my rovers course on a planet which show up on my nav ball and/or are set as a target on my screen. A second idea that I\u0027m not holding my breath for but would be very nice to have is autopilot once the nav points for my rover have been set. You cannot time warp when driving the rover like you can in a spaceship traveling through space. Who wants to drive the rover for 3 hrs to get 1/4 of the way around the Mun? At the very least, I would like to see Nav Markers but would love something to address the monotony of the rover journey.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
