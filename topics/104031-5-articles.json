For a 10 ton impactor at Mach 10 (with kinetic energy equivalent to its own mass in TNT), the radius to damage \u0022heavily built concrete buildings\u0022 is about 20 metres, while for more ordinary buildings it\u0027s about 100 metres. I\u0027m not so sure about effectiveness against underground bunkers. Regardless, if you\u0027re targeting a reinforced structure you probably want much more precision. Laser-guided bombs can manage a CEP of \\*one\\* metre, and probably other systems where the projectile is able to \u0027see\u0027 the target can do the same.\n\nBack to the original question of what a rods-of-god strike would look like, well before impact it would probably be just like a nuclear missile re-entry such as this famous(ish) Peacekeeper shot:\n\n![Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Peacekeeper-missile-testing.jpg)\n\nAlthough that\u0027s a long exposure, I don\u0027t know how bright the projectiles would look to the eye."},{"CreatedByName":"kerbiloid","CreatedById":129408,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T07:38:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 hours ago, cantab said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Although that\u0027s a long exposure, I don\u0027t know how bright the projectiles would look to the eye.\n\u003E \n\nSpoiler\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/6SObYcIRTlI?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022459\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T15:07:09Z","Content":"[@kerbiloid](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129408-kerbiloid/) That\u0027s a really great find! And I think pretty much finalises answering [@RainDreamer](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/129077-raindreamer/) \u0027s original question, because these unarmed re-entry vehicles are very much like an orbital strike projectile would be, impacting at the same kind of speed quoted as 16000 km/h (or Mach 13, or 4500 m/s). I can\u0027t find the mass of the re-entry vehicle, but changing mass should just scale up or down the effects anyway.\n\nA bright bolide flying across the sky, then at the impact site a relatively small fireball and a larger cloud of debris thrown into the air, with fragments landing considerably further away. Almost surely an impact crater and probably a blast, but the video doesn\u0027t have close-ups or audio to confirm.\n\nIt\u0027s not dissimilar to my prediction on page 3, the biggest difference seems to be that hitting a real-world target throws up a lot more fine dust that lingers, compared to hitting a uniform bed of sand.\n\nI think the video also demonstrates that if the guidance was precise enough, an ICBM with kinetic impact warheads would be an effective weapon. Value-for-money is another matter though, and there are concerns that the target and third parties might detect an ICBM launch and assume it was carrying a nuclear weapon and react accordingly."},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-06T20:06:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5.11.2016 at 3:43 PM, DerekL1963 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E True, but even so the effectiveness of it\u0027s controls limits what it can do.
