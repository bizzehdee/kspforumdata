Put a bunch of guys in an OKS hab module in one of the earlier launches. They didn\u0027t show up anywhere, except in the ground based kerbal management ui (hire/fire thing).\n\nGot the station finished. I installed crew manifest to try to access the kerbals in the module. It allowed me to move them around the station.\n\nSaved, quit, and now I can no longer control that space station.\n\nLog shows:\n\n[EXC 08:34:46.428] ArgumentOutOfRangeException: Argument is out of range.\n\nParameter name: index\n\n System.Collections.Generic.List\u00601[internalSeat].get\\_Item (Int32 index)\n\n KnowledgeBase.CreateVesselCrewList (.Vessel v)\n\n KnowledgeBase.OnMapFocusChange (.MapObject target)\n\n EventData\u00601[MapObject].Fire (.MapObject data)\n\n PlanetariumCamera.SetTarget (.MapObject tgt)\n\n SpaceTracking.SetVessel (.Vessel v, Boolean keepFocus)\n\n SpaceTracking\u002B\n\n .MoveNext ()\n\n[EXC 08:34:46.497] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n\n KnowledgeBase.UpdateVesselInfoList (.Vessel v)\n\n KnowledgeBase.FixedUpdate ()\n\n[EXC 08:34:46.615] NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n\n KnowledgeBase.UpdateVesselInfoList (.Vessel v)\n\n KnowledgeBase.FixedUpdate ()\n\nIt looks like those were munged kerbals, and they got put someplace bad. \n\nTLDR:\n\n1. Put kerbals in OKS hab module on VAB. \n\n2. Launch OKS hab to space station. \n\n3. Use crew manifest to move kerbals to other parts.\n\nThis assumes I didn\u0027t put them into a bad module, which is also a possibility.\n\nFew questions:\n\n1. Is there any way to remove those kerbals and salvage this savegame?\n\n2. Barring that, Is there any way to save just the ship, and start a new game with that ship in orbit?"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord_Pall","CreatedById":2350,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T17:32:47Z","Content":"Copied the vessel section in the save to a new clean game.
