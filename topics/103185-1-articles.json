I can not connect one part to another in two or three points.\n\nSee a picture. Points 1,2,3 are connected, while 4 is not.

The best way to get that last point connected is to use a strut to connect the adjacent parts.\n\nSome trickery can be done with multiple docking ports, but it\u0027s much more finicky to get working and usually makes a less structurally sound assembly than using struts. Multiple docking ports are better for things assembled in orbit when one port isn\u0027t rigid enough."},{"CreatedByName":"Yasmy","CreatedById":79995,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-01T23:59:26Z","Content":"\u003Cdeleted because=\u0022\u0022 red=\u0022\u0022 iron=\u0022\u0022 crown=\u0022\u0022 beat=\u0022\u0022 me=\u0022\u0022 to=\u0022\u0022 it.=\u0022\u0022\u003E\u003C/deleted\u003E\n\nOr you can use a mod like Kerbal Attachment System (KAS)"},{"CreatedByName":"Dixi","CreatedById":140278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T00:00:57Z","Content":"So, if I do not want mods, the only way is to put shot struts to connect loose points.

The extra pieces won\u0027t make it any stronger, and by adding more joints you\u0027re actually \\*decreasing\\* stability. Just use the outriggers at the main attachment point (and use as few as you can get away with). Also, placing struts can be somewhat strategic. Try to place some above and below the main attachment point and parallel to the outrigger, also try to place some on diagonals to help dissipate torsional forces. Having too many is better than to few... once you get it strong, you can start experimenting to see what you can take away. \n\n\u0022perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away\u0022 - Antoine de Saint Exup\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00A9ry"},{"CreatedByName":"superm18","CreatedById":57755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-04T07:04:14Z","Content":"Use the welding mod by ubizur"},{"CreatedByName":"The-Grim-Sleeper","CreatedById":183905,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-06T09:22:53Z","Content":"You might also like the \u0027Recoupler\u0027-mod by Booots:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed2765981875\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/157131-130-recoupler-monocouple-your-bicouplers/\u0026\u0026do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nLink to the welding mod by ubizur:\n\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022\u0022 data-controller=\u0022core.front.core.autosizeiframe\u0022 data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 data-embedid=\u0022embed9239074803\u0022 scrolling=\u0022no\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/96670-131-252-2017-10-28-ubiozur-welding-ltd-continued/\u0026do=embed\u0022 style=\u0022height:214px;max-width:502px;\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-01-08T02:07:03Z","Content":"This is a years-old thread, and the person originally seeking help has presumably long since gotten their answer.  ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif \u0022;)\u0022)\n\nLocking the thread to prevent further confusion.
