Use of skycrane type designs yet another. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some obvious \u0022golden nuggets\u0022 floating around the forums, but it would be nice if someone could combine that information into one place. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example: you can cover the simple land a pod / rover. The. Landing a maned mission that includes a rover for your kerbals, then maybe landing base type modules. Then skycranes for small things and skycranes for large items?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIcing on the cake: a reusable skycrane capable of both delivering a payload to the surface or taking a payload to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
