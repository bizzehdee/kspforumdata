Staple the mod, select the size, select the texture, adjust if you need it. That\u0027s all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond, this was the purpose of the mod from the beginning. If you don\u0027t like it, I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll have to bear with it or find something else. You can always use the legacy parts and modify them for them to show once more in the VAB.

Unfortunately, I cannot help you at all right now. I\u0027ll need your output_log.txt, KSP.log, and as much information as possible. In which save file is this not working? Career or sandbox? The more information the better. Because as is, there are two clear things that should not happen. First, all those context menus of tweakable should not appear on the new parts. Second, that editor window should not look like that. Basically, something really wrong is going on. I\u0027ll need the info to know, because this bug has never happened to anyone else before, and so I doubt it\u0027s caused purely by RealChute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022edemlama\u0022 data-cite=\u0022edemlama\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust noticed that the calculator is a .exe file, this is going to kill this mod for all the OSX users, mac can\u0027t run .exe files\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood thing that you don\u0027t need it then, \u003Cem\u003Esince it\u0027s in the game now\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, if you could upload your GameData folder in a zip file, it would be of great help.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"edemlama","CreatedById":100153,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T00:30:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry didn\u0027t mean to sound rud,I was quite puzzled but what i was seeing and it took me a bit to understand that there was something wrong with it. i will send everything now, how do i get the .log files?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arrowmaster","CreatedById":57556,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T00:54:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had the same issue.
