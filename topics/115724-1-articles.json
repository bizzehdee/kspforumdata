As it happened, this asteroid had a small probe attached to it and equally exposed to the airstream so it was interesting to compare what happened to both the rock and the probe.\n\nI suppose most asteroids are small and flimsy so should fall apart/explode in Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere. I was just a bit surprised that the whole big asteroid was destroyed before even the solar panels on the attached probe failed ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif).\n\nWhile having asteroids be destroyed on reentry is, I suppose, realistic, it\u0027s still a bit disappointing.

I was willing to give realism a pass on that one.\n\nBesides, if asteroids are so flimsy (I\u0027m assuming \u0022rubble pile\u0022 and such things), how are we able to grab and move them around like we do?"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T17:17:45Z","Content":"Asteroids have a maxtemp much lower than some other parts, if you want one down to kerbin at 100% heat, you have to either do a powered smooth landing or attach lots of heatshields.\n\nYet, disappointing to lose an asteroid"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T01:29:51Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yet, disappointing to lose an asteroid\n\nYou missed my points. I wasn\u0027t trying to land this asteroid and the ship I sent to it lacked the thrust and fuel to affect its course or orientation at all. My point was, asteroids, even big ones, burn up before small, delicate, unprotected probes. Hell, even before the solar panels of the small, delicate, unprotected probes.\n\nI find this rather bemusing. Asteroids, even small ones, have rather high mass, especially compared to a ship. Much more density, etc. This mass SHOULD realistically make them into vast heatsinks when compared to attached ships, especially because, being round-ish, asteroids have a low amount of surface area to volume so cannot heat up very fast anyway.\n\nBasically, if you assume that an asteroid is a monolithic thing, then it should NOT die before exposed delicate parts. In fact, it maybe shouldn\u0027t die at all but make it to the ground. Sure, its outer layers might slag and spall somewhat but its center shouldn\u0027t even know the outside\u0027s gotten hot. And assuming asteroids to be monoliths seems to be the basis for the Klaw and the whole implementation of ARM.\n\nConversely, if you assume the asteroid is a rubble pile or some sunch thing, then sure, the air resistance should scatter it like windblown chaff. But then how could a ship grapple it and move it around as desired?\n\nSo, we have a conflict here IMHO. OT1H, the asteroids can be Klawed and maneuvered as monoliths, bot OTOH they have the reentry resistance of rubble piles. This IMHO needs to be resolved so that asteroids are the same across the board. Because essentially everything else connected with asteroids assumes monolithic structure, then IMHO reentry should be the same way. Thus, asteroids should not even begin to come close to burning up."},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T07:44:13Z","Content":"Asteroids seem weak because stock parts are incredibly heat tolerant. I remember asteroids have 2500 \u0022units\u0022 of max temperature, which is currently pathetic for giant solid space rocks.\n\nYour explanation of a rubble pile asteroid made me wish for some more SQUAD care. They really are big and should have enormous thermal mass, they look like big space rocks, but burn up like they were made of magical space dust that cant stand heat. Maybe squad would fix.\n\n(I\u0027d also like a higher crash tolerance on them)"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T07:50:13Z","Content":"Still thinking asteroids should burn down in size - A C-class would pop to a B-class, than an A and lastly go poof.\n\nEverything attached to an asteroid while it burns down should loose its connection."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T08:00:58Z","Content":"wow it\u0027s the other extreme.
