I wasn\u0027t trying to land this asteroid and the ship I sent to it lacked the thrust and fuel to affect its course or orientation at all. My point was, asteroids, even big ones, burn up before small, delicate, unprotected probes. Hell, even before the solar panels of the small, delicate, unprotected probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI find this rather bemusing. Asteroids, even small ones, have rather high mass, especially compared to a ship. Much more density, etc. This mass SHOULD realistically make them into vast heatsinks when compared to attached ships, especially because, being round-ish, asteroids have a low amount of surface area to volume so cannot heat up very fast anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, if you assume that an asteroid is a monolithic thing, then it should NOT die before exposed delicate parts. In fact, it maybe shouldn\u0027t die at all but make it to the ground. Sure, its outer layers might slag and spall somewhat but its center shouldn\u0027t even know the outside\u0027s gotten hot. And assuming asteroids to be monoliths seems to be the basis for the Klaw and the whole implementation of ARM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, if you assume the asteroid is a rubble pile or some sunch thing, then sure, the air resistance should scatter it like windblown chaff. But then how could a ship grapple it and move it around as desired?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, we have a conflict here IMHO. OT1H, the asteroids can be Klawed and maneuvered as monoliths, bot OTOH they have the reentry resistance of rubble piles. This IMHO needs to be resolved so that asteroids are the same across the board. Because essentially everything else connected with asteroids assumes monolithic structure, then IMHO reentry should be the same way. Thus, asteroids should not even begin to come close to burning up.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-13T07:44:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAsteroids seem weak because stock parts are incredibly heat tolerant.
