The amount of Liquid fuel you can store is the same. What I\u0027m suggesting is to make it so when you empty a tank from Oxidizer, you can fill it with more liquid fuel to take the place of the oxidiser. Also, Scott Manley once said that we will be able to use orange tanks for all kinds of fuel-Xenon gas, RCS fuel, which is not in the game yet. That should be added too, in my opinion.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T16:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to see in the base game, certainly, if only to significantly reduce part bloat.
