Radial-in/out will \u0022rotate\u0022 your orbit around a point that is decided by where you are along your current orbit, and the specifics of your orbit. Try creating a maneuver node with a significant radial-in/out burn, and move it around your orbit. Here\u0027s the basic process:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Pivot your orbit until the argument is correct (altitude may be off). Maneuver nodes can help here, radial burns adjust this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Burn prograde/retrograde at the appropriate times to match the orbit exactly. This *must* occur at peri/apoapse in order to avoid changing the argument.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Once close, argument can become a bit jumpy (especially for a circular orbit), use a combination of prograde/retrograde and radial to adjust the height of your peri/apoapse to the desired point without changing argument. If you\u0027re approaching your apoapse, radial-out will shift it ahead of you in your orbit, and radial in will shift it backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Note that the more you are angled towards radial, the less the burn will affect prograde (and vice versa).

Your inclination is the angle that your orbit makes with the equatorial plane. Think of it like a disc. Once you have an inclination, your orbital plane changes (and can be rotated around). This rotation is where the longitude argument comes into play, the longitude of ascending node is the longitude at which your orbit will cross the equatorial plane (and is presumably written with respect to the parent body\u0027s prograde vector). Imagine taking your orbit and rotating it around the north pole, this is the adjustment of the longitude of your ascending node. Adjusting this is a very difficult task, which is why at launch you must take care to match the target plane (not just its inclination). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etl;dr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m describing this well, so I\u0027ll give one more example. If you think of a satellite dish, pointed up at an angle and imagine the rim of the dish as an orbital path... the angle that the dish makes with the ground is its inclination. If this dish were attached on a post which allowed the entire thing to rotate, this rotation would be like changing the longitude of the ascending node... if it were pointing east, and then rotated to point south this would represent a change of 90 degrees in the longitude of ascending node.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I do, I\u0027m too lazy/impatient to wait for the correct time to perform the most efficient launch (directly into the correct orbit)... so I simply launch on a low equatorial orbit (as if going anywhere else really), then burn so that my apoapse rests on the ascending/descending node of the target orbit. Once at apoapse I burn to match inclination and raise my orbit until it crosses the target orbit\u0027s periapse or apoapse. Once there I use a combination of prograde/retrograde/radial burns to match my target orbit perfectly. It\u0027s a bit more complicated, but it\u0027s not terribly inefficient (just marginally inefficient). The reason I use this method is because it really reduces the guesswork and potentially difficult piloting that can go with trying to launch directly into the desired orbit.
