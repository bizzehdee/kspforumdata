Radial-in/out will \u0022rotate\u0022 your orbit around a point that is decided by where you are along your current orbit, and the specifics of your orbit. Try creating a maneuver node with a significant radial-in/out burn, and move it around your orbit. Here\u0027s the basic process:\n\n1) Pivot your orbit until the argument is correct (altitude may be off). Maneuver nodes can help here, radial burns adjust this.\n\n2) Burn prograde/retrograde at the appropriate times to match the orbit exactly. This \\*must\\* occur at peri/apoapse in order to avoid changing the argument.\n\n3) Once close, argument can become a bit jumpy (especially for a circular orbit), use a combination of prograde/retrograde and radial to adjust the height of your peri/apoapse to the desired point without changing argument. If you\u0027re approaching your apoapse, radial-out will shift it ahead of you in your orbit, and radial in will shift it backwards.\n\n4) Note that the more you are angled towards radial, the less the burn will affect prograde (and vice versa). Use this fact to make the smallest possible adjustments to whatever orbital attribute you\u0027re trying to alter (in addition to decreasing throttle limiter and using capslock for fine control).\n\nOnce you practice a bit, you\u0027ll get the hang of it.

The obvious exception would be Polar orbits, since if you launch out of plane it will take a tremendous amount of Delta V to match them. Launch at zero. There will be people ho scoff at this, but when you get better at figuring out when to launch, then you can worry about launching into plane. \n\nFrom your 0 degree orbit, do the following:\n\n- Ensure your current orbit is circular\n- Focus view on Kerbin (or whatever body you are orbiting)\n- From your map view, locate the AN and DN nodes on the target orbit. (They will be indicated on contract orbits.)\n- Adjust your view so that both your *current* orbit and your *target* orbit each form a straight, flat line. (At the same time..You need this perspective.)\n- Now adjust your view so that the AN and DN nodes (They each have a little triangle pointer) are intersecting at the same point in your perspective (Both orbits should still be flat lines). The tips of the two pointing icons should just barely be touching, or as close as you can get. Click on this point of your orbit and create a manuever node.\n- Adjust your inclination from this point. From a circular orbit, the Delta V requirements should be roughly the same on either side (ascending, descending) of the orbital plane. This does require a basic understanding of how to change your inclination.\n- If you use mechjeb to do this, remember that you may have to do a \u0022negative\u0022 inclination change to match the orbit, depending on the node you perform the manuever at.\n- Using the same perspective trick, you can overlay the Ap and Pe node indicators and plot the changes to your apsides to perfectly match the target orbit.\n\nIf you follow this procedure (assuming I haven\u0027t made it seem entirely arcane), your matching orbits will be perfect after three burns (more if you change altitude in steps). Two disclaimers:\n\n1. You do not necessarily need to circularize your orbit before matching inclination, but remember that trying to change inclination at periapsis and at lower altitudes is much costlier than near apoapsis or high altitude.\n2. If you choose not to circularize, it will not work for matching apside points. You\u0027ll just have to create a node and drag it around until it matches.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-20T16:20:04Z\u0022 title=\u002203/20/2015 04:20  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 20, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"michaelhester07","CreatedById":96470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-20T16:10:09Z","Content":"I\u0027ll give you my experience for satellite launches into kerbin orbit.\n\n---===== Launch =====---\n\n1. Any heavily inclined orbit like that has 2 launch windows. Open your map and look at kerbin, then rotate around until the orbit appears flat. Now time warp until the marker for your satellite is nearly lined up. This is one of your launch windows. \n\n2. Pay attention to the direction the rotating dots are on the orbit.

When you get to the point where you\u0027ll start your gravity turn click on the velocity indicator on the navball to select \u0022orbit\u0022 mode, then line up your orbit prograde to the heading that your final orbit will be. You can estimate the orbit. Your screen shot\u0027s orbit would be about 150 degrees if prograde on it goes south, or about 320 if it goes north. Don\u0027t let your own prograde altitude on the nav ball drop below 45 degrees until your apoapsis is above 40km.\n\n4.

If your satellite is designed right then you also have 3000 delta V. We\u0027ll use some of it to learn what your markers will do. Find the normal marker (it\u0027s the blue marker on the \u0022sky\u0022 side of your navball. If you burn towards it you\u0027ll rotate the periapsis/apoapsis markers clockwise (as you view kerbin from the north). Find the anti-normal marker, burn towards it. You\u0027ll rotate the pe/ap markers counter clockwise. Note that this is reversed if you\u0027re in a retrograde orbit (that is an orbit in the opposite direction that kerbin\u0027s moons go).\n\nLocate the purple markers. On is to the north, the other to the south. \n\n1. Find the AN/DN on the target orbit. These will not be marked on your orbit. You\u0027ll have to eyeball the lineup like you did with the launch window. Burn toward one of the purple markers when you\u0027re at DN. If the node\u0027s angle decreases keep burning, otherwise burn toward the other marker. Get these angles under 1 degree.\n\n2. Using the information about normal/anti normal you can line up the PE marker with the target orbit\u0027s PE. It may be your AP marker. You can do this from any point in your orbit.\n\n3. Now that the PE/AP marker is lined up wait till your ship is at the opposite marker and burn prograde until the marker\u0027s altitude is the same as the target orbit marker\u0027s altitude\n\n4.

Use normal or anti-normal burns to match the marker\u0027s location in the orbit.\n\n5.
