I find these to be particularly useful when plotting a rendezvous; you can set up a node that intercepts with your target\u0027s orbit and then click the right button to allow additional time for phasing if you\u0027re going to be arriving early at the target orbit.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T14:25:56Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 02:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by A\\_name**"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:23:37Z","Content":"Hi Sharpy, they are for moving to the next and preceding orbit, basically forwards and backwards in time and the buttons have a \u0022-\u0022 and a \u0022\u002B\u0022 on them ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nNinja\u0027d by A\\_name!"},{"CreatedByName":"A_name","CreatedById":134040,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T18:41:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Ninja\u0027d by A\\_name!\n\n Hahahaha happens too often! ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"}]}
