The name is descriptive enough that I had an idea about what it was, but I hit Wiki to make sure. Basically, if you overlaid a 360\u00B0 compass card on the plane of reference (usually the equatorial plane of the body being orbited) but reversed the numbers so that they run COUNTER-clockwise, and referenced 000\u00B0 to a specified reference direction, you can determine the LAN by reading where on the imaginary compass card your orbit crosses from below the plane of reference to above it. Easy peezy, lemon squeezy, right? Except, what is the direction I should be using for 000\u00B0? In our real-world celestial navigation, 000 for the purposes of measuring a LAN is the ray created by drawing a line from the Sun out through the point in Earth\u0027s orbit at the vernal equinox. In KSP... where is the 000\u00B0 reference for LAN?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-11T15:34:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223670454\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022188161\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221568214735\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002292580\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fadamor\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n22 minutes ago, Fadamor said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn KSP... where is the 000\u00B0 reference for LAN?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCouldn\u0027t tell you off the top of my head, but the real answer is that \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eit doesn\u0027t matter\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe reason that it doesn\u0027t matter is that it\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egraphical\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E thing.\u00A0 You don\u0027t actually need to look at the numbers displayed on the contract at all, unless you particularly like to as a reference.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s because \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022background-color:#ffff00;\u0022\u003Ethe target orbit is graphically displayed in the map view\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E.\u00A0 Go into map view.\u00A0 If you focus on the Mun-- or on any spacecraft that\u0027s within the Mun\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E-- then you\u0027ll see the target orbit displayed in some bright color, with a little animated bright point moving round-and-round to show you which direction you need to be orbiting (pay attention to that-- a very common cause of \u0022hey, how come my contract\u0027s not completing\u0022 questions from new players is that they got to the correct orbit but are going in the wrong direction).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo all you have to do is use the map view to guide you as you set up your encounter and you\u0027re all set.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-11T16:33:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs Snark said, it really doesn\u0027t matter as far as completing the contract goes.\u00A0 I wouldn\u0027t even worry about when it comes to contracts.\u00A0 But if you really want to know where zero longitude is just to satisfy your curiosity, it seems to be just some random direction.\u00A0 Kerbin doesn\u0027t have a vernal equinox, so we can\u0027t use that, or anything else like it, for reference.\u00A0 However, we can located 0 longitude using the positions of Kerbin and the Sun at specific times of year.\u00A0 Kerbin is located at 180 degrees longitude on Day 1, 00:38:53 of every year, and is located at 0 longitude on Day 214, 00:55:05 of every year.\u00A0 So whenever the clock reads \u0022Day 1 - 0h39m\u0022, a line drawn from Kerbin to the Sun points in the direction of 0 longitude.\u00A0 And when the clock reads \u0022Day 214 - 0h55m\u0022, a line drawn from the Sun to the Kerbin points to 0 longitude.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(EDIT)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have to make a correction.\u00A0 The specific times that I cited apply only to Year 1.\u00A0 If Kerbin\u0027s year consisted of an exact number of integer days, then those times would reoccur every year.\u00A0 But since Kerbin\u0027s sidereal year contains a fractional day (1 year = 426.09 days), each new calendar year begins with Kerbin in a slightly different part of its orbit than the year before.\u00A0 It take an extra 32.41 minutes each year to get back to its staring place.\u00A0 So Kerbin doesn\u0027t reach 180 longitude on Year 2 until Day 1, 01:11:17, and the time continues to advance each year.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-11T22:17:37Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2019 10:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by OhioBob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fadamor","CreatedById":92580,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-12T02:50:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmm... never have seen a target orbit when I change focus, but then again I don\u0027t get too many contracts with specified orbits.
