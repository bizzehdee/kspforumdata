KSP needs at least 4GB according to the minimum system requirements, but that leaves pretty much nothing for background processes and the OS. I recommend 8GB or more of system RAM if you don\u0027t want to have to close your browser/everything else when playing. That needs a 64-bit OS, though the game will still be 32-bit."}]}
