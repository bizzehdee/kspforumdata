Those satellites are meant to be deploy at mid course to target a polar orbit (example Duna and Ike), as the station would target a equatorial orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I needed a radial separator. I tried to fix 2 decouplers in reversed (using offset and sub-assembly), which I would fire in sequence to avoid bouncing back. But the whole piece was hard to fix on the satellite and to the central core of the station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally I decided to launch the satellites to the front, so I used a 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 double decoupler using a radial decoupler, a small nose cone, and a small stack decoupler. These where much easier to fix on the station. But I was luck to be able to launch the satellites frontward.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you use radial separators ? How do you create them ?

Use the modular girder segment or cubic octagonal strut to create a radial attach node, and then attach the separator (or a decoupler with the arrows pointing out) and attach our satellite to that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou CAN get the radial decouplers to face backwards through clever root tool (the \u00224\u0022 key in the VAB) and subassembly doohickery, but it\u0027s complicated enough that I can\u0027t remember all the steps offhand and except in rare cases it\u0027s not worth the trouble. The only time I used it in game was for my Astro Glider 2, and I suspect it caused some light Kraken attacks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-20T11:07:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/128713-Radial-Separators-in-stock\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis tutorial \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ei\u003C/strong\u003Es for building radial separators out of the structural pylons.
