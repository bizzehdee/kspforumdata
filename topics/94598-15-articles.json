In fact I would even be willing to support CTT actively. But understand that I cannot simply remove or change the existing KSPI techtree without breaking someone game. My main concern is that players with existing campaign can continue their game. So in order to facilitate this, I added a global setting (PartTechUpgrades in WarpPluginSettings.cfg) which can link any number of interstellar parts to alternative Technodes. For the moment I linked all hightech Interstellar parts to their original KSPI technodes. This should ensure players can continue to build and upgrade their Interstellar parts with whatever Techtree they desire.\u003Cp\u003EYou can download the new version of KSPI 0.90 Extended 0.5.1 with support for other techmanager techtrees at \u003Ca href=\u0022https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/508/KSPI%200.90%20Extended%20Configuration?noedit=True\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbalStuff\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEnjoy!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThx for the fix.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI still didn\u0027t figured out where the problem in my CTT config is, I tested it on my other PC with only KSPI, TechManager and CTT installed.

Currently the stock KSP-I Liquid Methane tank has significantly lower volume-capacity that its actual dimensions as the stock KSP-I Liquid Methane resource is *MUCH* denser than the real thing (this was probably done to make it competitive with LiquidFuel, and to give it a similar feel in terms of volume capacities, as players wouldn\u0027t know just how far off the density used really was, and would otherwise assume the Methane tank held much more mass than it did based on their experiences with LiquidFuel, if a more realistic volume/density were used...) However since we\u0027re using *REALISTIC* densities for CO2 (it\u0027s much simpler than trying to come up with an arbitrary value that feels \u0022right\u0022 for the game- even Fractal_UK used a realistic value for the density of the gaseous phase CO2 in the CRP...) we need to correct the volume so the tank holds more. A good rule of thumb is that a fuel tank should have about 5x the resource capacity when moving to a realistic resource-density (unless you seriously think stockalike fuel tanks should have a utilization of less than 20%) Or, just used a Procedural Parts tank stretched to exactly the same dimensions as the fuel-tank to figure out the approximate correct volume...

I just wanted to caution you that the main reason besides running out of time to do it that Fractal_UK said he *didn\u0027t* include N2 or CO2 as usable propellants (despite apparently already having a resource definition included for CO2 in the Community Resource Pack- although he really should have used cryogenic liquid rather than gaseous densities and included a resource-cost...) was because he didn\u0027t want to overwhelm players or their RAM with too many different preset tank-types. The response to which was a deluge of suggestions by numerous players (including myself) that he just include a tweakable tank like in B9/Firespitter (although these responses reached him too late- as he had just begun a long period AWOL from KSP-Interstellar, little to my or anyone else\u0027 knowledge...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny solution that reduced the total number of parts players need to deal with- whether it\u0027s a universal-tank of some sort (the idea that a given tank could hold any number of propellants is not new to KSP, but nobody\u0027s figured out how to code a tank that can hold any of several resources but *ONLY* one at a time just yet...), or a tweakble tank that uses the same airframe/model for any of a number of different internal fuel tank setups, will be good with me and probably good with Fractal_UK. Personally, I\u0027m just going to delete the preset tank from my GameData folder anyways, as I have done with *ALL* my cylindrical preset tanks, and replace them with Procedural Parts tanks on my rockets...

Right now, the only usable way to store Liquid Nitrogen is in the Liquid Nitrogen Cryostat tank parts you released... (for reference, the KSPI_RF config already includes code to do this with KSP-I Water using Kerosene as a reference resource as it has the most similar properties to water- you could do the same using Liquid Oxygen as a reference resource for Liquid Nitrogen and Liquid CO2 to make these tanks available for any tank-type that can store Liquid Oxygen...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FreeThinker\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell for starters, it should not conflict with RealFuels because RealFuels does not affect KSPI thermal/electric trusters.

This is *EXACTLY* how rocket engines behave in real life: an engine operating in vacuum doesn\u0027t consume less fuel at full-throttle than one operating at sea-level, it just generates more thrust...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to *REALISTICALLY* simulate how an electric engine behaves at higher atmospheric pressures, you\u0027ll do the same thing. \u003Cstrong\u003EElectric Thrusters don\u0027t perform poorly at sea-level because they have lower fuel-flow, they perform poorly because they have terrible Specific Impulse (ISP) at sea-level.\u003C/strong\u003E The actual reason for this is because electric thrusters typically have VERY low exhaust-pressures (they rely on accelerating a very small number of molecules to a very fast speed instead of a lot of molecules to a slower speed), and thus suffer a LOT of atmospheric-compression of their exhaust stream at sea-level...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhich brings up an EXTREMELY interesting point\u003C/strong\u003E- a sufficiently high-powered (probably multi-GW) electric thruster operating on a low molecular mass fuel such as Hydrogen should actually have a very GOOD sea-level Specific Impulse, as its exhaust stream would have a quite-high pressure compared to the atmosphere (and thus the thruster would operate nearly as well at sea-level as in vacuum). The increased fuel-flow of a high-powered electric thruster doesn\u0027t just improve its thrust in vacuum, it also increases the density of its exhaust stream (and thus makes it perform better at higher atmospheric pressures). Theoretically you could have an electric thruster with a sufficiently high power-level that its ISP-curve was almost completely flat from sea-level to vacuum: that is its exhaust trail was so high-pressure that it was virtually unaffected by the surrounding atmosphere in low-altitude flight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, the reason electric thrusters perform poorly at sea-level is because the operate at very low fuel-flow rates (and thus exhaust stream densities). If an electric thruster\u0027s fuel-flow rate even started to remotely approach that of a chemical rocket, the curve between its sea-level and vacuum ISP would actually be FLATTER than that of a chemical rocket (that is, it would be LESS affected by higher atmospheric pressure) because its much higher exhaust-velocity leads to a much higher exhaust-pressure for the same mass-flow rate...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T18:00:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EFreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E you might find THIS equation helpful for creating a thrust-ISP relationship:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThrust = (Mass Flow-Rate) * (Exhaust Velocity) \u002B [(Exhaust Pressure) - (Background Pressure)] * (Exit Area)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhere \u0022Background Pressure\u0022 is the ambient pressure around the spacecraft, and Exit Area is the nozzle-size (it\u0027s worth noting that in a chemical rocket, increasing the nozzle-size increases Exhaust Velocity, but decreases Exhaust Pressure, due to the flow dynamics of the exhaust-stream...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EElectric Thrusters normally operate in the regime where Background Pressure is negligible- outside the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, if fired INSIDE the atmosphere, the Background Pressure will typically overwhelm their anemic Exhaust Pressure (which is so low that electric thrusters usually don\u0027t even include a proper nozzle to provide extra Exit Area, as it\u0027s not worth the extra mass...) and the second term becomes negative, causing the electric thruster to lose thrust.

This has never been done in real life, but it is *EASILY* possible in KSP-Interstellar with Microwave Beamed Power (on the scale of hundreds of MW to a single plasma thruster) or an Antimatter Reactor for the power-source for a high-powered plasma thruster...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-05T00:05:44Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2015 12:05  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tnelluz","CreatedById":137402,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T22:24:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehi \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst thank\u0027s everybody for the work to make compatible the mod interstellar whit .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei have a problem (huston we have a problem...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei install kerbal.90 whit only 2 mod interstellar (whit the patch from freethinker) and B9 for make spaceplane whit cargobay (like draco in scott manley\u0027s videos)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT the energy mechanical dont want to work\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Efirst the fusion reactor 2.5 m should develop about 6GW of elettric power whit the eletrical generator 2.5 but none of it.......why??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eat first i think the matter was the energy kicker request by fusion (for mantein the laser 45MW) and i put another reactor (kiwi) and another elettric generator but the electric power of kiwi ther isn\u0027t .Nothing work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the try i make a simple ship for testing the fusion reactor whit tank of deuterium and tritium and whit radiator. all is at the maximum of development (in the sandbox..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ehelp me what\u0027s the matter? why i can\u0027t develop about 6GW ??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei think is a bug in the mod...how i make log file for your help?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethank\u0027s and excuse for my english!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/v5ahmiV\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/v5ahmiV.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022v5ahmiV.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Atrius129","CreatedById":107132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-04T23:15:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tnelluz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tnelluz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ehi \u003Cp\u003Efirst thank\u0027s everybody for the work to make compatible the mod interstellar whit .90\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei have a problem (huston we have a problem...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei install kerbal.90 whit only 2 mod interstellar (whit the patch from freethinker) and B9 for make spaceplane whit cargobay (like draco in scott manley\u0027s videos)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBUT the energy mechanical dont want to work -Snip-\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHi tnelluz, welcome to the forums.

This is actually a GOOD thing, as it reduces your reactor fuel-consumption when it is not actively in use. In order to get the reactor to produce its full rated thermal power, you need to include some kind of draw on the reactor- such as running a Thermal Rocket Nozzle or a Plasma Thruster... Then the reactor will automatically dial itself up to meet the new power demand, with a maximum possible thermal power production of the rated capacity of the reactor. Keep in mind that if trying to produce electricity, you will NOT produce the reactor\u0027s rating for heat-production in electricity: generators in KSP-Interstellar (like in real life) actually lose the MAJORITY of the thermal power passed through them, and only manage to convert about 20-40% into electricity...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, \u003Cstrong\u003EFreeThinker\u003C/strong\u003E, I hope I didn\u0027t overwhelm you with all the math before.

When dialed up to higher mass flow rates (which KSP indirectly records for all engines through \u0022Fuel Flow\u0022- multiply this by fuel resource-density and you have the Mass Flow Rate...) the Exhaust Pressure increases (the simplest way to reflect this relationship would be linearly for now...) and the effect of atmospheric pressure decreases...

The simplified formula is:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThrust = (Vacuum ISP) * (9.80665) * (Mass Flow Rate) - (Exit Area) * (Background Pressure)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EVacuum ISP, Mass Flow Rate [equals: (Fuel Flow in Liters) * (Mass per Liter of Fuel)], and Background Pressure are all easily-accessible in KSP. The Exit Area is a result of the thruster-geometry for any given engine, and is simply the size of the exhaust opening for electric thrusters... (which don\u0027t normally have rocket nozzles to increase Exit Area)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to calculate the Exit Area for the KSP-I electric thrusters would be simply to hold up a Procedural Parts fuel tank of a known radius, and try to approximate the radius of the exhaust-opening for the electric thrusters currently in-game...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotice this formula leads to the following effects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engines with high Vacuum ISP, but low Thrust, suffer comparatively-large losses of thrust at sea-level due to their very poor Mass Flow Rate. This matches the behavior of electric thrusters at low power-levels in the real world well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engines with high Mass Flow, and comparatively small Exit Area (such as a launch-stage chemical rocket engine) suffer a comparatively small loss of thrust at sea-level. This matches the behavior of first-stage chemical engines in the real world well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engines with medium Mass Flow, and comparatively large Exit Area (such as an upper-stage chemical rocket engine) suffer intermediate loss of thrust at sea-level as a fraction of their vacuum thrust. This matches the behavior of upper-stage engines in the real world well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Cutting the Mass Flow Rate, without reducing the Exit Area, results in a proportionally-larger loss of Thrust (and thus a lower sea-level ISP). This matches the behavior observed when throttling-down a rocket engine in-atmosphere in the real world well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Engines with HIGH Mass Flow Rates *AND* Specific Impulse suffer *VERY* little thrust-loss in-atmosphere, even at higher Background Pressures. This matches the predicted behavior of a high-powered electric thruster in-atmosphere well...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESome other thoughts:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- A Microwave Thermal Rocket, in real life (and in KSP) is normally capable of maximum Mass Flow Rates that match or exceed a comparable-sized chemical rocket engine, while having more than twice the Specific Impulse. Thus, with enough Microwave Beamed Power, a Microwave Thermal Rocket should make a *SUPERIOR* launch-vehicle to a comparable-sized chemical rocket, as it is less vulnerable to atmospheric-compression of its exhaust stream (as the Exhaust Pressure is actually higher at comparable Mass Flow Rates due to the higher Specific Impulse...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All this reading up on the relationship between Exhaust Pressure, Background (\u0022Ambient\u0022) Pressure, net Thrust, and Exhaust Velocity also led me to another interesting relationship... Real life rocket nozzles exist in order to expand the flow of gasses leaving the combustion chamber of the rocket, and thus increase Exhaust Velocity at the expense of Exhaust Pressure and Exhaust Temperature...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Microwave Thermal Rockets in KSP-Interstellar all have Specific Impulse values that assume a linear flow of exhaust without expansion or compression. However, if you slapped a typical rocket-nozzle like one used on chemical rockets (one that expanded the flow of exhaust gasses from the exit of the heat-exchanger) on the bottom of a Microwave Thermal Rocket, you could increase the Exhaust Velocity (and Specific Impulse) at the expense of Exhaust Pressure (and Thrust).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus, by simple mechanical manipulation of the exhaust stream, you can optimize a Microwave Thruster for Thrust and sea-level performance, or Specific Impulse and vacuum performance. The only difference is the nozzle shape/size and mass, yet you can get drastically different performance values by simply changing the nozzle...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince a Microwave Thermal Thruster is capable of Mass Flow Rates comparable to a similarly-sized chemical rocket engine with more than twice the Specific Impulse when using H2, and at a *significantly* lower Exhaust Temperature (the high ISP is due to the very low Molecular Mass of H2, *NOT* high Exhaust Temperatures...), there is a LOT of room for manipulation of the exhaust-stream to improve Specific Impulse.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn expanding nozzle could be used to improve the Specific Impulse further at the expense of Thrust- for instance once could theoretically increase the Specific Impulse 41.42% and cut the Thrust in half to achieve an identical Thrust (before the effects of reduced Exhaust Temperature- which would cause Thrust to drop even further...) to a chemical rocket engine of comparable size for a lower engine mass and a whopping Specific Impulse of over 1200 seconds! (assuming a starting ISP of 850 s for Hydrogen and a starting Thrust twice that of a similar-sized chemical rocket: both of which can be achieved with current technology...) Such drastic increases in Exhaust Velocity are not possible with a Hydrolox chemical rocket because the Exhaust Temperature would drop below the boiling point of Water (the primary exhaust constituent) with such a drastic expansion of the exhaust stream... (this would also dramatically increase the vulnerability to atmospheric-compression at low altitude) But the boiling-point of hydrogen is *MUCH* lower, and thus a pure-H2 thermal rocket can safely expand its exhaust stream to a *MUCH* greater degree than a LH2/LOX chemical rocket...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBottom Line: I have provided a formula above that relates Mass Flow, Specific Impulse, and the effects of Ambient Pressure on rocket Thrust. There is also room for the inclusion of exhaust nozzles specifically geared towards vacuum or sea-level performance with the Thermal Rocket Nozzles... (It might be worth creating alternate versions of the Thermal Rocket Nozzle part that has a nozzle size-shape is optimized for vacuum operation, as the current exhaust nozzle is optimized for sea-level performance.)\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Atmosphere Curve of the current Thermal Rocket Nozzle also needs to be *COMPLETELY* thrown out: it does NOT accurately reflect that whereas a fission nuclear-thermal rocket might be operating at very low Mass Flow Rates and thus operate poorly inside the atmosphere, a Microwave Thermal Rocket using the same Thermal Rocket Nozzle part may have as much as TWICE the Exhaust Pressure of a comparably-sized chemical rocket due to the very high Mass Flow Rate, and thus actually have *REDUCED* vulnerability to atmospheric compression vs. a chemical rocket... (the current Atmosphere Curve for KSP-I Thermal Rocket Nozzles means that they *ALL* have VERY HIGH vulnerability to atmospheric-compression, with seal-level ISP only 40% that of vacuum ISP, despite the fact that *AT SUFFICIENTLY HIGH MASS-FLOW RATES* a Thermal Rocket can *EXCEED* the sea-level ISP of a chemical rocket by a very large margin, and easily achieve more than 80% the sea-level ISP compared to vacuum ISP...\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERegards,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENorthstar\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-05T02:09:02Z\u0022 title=\u002202/05/2015 02:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Northstar1989\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-05T09:20:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Northstar1989\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpeaking of which, you *REALLY* need to create ModuleManager patches for RealFuels and Procedural Parts so that players can generate Liquid Nitrogen (and soon Liquid CO2 or a re-balanced CO2 using liquid densities) tanks in these mods. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould someone please create these Module manager files, I realy don\u0027t have the time.

The Exit Area is just pi-r^2 = 9-pi (9 * 3.14159) for the opening, plus the surface area of the partial cone- which comes out to the surface area of a trapezoid with a top side of 6-pi meters (the circumference of the exhaust opening) and a bottom side of 7-pi meters (the circumference of the bottom of the nozzle), and a height of 0.707 meters (so 6.5-pi * 0.5).
