It hit us at a shallow angle so it scooped up a lot of our mantle and put it into orbit. There it formed a saturn style ring that merged into our moon after a few million years. That\u0027s why the rocks that Apollo brought back had pretty much the same chemical makeup as the rocks we find on earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter the moon got made it was really close to earth. it must\u0027ve been pretty impressive, with the moon looking huge and volcanoes erupting as it rises (due to tidal effects). But the earth rotated faster than the moon orbited, back in those days a day only lasted about 10 hours. So over time tidal effects slowed down the rotation of the earth while boosting the orbit of the moon. So over time the moon has slowly drifted away from us. It\u0027s still moving away at a rate of about 4 cm a year and slowing the earth\u0027s day accordingly.

A passing object is captured into orbit via gas drag from the pro to-Jupiter nebula, and then the remainder of the nebula gets blown away as the Sun \u0022turns on\u0022. The result is that extremely distance moons are often as much prograde as retrograde.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe inner gas giant moons (Io, Europa, Titan, Dione, etc.) likely formed in situ via accretion in mini-nebulas that a gas giant planet could form.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can have moons captured via likely traumatic three-body interactions (up to and including lithobraking with a pre-existing moon).

Triton did completely wreck Neptune\u0027s pre-capture moon system, and you are right. Even without such disruption, moon systems can be a mess. Look at Uranus(don\u0027t joke)! Most of its moons will collide with each other and most of the irregular inner moons are spiraling inwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, there is another way small moons can form: Collisional disruption of a parent body. There is a reason there are moon families. This does not apply frequently to large moons, but most retrograde moons orbiting the gas giants may be the result of collisional disruption.
