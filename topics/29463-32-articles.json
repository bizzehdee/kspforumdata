Having successfully drained the Mun of enough science to obtain all of the scientific instruments, I wanted to use the same approach on Minmus as on the Munar mission. The expedition would require four launches. The first was the core module consisting of the lab, crew quarters and a docking hub, the second a fuel ship to allow multiple landings, and the third was the crew transfer vehicle that would take the crew to Minmus and return them safely to Kerbin at the conclusion of the mission. These first three launches were combined in Minmus orbit to form the lab facility. The fourth launch was the lander, which wound up making nine return trips between the orbiting lab and the surface. On each trip, the lander would gather science from a biome and then return to orbit to transfer the science to the CTV, refuel the lander, and clean out the Science Jr. and Goo containers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe crew consisted of five Kerbals: Jeb and Bill performed the landings, with Jeb acting as the lander pilot and Bill as the science officer. Jendan and Tomzer ran the orbital lab facility, while Bob was pilot for the crew transfer vehicle. With not much to do between the outbound and inbound trips, Bob also did most of the cooking and put on occasional puppet shows to entertain the others.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all the, the mission went off absolutely flawlessly, and by the time Jeb and Bill had returned from their ninth and final landing near the northern pole, the science crew had processed and uploaded 73 experiments to the data banks in the CTV\u0027s capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the return trip to Kerbin, a miscalculation for the required fuel load meant that there would be no circularizing the orbit and then landing precisely back at KSC. Rather, the aerobraking maneuver turned directly in to the landing, meaning the landing point was pretty much chosen at random. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief as the three parachutes deployed at 5 km to signal the final phase of the landing, followed by the full deploy at 500m. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was then that it occurred to Jeb that the lander was about to land in water, and that the lander consisted of simply a three man capsule (occupied only by Bob on the return trip), a Hitchhiker Storage Container for the other four crew, and four lander legs. In a water landing, the legs would be useless, and the HSC did not have the structural rigidity to withstand a water landing at 8 m/s - the legs were meant to absorb the shock. With seconds to spare, Jeb and Bill scrambled up the ladder to the safety of the capsule, but after weeks in space, Jendan and Tomzer were killed instantly as the HSC was crushed on impact.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s some images:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://bazinga.smugmug.com/photos/i-8JTXDTD/0/M/i-8JTXDTD-M.png\u0022 alt=\u0022i-8JTXDTD-M.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch of the core module.
