I think I have a pretty good handle on what I\u0027m doing, but it does leave me some questions about what the community considers to be best practices:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Polygon/Triangle count in the visual model, and the collision mesh. The parts I\u0027m making are not ridiculously complex, but sometimes a really smooth curvature looks great and makes me want to use more vertices. I\u0027m aiming to stick to the standard 24-vertex circles for things like fuel tanks. As an example, I made a \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-08-27%2022-08-55-54.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Esmall radial fuel tank\u003C/a\u003E (similar to the longer radial monopropellant tank in stock), and it ended up with something like 1072 tris in the model, and about 164 or so in the collision mesh (I spent a bit of time simplifying the collision mesh as best I could). The visible curvature is gorgeous, so I\u0027ve left it that way for now, figuring we\u0027re not taxing most people\u0027s GPUs to the degree we\u0027re hitting the CPU. But most of my other models have stayed simpler, and most of my collision meshes are just a cylinder or truncated cone that matches the exterior of the model. Do any of you use a rule of thumb for how many polygons is acceptable? I\u0027m assuming more complex collision meshes can impact physics performance? \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEDIT:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E I see the tutorial thread says 255 as a limit in collision mesh. I\u0027m under that in everything I\u0027ve made so far.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Collision mesh alignment. The stock fuel tanks clearly have the model oriented to place edges in the N/E/W/S cardinal directions, but what do they do with the collision mesh? I saw in another thread, someone commenting that it\u0027s preferable to have the faces on those sides, rather than edges. In a typical 24-face cylinder, would you aim the model\u0027s edges in those directions (to match stock), but turn the collision mesh to put the faces on those sides? \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEDIT:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E I found it mentioned elsewhere that the stock collision meshes for fuel tanks and the like are 12-sided. Experimentally I confirmed this, and confirmed that they are rotated relative to the model so that the faces, not the edges, are aligned to the cardinal map directions.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Models with negative space. If your model has some visible space inside it, are you bothering to use multiple collision meshes, or any other trickery to simulate concave spaces? I\u0027ve just been making the collision meshes conform to the exterior, and so if there\u0027s an opening somewhere, it\u0027s treated in the editor as a solid surface. An example is this wide-open \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-08-29%2018-56-42-70.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Einterstage adapter\u003C/a\u003E, where right now the collision mesh is a truncated cone that matches the exterior edges on the sides. It fills in the top and bottom accordingly, and also does not include a cylinder for that upper cylindrical section. Just wondering what\u0027s best here. \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEDIT:\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E Yeah, I see in other threads people are using multiple colliders. Just not sure what\u0027s best for a somewhat empty cone, for example.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd one not related to \u0022best practices\u0022:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. I\u0027m looking at the small Z-100 radial battery, and it\u0027s glowing LED on top. How do you do that in the texture? I opened up the MBM, and all I can see that doesn\u0027t conform to the rest of the battery pack is a large splotchy white area. No alpha channel or anything. I\u0027d love to have some lit-up features. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Is this something I need to do in Unity rather than in Blender before importing?

The reason for this is that with my whopping 2 gigs of RAM, KSP seldom crashes or lags on me.

Yo get it, you need to create as much as colliders as needed but here, complexity REALLY MATTERS, as 3-6 colliders for one part is ok (but may not be so ok if this parts is used multiple time like seen with the stock Claw issue not so long ago with 8 of them at the same time). I tried 16 colliders on one part...
