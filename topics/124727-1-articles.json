What I\u0027d like to be able to do is take a rocket fuel tank and, either when one resource is drained or after dumping it, reassign the volume for one fuel to bolster the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChiefly this would be useful for launching a tank as a conventional rocket stage and then reassigning it to fuel an LV-N.
