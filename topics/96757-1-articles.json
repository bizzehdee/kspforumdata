However, from what I understand MRO won\u0027t be able to transmit the descent data back to Earth immediately, so the MarCO cubesats\u0027 purpose still stands. Also, what shocks me is that even after this burn and two even larger ones planned for 09/2016 and 04/2017 which will re-establish its original orbit (lasting \u0026gt;3 minutes each!), MRO will still have 187 kg of hydrazine -- \u003Cstrong\u003E19 years of fuel!\u003C/strong\u003E I find this mindblowing.
