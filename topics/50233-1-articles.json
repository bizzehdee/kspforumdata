Also, I\u0027ll have to sign up for imgur or some other image hosting site because we can\u0027t upload pictures directly, right? (I\u0027ve been lurking for a long time and I think someone mentioned this once)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnywho, here\u0027s how my tank dropping design works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design is for an interplanetary transfer stage with very low T/W (for reference).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the payload at the top of the stack. This is the item that I want to push out into deep space. In my case, it is a 60ton reusable lander for use at Laythe and it launches with the transfer stage (I\u0027m into big MEGA launchers - my transfer stage doesn\u0027t get itself into orbit with the payload, it is placed there by a massive rocket and then goes on to Laythe with the payload attached already as they launched together). Docking with your payload in orbit (so you don\u0027t have to have a massive rocket to launch them together) will work as well so long as you place the clampotron at the top of your transfer stage (you don\u0027t want your payload docked at the bottom of this stack where it will be dumped mid-flight).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe transfer stage itself has 3 orange fuel tanks, 8 NERVAs and support gear. I will start at the top tank. The top tank has a decoupler on it to seperate from the payload and a remote control unit under that because I want to be able to use this stage (which is the final stage in the stack) as a communications hub when it arrives at Laythe and dumps off it\u0027s cargo. No need to waste the infrastructure of a usable (if empty) tank if you\u0027ve bothered to take it all the way there! I also attached solar panels and a battery, as well as 2 large RCS tanks and some RCS thruster units to this tank to provide attitude control and to keep it \u0027alive\u0027 after the lander has seperated and taken it\u0027s power and RCS systems with it. Towards the bottom of this tank, I place 8 cubic octogonal struts with radial symmetry onto the side. Then I take 8 more cubic struts and place them over the other struts but making sure that they are facing \u0027down\u0027 so that things can be attached to the bottom. Then, on these \u0027downward\u0027 facing cubic struts, I place 8 NERVA engines with symmetry. They will overlap a bit and are a bit tricky to attach, but they will stick on their eventually. You do NOT need to turn on part clipping to do this even though they overlap a smidge.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the bottom of this tank, I place a single clampotron docking port. This is so that on the occassion that I have a really efficient burn and have some fuel left over, I can dock later craft back to this tank in Laythe orbit and get at that sweet, sweet rocketsauce. Because I am placing a payload and decoupler on top so that I can launch the payload with the transfer stage, you can NOT place a clampotron on the top. The problem is that when you decouple this tank from the payload, the decoupler will stay attache to it, blocking the clampotron. So you have to put the clampotron on the bottom if you want to ever dock with this thing after seperation. You probably won\u0027t care about docking with an nearly empty tank, I do it as a Just-In-Case measure. I *think* there are decouplers that will detach from both parts that are being seperated but I\u0027m not sure. Anywho, under the clampotron, I attach a large decoupler, then strut that decoupler to the tank so it is firmly attached. Then, under this decoupler, I attach a second orange fuel tank. On this tank, I place a single cubic octogonal sturt to the side near the top. Then on the tank above it, I also place a cubic octogonal strut in line with the one on the other tank, attaching them as close close together as practical. Then I run a fuel line from the bottom octogonal strut to the top one. This will allow the bottom tank to feed the top one so that when it is empty, I can jetison it with the decoupler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I repeat the proceedure by placing a decoupler on the second tank (no need for a clampotron, this tank will be jetisoned mid-route and will be empty) and then attach a 3rd orange fuel tank to that. I place cubic octogonal struts on the bottom of the 2nd tank and the top of the 3rd tank and then connect them with a fuel line going from the 3rd tank to the 2nd one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you have to make sure you get the staging right: Your 8 NERVA\u0027s, being in the top tank, will automatically be set up to not activate until the other tanks are jetisoned. Move them down the staging list so that they fire when the entire interplanetary cruise stage seperates from your booster. DO NOT place any of the decouplers in the same stage with them. Now, when you pop off of your launch vehicle, the NERVA\u0027s will be pulling your entire cruise stage tractor-style. Place your 3rd tank decoupler on the stage above the NERVA\u0027s and your 2nd tank decoupler on the stage above that. This way, when your bottom tank empties, you can hit space bar and dump it. Doing this will not do anything to your NERVAs - they will keep firing as they are not attached to the stages being dumped (remember they are on the very first tank in the stack) and they don\u0027t have any decouplers of their own. Then, when your second tank is empty, hit space bar again and it too will be dumped. This set-up can take a 50-60ton payload all the way to Laythe with good piloting without ever touching the fuel load of your payload. You should even have some fuel left over - though you have to aerobrake at Laythe to get captured into orbit as you will not have enough fuel to do a powered orbital capture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENotes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe fuel lines will not automatically drain the bottom tanks for some reason. You have to alt\u002Bright click on the tanks and manually drain the fuel out as you go. If you are burning and you begin a fuel transfer, then the fuel will continue to be drained out of the bottom tank until you either close the fuel management window or the tank empties.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NERVAs will provide 0 attitude control until either the 3rd or 2nd tank is dropped (I\u0027m not sure why to be honest but I think it is because the vectored exhaust is hitting the fuel tanks below the engine and being deflected). You will thus have to use RCS fuel to steer until those tanks are out of the way and then the NERVAs will provide effective thrust vectoring.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe NERVAs will not overheat at full throttle. I think the tanks they are attached to absorb some heat or something. In any case, I observed that while the \u0027overheat\u0027 warning came on, it stopped climbing about a fifth of the way to maximum and held steady even through a 20 minute burn. Go figure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe advantages of this system:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*You get to take full advantage of staging without having to haul around engines for each stage. In effect, this is kind of a pancake/asparagus staging hybrid as you are pulling fuel from tanks that you then drop to cut down on deadweight while not having to carry engines for each stage as you do in both asparagus and pancake staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*It is much easier to integrate an in-line staging system like this with a launch vehicle than it is to integrate a wide, radially-attached asparagus stage. As this is intended for an interplanetary cruise stage and is itself a payload on a launcher instead of a launcher in it\u0027s own right, it needs to be \u0027fit\u0027 within a launch vehicle - which is hard to do when you have lots of radial tanks hanging off the side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*More efficient that standard asparagus staging - this allows you to drop off one tank at a time while still transfering fuel to later stages instead of having to drop off pairs as is the case with asparagus staging. This is more efficient as you drop deadweight sooner than you would with asparagus staging. You also only have to have one set of engines to power all the stages instead of seperate engines for each stage as is the typical set up for asparagus staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*You can avoid the problem of being top-heavy that you might otherwise have with attached radial stages. Your center of mass will be roughly in the center of the stack rather than up at the top (or at the bottom if you radially attach there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Easier to ditch RCS thrusters when you don\u0027t need them - you can see where your center of mass is for each stage as you build it and place RCS thrusters accordingly. Then, as each stage drops, any RCS thrusters attached to it get dumped as well and since you are now much lighter and compact, you don\u0027t need them anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDisadvantages:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*The lack of powered steering from the engine gimbals is definitely a headache and you need lots of RCS gas to overcome this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*A long, skinny rocket can be hard to turn without lots of RCS gas and thrusters. Consider adding in-line reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*You have to manually drain lower tanks in flight. I have no idea why the fuel lines don\u0027t work the way they are supposed to in this setup. The engines will pull fuel out of the tank they are attached too and not the lower ones until you manually drain them to fill the top tank. Maybe if you connect a fuel line from the second tank to each engine (instead of attaching a single fuel line to the top tank) it will work. I haven\u0027t tried this, so I don\u0027t know. However, even if you do do this you will now have the added mass of 7 additional cubic struts and fuel lines. It\u0027s not much, but every bit counts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Kerbal Engineer definitely \u003Cstrong\u003Ecannot \u003C/strong\u003Ecorrectly calculate your deltaV with this setup. However, I suspsect this is because the fuel lines will not automatically drain the tanks rather than a problem with KE itself. Like I said, to get around this, build the stack first without decouplers and fuel lines and stick the engines at the bottom. KE will now tell you how much deltaV this unoptimized stack will get. Now go and add all of your decouplers and fuel lines and just keep in mind that your total deltaV will be somewhat higher than what KE told you before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings to investigate:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*I did not have any \u0027reverse steering control\u0027 issues with this rocket. I\u0027ve heard that when you attach engines to the top of a rocket instead of the top, that the control inputs will be reversed so long as the Center of Mass is below the engines. I didn\u0027t have this issue - in fact, I had no steering capability at all from the engines because they were blocked by lower stages (they are very close to the tanks, nearly clipping). However, the RCS system worked fine and didn\u0027t suffer from reverse steering. By the time the 2nd tank was dropped, the blockage of the engines was gone and now the CoM had shifted above the engines so I never had reverse control issues but I can\u0027t prove these were the reasons why I didn\u0027t have reverse-steering problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*This design *should* work with big launch vehicles and not just interplanetary stages, though you\u0027ll have to use much more powerful engines. It is worth investigating in any case.
