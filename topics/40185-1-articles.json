That worked for me. Unfortunately Kerbal Started acting weird after a few flights. I went to the space plane hanger and when I went to take off my gimbal was rotated 90 degrees to the side. So the orange was on the right and the blue on the left. I cannot figure it out. Now when I activate the space plane guidance my plane flys on its side. All the controls are swapped around to match.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only that, but after I try to fly like that and then go back to the main area where you can click the buildings, none of them get highlighted by the cursor and I cannot select any of the buildings except the \u0022training academy.\u0022 What I am doing now is re-installing Kerbal to see if that fixes it. I am using a MAC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I\u0027ll post a link to the space plane I uploaded on spaceport. Its a really interesting design that can fly a pilot into space and meet up with a space station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
