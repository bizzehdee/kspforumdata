The Retrieve Vessel and Return To Space Center buttons in flight visibly click but do nothing, and if I alt-F4 to close the game, then reload the save, none of the space center buildings react to the mouse pointer in any way, and the return to menu arrow is unclickable. If I start a new career, it works normally until the same thing happens again. The only common thing between the three times this has happened (which is likely a coincidence) is that in all cases Jeb Kerbal had recently been killed in an accident (I play with reversion disabled).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am running Windows 7 x64, and have the Steam version of KSP (which I believe to be the 32bit version).
