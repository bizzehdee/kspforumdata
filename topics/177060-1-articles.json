The NAR and TRA seem to be against non-certified motors, solid and hybrid. The advantage of using an NAR or TRA certified\u00A0motor seems to be that you don\u0027t need any permits to buy, sell, or transport them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I can\u0027t find any concrete information on whether or not it is legal to make \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0non-certified motors without various explosives permits (Low permit, Manufacturers permit, etc). Which means that something will most likely say no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, making my own solid fuel grains is probably out. Maybe even Rocket Candy, I can\u0027t even find a concrete source for that (although I was not planning on making R-Candy). That leaves 2 options, the first being liquid engines. I actually haven\u0027t found much against the legality of liquids, but I\u0027m not stupid/smart enough to go out and build my own bipropellant engine (although I have designed a few very simple ones). That left trying a monopropellant \u0022engine\u0022 (read: tiny thruster), and I\u0027ve already gone down that rabbit hole, IIRC it\u0027s legal but hard, as the two easiest monopropellants to get are N2O and H2O2. N20 is a gas at room temperature, and gases aren\u0027t generally good rocket propellants, getting it liquid would be difficult. H2O2, you can\u0027t buy it above a certain concentration and its incredibly dangerous to purify by yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, liquids are out, for a different reason than solids. That leaves hybrids, but you can\u0027t make your own fuel, so you\u0027d need to use something else as fuel. Something commonly available... Like a plastic. Specifically, I\u0027m looking at ABS and Acrylic. With ABS I could 3D print fuel grains, and it\u0027s relatively easy to get a large acrylic rod and drill a hole through it. The problem at this point becomes the exhaust gases, ABS products are carcinogenic, not good, and I wasn\u0027t able to find anything about Acrylic products, besides the fact that you should use ventilation of you are engraving or laser-cutting it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it might not be a concern if I\u0027m testing it from a safe distance, let it air out, and properly dispose of the acrylic later on (and test in a location not near anything people will eat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, my point is, does anyone see any legal problem or long-term health problem with doing something like this, a hybrid motor using acrylic and gaseous oxygen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aeq7zeeayIo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^^^Like this but way smaller initially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s worth saying that I only intend to do static fire tests, and maybe thrust measurements, not actual flights (I\u0027d need a lot of certification to do that, and that\u0027s just not possible to do, especially being a non-adult).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"K^2","CreatedById":57710,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-07-26T07:28:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not a lawyer, but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAFAIK, there are no federal laws explicitly regulating rocketry. There is, however NFPA 1127, which defines high-power rocketry and it is going to be the basis for governing law in many jurisdictions, as well as be the guideline for many fire marshals who might cite you for violating fire safety. Hence, NAR and TRA certification for HPR that do comply with NFPA 1127.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou also have to be mindful of airspace. Federal regulations require you to clear significant launches with FAA. Well, any potential hazards to air traffic. FAA, however, tend to be pretty friendly about it, so long as you launch in a low population area with no significant air traffic. Generally, they\u0027ll just issue a NOTAM for your launch window, and pilots will steer clear of the area.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there is the matter of propellant for your rocket. Almost anything you\u0027ll be using is some kind of regulated. Either as a fire hazard, material for explosives, or in drug manufacturing. Almost none of it is strictly illegal, but it might require certification, and will probably land you on some watch lists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, local laws vary.

Especially during the dry season. So keep in mind that just because it isn\u0027t against the law, that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s safe, and that you would be the only one affected by any mistakes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, clearing the area of anything flammable, possibly putting down gravel if your test stand is on dirt, and keeping a fire extinguisher, hose, and cell phone nearby should be safe in most places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA couple of other notes on your personal safety, from what I know (which isn\u0027t a lot):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst of all, use non-frangible materials for any pressure holding parts.

Don\u0027t ever\u00A0have a direct line of sight to it, put metal shields between it and anything that you don\u0027t want to be hit by pieces of rocket motor (buildings, fuel or oxidizer tanks, but most importantly, anywhere people might be). In addition to shields, you probably want to be in a \u0022blockhouse\u0022 made out of dirt or something simple\u00A0while firing.

The NAR and TRA seem to be against non-certified motors, solid and hybrid. The advantage of using an NAR or TRA certified\u00A0motor seems to be that you don\u0027t need any permits to buy, sell, or transport them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I can\u0027t find any concrete information on whether or not it is legal to make \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0non-certified motors without various explosives permits (Low permit, Manufacturers permit, etc). Which means that something will most likely say no.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, making my own solid fuel grains is probably out. Maybe even Rocket Candy, I can\u0027t even find a concrete source for that (although I was not planning on making R-Candy). That leaves 2 options, the first being liquid engines. I actually haven\u0027t found much against the legality of liquids, but I\u0027m not stupid/smart enough to go out and build my own bipropellant engine (although I have designed a few very simple ones). That left trying a monopropellant \u0022engine\u0022 (read: tiny thruster), and I\u0027ve already gone down that rabbit hole, IIRC it\u0027s legal but hard, as the two easiest monopropellants to get are N2O and H2O2. N20 is a gas at room temperature, and gases aren\u0027t generally good rocket propellants, getting it liquid would be difficult. H2O2, you can\u0027t buy it above a certain concentration and its incredibly dangerous to purify by yourself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, liquids are out, for a different reason than solids. That leaves hybrids, but you can\u0027t make your own fuel, so you\u0027d need to use something else as fuel. Something commonly available... Like a plastic. Specifically, I\u0027m looking at ABS and Acrylic. With ABS I could 3D print fuel grains, and it\u0027s relatively easy to get a large acrylic rod and drill a hole through it. The problem at this point becomes the exhaust gases, ABS products are carcinogenic, not good, and I wasn\u0027t able to find anything about Acrylic products, besides the fact that you should use ventilation of you are engraving or laser-cutting it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut it might not be a concern if I\u0027m testing it from a safe distance, let it air out, and properly dispose of the acrylic later on (and test in a location not near anything people will eat).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo basically, my point is, does anyone see any legal problem or long-term health problem with doing something like this, a hybrid motor using acrylic and gaseous oxygen?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u003Ciframe allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aeq7zeeayIo?feature=oembed\u0022 width=\u0022480\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n^^^Like this but way smaller initially.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s worth saying that I only intend to do static fire tests, and maybe thrust measurements, not actual flights (I\u0027d need a lot of certification to do that, and that\u0027s just not possible to do, especially being a non-adult).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot legal advise:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think you just need an FAA permit also I\u0027m think of making my own liquid rocket too.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeiss Ikon","CreatedById":174016,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-12T22:18:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf the test isn\u0027t on the grounds of an airport, and the engine never leaves the ground (as with the static test in the video) FAA won\u0027t have a word to say about it.\u00A0 As long as you don\u0027t illegally store \u0022explosives,\u0022 produce something that\u0027s illegal to possess, or create a hazard to life or property (don\u0027t do this in a rural area during high fire risk), there shouldn\u0027t be any legal repercussions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat said, it wouldn\u0027t be at all a bad idea to notify your neighbors that you\u0027re testing \u003Cem\u003Esafe and legal\u003C/em\u003E rocket motors, just so they don\u0027t call the emergency responders when they hear the test.\u00A0 This kind of rocket can produce a very distinctive sound, as the chamber pressure produces oxidizer flow rate changes, leading to thrust oscillation that sounds very much like a pulse jet.\u00A0 This happens with liquid oxidizer, when the chamber pressure exceeds approximately 50% of the pressure available at the injector (which will always be less than tank pressure, due to throttling losses).\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
