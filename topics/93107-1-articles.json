In my vision of .91:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe big new feature is a major overhaul to the tutorials and suchlike. We saw a little of this in .90 with the info popup windows but it was still very spartan. Now, Tutorial Mode will walk the player through building a basic rocket, making their first orbit, and then transferring to the Mun and Duna. The Tutorials don\u0027t take the player all the way though; there are only a few light pointers when it comes to actually touching down on another world.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EFor Science and Career mode, there have been lots of tweaks to game balance. The tech tree has been completely redone, and the contracts, strategies, and science experiments all gone over too to make a well balanced game. In hard mode part costs and contract rewards now vary depending on the state of your space program, so you will have to work to balance the books from your first launch to the very end.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe new landing gears and the 2.5 m jet engines will really make things nice for plane flyers. \u003C/em\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cem\u003ESpace\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/em\u003Eplane flyers, on the other hand, will find the significant nerf to the jet engines gives a new challenge.

You can push physics warp as high as your computer can manage without losing accuracy, great for those long burns, and there\u0027s control damping so the ship isn\u0027t so twitchy when you do it.
