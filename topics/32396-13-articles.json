For example, if you dont have launch clamps, a small 6ton vehicle with 6 monster wheels has every wheel pop instantly.

For example, if you dont have launch clamps, a small 6ton vehicle with 6 monster wheels has every wheel pop instantly. Unfortunately it also breaks the launchpad I\u0027m using too sometimes (I\u0027m using the hooligan labs launchpad parts, they would be a great addition to your core mod.).\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas how to get around this? I remember in OC if you spawned something on a planet it would \u0027float\u0027 down until it touched the ground and then have normal physics applied. You could try doing the same for your mod, just have it spawn like 1 m above the launchpad coordinates and float down. Then it still looks good and less explosions!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeen having a good time with the mod, I just can\u0027t get a base running though with consistent spawn issues. Looking forward to mining some ore. Thanks for your work on the mod - so much great potential!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAre you using the v2 release or the (earlier) v2 alpha?

This is also happening with the pad at KSC. Easy way to avoid issue is use launch clamps.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Krisism","CreatedById":71149,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T14:44:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m using the most recent version, with my own parts made from the previous release by EvilC (not sure, perhaps the dev build in question).

I\u0027ve actually only tested this off world in low-g environments (mun/minimus). The issue with launchclamps is they each become a separate craft after and you have to end flight for each of them (kind of a pain) - not to mention if you aren\u0027t using a lander sometimes its tough to actually clear the clamps and get off the pad (unless you can somehow clamp to the top).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you help me understand how EL spawns a craft after you select your ship and click \u0027build.\u0027 I want to get this figured out quite badly and hope there is some way I can help.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks again for the mod!
