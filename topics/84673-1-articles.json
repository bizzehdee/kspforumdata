I tought it was parts overload, so I uninstalled them and I installed them mods in packages, however the lag returned. I have installed no parts mod or such, and yet my ksp is running at 20fps... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any way to, trough logs, track what individual mod is causing so much lag? i am right now going trough the slow and tedious process of deleting one and trying again...

Check to see if the log (alt-f2 or alt-f12) is spewing some kind of error.
