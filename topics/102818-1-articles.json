The latest Intel drivers for the Aspire 4720Z on the Acer website (at least the European section) are v7.14.10.1409, however you\u0027re using v7.14.10.1436. The latest drivers for the 965 Express family of GPUs for Vista 32 bit on Intel\u0027s website are v15.12.4.1666, and should be [available here](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81508/Mobile-Intel-965-Express-Chipset-Family).\n\nI\u0027m not sure if this will fix the problem or not, but the last lines of your output log do seem to suggest something very wrong going on with the GPU. I\u0027d also suggest turning any detail level options in the game right down, as the 965 Express chipset is old, and wasn\u0027t all that much of a \u0022gaming\u0022 chipset when it was new."},{"CreatedByName":"Demon Wolf","CreatedById":140066,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-29T11:43:45Z","Content":"that did it thanks for the help i thot i had 1666 installed but thin i jest put darped a new HD in it so i may not had put 1666 back in"}]}
