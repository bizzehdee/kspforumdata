When using rendezvous autopilot, after it is done setting up closest approach it will start to plan a node for the intercept. While nearing the intercept it makes a node for a burn to correct for 1.0m/s and will try the burn and as soon as it is complete it will keep making a new node to correct over and over instantaneously; It will keep making a new node so quickly that it is like a buggy strobe effect on the navball all while my craft is spinning about out of control trying to keep up until finally I have to cancel autopilot and intercept and match velocity manually. Any ideas on how to fix it?

I checked this all by having my brother walk me through the install on his computer. We have the same versions and performed the same steps side by side. The one thing I found was when i downloaded the file, for some unknown reason I didn\u0027t get the PluginData folder inside of the Plugins folder inside of Mechjebs folder. We did the download at the same time from the same link and he got the file but i didn\u0027t. I copied the file from his computer and brought it into mine, still no fix, parts show up, can be attached, but no functionality. At this point we thought maybe it was my copy of KSP itself so we tried a complete game copy. Copied his entire KSP game file onto thumb drive then brought it to my computer and still same problem. I have had similar issues with the mods: Chatterer, ATM, and every planetary editor I could find. I did not look into these others as closely because Mechjeb is more important to me. I do have the SpaceY Mod and it works perfectly. I am baffled at this point and could use any help at all.

After your post I had an idea and tested it. I found a simple leak that occurred each time your change scene. \u003Cp\u003EMJ was recreating a 300x100 texture each time and in Unity when you do a \u0022new Texture2D()\u0022 they are created in the C\u002B\u002B part of unity and are no freed unless you Destroy(xx) them. Most of MJ code deals with that but one creation had escaped.
