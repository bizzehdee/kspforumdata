I would put this wee guide on the wiki, but the wiki is rather...restrictive. I also couldn\u0027t find any simple guides like this for KSP anywhere after a lot of searching, so here it goes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst off: No complex math. You don\u0027t even need to know how to multiply or divide. The only skill you need is basic addition and subtraction, and an ability to read the data MechJeb gives you (yes, you can fly the thing yourself the entire way, though I can\u0027t imagine why anyone would want to do this eight-or-so times without using at least Smart A.S.S., which is what I use for all my orbital maneuvers for this after the ascent. It will get repetitive the more satellites you put up).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSecond: I say \u003Cstrong\u003Egeo\u003C/strong\u003Estationary because I\u0027m comfortable with it, I\u0027m not interested in arguing semantics, and geo is from the Greek for \u0022earth\u0022 though typically in the sense of \u0022land\u0022 or \u0022ground\u0022, not specifically this planet we meatbags call home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThird: I assume here that the reader has a firm grasp of orbital maneuvers, including phase changes (adjusting the altitude of an orbit), plane/inclination changes, basic ship piloting, and perhaps even a cursory knowledge of what all the lovely buttons do in MechJeb. There are tutorials already for all of this, so I\u0027m not going to cover any of it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally: The goal of this tutorial is not just to describe how to get a payload into geostationary orbit, but how to get it at more-or-less a precise longitude with a minimum of fuss. That is, one burn from a parking orbit to GEO, or close to GEO, with minimal adjustments if the user wishes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 1: Understand What a Geostationary Orbit Is\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and the difference between \u0022geostationary\u0022 and \u0022geosynchronous\u0022. Really, I can\u0027t do a better job here \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethan Wikipedia\u003C/a\u003E, and for the sake of brevity, I won\u0027t go into detail. Short version: a geostationary orbit will keep some orbital body above the same longitude at all times. Put more simply, to an observer on Kerbin, a satellite in geostationary orbit will remain stationary in the sky (well, hopefully, or at least with so little deviation it\u0027s unnoticeable). A practical example: Geostationary satellites are used to provide streaming data to large numbers of clients, such as in the case of satellite TV providers. The simplicity of using a simple receiver that doesn\u0027t need to track the satellite far out-weighs the cost of putting a satellite in GEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, Kerbin\u0027s GEO altitude is 2.870Mm. Get a piece of space junk up at that height, such that its apoapsis and periapsis are both at 2.870Mm, and you have yourself a GEO.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 2: Build a Rocket\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnything that can get your desired payload to an altitude of 2.870Mm above Kerbin will do (that\u0027s Mega-meters, or 2.870 million meters). Test it out with your payload, see if it can get you there in one shot, with fuel and an engine to spare, preferably, for fine-tuning; I have a soft spot for the NERVA for this task. An easy way to do this is to just set MechJeb\u0027s ascent autopilot to 2,870km and let it go. If you get your payload there with fuel to spare, you\u0027re in good shape and have enough delta-v to get your payload there. Note that any rocket that has enough delta-v to escape Kerbin (e.g. Mun or Minmus launch vehicles) will likely have enough delta-v to get to a stable GEO (the circulisation burn could mess with this; I haven\u0027t done any specific math on this point, nor do I plan to).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 3: Launching\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen more than a few mentions of GEO constellations requiring precise launch timing, as one would use for a rendezvous with a spacecraft in low-orbit. This simply isn\u0027t the case. If we consider the case of a direct ascent to GEO, and a similar ascent profile for each launch, each satellite will end-up in roughly the same position because, relative to the rotating surface of, the final point of the ascent hasn\u0027t moved. So, the bottom line? Launch whenever you darn well please, as we need to fix this later anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis first launch is a dry run. We\u0027re out to collect data, and little more, you may even wish to do this in a test save if you\u0027re as OCD as I am about not littering space more than necessary. Launch your vehicle to a low-altitude of your choosing, just write it down. This is where all subsequent launches will be going. I usually go with 200km (eventhough this has the mild downside of being a little slower because of time compression limits...I don\u0027t really mind). Once you are at your parking orbit (you did remember to write that altitude down, right?) and inclination is at 0 (or within a few degrees), open MechJeb\u0027s surface information window. At the very bottom you will see Longitude. This the the key piece of data we\u0027ll be using.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 4: Transfer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWait until your craft is approaching 0 degrees longitude. Then commence a burn to enter a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EHohmann transfer orbit\u003C/a\u003E with apoapsis at 2.870Mm. Warp to the AP, then bring your periapsis up to 2.870Mm as well. If you are using a relatively low-thrust engine (or even a high thrust one; you\u0027ll need to expend quite a bit of delta-v to circularise this orbit), you may end-up burning for so long that your apoapsis begins to rise again. That\u0027s okay, get it close, we\u0027ve got our data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNote the current longitude. We\u0027ll call this \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd for the sake of actually giving an example, let\u0027s say we arrived at a new longitude of 138 degrees. Ta-da! That 138 degrees is very, very important. I hope there are lightbulbs going off now...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 5: Interpreting What the Heck I Just Told You To Do\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u0027s where the math comes in. The beautifully easy, peasy math. Let\u0027s say that we now want to deploy a payload such that when it\u0027s in GEO, it\u0027s (approximately; done right this method should get one within a few degrees longitude) at 0 degrees longitude. We simply do: 0 - \u003Cem\u003Ex\u003C/em\u003E = longitude of burn. In this case, we get -138 degrees. So, following the same pattern as our test flight, exiting our parking orbit of 200km at -138 degrees longitude (or at least, starting our burn there) will have the satellite arrive in GEO on or close to a longitude of 0 degrees.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo further illustrate, here\u0027s a table showing the (exceedingly simple in comparison to most math stuff with orbital mechanics in KSP) math that gives us the longitudes to burn at for all eight orthagonal points, giving a nice, evenly spaced set of 8 satellites (negative values used so they correspond correctly to longitude as displayed by MechJeb):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\n0 - 138 = -138\n45 - 138 = -93\n90 - 138 = -48\n135 - 138 = -3\n180 - 138 = 42\n-135 \u002B 138 = 3\n-90 \u002B 138 = 48\n-45 \u002B 138 = 93\n\u003C/pre\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd unless I completely messed-up (I\u0027m a little sleep-deprived of this writing) that should make sense. See? I keep my promises. Not so much as a multiplication sign. But wait! There\u0027s more!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EStep 6: So You Don\u0027t Know How to Add\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo problem! All you need to know is how many degrees you want to separate your satellites by. Then just initiate your burn from points that are equally spaced by longitude. So if you don\u0027t really care where \u003Cem\u003Eexactly\u003C/em\u003E your satellites end-up above Kerbin, you could simply do transfer burns at 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, -135, -90, and -45 degrees longitude. Just make sure you do the same thing with the same rocket every time. Changing the throttle, thrust (i.e. engines), mass, anything, will throw everything off, requiring you to go back to Step 3 for that rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you\u0027re finished, you\u0027re free to correct the orbit as you normally would, by reducing periapsis, increasing apoapsis, and returning, burning normal or antinormal to adjust inclination, etc. I\u0027ve managed to get within a few degrees longitude of my intended destination (about a degree or two off; close enough for me), with eccentricity of 0.0003 and inclination of \u0026lt;0.1 (which is the standard margin of error for inclination of real-world GEO satellites).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope that made some modicum of sense, and that it\u0027s somewhat helpful. I\u0027ve found this to be an exceedingly easy way to have a nicely-spaced constellation of comsats around Kerbin. You know, for Kerbin TV...or whatever they do to rot their brains.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-01T04:46:41Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2016 04:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by phoenix_ca\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixing typos\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"djnekkid","CreatedById":36328,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-24T06:34:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot too bad, but here is my 2cent :-) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want a geostatenary net with say 8 sattelites, with mechjeb assisted launch, (com releay mod anyone??)

Also it saves on total launches if your playing with limiting yourself (say 1 launchpad and 3 runway launches per week)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso it can be much easier tuning the orbits because you can kill any polar component of all 6 sats orbits while they are still attached. When the time comes you just need to launch them off and burn prograde\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-05T00:49:45Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2014 12:49  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by linkxsc\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore to say\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"draeath","CreatedById":25709,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-05T15:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally key point to this that simplifies things a lot...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour inclination and eccentricity are nowhere near as important as your orbital period.
