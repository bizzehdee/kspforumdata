For a given altitude on Kerbin, find that pressure then find that same pressure on the Duna chart and read the altitude. However, then you have to take Duna\u0027s lower gravity into account, which means add about 1000m to the Duna altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHOWEVER, being able to fly at 15000m on Kerbin will NOT get you over Duna\u0027s moutains. The vast bulk of Duna, the endless hilly dune fields, average about 2500-3000m. This corresponds to 16000m on Kerbin for atmospheric pressure. Duna\u0027s mountains are often 5000m high but many got up over 7000m, so you need to reach 8000m on Duna to feel totally safe. Of course, if you can get to 6000m, you can still get almost anywhere, you\u0027ll just have to fly around some inconveniently long chains of high mountains.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s the easy part. The hard part is landing. To have a viable Duna plane for exploration or whatever, you need to be able to operate from the dune fields. This means being able to maintain altitude at no more than 30m/s (slower is better) at 2500--3000m on Duna. This is so you can hit and then stop within the very small areas of flat-ISH ground scattered amongst the dunes.
