Since in craft 1, the whole airframe is being pushed, but in craft 2, the whole airframe parts is moving at once\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe scramjet engine must take in atmospheric air as an oxidizer and burn it with a fuel. This results in significant drag. In fact, the net thrust of a scramjet (or any airbreathing engine) is the difference between the product of exhaust mass flow and exhaust velocity and the product of intake mass flow and forward velocity, in keeping with the following equation:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003EF\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ethrust_net\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/sub\u003E = \u003Cem\u003EMF\u003Csub\u003Eexhaust\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/em\u003E * \u003Cem\u003Ev\u003Csub\u003Eexhaust\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/em\u003E - \u003Cem\u003EMF\u003C/em\u003E\u003Csub\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eintake\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0\u003C/sub\u003E* \u003Cem\u003Ev\u003Csub\u003Evehicle\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooks complex, but it\u0027s intuitive if you think about it. What\u0027s providing forward impulse? Well, it\u0027s the momentum of whatever you\u0027re pushing out of the back end of the engine. But what are you pushing out of the back end of the engine? Fuel, yes, but also all the air you pulled into your intake to mix and burn with your fuel. And that air entered your engine at the forward airspeed of your vehicle, so you have to subtract the momentum it already had in order to find out what your actual effective net thrust is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAll that to say -- a scramjet, or any other airbreather, has to deal not only with drag on the vehicle, but also with intake drag. If the handwavium engine has the same\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Etotal\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thrust as the scramjet, then the handwavium aircraft will have far superior drag performance because you don\u0027t have to deal with an intake. If the handwavium engine has the same\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enet\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0thrust as your scramjet, the scramjet will have lower total drag because net thrust factors in intake drag losses, and the intake of a scramjet is typically a large component of your vehicle body.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing to deal with is mass. The scramjet will lose mass as it flies while the handwavium engine will not. However, the scramjet will also lose thrust as it accelerates, due to that \u003Cem\u003Ev\u003Csub\u003Evehicle\u003C/sub\u003E\u003C/em\u003E value increasing, so that needs to be taken into account as well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut none of these differences have anything to do with the mechanical transference of force/acceleration. One can presume the scramjet\u0027s airframe is rigid enough that force on the engine mount is transferred to the rest of the craft as well as if each component were being accelerated together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DAL59","CreatedById":180784,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-05T02:37:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHow strong of an capacitor could you make that weighs less than 100 pounds?\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-02-05T09:15:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe ?
