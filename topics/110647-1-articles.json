I understand that not being able to give rep for the same post twice is logically there for security reasons, but I found some others to be a bit.. irritating. Especially having to wait 24 hours to rep more--What are these for? I find this a bit too.. restrictive. Being an avid rep-spreader, I don\u0027t know why this is there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dodgey","CreatedById":89577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T16:22:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m assuming that it is to prevent spamming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starwhip","CreatedById":83990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T16:24:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dodgey\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dodgey\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m assuming that it is to prevent spamming.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes.
