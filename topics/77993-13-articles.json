Let me try again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my opinion, and I cannot speak from a position of authority on the matter, the \u0022stupid\u0022 requirements for contracts are an attempt to mirror reality. I\u0027d wager that when a prototype is tested, it is done so at a variety of different altitudes, speeds, and other parameters determined by the engineers and technicians responsible for the design. It wouldn\u0027t just be handed to the tester to test when it was convenient for them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe requirements for altitude etc, to me, appear to be Squad\u0027s attempt to mimic this. If the game allowed completion of contracts by testing whenever the player wanted, or when it suited them, then it\u0027d be far too easy to breeze through the contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I for one applaud the different criteria that contract fulfillment requires!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Godot","CreatedById":16902,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T09:34:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOL, that\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4s interesting ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eit seems like your contracts enable you to get test models of parts, that you haven\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4t researched yet ...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethese are available for you to use until the contract to which they are connected is fulfilled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards they vanish (unless, of course, you have reearched the necessary node in the meantime)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
