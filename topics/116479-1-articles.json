With backlighting like the other analog avionics gauges, of course.\n\n2: Generic jeweled lamp:\n\n[![zsYNNw.jpg](http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/661/zsYNNw.jpg)](https://imageshack.com/i/idzsYNNwj)\n\nThe lights from your switch w/guard are good examples (just with no switch and no descriptor plate). All I want is a simple domed lamp that I can control (turn on / turn off / color change) using JSIVariableAnimator.\n\n3: The complex one:\n\n[![Q63uXG.jpg](http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/673/Q63uXG.jpg)](https://imageshack.com/i/ipQ63uXGj)\n\nThe range and range-rate instrument from Gemini (used for docking). What I\u0027d really like is the outer scale to be in meters x 1000, and linear (this looks logarithmic) out to 10km maybe? The inner ring scale could be range from -100 to \u002B1000m - maybe it would make more sense as a logarithmic scale (if that\u0027s not too hard). The rate would make sense as \u002B/- 2m/s (maybe that\u0027s accurate enough for docking). All three gauges would be controlled by JSIVariableAnimator, of course.\n\nEDIT: I found the documentation for this instrument in the Gemini manual (volume 2) - the outer ring is used to report distance. The inner ring reports the relative speed (closure rate). It\u0027s actually a fairly interesting device, but I\u0027ll skip the details. Maybe rescale the outer ring to 0 - 10 ( x1000 meters), and have an inner ring that corresponds to 0 - 100 (m/s). The inner gauge (the -5 - \u002B5 ft/s) is longitudinal rate, so it could remain as a -2 - \u002B2 m/s - the documentation says it\u0027s pegged to one of the extremes up until the final approach for docking. Although having a 2nd gauge like that (maybe pointing to the left, or on the left edge pointing inwards, so it\u0027s oriented vertically) would allow decomposing longitudinal motion into vertical and horizontal components.\n\nI\u0027d be happy with the first two items. I\u0027d be extremely happy if the docking gauge was possible, too, but I realize that\u0027s more complex and specialized. I\u0027m still trying to think of analog gauges that could work for docking alignment, but I haven\u0027t come up with anything yet.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-17T14:18:49Z\u0022 title=\u002208/17/2015 02:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MOARdV**\n  \nChange description of how the R\u0026R-R insturment works."},{"CreatedByName":"alexustas","CreatedById":78632,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-18T04:26:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Alex, you\u0027ve made a couple of requests for RPM features.

It\u0027s not too hard to do, if you\u0027re using the props included in ASET Avionics, ASET Props, and stock RPM. You have to install a Unity editor and KSP Part Tools, and then it\u0027s mostly a case of placing props, resizing them, and moving them around. It is time consuming, however. For instance, this:\n\n[![5Jq35p.jpg](http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/661/5Jq35p.jpg)](https://imageshack.com/i/id5Jq35pj)\n\nis about 10 - 15 hours of work (between arranging things in Unity, testing it in-game, and customizing some prop configurations). I\u0027ve put about 15 - 20 more hours into it and rearranged a lot of things since then. I can\u0027t imagine how much time Alexustas has put in to the pods he\u0027s done (although maybe, being artistically inclined, he\u0027s quicker at it than I am)."},{"CreatedByName":"Gaultesian","CreatedById":145145,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-22T23:40:38Z","Content":"Thanks for the advice and the encouragement MOARdV.
