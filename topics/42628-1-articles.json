I\u0027ve seen it happen on a live stream once and it was apparently the case of corruption. I also noticed that it is only on that certain part that makes it happen. I tried re-loading the craft but it is still the same so most likely I saved it like that. So i\u0027m trying to fix the ship, should i try and edit the .craft and remove that part out? (I can provide pictures if necessary)Any help is greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Well I sorta found a solution, The leg was placed in symmetry so i tried picking up the one on the opposite side and i could remove it, but if i try to put it back in the same sport I run into the same problem again. Sorry about this, I should have done more testing with it before i brought it here...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-15T19:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002208/15/2013 07:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by xzxvrx\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EProblem Partially Solved\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
