I don\u0027t have the science for the XL yet but noticed that the text for both state: fully deployed they have a drag of 500. Either fix the text if its wrong or fix both the text and the drag stats so the XL has more drag, if its two chutes, then it should state, 2 chutes at 500 drag each.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Supernovy","CreatedById":29617,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T05:04:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the current model, the higher mass of the larger parachute will slow the craft down more than the lower mass of the smaller parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-14T15:13:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree that the information is misleading.
