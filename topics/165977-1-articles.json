I even aimed the camera at the RMG and pressed control from here, but it still focuses on the spent stage. Also, whenever I remove one part with staging, EVERY other part with staging gets messed up. I have procedural parts mod, tweak scale mod, and KSP 1.2.2. This is my first working multi-stage (8 stages, 80\u002B\u00A0parts, 9 engines) rocket, so I don\u0027t know too much about staging.
