I\u0027ve been playing fairly solidly for a few weeks now....love the career mode!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been to Mun a few times, crash landed more than controlled...although the most recent one didn\u0027t kill the little fella. Minmus, I\u0027ve had more success with, its a slower descent/landing but I NEED a joystick because I just can\u0027t do it right with the keyboard controls. Its on order...frustratingly my existing one doesn\u0027t work properly, there\u0027s loads of talk on forums etc about the issue but no solution other than a different joystick I think.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been to Duna (and Ike) too, twice now. And 3rd trip I completely muddled it but had a ton of fuel, so flung myself out into space and randomly came across Jool, which was a bonus. Didn\u0027t have enough fuel to deorbit, tried an aerobrake but it went spectacularly wrong. Never mind.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI looked more methodically into a trip to Eve, the plannnig was meticulous, I lined everything up...and had an \u0022encounter\u0022 with the Mun! I guess any kind of encounter is going to throw you off track and thus, I scrubbed that trip. Never mind, I\u0027ll try again in another 7 years or whenever the alignment of the planets favours me!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-12T23:07:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are typical misadventures even for a veteran player.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome to the forum. \u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/kerbal-forum-uploads/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"paul_c","CreatedById":208135,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-11-12T23:28:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Image%20009%20ksp%20minmus%20surface%20b\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002271.12\u0022 height=\u0022847\u0022 width=\u00221191\u0022 src=\u0022https://fse-aardvark-planner.co.uk/other/Image%20009%20ksp%20minmus%20surface%20base.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModule built and flight tested - check\u003Cbr\u003E\nTrans-Minmus injection planned - check\u003Cbr\u003E\nBig rocket didn\u0027t blow up upon launch - check\u003Cbr\u003E\nBig long trip executed perfectly...well most of it, barring the last 50m.
