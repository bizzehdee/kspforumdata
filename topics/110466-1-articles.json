Good luck and have fun.\n\n**Orbital flight instructions:** \n\nOnce in orbit you will need to take control of Storm, decouple it and activate fuel flow on all the tanks (including wings) and make sure to look inside the craft so you can activate the 6 internal fuel tanks. Sorry but for some reason you can not disable fuel flow between Thunder and storm so it was the only option. \n\n**Download links:** Part count 502 (Both craft together, 160 parts in Storm.)\n\n[**http://www./download/ic1qb4bpf0gn822/Thunder\u002BStorm\u002B\u002BASATO.craft**](http://www./download/ic1qb4bpf0gn822/Thunder\u002BStorm\u002B\u002BASATO.craft)\n\n[**http://kerbalx.com/Roflcopterkklol/Thunder-Storm--ASATO-carrier**](http://kerbalx.com/Roflcopterkklol/Thunder-Storm--ASATO-carrier)\n\n![vJpigqZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/vJpigqZ.jpg)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E ![2Z9N4DZ.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2Z9N4DZ.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![FXjDvb6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/FXjDvb6.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![bIO58CW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/bIO58CW.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![Ig9LUsn.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Ig9LUsn.jpg)\n\u003E \n\u003E ![fYkQ5cW.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/fYkQ5cW.jpg)\n\nIf you have an idea you want to see come true leave a comment saying what it is and i will try my best to accomplish the task, i seem to be low on projects now.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-23T09:48:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/23/2015 09:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Roflcopterkklol**"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T09:36:52Z","Content":"SATOS BABY!!! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Have a nice rep ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T09:51:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E SATOS BABY!!! ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif) Have a nice rep ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nhaha thanks man, ill be honest i am fairly glad its done, that thing was a nightmare to get working"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T14:42:06Z","Content":"Hmm should i make a smaller version of this craft? less parts and all that"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T17:12:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Hmm should i make a smaller version of this craft? less parts and all that\n\nI\u0027d like to see you do that ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:12:36Z","Content":"Pardon me but Google was no help - what\u0027s a SATO?\n\nSingle Airplane To Orbit?\n\nSepratron Assisted Take-Off...?"},{"CreatedByName":"SHiftER2O","CreatedById":141087,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-23T22:17:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Pardon me but Google was no help - what\u0027s a SATO?\n\u003E Single Airplane To Orbit?\n\u003E \n\u003E Sepratron Assisted Take-Off...?\n\nShuttle Assist To Orbit good sir ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Roflcopterkklol","CreatedById":119190,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T01:37:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027d like to see you do that ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nFair enough, ill try and do a craft like this that is under 250 parts"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-24T05:33:13Z","Content":"Thunder Storm!
