Now you can drop the atmospheric engines and the air intakes on the orbital one also you can further slim down the wheel, also the wheels does not need to be raised. You also has the option to replace the spaceplane with an disposable second stage to carry heavier payload.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou also avoid doing docking and refueling in an hurry.
