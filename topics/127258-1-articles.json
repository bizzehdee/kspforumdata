The angle doesn\u0027t matter as your chaotic rotation will keep the heat evenly distributed and let parts cool off while they are occluded.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nA demonstration with FAR, no damage due to aerodynamic stresses, craft is kept cold, works in 100% of cases with no part loss:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ciframe class=\u0022imgur-album\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 height=\u0022550\u0022 src=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5b1v7/embed?background=ffffff\u0026amp;text=1a1a1a\u0026amp;link=4e76c9\u0022 width=\u0022100%\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe actual rotation speed was about 1 rotation per 1-2 seconds. In shallow reentry angles, the cockpit kept going from 80% overheat to zero very rapidly but never overheated. Also note, that the wing surface is not below average so this type of renetry seems to work with FAR aerodynamic stress just fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course this won\u0027t work with all types of craft but if you have problems with burning up during reentry, rotation may be the way to go. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-12-07T23:49:47Z\u0022 title=\u002212/07/2015 11:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 7, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by theend3r\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T01:06:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/389922548159536022/964F366E7177031FCB9B292757345170FE1D4234/\u0022 alt=\u0022964F366E7177031FCB9B292757345170FE1D4234\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know about FAR but stock aero from Kerbin orbit, cobra reentry is the way to go. \u00A0Set your periapse to 30 km, point the nose at the zenith and nothing gets very hot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T02:17:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just use REALLY high angles of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"WillThe84th","CreatedById":154644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-08T02:20:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222312888\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022127258\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221449541022\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022140061\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022CliftonM\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, CliftonM said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just use REALLY high angles of attack.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do the same thing.

When it was first announced that it was becoming a thing, \u00A0I remember it being\u00A0explicitly stated that it would be \u0022forgiving\u0022, that as long as you didnt do something crazy like direct entry from Duna, it wouldnt prove a challenge. Since that statement has since been proven a lie I just dont play on full heating. I see no point. I don\u0027t want to be hoping for a full 6 minute descent that I guessed right on my altitude and wont burn up. To me that isnt gameplay, its luck. I drop it to 60% and call it good.
