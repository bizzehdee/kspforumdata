How are people generally doing this? Currently I have a \u0022mobile\u0022 base sections on rover wheels, that I can get docked while landed at kerbin, but getting these monstrosities to the mun has been largely disastrous. (Yay, rescue missions)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m currently using a top mounted \u0022lander\u0022 with radially mounted engines to land/drop the base, which then starts rolling out of control since its on a slight slope, and when I try to brake that doesn\u0027t work, and if I try to apply reverse \u0022thrust\u0022 using the wheels the whole contraption just flips over (high CG). The configuration I\u0027m using is a simple coupla\u002BPDP container on 4 rover wheels. I\u0027m not really confident that attaching the science module would go over any better (and I haven\u0027t figured out a good way to get that monster into orbit yet).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of plan B I\u0027ve though about just using landing struts, but then I\u0027m not sure how to upgrade/attach new modules. Should I try to build the whole thing in orbit using docking ports and try to land it (will the clamp-o-trons survive something like that?). Or perhaps I should try to just build some absurd monster base with integrated landing systems? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, advice appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-22T18:17:58Z\u0022 title=\u002206/22/2015 06:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by harlikwin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:09:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is an eternal pain point in KSP, it keeps cropping up in the forums. Assembling surface bases in stock is just miserably difficult and frustrating. There are people who have managed it, but it\u0027s just a royal pain in the fundament.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are three basic approaches you can take:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Brazen it out, grit your teeth, and just do it. There are people who have built surface bases in stock, and there are some design techniques that aim to help, but after much time futzing with it I have come to the conclusion that this is just far more trouble than it\u0027s worth. YMMV.

Use the Claw. Advantage: this is easy. Disadvantage: The claw is notorious kraken-bait and has a tendency to destroy the universe. I avoid using it for any purpose ever. (Also, for me personally, it has a second disadvantage, which is that it feels like an unrealistic hack. It breaks the immersion that makes KSP so fun for me; suddenly it\u0027s just \u0022I\u0027m playing a game\u0022 rather than \u0022I\u0027m flying spaceships\u0022.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Use Kerbal Attachment System. Yes, it\u0027s a mod, but it\u0027s a minimally intrusive one if you just deliberately ignore most of its features. There\u0027s a \u0022connector port\u0022 part that you can add to your ships, either in the VAB/SPH or in the field by an engineer. All you have to do is land (or drive) your base components within a few dozen meters of each other. Then you just walk a kerbal up to a connector port, click on it and choose \u0022start link\u0022, walk to another component, click on its connector port and choose \u0022complete link\u0022, an there you go-- your base components are connected by a pipe that acts the same as if they were docked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T18:22:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEach lander requires something different.

My philosophy is to make sure to be able to do things manually first a few times, and then I don\u0027t mind automating them, but in this case maybe Kerbal Attachment is the way to go. It would also let me refuel things if necessary (currently using an absurdo-miner/lander/ISRU combo that I\u0027ve dubbed the crystal palace due to the fact its coated with solar panels) that I\u0027m using to refuel my space stations.

The base modules were mounted to the top of the lander, and not the bottom. I found that the fuel on top, which usually weighs more than the object being move, will make the entire assembly a bit top-heavy, and prone to tipping. So this was a good way to avoid that result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Each module (MPL, crew bays, etc) was of the 2.5m variety, and went up sideways. This made the final \u0022rover\u0022 much more stable, with a much longer wheel base and less mass on top. They had a radial mounting point at both top and bottom, with a docking port on the bottom. On top was all the odds and ends that would otherwise shift the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Each module came stock with two large radial RCS tanks mounted near the bottom (but enough to give wheel clearance). This helped in giving it a low center of mass, and a plethora of thrusters allowed it to fly off the lander with ease. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. For wheels, I added a pair on each side of the assembly via the mid-length I-beams connected at the bottom of the module. This gave it a decently wide stance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. On each end were structural fuselages connected to docking ports. Assembly was a remarkably simple process of driving one docking port into the other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe end result was more like a train than a \u0022base\u0022, but it had something like 18 cars all told, and could go at pretty good speeds. It was kind of fun to IVA-drive on the Minmus flats with the cupola module up front. Probably could have flown into Minmus orbit using RCS alone.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
