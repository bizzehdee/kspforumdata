Anyway, I fixed this for the next version.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E **KospY**: it would be very much more flexible to check the experience effect rather than the trait. There are modders (myself included) that plan on adding more traits (one that comes to mind: medic), and they will be left out in the cold. Effects are almost as easy to check. Better yet, Effects are very easy to create: I have done so for Extraplanetary Launchpads (ExConstructionSkill). Currently only engineers get the skill, but there\u0027s no reason someone couldn\u0027t give it to any other profession (trait).\n\u003E If you like, I can do the work and send a PR.\n\nI\u0027m checking the experienceTrait.title of protocrewmembers to restrict the use of an item (ex : screwdriver need trait \u0022engineer\u0022).\n\nIf a new trait is created, you just need to put the item restiction to \u0022medic\u0022 in the config file no ? \n\nBut may be I didn\u0027t understand what you want exactly... \n\nSure you can send me a PR if needed, i\u0027m open to any suggestion to improve compatibility with other mods ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Did you read the OP? It\u0027s standalone, no KAS (or module manager apparently, but MM is needed for other mods) required. It does have a slight conflict with the grab keybind in KAS, but they\u0027ll fix that in the next KAS update and besides, you can change the keybind, takes less than a minute to do so.\n\u003E KospY: I would suggest that you disable window clickthrough when the inventory editor window is open because you can accidentially do something to something behind the window that you don\u0027t want to do.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: The ingame manual book reader (which is a neat feature btw) needs a zoom function because the text is kind of small for me to read.\n\nAdded to my todo list.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Hm, I had a crash that appears to be related to KIS (crash folder) [http://sta.sh/01d3byrnjfwz](http://sta.sh/01d3byrnjfwz)\n\u003E I\u0027m not exactly sure how it happened, but it happened while I was putting things into a command pod inventory. Some of the steps were that I accidentially removed and then deleted something while putting things into the inventory, undid that (which also removed stuff from inventory), started getting a strange exception coming from Extraplanetary Launchpads, then a short time later, crash.\n\nSorry but can you be more precise ? We can\u0027t \u0022delete\u0022 item in the inventory so I don\u0027t understand what you did. \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I think he/she meant preserving the science samples while they\u0027re in inventory, which you can\u0027t do with KAS when you store something with science samples in it.\n\nThere is no problem about storing science part in container.\n\nThe \u0022state\u0022 of part is preserved in the container. If you recover a container with science part in it, the experiments (and part cost) will be recovered.\n\n(It also worked in the last version of KAS)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Also, an idea, while we can view the volume of something that is in an inventory, we can\u0027t for things that are outside inventory (ie. the VAB/SPH). So, maybe it\u0027s something planned, but how about a way to view the volume of things while in VAB? Theres going to be some parts (such as the two track parts I mentioned in an earlier post) that are light enough, but are too big volume wise and might not be obvious that they don\u0027t fit.\n\nIf you put a part that do not fit in the container, a message with the volume of the part will be displayed.\n\nSure that will be nice to see the volume from the editor tooltip, but I didn\u0027t find a way to do that (yet).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E While KIS is a standalone, you need both if you want KAS parts (pipes, struts, winches, etc.). It\u0027s also unclear to me how exactly KAS\u0027s KASModuleGrab (the module added to parts to allow you to grab them) coexists with KIS. From looking at the OP and the Wiki, it seems like parts no longer need a \u0022grab module\u0022 to allow Kerbals to grab/attach/manipulate the parts but I haven\u0027t played with the mod yet. It\u0027s also not clear what happens with parts with the KASModuleGrab already, i.e., do they function independently (no KIS mass, volume, trait limitations) or does KIS override the KAS functionality.\n\nGrabmodule is no more needed. As I say on the first post, KIS is standalone, so it work independently of KAS.\n\nToo avoid confusion, I also recommend to remove \u0022MM\\_Science.cfg\u0022 and \u0022MM\\_Squad.cfg\u0022 (ModuleManager patch file) from the KAS folder after migrating from KAS container to KIS container.\n\nThis way the grab module will not be activated on stock parts. I will add this to the main thread.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Just tried to use one of the explosives to explode one of the KSC buildings and nope, doesn\u0027t work, aw.... That\u0027s only ONE explosive though.....\n\u003E Not even 9 of them, and yes I have indestructible buildings off. They will chain react though, which is cool.\n\u003E \n\u003E Edit: How do I get the kerbals to carry one of the containers like in KAS?\n\nCarrying container on back is removed. You can only move them around with drag \u0026 drop.\n\nWith the bigger containers coming next, it will be completly weird to do that. Also, it give purpose to rovers for moving containers.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E So.. attachment via the green nodes? (not surface attachment)\n\u003E ZOMG, I need this so much. In my career I have a whole bunch of ships using LV-909, because I haven\u0027t researched the LV-N yet (playing with Kerbal Construction Time so science is slow). Instead of mulching the ship into RocketParts and building it again, I\u0027d much rather just swap the engine.\n\u003E \n\u003E Is this anywhere near close, or just a wishlist idea at this point? I have 73 Kerbal days... ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nStack snap attach is attachment via the green nodes yes. I\u0027m pretty close to finish it, but I can\u0027t give any ETA. \n\nI also need to update KAS before adding new feature to KIS (because if not, KAS will never be updated ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) )\n\n\u003E \n\u003E A way for Kerbals to carry the KIS containers would be good though, provided that they aren\u0027t too heavy of course. I can\u0027t seem to get them into Kerbal inventory.\n\u003E Edit: Apparently EPL doesn\u0027t like it when a stake is in a kerbals inventory, it fires one of these every time I switch over to the base from the kerbal.\n\u003E \n\u003E NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.ExSurveyTracker\u002BSurveySite\u002B\u003Cgetenumerator\u003Ec__Iterator0.MoveNext () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\u003C/getenumerator\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.ExSurveyStation.Highlight (Boolean on) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.ExBuildWindow.UpdateGUIState () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.ExBuildWindow.Select\\_Pad (ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.ExBuildControl selected\\_pad) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.ExBuildWindow.BuildPadList (.Vessel v) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads.ExBuildWindow.onVesselChange (.Vessel v) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at EventData\u00601[Vessel].Fire (.Vessel data) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at FlightGlobals.setActiveVessel (.Vessel v, Boolean force) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at FlightGlobals.ForceSetActiveVessel (.Vessel v) [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0 \u003C/filename\u003E\n\u003E \n\u003E  at VesselSwitching.Update () [0x00000] in \u003Cfilename unknown=\u0022\u0022\u003E:0\u003C/filename\u003E\n\nWell, I didn\u0027t check the mod with ExtraplanetaryLaunchpads, I will try to take a look.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-14T20:33:30Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2015 08:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by KospY**"},{"CreatedByName":"EthanKerbman","CreatedById":116352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T20:33:47Z","Content":"Should work the same, as long as it uses a KASModuleContainer, it should be converted, I\u0027ll be trying it myself shortly, and maybe post MM configs for dedicated bays (CactEye, UniversalStorage, BoxSat and USI\u0027s mods) if it works.\n\nKeep in mind, only convert if you have no active ship with parts inside a KAS container, the results might range from losing your stored parts (guaranteed) to kraken attacks (probably not, but not entirely impossible I guess)."},{"CreatedByName":"KospY","CreatedById":33868,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-14T20:38:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So this will be incorporated into KAS?
