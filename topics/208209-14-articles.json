pre-release streams/videos of KSP 2.\u00A0 Assuming TT are willing to splash some money around on advertising, and distribute some review keys, then getting day one reviews out will be easy.\u00A0 (That is something that no indie developer can expect if they don\u0027t have a publisher/advertising money and/or hype).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso note that first impressions matter.\u00A0 If the initial word of mouth is that a game isn\u0027t worth your time/money, then that impression will probably stick.\u00A0 A premature/bad early access release can be fatal to a games development.\u00A0\u00A0Pushing KSP 2 out to early release too early could result in a backlash from unsatisfied customers expecting the finished product.\u00A0 \u00A0From Take Two\u0027s perspective that risk is almost certainly not worthwhile.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EPersonally I think a large developer or publisher who doesn\u0027t need early access money/feedback can get the same amount of publicity and hype potential with less risk by releasing a finished game rather than an early access game.\u00A0 If have an advertising budget, then they can get reviews and first-plays and hence get noticed.\u00A0 Whether their game then develops hype depends on the game and whether it appeals to the market.\u00A0 Early access does not provide any advantage here, and if the game comes across as unfinished/unpolished then can be a problem.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003EUltimately the choice of early access or not belongs
