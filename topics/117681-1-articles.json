I\u0027ve decided to tentatively dip my feet into the vast ocean that is this game\u0027s modding community, and for my first mod I decided to make a [Scramjet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet) style engine. (Basically a high thrust jet engine that only works at speeds above mach 3 and altitudes above 10km) I took the stock turbojet, and changed the .cfg file atmosphere and velocity curves so it now looks like this:\n\n    \t\tvelCurve\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.2 0 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.72 0 0 0\t\t\tkey = 1.36 0 0 0\t\t\tkey = 2.15 0.1 0 0\t\t\tkey = 3 3 0 0\t\t\tkey = 4.5 5 0 0\t\t\tkey = 5.5 0 0 0\t\t}\t\tatmCurve\t\t{\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.045 0.5 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.16 0.5 0 0\t\t\tkey = 0.5 0.001 0 0\t\t\tkey = 1 0 0 0\n\nWhat I\u0027d like to know is how should I change the final two values on each column, I made them zero just so I could see the numbers better, but I don\u0027t know what they actually do. Can anyone explain them to me? The values I have put seem to work, but there are hard cut-offs instead of smooth transitions. As in, the engine immediately leaps up from not working to suddenly working when mach 3 and 10km altitude is reached, and vice versa for the speed.\n\nAny ideas?"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T08:25:19Z","Content":"The final two values are the in- and out-tangets of the curve, at 0 0 the tangent goes in and out flat horizontally for each key so not exactly a smooth transition.\n\nI recommend to check out [r4m0n\u0027s float curve editor for unity](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83246), it shows you a graph for your curve, lets you tweak and copy paste it. (remove empty spaces before keys when you use it)\n\nAlso, here\u0027s a handy [guide on configuring air breathing engines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120899) including scramjets"},{"CreatedByName":"Zaddy23","CreatedById":123145,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T09:28:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Also, here\u0027s a handy [guide on configuring air breathing engines](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/120899) including scramjets\n\nAha, thanks!
