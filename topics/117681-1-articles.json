I\u0027ve decided to tentatively dip my feet into the vast ocean that is this game\u0027s modding community, and for my first mod I decided to make a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramjet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EScramjet\u003C/a\u003E style engine. (Basically a high thrust jet engine that only works at speeds above mach 3 and altitudes above 10km) I took the stock turbojet, and changed the .cfg file atmosphere and velocity curves so it now looks like this:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\t\tvelCurve\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 0.2 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 0.72 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 1.36 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 2.15 0.1 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 3 3 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 4.5 5 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 5.5 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tatmCurve\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 0 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 0.045 0.5 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 0.16 0.5 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 0.5 0.001 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tkey = 1 0 0 0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat I\u0027d like to know is how should I change the final two values on each column, I made them zero just so I could see the numbers better, but I don\u0027t know what they actually do. Can anyone explain them to me? The values I have put seem to work, but there are hard cut-offs instead of smooth transitions. As in, the engine immediately leaps up from not working to suddenly working when mach 3 and 10km altitude is reached, and vice versa for the speed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Porkjet","CreatedById":92433,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-05T08:25:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe final two values are the in- and out-tangets of the curve, at 0 0 the tangent goes in and out flat horizontally for each key so not exactly a smooth transition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend to check out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/83246\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Er4m0n\u0027s float curve editor for unity\u003C/a\u003E, it shows you a graph for your curve, lets you tweak and copy paste it.
