Surface gravity is a combination of mass and density, Jupiter is 317 Earth masses while having \u0022only\u0022 2.5g at the surface (in this instance \u0022surface\u0022 refers to the level at which the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar, aka earth sea level atmosphere density). Uranus, in fact, only has 0.886g, and 14.5 earth masses. Now, the difference in mass between, say, Pluto and Charon is only a factor of 8 (that is, Pluto is 8 Charon masses), so Earth could quite easily orbit Uranus if Alternis decided to relocate our solar system, although it would be quite a lopsided orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, neither the stock system or Alternis would really be gravitationally stable for very long. That many big planets orbiting that close together would quickly spell havoc, even if they\u0027re locked in orbital resonance with one another like the moons of Jupiter (and Jool). I won\u0027t deny there\u0027s been a little bit of bending of the rules for purposes of the game though, for both Alternis and stock ;p\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-27T09:55:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2013 09:55  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by NovaSilisko\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andrew Hansen","CreatedById":82311,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-27T10:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NovaSilisko\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022surface\u0022 refers to the level at which the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar, aka earth sea level atmosphere density\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat makes sense to me.
