This variant should have four docking ports that act as a guiding unit (if you use \u0027Control From Here\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownload: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24250760/KSP%20Ships/ExperiModu%20Lander.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/24250760/KSP%20Ships/ExperiModu%20Lander.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo encourage further innovation of this sort of design, I have decided to make this one free to modify or study. There are no restrictions to however you use it. You can even use the same concepts from it and actually improve it. Heck, this could even serve as an inspiration for a mod (or use with a mod) such as targeting computers.
