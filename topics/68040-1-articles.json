I was able to get the game to function with all 3 of these mods after trying to start the game 3 or 4 times. It would work for a while then it would crash after maybe an hour. Now in .23.5 I started it up and the game worked but Kerbal Alarm CLock gave me a prompt that it needed to be updated so I closed the game and then updated it. Now I cannot start the game. The game gets stuck at the begining. Usually at Squad_tab-extend or some such. I checked and the file was there and I was able to get sound from it when I clicked on it. I don\u0027t know what to do now. I gave up playing KSP on my windows PC because it just wouldn\u0027t start with 2 or more mods installed. I may give it up on mac too if I can\u0027t get this tow work. not to mention that KSP is considered still open in steam on mac when I close it in game rather than force quit. This is in modded and unmodded KSP. Any help would be appreciated. I really like playing modded KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thunderstar","CreatedById":64703,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T23:44:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei can\u0027t get any mods to work on 23.5, none, if the game doesn\u0027t crash before the main menu, it doesn\u0027t loads the mods, maybe we just have to wait for the mods to be updated, a lot of things changed in this update\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyomoto","CreatedById":64780,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T23:59:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh ... this may be a Mac issue then because all my mods worked right off the bat, and so did the updated ones. What I would recommend is removing all your mods, starting the game. Now add them one by one to find the offending mod. I\u0027ve had, on rare occasions but more than once, a mod get \u0027corrupted\u0027 and I had to install it fresh from the zip to fix it. That\u0027s the only time a mod has literally kept the game from starting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
