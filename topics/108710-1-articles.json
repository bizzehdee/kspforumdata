Would it be fruitless to try to \u0022match\u0022 orbits with her in the opposite direction, to save me the fuel costs of flipping my own orbit? Or would we just end up whizzing by each other at impossibly high speeds? I assume I need to suck it up and match her inclination, but I was curious what you all think.

You\u0027ll have a closing speed of ~4200m/s. Taking off to the west rather than the east will require around 400m/s more delta-V than normal. Swapping orbit directions like that will take that ~4200m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could do some trickery like boost to ~Minmus (900dV), reverse your direction there (~400dV), then burn to recircularize your orbit going the new direction (~900dV again, less if you aerobrake). That drops the required dV to maybe 1300, but taking off to the west is significantly easier.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T02:59:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell around Kerbin for instance, you would be doing 2300\u002B m/s in one direction and she would be doing 2300\u002B m/s in the opposite direction. If you were to meet at the same spot, I bet it would be quite the sight.. for a moment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo save dV there are a few useful approaches though. One would be to launch directly into the reverse orbit, costing only around 350 m/s extra m/s. If you are already in orbit, inclination changes are cheaper the higher up you are in orbit. For example, if you raise you apoapsis out to near minmus, then you are only traveling at less than 30 m/s near apo. You can thus switch your direction 180* by just burning retrograde and using only 30 x 2 m/s. You still have to pay to raise and lower you apo before and after the maneuver (930 x 2 m/s), but for large inclination changes like 180* it will save fuel overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ninja\u0027s while I was afk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T04:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the swift and helpful answers!

That percentage varies based on how much you need to change the inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs such changing it at a very low velocity is very cheap, while changing it at high speed is significantly more expensive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe cheapest way of changing inclination is to make something else spend the dV (gravity assist off a planet/moon), but that is often impractical.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Spock","CreatedById":116542,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-11T14:42:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I launched west, and it worked a treat.

Changing the peri on Kerbal from 100k to 500 k takes a long burn at Kerbal but just a slight tap on the shift key if your apo is out by Minmus. This is why planetary travel is even possible.

And I had an easy time matching orbits with the stranded Kerbil and bringing her home. I did have excitement on re-entry, though -- I didn\u0027t change my inclination, so I went into re-entry heading clockwise, east-to-west, rather than the usual west-to-east. It was by far the hottest re-entry I have had in 1.x! My heat shield lost 40% of its ablative protection! I assume this was because I was moving faster, and undergoing more friction, once I hit the atmosphere -- although my speed as I approached Kerbin didn\u0027t seem much higher than usual.
