Then left click on the maneuver node again to open it up. If the maneuver node is very close to other stuff, it might take a couple of clicks to open it up, but it always works in my experience. Just don\u0027t double click. Then you can zoom in on the target planet and still have the maneuver node open so that you\u0027re able to tweak it. If it\u0027s out of the screen or it\u0027s unresponsive, move the camera around so the maneuver node is closer to the center of the screen. I\u0027ve never had much of a problem with using stock maneuver nodes to tweak planetary encounters (I always had Conic Patch Draw Mode set to 0 for more intuitive encounters, gravity assists etc).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, MechJeb includes the same node utility as PreciseNode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
