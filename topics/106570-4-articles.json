These are all printed in light-coloured text, which makes them nearly invisible if they\u0027re over a light background. Adding a fine black outline to the font would make them readable on any background.\n- A number of the part sequences need to be rebalanced in various ways in order to have sensible economy of scale. You should never have a situation where a small version of a part is *strictly better* than a larger part that does the same thing. For instance, the Z-series batteries all hold the same amount of charge per unit of mass, but the larger ones cost *more*, proportionally, than the small ones; this makes no sense; the larger ones should either be identical-but-bigger or better-but-costlier. Similarly, the Gigantor solar panel should be *at least* as mass efficient as the smaller retractable panels. On the other hand, the ladders all have the same mass despite massively different lengths, while the RCS quad has the same mass as the linear thruster while offering 4 nozzles to its one.\n- Two of my previous suggestions, namely radial-mount drogue chutes and the ability to rename objects from the tracking station, are already in the game and should be removed from the list. (Note that my original suggestion was for radial-mount *and 0.625 m* drogue chutes; the radial-mount already exists, but the 0.625 m part is still a valid suggestion.)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-26T19:29:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/26/2015 07:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by macdjord**"},{"CreatedByName":"DSKY","CreatedById":115470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T16:32:22Z","Content":"The dialog where you select which saved game to open lists the number of active flights by each save. ***Flags*** count as active flights.

This would simplify docking with the damn things and make sure solar panels always face the Sun. Too many times I\u0027ve set a space station to target the Sun and point directly at it, only to fly into physics loading range of it and see the rotation hasn\u0027t been preserved. Now I either have to switch vessels and reaim the space station (which isn\u0027t the easiest thing to fly, being heavy and held together with docking ports) or dock at this [EXPLETIVE] up angle and hope I don\u0027t block what few panels are left facing the Sun.\n\nNavball. Oh how I would love to just have a simple artificial horizon with compass overlay, like real avionics. Being able to zoom in on it would be a treat as well if Navball is kept (some of us are used to it, and players new to the game/not versed in aviation might find it simpler to grasp). I understand that the directions on the Navball correspond to cardinal directions on the surface (and zenith for 90 degree pitch up, nadir for 90 degree pitch down), but in orbital mode, I\u0027d like the Navball\u0027s horizon to represent the orbital plane, 0 degrees heading being exactly prograde, 90 degrees east being radial.
