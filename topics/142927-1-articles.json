When I load up the options it has two columns and the only way I know what I am doing is when I am hovering over the selected answer. this also happens in game when building the ship and/or rocket; I cannot see the navigational menu to the left of the parts area. I really really enjoyed the demo and I bought this game last night and It isn\u0027t cooperating at all. I can\u0027t do the training because that is also bugged\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-01T22:26:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/166125-farmerbubba/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022166125\u0022 href=\u0022%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/166125-farmerbubba/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Farmerbubba\u003C/a\u003E, please take a look at this thread, we\u0027ll need more info.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83213-please-read-before-posting-stock-support-bug-reporting-guide/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
