Now the information given to us from the wiki says that it is tidally locked with Kerbin and only only spins once though its whole obit. From the map view I thought I saw what looks like it spinning a couple of times before making a full obit. I am not sure that it is my perspective or if it actually isn\u0027t tidally locked like the mun, Ike and Moho. I wounder if someone out in the community can help prove or disprove my observations. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ddavis425","CreatedById":14725,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T01:25:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was tidally locked in 0.15 and 0.16, but as of the recent update it is no longer tidally locked.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T04:07:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUntil the game gets more put together(and in Beta), it is better to take the Wiki as more a loose guideline than set doctrine.
