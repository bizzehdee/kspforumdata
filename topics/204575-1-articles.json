You could look up some of his videos on YouTube.

There is no 5m single engine in the game, but there is a fuel tank/engine assembly part that can serve as the basis for your custom 5m super-engine. It has 5 nodes: 4 size 1 nodes and one size 3 node. A Mastodon should go into each of the size 1 nodes. An engine plate with 5 Vectors should go to the size 3 node. So you have a super-Mammoth with 4 Mastodons and 5 Vectors, and no nozzle clipping. This will be your lower stage engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo boost it into the orbit, add 4 asparagus staged boosters. Each should be a Size 3 Kerbodyne with a Mammoth as the engine. So you\u0027ll have a Size 4 central stage and four size 3 asparagus staged booster stages. This alone is enough to launch really big payloads into space. Whole stations, or interplanetary cruisers with 10k delta-v, you name it.
