I simply have no good clear way to resolve this ambiguity.  \n\nIf I could 100% rely on state and value detection, it might work, but unfortunately it has not had a history of being reliable.

This function is always active and when you press \u0022Finalize results\u0022 it gets the data and move it to that pod invalidating the active contract. To avoid that I tried to exclude StationScience parts and experiments from any treatment with success, but there were secondary effects.....\n\nThe version I compiled can work with StationScience with no issue until the user finalize the experiment. At this point he SC part  acquire the data  of the experiment and this line:\n\n    if (ActiveContainer().GetActiveVesselDataCount() != ActiveContainer().GetScienceCount())\n\nstarts to execute on every Cycle, spamming the log. The problem is translated to the ship that docks the capsule for kerbin return. We need a way to compensate this inequality.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-08T09:31:25Z\u0022 title=\u002206/08/2016 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 8, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Guest**\n  \nmore information found"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-09T06:49:50Z","Content":"Finally I have it working.\n\n[@WaveFunctionP](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/104784-wavefunctionp/) I have no GIT or repo so PM me if you are interested in the changes I have made."},{"CreatedByName":"Jim DiGriz","CreatedById":92465,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-07T02:55:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E On 5/5/2015 at 7:29 PM, WaveFunctionP said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Cu\u003EWhat it does not do:\u003C/u\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E Give you science you could haven\u0027t gotten otherwise.\n\u003E \n\nShould probably have better integration with RemoteTech.
