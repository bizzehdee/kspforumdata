I looked around a little and couldn\u0027t find anyone else who made a shuttle in vanilla KSP and also landed it on the runway in the same mission, so I felt that this would be a strong first video. Thank you very much for watching it, I really appreciate it. Please let me know how I can make future videos better and maybe give me some ideas of other missions I could make a video of. Feedback in general would be greatly appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you guys very much! It means a lot to me.

Most people aren\u0027t going to have time to watch a whole 15 mins. Good idea for putting the \u0022Skip to 8:00\u0022 comment in the beginning though! Very smart, that definitely made up for it. Good job on the design, as well. This is just overall very good. Good luck in your video making endeavors!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sirine","CreatedById":74830,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T01:56:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Skip to 8:00\u0022- The best feature of this video!!!
