SAB designs had a more flexible lift model that would change dynamically based on airfoil placement. if they havent given the same lift model to both hangars then this subassembly addition is doomed before it has begun. on a side not i havent been *edit* playing since 0.21 hit the scene so i might have missed some ninja bug fix.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-25T03:03:02Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2013 03:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by praise the suuun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazro","CreatedById":55825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T02:56:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, the flight model for rockets and planes are the same. The only reason that the lift markers are different is that the VAB assumes you launch straight upwards, while the SPH assumes you fly towards the horizon. Lifting surfaces don\u0027t cause any lift while going straight up in KSP, so you don\u0027t have to worry about your rocket spinning around in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"praise the suuun","CreatedById":69912,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T03:01:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for responding. if a space place launches into the atmosphere from a booster from the VAB will its lifting surfaces still assuming it will be propelled vertically?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-25T03:03:53Z\u0022 title=\u002209/25/2013 03:03  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 25, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by praise the suuun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazro","CreatedById":55825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-25T03:05:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I can gather, you\u0027re asking if they\u0027ll still work.

A vehicle is a vehicle, parts are parts. It doesn\u0027t matter where they\u0027re built. It\u0027s just that the VAB makes it easier to build taller structures, typically associated with rockets, and the SPH makes it easier to design long or wide structures, like spaceplanes.
