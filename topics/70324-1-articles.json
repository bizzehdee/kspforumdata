It is cool and spent hours / days already playing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomething that is definitely missing in the game is the ability to construct objects in orbit and I mean literally construct them in orbit. What would be great after setting up a space station to support the construction of objects in orbit, to select a template of construction and than see the Kerbals construct the object in orbit depending on the resources available on the station which would be great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would be ingredients to make this work would be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.
