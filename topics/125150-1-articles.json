Recently installed the 1.05 update. A bit miffed at having to re-purchase many parts in career mode when playing on moderate difficulty. More miffed about the Whiplash Turbojet engine, which I have bought and researched, not showing up with the rest of the engines. As in, I see it in the science trees, but not in the build options in the hangers. I had just got it prior to 1.05 and was really looking forward to upgrading my jets. Is the engine gone?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cricketfighter","CreatedById":153456,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-12T05:58:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m having the same issue with the Whiplash Turbojet not showing up in the hangar even though it shows up as purchased in the tech tree.
