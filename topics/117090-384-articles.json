The reflections you see are exactly what you should be seeing.  Yes, the icon-previews look different than the parts do in the editor, or in flight (because they are using different reflection maps for each).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Quote\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E when the part is on the launchpad it has reflections only at the windows\n\u003E \n\nThat is exactly how those parts were intended (the lander cans).  The windows are of course very reflective, but the metal hull was intended to be more of a brushed-metal style of shiny (so not truly \u0027reflective\u0027, but will still show some environmental lighting effects).\n\nIf all of those are fine; I wonder what the problem was with the engines in your previous screenshots?  Perhaps the issues you were having with SmokeScreen were preventing the stock system from working.\n\nI feel I have to put this out there -- in KSP 1.7/1.8, TU does not mess with, adjust, or manipulate the reflections in any way; that is entirely a stock system, and any issues you may be encountering are *stock problems,* and not something that I can fix.  If the shaders are loaded, and the textures applied, that means TexturesUnlimited is working properly (as that is all that the mod does; load shaders, and update materials on models)."},{"CreatedByName":"raptor30","CreatedById":92812,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-11T17:46:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E If all of those are fine; I wonder what the problem was with the engines in your previous screenshots?

I tough that it should look like in the small preview window (there seams to be more reflective) the problem with the first picture with only the engines is taht I had the stock reflections off in the settings when I put it on medium as you see in the settings screenshot it was looking like this after I restarted the game.

Seems to work fine under windows  DX11. But is still a no go with reg OpenGL or forcing GLcore under Linux ?  Cant do it right now. But if you need it I can grab a couple of pics to upload  and a log? Just wondered if this was just me or if others are having problems with Linux.\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E  \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Thank\u0027s  !\n\u003E \n\nScreenshots of the issues, and log files, would go a long way towards having the information to even address this (let alone investigate, or solve).  And yes, this much more belongs in the TU thread, as it isn\u0027t directly SSTU related.  If everything is working, TU should not touch stock parts at all; zero changes, as it doesn\u0027t do anything to them, nor to any of the stock rendering.  If you migrated older TU configs forward (merged new version into the old), there may well be some config-level issues from duplicate files/etc.\n\nPart of the problem is I have zero access to Linux or Mac desktops, so I can only ever \u0027guess\u0027 that the releases will continue to work, and can never do any sort of hands-on testing.  I have no doubts that there may be issues; unfortunately, I cannot confirm them, and any attempts at fixes will be \u0027guesses\u0027.  I believe they can likely be resolved, but I will need the cooperation of a willing test-case who has time to try out a couple of the attempts at fixes."},{"CreatedByName":"Delbrutis","CreatedById":144613,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-14T16:34:18Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 48 minutes ago, Shadowmage said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Screenshots of the issues, and log files, would go a long way towards having the information to even address this\n\u003E \n\nI will try and get a log and a couple of screens up after I get off work tonight.

Might be fixable, but it is going to require some additional work out of the devs, as now they need completely separate code-paths and setups; one dealing with a single camera, and one dealing with the multi-camera setup.\n\nThankfully, the old multi-camera code should be portable to the new versions and stuck behind some OpenGL-only conditions, and it is actually the single-camera setup that will require new work and changes.\n\nThe real problem is going to be that the possibilities/capabilities between the two are going to be vastly different.  There are going to be things possible with DX11 that simply aren\u0027t available for OpenGL.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 10 minutes ago, Delbrutis said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I was mostly just curious  if it was something with my set up or a general issue with GL users.\n\u003E \n\nIt could be either, but I suspect and expect it to be a widespread OpenGL problem."},{"CreatedByName":"AlphaKerman","CreatedById":166470,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-02-22T11:31:16Z","Content":"![FfFzpfS.png](https://i.imgur.com/FfFzpfS.png)\n\nAny idea why the Real Plume mod doesn\u0022t works?
