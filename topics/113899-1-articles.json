I imagine this boosts performance incredibly - Would you recommend playing in Linux regarding performance? Are there any downsides of playing in Linux?\n\nMany thanks in advance!!! every insight will be very much appreciated! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-23T22:56:20Z\u0022 title=\u002206/23/2015 10:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pvnkb1tch**"},{"CreatedByName":"Green Baron","CreatedById":107381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-23T20:45:53Z","Content":"64bit has about 20-30% performace gain over 32bit under Linux concerning framerate.
