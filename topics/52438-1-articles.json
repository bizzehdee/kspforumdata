I made this small thing with long, heavily strutted girder arms sticking out on all sides, put MJ on it, and told it to rendezvous with the target (which was in a different orbit on the other side of Kerbin) at a distance of 1 meter. What happened was, the \u0022kill vehicle\u0022 would home right in on the target but would slow down trying to get right next to it. But it could never get close enough because the girders were longer than that and would hit the target, knocking it away. The more interesting things occurred when the \u0022kill vehicle\u0022 would spin around to make another pass, really backslapping the target with the arms in the process. The result was that the \u0022kill vehicle\u0022 would spend 15 or 20 minutes constantly bludgeoning the target until it ran out of fuel. In the process, it would break off small parts but not big ones and never hit anything hard enough to explode it. But it did a great job of knocking the target all over the sky and sending it spinning at high speed.

Even if I scattered 10,000 parts in LKO, the odds of any ship coming near one of those parts is quite small. Second, the parts in their orbits would be moving at exactly the same speed as everything else in the same kind of orbit, further lessening the chance for a strike. Even if there were one, it would be at very low velocities.
