Today I wanted to show you what I have been working on for the past weeks. It\u0027s a small rocket family which features four interplanetary rockets (actually more than that, but I haven\u0027t finished all of them).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoals:\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Create a fast, reliable and simple way to get to Duna and beyond. These rockets are especially made for beginners, but I hope also experienced players will enjoy them. They are simple to use. To make them even simpler, I haven\u0027t included asparagus staging. What I like about these rockets is that they are designed to be used for colony-like projects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDownsides:\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u0153 Because they are simple and relatively small, they can\u0027t bring huge payloads. They are designed for small- or medium-size robotic landers, or for a one-man capsule. However, the Super-heavy rocket has proven that it can carry a medium-size lander all the way to Eeoloo. The second lightweight rocket, if refueled, can bring a small satellite on an escape trajectory out of the kerbol system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a relatively good knowledge of orbital mechanics (such as lunar gravity assists to accelerate or Ike gravity assists to slow down), you can save fuel and bring larger, heavier landers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you have fun with them. I personally enjoy very much crashing... ehm, landing on Duna and exploring Ike. I hope you\u0027ll have fun. Bring snacks, it\u0027s a long journey all the way to Duna.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel absolutely free to point out things that I could have designed better. I\u0027m not an experienced rocket builder but I enjoy very much testing my knowledge and my creativity. I like constructive comments, please don\u0027t be rude \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd yes, the rockets are named after Adam Steltzner, the Jpl engineer that came up with the landing sequence of the Mars Science Laboratory, Curiosity. He has inspired me and I think thousands of people around the world, and I wanted to do a small (very, very, very small) tribute to him by naming my first rocket family after him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry for my bad english, I\u0027m italian \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee you later! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-31T10:08:09Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2013 10:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Frida Space\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
