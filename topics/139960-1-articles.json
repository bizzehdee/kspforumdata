\u00A0Roving only beats flying where there\u0027s high gravity and no atmosphere, such as Tylo and (in OPM) Slate. \u00A0Everywhere else, I build either airplanes (if there\u0027s atmosphere) or hopping landers (where there\u0027s low gravity\u00A0and no atmosphere).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jaeleth","CreatedById":136435,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-18T11:30:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have a long experience with rovers.
