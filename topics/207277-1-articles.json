I believe it\u0027d be beneficial and since Kerbal Space Program isn\u0027t a face paced game, obviously, and frankly, forty to fifty frames per second would really be enough, if provided with truly cinematic and lifelike sights to behold and indulge, inspire the player.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s just a suggestion, a fleeting thought I thought I\u0027d share. My two cents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAssuming AMD and NVIDIA come back to their senses, and pull back, before permanently destroying most if not all interest in the PC gaming hobby, and nuking every remotely related industry in the process, that is.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
