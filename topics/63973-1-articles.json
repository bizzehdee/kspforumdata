I made a few changes to my gameplay. First, I decided I would start building my own rockets instead of using other peoples builds from tutorials or forums. Let me tell you it has been very difficult for me to create ships that have enough delta-V to get into orbit and then to the moon and also not have the the rocket start spinning as I try and get into orbit. The rocket spin makes my gravity turns fail miserably time after time, so by the time I do get my apoasis where I want it, I\u0027m ending up with a really messed up orbit if I\u0027m able to achieve it at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second change I made aside from building my own ships, was to start using Kerbal Engineer Redux to make rockets in a smart and efficient manner. So the learning curve has gone up with trying to build my own ships and do them efficiently at the same time. Then add in the fact that I\u0027m trying to use maneuver modes to get into orbit and then plan my burn to the moon. I\u0027m pretty slow at setting up the nodes, so trying to use this for setting up my initial orbit around Kerbin has resulted in many aborted orbit attempts with just returning the capsule to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo did I make it to the Mun? Yes, I finally did. It was getting late, and I was determined to get SOMETHING to the moon. So, I went back to my probe build (someone else\u0027s rocket design) and did my own orbit burns without using maneuver nodes. Whew...okay, orbit around Kerbin achieved again. Then after a few attempts I setup the maneuver node to the Mun and executed my burns (poorly, but successfully).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith much delight I got to transfer into the sphere of influence of the moon, whip around it, then transfer back into Kerbin\u0027s influence and sail safely home. I MADE IT! To the Mun and back without getting into orbit, or landing, but it\u0027s all about baby steps right? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it\u0027s time to spend some more time making my own rockets and try and get these spin and gravity turn issues resolved. It\u0027s okay to use other peoples designs, but my real accomplishment will be when I can build one from scratch and get to the Mun!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-22T17:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I might make a suggestion: Worry less about where your Apoapsis ends up, and worry more about getting your Periapsis above 70km.
