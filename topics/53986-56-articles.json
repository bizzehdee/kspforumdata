Ofcourse, your TAC RO fixes sound very interesting. The only thing I did, that could be a conflict is adding ElectricCharge (batteries). I don\u0027t mind changing these. What I do want though, is for crewed and \u0022active\u0022 parts to require ElectricCharge and from the looks of it, that\u0027s exactly what you\u0027re doing. And also inside lightning needs to consume more EC. How about 250 watts? More? 10x20w luminiscent strip lights per large module running at 80% efficiency seem realistic after looking at a webpage for a manufacturer of industrial lights. But maybe someone knows more about lightning inside the ISS. I couldn\u0027t find anything on NASA or wiki. But from videos inside it looks quite bright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFeel free to PM me, I\u0027d sure like to see what you\u0027ve previously done with FusTek and TAC life support.

Power usage in KSP in general is very low in comparison to RL usage, and the whole thing really needs a complete overhaul I think, more than just a rescale of the storage and generation aspects.

One day of production at that rate would be 1,800-2,400kWh or 6.48-7.78Gj. That\u0027s in Earth orbit, mind you, where solar output is 1.35kW/m2. At half the distance, you get double the power, and at twice the distance, you get 1/4 the power. At Jupiter\u0027s orbit (5.2AU), you get an output less than 4% of what you get in Earth orbit, which is why solar is not practical beyond Mars.\u003Cp\u003EISS currently generates about 84kW - the amount diminishes over time due to UV and micrometeoroid damage. None of these effects are currently directly modeled in KSP, though I seem to recall at least one mod which models the decline in solar power due to distance.
