I have plenty of fuel to get to any one of them that i wish and i figure Duna is the easiest so its where i mostly try to go. I utilize the hohmann transfer very similar to landing of the Mun(which i can do very easily) but my ship never crosses Duna at the same time and i am never grabbed by the planet\u0027s gravity. I just circle around and around for hours(like 20 years in-game time) and never come close enough. Im not capable of doing any of the complex math a lot of you guys use so i just want to know what it is im doing wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goraine","CreatedById":14914,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T15:03:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccuracy is very difficult in solar orbit, because the areas that are within a planet\u0027s sphere of influence are very small compared to the scale that you\u0027re working on. Also, Duna has an eliptical orbit, so standard transfers probabaly won\u0027t work, because you have to know where it is, and where it WILL be.

Then, mark the time that the planet reaches your apsis, add the length of the year to it, and that\u0027s the point of time that you\u0027ll have to be back there at.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor example, say you\u0027re heading to Duna, and you miss, Duna crosses your apoapsis at day 100, and you reach your apoapsis at day 120. Well, Duna has a year of 200.4 days, so it will be back at your apoapsis at day 300.4 Between day 300.4 and the current day (120), it\u0027s 180.4 days. So, you can thrust at your apoapsis, until the round trip time will take 180.4 days, and you and Duna should both arrive back at that point around day 300.4 Although you\u0027ll probably end up having to do some minor corrections anyway to intercept it when you get closer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it would take too much to alter your orbit to get there in time, you can wait a few orbits for more favorable conditions, or set it up to meet back there after 2 years or something like that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve found \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/Celestials\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kspwiki.nexisonline.net/wiki/Celestials\u003C/a\u003E is handy for finding orbital characteristics of planets, if you don\u0027t want to watch them and time them yourself. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-09-22T22:58:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2012 10:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by Soralin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperon4","CreatedById":32236,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T05:15:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI landed safely on Eve today!! =)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt took at least 3 hours to find the right angle for the insertion burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is how i did it atlast. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst i did my burn in LKO at sunrise to reach escape velocity from kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in kerbol orbit i found that -42ish degrees is pretty close. -51 degrees as it says in other guides did NOT work!?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKeep burning retrograde until the orbits touch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen major adjustments to orbit to find the damn SOI and finaly aerobraking in Eve atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy design uses the Kosmos Angara tanks. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond stage is 3 nuclear engines on three 4 meter long angara tanks..
