A capsule of three Kerbonauts were sent to investigate, but their mission was cut short by mysterious malfunctions and apparent mental breakdown of the crew. After Jebediah Kerman, from Kerbin, took the rocket down in a catastrophic landing, two of the Kerbonauts, obviously mentally unstable, disappeared on the surface of the Mun, leaving Tomson Kerman alone.

Bob Kerman, their trusted friend, finds that the KSP, or at the very least high officials inside the KSP, have known about the anomaly for a long time. He reveals that J. Edgar Kerman, actual KSP director, found the artifact himself while orbiting the Mun. After the crew makes a catastrophic landing near the anomaly due to an unknown force making the rocket unstable, Tomson flies his jetpack under the Arch, disappearing in a cloud of smoke.

The sheer amount of information, combined with the mess that was this filing system, if one could call it as such, made the job almost impossible. At breakneck speed he was sending request upon request to the computer... To no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter feigning extreme disinterest in Bill and Jeb\u0027s cause, he had somehow gained J. Edgar\u0027s trust, and was able to move around a little more freely. It hadn\u0027t been very hard: over the course of the past years, after landing on the Mun, Bob\u0027s only interest had been to bury himself in tedial, meaningless work. He had become the perfect bureaucrat, mulling over minute, unimportant details such as what exact number of pens and pencils was optimal for a KSP worker - too few, and they would end up going back for more too often, resulting in a loss of productivity; too many, and they would carelessly leave them lying around, which meant in the end buying way too many pens and pencils. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn truth, his trip to the Mun had deeply affected him. Space is mind-bogglingly big, had written Douglas A. Kerman, and he had been right: Bob\u0027s mind had been totally, impossibly, irreversibly boggled. His ego couldn\u0027t take it; his sense of purpose had been crushed to the point of non-existence. Where Jebediah\u0027s self-worth thrived on the accomplishment, Bob had only found there his own insignificance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe had needed those small, trivial things, because they made him feel huge in comparison. Like he actually mattered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily for the trio though, that meant he had taken a keen interest in the rich history of the Kerbal Space Program, and it looked like the answers to the Mun Arch might be lying not in the present or the future, but in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course all the official, main files from the Odysseus Project had been either deleted, intentionally corrupted, or simply never written at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Gotcha,\u0022 Bob said, pulling up a file on the screen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the Space Center Psychological Help Department was, and had always been, a completely separate entity, prone to clerical errors, neglect, and often plain lunacy. At least for Bob, this was finally paying off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInterview #3765 [Date: ----CENSORED----]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConducted by Dr Ichabod Kerman, upon the return of ----CENSORED---- from PO-000123. See file ----CENSORED---- for additional mission details.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: Hello ----CENSORED----. How are you feeling?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: Like crap. I\u0027m feeling like crap.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: Can you tell me more about the reasons?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: They\u0027re dead. They\u0027re both dead. Do you need another reason?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: Do you feel it is your fault?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: I should have been able to... Do something. Something else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: There were twenty three minutes forty seconds of complete blackout of communication between Odysseus and Kerbin during your trip... Tell me more about those twenty minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: Okay... First off, I know we\u0027re going to blame the engineers or something, because that\u0027s what we do here, but let me tell you Odysseus performed perfectly. Not a single glitch. It was almost boring. We got in a perfectly circular orbit around the Mun to observe the... The anomaly. And then we got closer. And... That\u0027s when it started.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: How did it start?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: Well, ----CENSORED---- started being very agitated, talking about \u0022going there\u0022 and \u0022landing this thing\u0022. Despite the fact that we didn\u0027t actually have landing gear. Despite the fact that we hadn\u0027t been trained to do that at all. You understand that? Soon ----CENSORED---- joined in the frenzy. I had on my hands two perfectly incapacitated Kerbals, and they were getting physically threatening and very, very agressive. ----CENSORED---- started pulling on levers like he had absolutely no idea what he was doing - which, let\u0027s be fair, was probably true, being a geologist after all - , he was shaking and sweating, while ----CENSORED---- was egging him on loudly. In the distance, I could see the anomaly getting closer, and the closer we got, the crazier they\u0027d get. Those weren\u0027t the orders we had received. We couldn\u0027t land this. No one could have landed this, it was an orbiter. This would end in everyone dying. You understand that? Everyone dying, millions of Kerbucks down the drain... A catastrophy for the Program.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: That\u0027s when you decided to...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: I had to think fast, you understand that? So I put on my helmet, strapped myself in and... Oh God...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: Please go ahead.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: I... I only wanted to calm them down. I opened the hatch. Oxygen flew out in a second. I thought they would... come to their senses... But ----CENSORED---- got sucked out immediately, gasping for air. He looked at the Arch, then back at me. He was gone. His eyes were glazed. He was... He activated his jetpack, but he never tried once to get back in Odysseus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: What was he trying to do?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: He was firing up his jetpack towards the anomaly. That\u0027s the last I saw of him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: And what about ----CENSORED---- ?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: He hung on... Uh... He was hanging on to the controls, still making us lose altitude. We were at barely 9000 meters. The rocket was flying all over the place, threatening to crash. I had to... I had to secure the ship. That\u0027s what they train us to do, you understand that? Secure the ship at all costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: So you made him let go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: Yes. I... I looked him straight in the eyes and made him let go. He was struggling. He was hitting me with all he had. I had to... I had to react. So I... I pushed him out. One more second, and the course would have been irreversible. It had to be done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: What did you do after?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: I corrected the course and aborted the mission. With the depressurization, I only had enough oxygen left to go back. Barely made it too... Instruments showed I passed out on re-entry. But I don\u0027t even remember escaping the Mun\u0027s orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: And you yourself didn\u0027t feel any side effects from this trip?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: Yes of course. I\u0027m obsessed with going back. But I know I can\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t... Handle it. The images are burnt in my head. That\u0027s the only thing I can think of.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: Your deceased colleagues?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: No. The Arch. Every time I look up to the sky... I\u0027ve been trying so hard... So hard... Not to think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: You will undergo rehabilitation over the next few weeks. Then, we will let the disciplinary commitee decide.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E----CENSORED----: I need a nap. I need several naps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDR KERMAN: That\u0027s all good. Everything will be alright.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----------------\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERECOMMANDATIONS: ----CENSORED---- seems tired, but rather balanced considering his ordeal. We would recommend him being put under observation and medication for several weeks, but his impeccable control in the line of duty has to be commended. Able to make hard decisions, following rules and regulations, ----CENSORED---- is an exemplary Kerbonaut and upon reflection, we withdraw our previous recommandation to get him on early retirement plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob quickly copied the file, and headed for the door. He gasped as he opened it and stepped out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s a little late for work, Bob. What in Kerbol\u0027s name are you doing in PsyHelp?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe towering, menacing silouhette of J. Edgar Kerman was blocking his way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, I am... I\u0027m concerned with the rocket, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe director raised an eyebrow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So, I was looking up the psychological profiles of Bill and Jebediah Kerman, sir. I\u0027m suspecting they might be unstable, I\u0027m trying to find a way to make them come back, should they ever try to, uh, take matters into their own hands.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJ. Edgar Kerman reflected on this lie for a few moments.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Those psychological evaluations are classified, Bob. What you\u0027re doing is very illegal and I should arrest you immediately.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes I know but...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...However seeing as the situation could easily get dire, the director continued, I will let it slide. Just tell no one you or I were here. And no more... Personal initiative. Are we clear?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob sighed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Go on home now. It\u0027s going to be another long day tomorrow.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yes, sir.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBob walked out of the building, and looked up, not believing his luck. Inches from him had stood the man who had killed two fellow Kerbals. The director could have crushed him here and there, had he been discovered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Mun was shining in the dark sky. Bill and Jeb were up there, and they needed him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe looked over his shoulder, and started sprinting to the control room. He had to let them know. He had to get on the radio now, and tell them to stay away from whatever that thing was.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs he got in the control room, Bob stopped dead in his tracks as a thought hit him. He had been panicking so much that he hadn\u0027t even given it a thought, in the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe didn\u0027t have any business in PsyHelp at this ungodly hour.
