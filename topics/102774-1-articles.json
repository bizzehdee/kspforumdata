And then you notice you forgot the landing gear or something equally silly, or that your design doesn\u0027t work well as a lander or something. You could use hyperedit, but that is not so handy.\n\nSo could we have a space craft simulator in the space center for testing our designs in other situations? One could design a vessel, and then try that out in a simulator. Simulator would have different options to start the vehicle from (From low orbit or surface of any planet). You could use this to test if your design works as a lander and can possibly return to orbit, or see if your SSTO can take off from other planet. Or you could even try to see if the design can do planetary transitions. (for this, you might want date/time setting for the simulator too)\n\nGameplay wise this would create a alternative universe, where there are no other objects but the simulated vessel and planets.\n\nIn addition: \n\n-Time should also not advance much (maybe a bit, but simulators should be able to do the time compression without game time moving faster. \n\n-Actions in simulator would not field any science, and would not fill any mission conditions. I guess EVA should be disabled in this model too. \n\n-Running the simulator should cost a little credits (fixed amount maybe? Or small % of ship cost) in \u0022programming fees\u0022. \n\n-Simulator could have multiple levels as a building, with higher levels locking more distant planets to be used in testing.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Would there be use for something like this? Is there some things I didn\u0027t think of that need addressing? Is my idea explained clearly enough?\n\nFeel free to post comments and questions."},{"CreatedByName":"cicatrix","CreatedById":120831,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T13:08:09Z","Content":"That\u0027s basically what save/load games are for.\n\nThere is also a revert button.\n\nOR you can install HyperEdit.\n\nI don\u0027t think that **adding a simulator within a simulator** serves any purpose."},{"CreatedByName":"pincushionman","CreatedById":98495,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-27T13:42:28Z","Content":"I use Sandbox for this.

It would also make Hard mode games more fun. Some of the game mechanics (especially rep) only really work if you assume no saving/reloading or reverting, but that can also be a real nuisance given the lack of stock design tools.\n\nI don\u0027t mind losing a crew due to a piloting error or losing funds because I mess up a parts test flight and need to repeat it. I do mind losing a crew because my spaceplane undercarriage wasn\u0027t correctly set up to the nearest fraction of a degree, or spending way more on a parts test contract than I\u0027ll get back from completing it because it takes me three attempts to get the design right."},{"CreatedByName":"Lord_Demon","CreatedById":77410,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-30T09:32:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E That\u0027s basically what save/load games are for.\n\u003E There is also a revert button.\n\u003E \n\u003E OR you can install HyperEdit.\n\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t think that **adding a simulator within a simulator** serves any purpose.\n\nI don\u0027t think saves are good for this. If for example I would want to test if a lander can get down on Duna and up to orbit again to meet with main vessel, it would seem pretty silly to create the whole thing and fly it to Duna just to find out that the lander part does not work. Then you have to load your save, resign the lander, then fly again to other planet to test it. And maybe changes added too much mass, so now you can\u0027t even make it to the planet, and you must design your main vehicle again. \n\nSpecially if you are one of those who design stuff on gut instinct, I think it would be a nice option that you could test just one part. It would enable you to build programs in reverse so to speak. \u0022can this lander part get to orbit from the surface of other planet\u0022 -\u003E \u0022what do I have to attach to that part to make a working lander?\u0022 -\u003E \u0022what kind of delivery system do I need to get the lander on orbit?\u0022 \n\nAnd as said, this could be done with Hyperedit. But that will complete any missions and train the Kerbonauts. So I don\u0027t know if that is ideal way to do this. That is why I would like to see a simulator built in. I think it would be pretty easy, as it would simply save your old game, and start a new one with defined parameters (and when that one ends, you would return to your previous game.) From implementation POV it might be quite easy addition (not sure but based on my limited programming experience) so it would not be that much effort to do it.\n\nI guess the same framework could also be used as a scenario editor, allowing people to create scenarios with their own designs, and maybe share them like ships. After all, scenario is only a save file with pre defined situation and description and some parameters for success/failure, isn\u0027t it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Wjolcz","CreatedById":39636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T01:20:17Z","Content":"I like the idea. Though maybe it should be locked in IVA mode only for the simulation and dont have actual terrain of planets but grids or some low-res terrain without any hills. Basically what IRL sims do. They only generate the stuff that are important for the mission. You won\u0027t render the whole planet, buildings and trees If you want to test if something can land on the runway only.\n\nHow I imagine you would roll out a list of options just like when editing a text file on PC and:\n\n\u0022Simulate X (take-off, landing, etc) on planet Y (would simulate gravity and atmo, and show the surface as some sort of grid maybe?) at the speed of Z m/s.\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-31T03:23:13Z","Content":"KCT has this, but honestly, that\u0027s what revert is actually for.

Id like it. Hyperedit wont ever become stock and the simulator can be a goal in on itself. We can start out with an empty simulator and gradually add planets/moons as they are \u0027discovered\u0027 via the space program. If you want to test your Duna Lander then send a probe first to collect readings. How dense is the atmo? How much gravity? The probe doesnt need to survive or return home, just needs to get there and send some science back. Then the challenge of completing the simulator for all space bodies becomes a challenge to complete. \n\nGranted, we could guess at a lot of this info for our own solar system before sending probes but we frequently learn that we got stuff wrong after we sent something to take pictures. A bare bones simulator, start in Duna orbit of 150k, only simulating the qualities that have been returned from previous missions would be very helpful when designing that stage with minimal hassle."},{"CreatedByName":"Sampa","CreatedById":130079,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-02T19:49:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This is going to start sounding like a thread hijack, but here goes:\n\u003E In order to use Sandbox as a \u0022simulator mode,\u0022 we\u0027d need some options added:\n\u003E \n\u003E . 1) ability to freely upgrade/downgrade buildings\n\u003E \n\u003E . 2) ability to upgrade/downgrade Kerbals\u0027 levels\n\u003E \n\u003E . 3) ability to timewarp in forwards **and reverse** (including timewarp 0) to let you set up initial confitions to your liking\n\u003E \n\u003E . 4) ability to import the state of any other save to use as initial conditions (planet positions, building state, hired Kerbals)\n\u003E \n\u003E . 5) ability to import ships from other saves, including those in flight there\n\u003E \n\u003E . 6) \u0022Launch\u0022 becomes \u0022spawn,\u0022 where you choose:\n\u003E \n\u003E . . a) body\n\u003E \n\u003E . . ![B)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png) landed/flight\n\u003E \n\u003E . . . i) if landed, specify lat/long\n\u003E \n\u003E . . . ii) if flight, specify orbital params\n\u003E \n\u003E . .

The initial time, the simulators would be extremely unreliable because the Kerbals have never sent anything out there yet. The more times they send stuff out there, the more reliable the simulators get and thereby, the more reliable the craft we send there! Just my 2 cents on the idea."}]}
