It\u0027s just a multiplication of three numbers, a * b * c. That\u0027s all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne of those numbers is a constant, which you can ignore up until you actually want to do the math. The next one is your engine\u0027s specific impulse (Isp). The remaining number is (the logarithm of) your rocket stage\u0027s mass fraction. The mass fraction, in turn, is the result of a simple division: mass of the stage full of fuel (\u0022wet mass\u0022) divided by the mass of the stage when it\u0027s empty (\u0022dry mass\u0022).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy am I telling you this? Because this is perhaps the single most important insight when it comes to building rocket stages. If you build a rocket stage, usually you already know what engine you want... especially in a vacuum. It\u0027s either going to be a ~350s Isp \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer\u0022\u003ELFO\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E engine, an 800s Isp NTR, or a 4200s Isp ion drive. Since you know Isp ahead of time, it is (mathematically speaking) a constant. As a result, you can simplify things, and just ignore Isp altogether while you build your rocket stage. And by defining as constant two of three numbers that define your \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, you end up in a situation where \u003Cem\u003Eonly a single variable truly controls your final \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. And that is the mass fraction. It is the single most important number of every single rocket stage you ever built, and will ever build.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is the dirty little secret of rocketry. Which normally isn\u0027t dirty at all, but Bob spilled the mystery goo earlier... \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get a nice visualization of this by simply solving a few of those logarithms for certain mass fractions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EExample 1\u003C/u\u003E: Let\u0027s say your rocket stage contains 50% fuel by mass. This means: the mass of the engines plus the mass of the empty tanks plus the mass of structural elements and other assorted greebling \u003Cem\u003Eplus everything sitting on top of this stage, fuel and all\u003C/em\u003E, is ultimately equal to the mass of fuel contained \u003Cem\u003Ein this stage alone\u003C/em\u003E. In this case, your wet mass is exactly twice your dry mass. And it doesn\u0027t matter how heavy your rocket is exactly - a division where the numerator is twice as big as the denominator \u003Cem\u003Ealways\u003C/em\u003E gives the result of 2. Thus your mass fraction is 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTaking the natural logarithm of 2, for which you use a calculator because nobody in their right mind memorizes this stuff nowadays, gives you roughly 0.693. Then you multiply in that one constant we ignored up until now, which is standard gravity at 9.80665. The result of this is about 6.8. Now all you need to finish the rocket equation is to multiply this number with your engine\u0027s Isp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr, in other words: a rocket stage - \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E rocket stage, in fact - with a mass fraction of 2 (where 50% of the total mass is fuel) will have roughly 6.8 times Isp worth of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E.

The first time I truly understood this, I had a small \u0022holy crap\u0022 moment. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:0.0:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_shocked.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:0.0:\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EExample 2\u003C/u\u003E: You do the same math for a rocket stage in which 20% of the total mass is fuel. Independent of your rocket\u0027s actual mass, the mass fraction is always going to end up as 100 / 80 = 1.25. One logarithm and one gravity constant later, you arrive at 2.188. That means, again, that any rocket stage with a mass fraction of 1.25 will have roughly 2.188 times Isp worth of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. If you add a Poodle, it\u0027s 2.188 times 350. If you add a LV-N, it\u0027s\u00A0 2.188 times 800. If you add a Dawn, it\u0027s\u00A0 2.188 times 4200.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EExample 3\u003C/u\u003E: A fun result of this relationship is that every rocket stage has a theoretical maximum amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E which it cannot exceed, no matter how much fuel you add. That maximum is defined by the mass fraction of the fuel tanks themselves. In KSP, even if all parts except fuel tanks were completely massless, every tank** would still add 1 ton of dry mass for every 8 tons of fuel it carries. The mass fraction of a fuel tank is 9 / 1 = 9. One logarithm and one gravity constant later, you arrive at 21.548.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means nothing other than: even if you add fuel tanks equal to the mass of the entire observable universe, your rocket stage will not exceed roughly 21.55 times Isp worth of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. In fact, since engines and structural elements and payload actually have mass, and you don\u0027t have the mass of the entire observable universe at your fingertips, you\u0027re not going to get anywhere near 21.5. You\u0027re not even going to get anywhere near 20, either. Even getting to 15 is probably going to involve significant effort - a mass fraction of greater than 4.6, which means that you need 3.6 times as much fuel by mass in one single stage as the entire rest of the stage (including stuff on top) weighs. By that time, you\u0027re going to get significant diminishing returns from adding more fuel already.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can derive a nice rule of the thumb from this: each rocket stage should probably have an amount of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E that\u0027s a sensible, healthy multiplier of engine Isp. If you look at your rocket and discover that all of your stages have roughly five times engine Isp worth of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, you will instantly know that you\u0027ve been building inefficiently. You could easily add more fuel without suffering much in the way of diminishing returns. On the other hand, if you discover a stage that has as much as 15 times Isp worth of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, you should probably split that into two stages (unless you have a good reason why a single stage must carry that much, such as total recoverability). But if your stages are all somewhere between 7 times and 11 times - roughly mass fractions between 2 and 3 - that looks pretty healthy. You\u0027re getting your money\u0027s worth out of your engines and structural investments without running into serious diminishing returns with your fuel load. Of course, this is disclaimed a bit by \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. KSP\u0027s engines don\u0027t have very much of that, and you may find that a launch stage without room for more engines may not be able to load that much fuel and still get off the ground. But once you are in space, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E becomes much less of an issue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother lesson you can derive from this - and which actually is automatically implemented if you follow the above rule of the thumb - is that all of your rocket stages should probably have similar mass fractions. It makes sense, if you think about it: the dry mass for any given stage includes \u003Cem\u003Eeverything\u003C/em\u003E that is sitting on top of that stage, including upper stages and all of their fuel. This means that if you overload an upper stage, giving it much more fuel than the average for your rocket\u0027s stages, this adds additional dry mass to the stage below it, reducing its mass fraction and therefore its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E - and since that stage is now heavier, that adds additional dry mass to the stage below that, too... and so on and so forth. It\u0027s a chain reaction of reduced mass fractions for every stage below. If there are enough stages below, and you overload an upper stage deep into diminishing returns, you could potentially run into a case where adding fuel \u003Cem\u003Ereduces\u003C/em\u003E the rocket\u0027s total \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E, just because you choke the lower stages that much! The only way to combat this is adding more fuel to each of the lower stages in turn... and suddenly you are back in a situation where every stage has roughly the same mass fraction. It\u0027s a natural equilibrium. Ultimately it makes economic and practical sense for upper stages to be a little heavier loaded than lower ones (remember \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E?), but you should not stray too far.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe one stage you\u0027re allowed to overload freely (funds cost nonwithstanding) is the launch stage, because that one has no stages below it that could be choked. All you have to keep in mind with this one is that your atmospheric (!) \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E mustn\u0027t fall below roughly 1.2. At that point, your rocket would become so slow in lumbering off the pad that gravity losses would eat more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E than you get from adding more fuel. I personally like to go no lower than 1.35, even. And because of the already mentioned low \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of KSP\u0027s engines, this may mean that an overloaded launch stage is a fairly rare thing to encounter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n** All tanks?
