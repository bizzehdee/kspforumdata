However when I started my game up again I found that the entirety of my satellite was gone except for the survey scanner on the end. Oddly enough it was still listed as a satellite and even weirder the camera is still oriented as if the whole ship is still there. I rotate the camera around the center of what used to be the ship while the scanner is off to the edge of the screen. Is there anything I can do to remedy this situation? Is this a known bug?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-17T06:43:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there a claw grasper part anywhere on the craft?

Another thing is that when I view the satellite from the space station and look at its information, it says it has 17 parts. (the correct amount) Of course when I go to the ship I can\u0027t see any of the parts except for the scanner. It doesn\u0027t show me any staging, fuel or electricity.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nedit: I tried the mission again with the same ship. Once I got to the moon again navigation stopped working (couldn\u0027t set flight paths.) I quick saved and loaded the quick save and the same exact thing happened again.
