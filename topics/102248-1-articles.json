I cannot figure out why it has decided to \u0022split\u0022 the mesh into those two parts. I even tried deleting all of my Blender materials but the \u0022mk2vtol\u0022 material keeps importing. I made sure that the mesh is one piece in Blender, and the UV map is all the same so I have no clue what the issue is. The missing material in the slot below is one that I deleted to better show how the mesh has been divided. The only other thing that I can think of is that I appended a mesh from a previous part to use in this one that uses the mk2vtol material, but idk where I would access that if it was stored in a different place.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/3fV5yrCh.png\u0022 alt=\u00223fV5yrCh.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CaptainKipard","CreatedById":70516,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T09:14:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBut did you remove the material references from the object itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Quiznos323","CreatedById":114900,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-19T09:22:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.
