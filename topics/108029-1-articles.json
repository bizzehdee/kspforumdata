Then, you could just hold down the key, and exit your 400m/s turns at maybe 380m/s, not 60.\n\nOf course, I don\u0027t expect it to work perfectly. After all, there\u0027s no accounting for instability or excessive control authority. But considering precision input mode already eases into the strength of the input, there should be time to detect when a stall is just about to start and limit the input magnitude at that point.\n\n*~Yeah you, shook me aaalll fliiight long~*"},{"CreatedByName":"ratchet freak","CreatedById":119895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T10:12:49Z","Content":"Use trim instead\n\nalt\u002Bs will move the pitch control a bit and then keep it there, alt\u002Bx will reset all trim"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:20:02Z","Content":"Alternatively, [use a mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-1-0-x-Pilot-Assistant-Atmospheric-piloting-aids-1-7-0-%28May-7%29) to place an interface between your imprecise input and the output you require."}]}
