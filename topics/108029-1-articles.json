Then, you could just hold down the key, and exit your 400m/s turns at maybe 380m/s, not 60.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, I don\u0027t expect it to work perfectly. After all, there\u0027s no accounting for instability or excessive control authority. But considering precision input mode already eases into the strength of the input, there should be time to detect when a stall is just about to start and limit the input magnitude at that point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E~Yeah you, shook me aaalll fliiight long~\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ratchet freak","CreatedById":119895,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T10:12:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse trim instead\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealt\u002Bs will move the pitch control a bit and then keep it there, alt\u002Bx will reset all trim\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crzyrndm","CreatedById":92871,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-07T11:20:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100073-1-0-x-Pilot-Assistant-Atmospheric-piloting-aids-1-7-0-%28May-7%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Euse a mod\u003C/a\u003E to place an interface between your imprecise input and the output you require.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
