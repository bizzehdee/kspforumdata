The only change is that the mass ratio for a lower stage includes the wet mass of all the stages above it as part of its dry mass (e.g. the stages above act as \u0027payload\u0027). For big rockets it is a lot easier to use Kerbal Engineer, or if you\u0027re feeling nerdy, a spreadsheet with tables of the wet and dry masses of various components.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tortoise","CreatedById":68002,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T07:31:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs TrooperCooper said, theres a hotfix.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-18T08:42:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECalculation by hand is done stage by stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you are completely stock and use no third party calculation tools, you can only ever manually calculate the bottom-most stage in the stack.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETherefore:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) For each engine in this stage, calculcate thrust * Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Sum up all these numbers\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Divide by total thrust of this stage to get average stage Isp\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(4) Put your vessel on the launchpad, go to map mode, click the little \u003Cem\u003Enfo box, note your rocket\u0027s wet mass\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(5) In the VAB, remove all fuel from that stage, then repeat step 4 to get your rocket\u0027s dry mass\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(6) You can now calculate this stage\u0027s dV\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E(7) In the VAB, remove that stage, and return to (1) to calculate the next stage\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
