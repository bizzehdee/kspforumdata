Why not just delete them?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas there been any thought into just doing a total conversion or having mods simply delete parts which they replace. ...or maybe just contain a list of parts that could be deleted after installing the mod, since a mod reaching in and deleting things may be overreaching to some. Would, as a mod, replacing the entire GameData/Squad folder instead of just adding a GameData/Mod folder have unseen repercussions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust a thought since I\u0027ve often used both KW and SP\u002B and find myself ignoring stock parts in the process.

You say you haven\u0027t used Squad parts since SP\u002B but in 0.25 SP\u002B parts will be Squad parts. The old wings and control surfaces won\u0027t be there anymore in 0.26 and the Mk1 and Mk3 parts are getting an overhaul by then (Mk1 in 0.25, Mk3 in 0.26).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are no repercussions. You can safely delete ALL the Squad parts if you like. I once did it accidentally and the game loaded, couldn\u0027t do much since there were no parts in the VAB, but the game ran just fine (it loaded really fast)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I wouldn\u0027t waste a lot of time until at least 0.25. In 0.25, the old parts will still be there but they are going to be marked Deprecated because they will go away in 0.26. You can of course delete them immediately if you wish. The Spaceplane Plus parts will replace them along with the newly rebuilt mark 1 parts.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-29T16:00:04Z\u0022 title=\u002209/29/2014 04:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 29, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T19:10:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Alshain\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Alshain\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThere are no repercussions.
