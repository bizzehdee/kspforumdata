I once replaced the LV-N with a Xenon engine. It probably would have made it, it even got into solar orbit before I had to switch to the Xenon, but then it said it would take, like, a week or something to get the orbit out to Jool.

That\u0027s how I got a stable orbit of it in my ribbons. I got caught by Vall a few times. I hoped it would send me on a collision course with Jool, but nope.
