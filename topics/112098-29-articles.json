The small maneuvering engines don\u0027t have enough fuel to slow the craft enough for this kind of trajectory, but I try it anyway because I\u0027m not willing to trust Duna\u0027s sparse atmosphere unless I\u0027m absolutely sure to hit the ground. (seriously, I usually start the lander in an orbit of about 60km, which only allows me 10x time warp. if I were to fail to land and had to come around again, [the wait time would be excruciating](https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/skeleton-computer-guy.jpg)\n\u003E \n\nI understand the part count issue.

You will have to set it at round 50,000 to go round twice dude. Even for an interplanetary aerobrake, which you should try at some point as it will differ somewhat from a testing hyper edited orbits. I use it too, I know what a godsend it is but the first lander, the cargo lander to arrive at Duna aerobrakes at interplanetary speeds.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-21T21:15:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2016 09:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Majorjim**"},{"CreatedByName":"pTrevTrevs","CreatedById":131541,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-21T21:22:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, Majorjim said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I know Duna EDL very well and a \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E of 30,000 will drop you in EVERY time.\n\u003E \n\nDo you know anything about pinpoint landings?

It may have been updated but the new aero broke it I think. \n\n For normal orbits you just need to make sure you are burning at the same point and for the same duration as the landed target vehicle. Even with the trajectories mod and with the lack of guidance computers it is very tricky. \n\n For a constellation mission it is doubly so as the first lander aerobrakes at interplanetary speed and the second from a stable orbit. \n\n---------------------------------\n\nLooking good [@Mad Rocket Scientist](%7B___base_url___%7D/index.php?/profile/139256-mad-rocket-scientist/) but why a white tank for it? Also, one honest criticism, the fairing could be cleaned up a little with the rotation tool.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-21T22:11:33Z\u0022 title=\u002206/21/2016 10:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 21, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Majorjim**"}]}
