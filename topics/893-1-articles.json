It does have a lot of flaws but it has tremendous lifting power.

I tried to make it as realistic as possible. Since its a huge solid booster, i made it sensitive to collisions, made it over heat like hell, and heavy and bulky. I am in no means a professional engineer in rockets technology, so if some one has tips to improve upon it, please, leave a comment. Also, it will overheat over nothing, so i recommend using Killerhurtz\u0027s Passive Radiator which can be found here: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=663.0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=663.0\u003C/a\u003E .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeavy, Bulky\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverheat\u0027s even on a good day\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERusty\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOld \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esmelly\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EExtremely Sensitive (It has feelings ya know)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBad fuel consumption\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPros:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust!
