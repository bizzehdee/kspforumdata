I am a KSP YouTuber and Streamer, and for my next video I will need a green screen in numerous scenes my film, but there isn\u0027t a mod for one yet. I\u0027m planning on basing it off of Cowboy Bebop if you are familiar with the show.\n\nI would love it if a mod maker could wip me up a GIGANTIC green screen. I think it *should* be easy to do.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T23:45:59Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Avera9eJoe**"},{"CreatedByName":"tygoo7","CreatedById":57345,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T23:42:37Z","Content":"I could make you one.
