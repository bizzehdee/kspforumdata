If i use a standard nosecone I am usually just able to get my aircraft to 1300-1400 m/s on RAPIERs, but with a fairing in front the cockpit seems much more heat resistant.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan style=\u0022line-height:1.6;\u0022\u003EIf I use a very small Fairing nosecone? a face-melting 1550 m/s at 10k, or 1625 at 20k (sadly much faster is impossible as even RAPIERs lose thrust at such high speeds).

Everything big I\u0027ve launched recently used fairings anyway, though I did discover that my primary cargo lifter \u002B 40 tonne payload has some issues. I find that the overheat warning for the fairing likes to activate about 5 seconds before you explode, 10 if you\u0027re lucky, which usually isn\u0027t enough time to recover, even if you cut throttle instantly. Heavier/bigger payloads keep that particular rockets speed in check so that it never blows the fairing on ascent (apparently, accelerating past \u0022white hot\u0022 is bad).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Enorats","CreatedById":141841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-10T22:57:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKER let you see all sorts of thermal info.
