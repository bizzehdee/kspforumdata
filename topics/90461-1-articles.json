That being said I\u0027m obviously a pretty big KSP fan and have always wanted to make a KSP film. This isn\u0027t what I\u0027d call a \u0027professional\u0027 video by me, but really just a bit of fooling around to see what my limits were within the game. The video itself came out pretty well and I think the next video I put together will really shine!

The fluidity of the non-KSP sections is great. Very well matched. Nice balance in the scenes and camerawork. One suggestion might be to put something just before when the engine malfunctions. First time I saw it I wasn\u0027t sure whether the Kerbal was left floating in space or not. I gather he\u0027s supposed to be in the cockpit, but the scene just before just shows him on backpack RCS. I suggest just a pic of him grabbing the door, or perhaps a scene inside the cockpit first.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spinomonkey","CreatedById":102142,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-17T03:28:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks guys!
