Drivers seem to follow the rules of the road (most of the time, anyway), but cyclists are all over the place. At times they occupy the road along with cars and should be subject to the same rules, at others they seem to follow the rules for pedestrians, whichever is more convenient at the time. It makes it very difficult for motorists to predict how a cyclist will behave and act accordingly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have nothing against cyclists, but there needs to be defined rules for them to follow and penalties for not following them, just like everyone else on the road.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jmiki8","CreatedById":94688,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T18:05:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u002B1 to Red Iron Crown\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m sad to say (I\u0027m a cyclist too), but here in Hungary the majority of cyclists are very rude, and don\u0027t obey even the most basic rules, like stopping at the red light, and giving way to the right. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy \u0022favourite\u0022 kind of such people are the ones who ride at like \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A12 km/h in a way you can\u0027t pass them in the narrow bicycle lane.

Also, they are very unpredictable. They change lanes so rapidly that even the most careful drivers have no chances of avoiding an accident.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere in Budapest the number of cyclists are rapidly increasing. There are many of them who haven\u0027t brought their bike out from the garage for years, and aren\u0027t adapted to riding on the city\u0027s roads. Police is very tolerant with them. This is not the case with drivers. I think this is very unfair. Forcing cyclists to follow the rules would be good for everybody.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, there are a lot of disrespectful motorists who use their 1-2 tons of steel to frighten the cyclists, or are simply not careful enough. I have been riding the bike to everywhere (instead of mass transit) for 3 years, but I haven\u0027t caused any accident, damage to property or injuries (for others or myself), even if I meet rude drivers and cyclists everyday. The most important thing is to be careful, and learn to handle these careless guys safely, because they will always exist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-22T18:09:01Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2014 06:09  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by jmiki8\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EdFred","CreatedById":108599,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T18:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI also cycle, and there are times when I want to clip some of the idiot cyclists with my mirror, because they give the rest of us a bad name.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-22T18:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t cycle, but I often see moronic cyclists going through a red light at a pedestrian crossing.
