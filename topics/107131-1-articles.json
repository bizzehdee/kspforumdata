Just recently found this game and have only really started playing it the past couple of days. It\u0027s certainly a steep learning curve and coming on here the amount of info and the things you can do is a bit overwhelming when you see it all for the first time. Decided I would just start grinding away in career mode without too much playing in sandbox. Currently trying to get into orbit (I understand the theory and can get a nice circular orbit in sandbox), but I can\u0027t quite get there without running out of fuel. I can get a nice Ap, but when I get to the burn to raise the Pe I have to stop as I wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back. I think I\u0027m being limited by the weight limit rather than parts. I\u0027ve upgraded the VAB and unlocked the first 5 bits of the tech tree. Do I need to upgrade the launch pad for the weight limit to increase? Just making my way through some contracts now.\n\nCan you guys some mods for me. Not looking for anything too \u0022cheaty\u0022, just some cool parts or info displays/panels etc to help with the game. Are there any other general recommendations for this game? What sort of things can I be doing while not in career mode? There is so much possibility it\u0027s hard to know what to do/try first.\n\nAnyway, this was a bit of a ramble. Thanks for reading and I hope I can really get into this game like a lot of you guys.\n\nDW ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Commander Jebidiah","CreatedById":78685,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:52:30Z","Content":"Welcome, you\u0027ll love it here but you can\u0027t escape ksp!\n\nTo increase mass limit you have to upgrade the pad.\n\nAh mods, i suggest that you stay away from part of as they can be overwhelming.\n\nfor aesthetics - environmental visual enhancements, texture replacer\n\nFor vessel info - mechjeb, kerbal engineer, VOID.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-03T11:54:35Z\u0022 title=\u002205/03/2015 11:54  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Commander Jebidiah**"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:17:36Z","Content":"Welcome to the forums, DopeyWomble! Good to have you aboard.\n\nCareer mode is a good way to introduce yourself to the concepts and the parts you have to work with. There is endless possibility in this game.\n\nAfter you look around the forums a bit, you might be amazed at what people build.\n\nHappy landings!"}]}
