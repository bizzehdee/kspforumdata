I had very little fuel left when I landed, but it was great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo since then, I\u0027ve been trying to build a craft that will go from Kerbin to the Mun and back, but found it to be very hard fuel-wise. I wanted 3 Kerbals to fly to the Mun to get the flag-planting experience, so I used the 3-person pod, with a 1440 unit fuel tank and poodle engine as the lander. I couldn\u0027t get this to work. I could only land on the Mun, then would be left sitting there with no fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I designed a tanker to get out to the Mun and orbit it. Then I flew my 3 Kerbals out there and docked with the tanker. I had never docked before, but it went very well! It was lots of fun and a bit easier than I thought it would be. I topped off my lander with liquid fuel and RCS. I thought surely this would be enough to get me down to the surface then back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, I got down to the surface and landed with 544 fuel left. LOL Where did it all go? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did a quicksave and proceeded to do all the science experiments and Bob Kerman was the first one out to plant his flag. Then I tried to get him back into the rocket. He RCS\u0027d up under the ladder and morphed through the Service Bay doors and got stuck in the Bay. I could not get him out to save his life. He was stuck in there with a smile on his face. I wasn\u0027t really comfortable with this, so I quick loaded.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter playing around, discovering that Kerbals can slide for miles on the Mun\u0027s surface, I loaded everyone in and lifted off.

I had to orbit 5 or 6 times to finally stay within Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and was then able to splash down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was a great mission. I got 844 science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI realize this was not the most efficient way to do this mission.
