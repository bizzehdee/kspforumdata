The most interesting part about it uses a JumpDrive to jump into orbit, or other plant orbit depending where you insert your Jump Beacon. It allows me to get this massive cruiser off Kerbin and jump after 1000 meters from liftoff without having to refuel it in orbit for days. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you like it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/lMg1mUZ.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022lMg1mUZ.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/AQoxjvf.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022AQoxjvf.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/SughMW3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022SughMW3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heartstrings","CreatedById":134318,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-04T20:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELooks absolutely amazing.
