To do this you wait until your ship is almost to the point where the X crosses. If the orbit you\u0027re trying to match is below your orbit from that point, you\u0027ll need to point towards 0 degrees (north) to lower your orbit to match theirs. If the orbit is above yours, you need to point towards 180 degrees (south) to raise your orbit to match theirs. Burning at this point requires the least fuel, and if you do it from the map its very easy to see when you match up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the most part you will do most of your burns on the equator of the navball. this is the line where brown meets blue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a great thread in the how to section on the rest of the mechanics for orbital rendezvous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
