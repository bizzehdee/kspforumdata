Some shenanigans happened with the orbits and despite getting a good slingshot, I had a tenuous Kerbin orbit... with a period of 1.02 years. I didn\u0027t even think this was possible. I didn\u0027t screenshot it, but I swear my word is true. Is this an error or is this really possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor that matter, I\u0027d love to see what your largest orbits are of any kind, with the highest apoapsis value \u003Cstrong\u003Ethat aren\u0027t escaping Kerbol\u003C/strong\u003E.

You can see the four Joolian probes that never were deployed: this was back with the rotating reference frame PE bug in 0.18.4, so I gave up and let the slingshot do what it would.
