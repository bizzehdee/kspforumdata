The liquid fuel is used as propellant in the Vista engine. Reactors do not need propellant.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfaik, most current efforts center around a principle pretty much identical to the Vista. Laser a small mass of deuterium/tritium, and use it to ignite regular hydrogen into a sustained plasma state by compressing it with magnetic fields. Burning straight deuterium/tritium for power is wholly impractical. It\u0027s just not a big enough bang for as little as can be reasonably used.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t currently know of any reactor efforts which are D/T only. I could be wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReally though, even an AM reactor would just be little bits of AM that are used to ignite magnetically compressed hydrogen to get it to a usable plasma state without having to use a bunch of power for massive lasers too. Otherwise, an AM reactor wouldn\u0027t produce much (currently) usable energy at all. It\u0027d generate a lot of thermal potential, but not all that much more than most nuclear reactors, and that would be only a tiny fraction of its power...the rest would be wasted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we really want to get the most out of any such reactors, we\u0027ll have to develop materials that, in concert, are capable of interacting with the radiation from the reaction the same way solar panels convert visible wavelength photons into electricity. In the meantime, our only options are to use as much of the energy to generate as much heat as possible to use over the broadest system to get the most mechanical/electrical potential out of it. Or, to pass the plasma through networks of coils to generate electrical fields as it passes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFortunately, there are already materials under research that will be capable of directly converting thermal energy into electrical energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat...may have come across as patronizing or condescending.

Some inspiration, food for thought. Not that you seemed bored and in need of new part ideas but here it is anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start, put the thermal jet engine in your brain. Runs off nuke as the heat source for the typical \u0022combustion\u0022 stage. right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Enow:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/BGRPksU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022BGRPksU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a combined jet engine and generator. The performance is basically that of a jet, but if the generator loads it down then thrust will drop. On the other hand, it can generate a fair amount of juice this way. It only functions if there\u0027s atmosphere, but does not require any fuel other than the reactor. As a generator, it should be lightweight and efficient compared to the one\u0027s we\u0027re used to in this mod (But it only works in atmosphere).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/t32KgvU.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022t32KgvU.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a side-mount concept featuring two of those offset jet generator things into an integrated reactor. Basically a one-stop shop to make something move in the atmosphere. It\u0027s by itself here so no scale, but I imagine a small one would have a probe with small wings cruising nicely or make a rockin KAS jetpack. Or just a really convenient generator. Normal size would be similar thrust to a single turbojet and capable of jamming out a few MJ if needed. Maybe half actually.. Very modest, but also very lightweight. Ideal for a scout type plane setup where you aren\u0027t looking to charge an FTL jump or anything. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/yMl6bR1.jpg?1\u0022 alt=\u0022yMl6bR1.jpg?1\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Esimilar concept, this is a larger inline style shown with Mk 1 cockpit and sandwiched between 2 fuel tanks. Not that it needs fuel but this layout kinda makes a hole for something to go there. The scale I drew is also kinda big, that thing would haul ass. Probly oversized.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could perhaps be a large sidemount meant to stick onto existing reactor part. Again, mostly redundant to the existing thermal jet but contains generator. as a non-integrated setup it seems maybe too redundant? Nice to have side-mount option at least.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
