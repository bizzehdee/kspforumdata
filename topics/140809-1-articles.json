In most cases it takes very high temperatures to reach a reasonable ISP. If we argue that IR has a gas temperature of about 2500K thats a rather puny ISP.\u00A0 If you really want to get the ISP up you have to convert the heat to electricity, in which case you lose half of the energy, at least, in order to create a gradient, presumbably with space. With the remaining half you create a low voltage wavefunction, then transform it into a high voltage wave function, whose waste heat you could scavenge. From there you have to use a rectifyer to create a high voltage, you also need a UV light/X ray ion generator. At which point you ionize particles then place the cations in a electric field and accelerate them to 10000s of m/s. This is how a fission reactor based ion drive system works. You can use sunlight as a source of heat, but again it has a maximum ISP because of the average \u0027temperature\u0027 of light coming from the sun. You can grab some of this with solar panels and use this to run transformers that run the ion drive systems. A third, rather messy option is to take antimatter and matter, let them react, and then convert the high energy photons into lower energy photons using a number of high energy gamma absorbers, this will tend to create alot of nuclear byproducts, which in turn will heat up and produce things like neutrons, etc, and eventually you have heat and a very trashed up reactor lining.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMore sophisticated versions of heat generation are fusion reactors (although technically once it gets going it may actually produce more light and x-rays than heat).
