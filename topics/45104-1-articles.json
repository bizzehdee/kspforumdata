They are broad spectrum, capable of seeing a massive spectrum of light, but record only the magnitude, not the color, and instead take pictures through filters allowing only specific wavelengths to pass (and the single images are usually displayed in black and white). To get an image like the one we might see, they have to use 3 filters on 3 different shots that correspond to the colors our eyes are sensitive to, and then combine them.
