There were several other deviations from the main theme as well; I\u0027m not sure how intentional or needed they were.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 The scoring seemed a little weird. In the game\u0027s theme, the score remained relatively triumphant, with very little dissonance. In your scoring, there were a bunch of instruments playing in the background that clashed a little. The clashing seemed to happen at the end of phrases, which is a real no-no. (You generally want the music to \u0027resolve\u0027 by the end of a phrase.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 C\u0027mon!
