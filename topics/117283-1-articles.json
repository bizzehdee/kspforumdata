It would help *so much!*) \n\nInstead of playing a minor seventh chord, though, you just played an octave. Now, that\u0027s not a bad thing necessarily, and [I\u0027ve done it before too.](https://youtu.be/Fuz-iKfnU8M) It can detract from the music though, and it\u0027s a significant deviation from the original score. There were several other deviations from the main theme as well; I\u0027m not sure how intentional or needed they were.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 The scoring seemed a little weird. In the game\u0027s theme, the score remained relatively triumphant, with very little dissonance. In your scoring, there were a bunch of instruments playing in the background that clashed a little. The clashing seemed to happen at the end of phrases, which is a real no-no. (You generally want the music to \u0027resolve\u0027 by the end of a phrase.)\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2 C\u0027mon! If you claim to make the KSP theme in Garageband, you\u0027d *better* finish the thing. Seventeen seconds\u0027 worth of music doth not a theme make, to misquote the Bible. Keep at it, my friend!\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"kenbobo","CreatedById":70629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T01:57:11Z","Content":"Hey upsilon- look up Finale Notepad 2003- it\u0027s a little bit old but it still works\n\nI did this in 10 minutes in a car ride.\n\nPhones battery is almost dead- peace"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-31T03:22:33Z","Content":"This work of a fan has been moved to Fan Works."}]}
