Pointing at Kerbin wouldn\u0027t work with the standard range system.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, I would suggest to make a check with any Command station or communications relay in low orbit around a designated body, such as Kerbin. No other station allowed to establish a failsafe reconnection than the above. These failsafe checks to be conducted only when required (such as with the probe focused) or, if feasible, a random check may bo done every fixed amount of gametime to better simulate what would happen in reality, and the result of the check more successful the shorter the distance from the base station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that is feasible and not too heavy in terms of processing power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome longer ideas about the above.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIMO, a failsafe program IRL would scan the ether to find any valid signal. Will take time if the signal is faint, almost lost in the spectral background noise from stars and cosmic rays. But such noise changes with time (like e.g. Sun activity) so there\u0027s no telling (for a probe) when a signal will be heard again. They keep scanning until there is power. Thinking deepspace probes, as the Pioneer ones. Anyway, such deepspace probes maintain some knowledge of their position IRT planet Earth, so they don\u0027t have to re-orient the main dish and scan a larger area. Not having to re-orient, saves power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if the standard range system would be a limit, I believe that having the probes pointing at Kerbin in failsafe mode is key to a realistic approach. However, with Kerbin I would not limit to KSC, but any Command station on the planet and communication relay orbiting in LKO (at least). I reckon that the angle at which a LKO orbit is seen from deepspace is small enough to be considered almost a point, for this purpose, so a dish on a distant probe would be aimed so to have optimal gain with any signal from LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, somebody may develop a huge communication infrastructure on other planets, then relieving Kerbin from this \u0022central role\u0022. One suggestion here: to define a planet/moon as the communications hub in one of the config files (default Kerbin), and let a player change it. Any \u0022lost\u0022 probe should always try to connect with the designed hub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: given the many who like to play without failsafe mode, the mod may simply consider a \u0022null\u0022 value for the communication hub in the config as a failsafe switch off.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-21T23:23:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2013 11:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by diomedea\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Andon","CreatedById":21251,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-21T23:13:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eif you copy the config from the older version over to the new version, you can get rid of the time delay.

This is essentially as far as a failsafe goes for real satellites.\u003Cp\u003EHaving said all this, RemoteTech for the most part already does this. Only thing I would change is the EVA thing. If you really wanted more realism you could make the satellite take longer to reconnect the longer it goes into blackout.
