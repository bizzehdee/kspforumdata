Even minor incidents lead to changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe list of changes made to aircraft and adjustments to designs in future builds is too long to list, but for instance: a Boeing 777 crashes (with no fatalities) on runway approach due to ice crystals in a heat-exchanger in the fuel lines of the Rolls-Royce Trent 895 engines. The heat-exchanger was redesigned and existing aircraft with that engine are retrofitted with the new design, and new Trent 895 engines are built with the upgrade. In the meantime, even before the cause was fully understood, operating procedures were put in place to reduce the chances of ice causing blockages. Boeing were also required to redesign the undercarriage attachment, because during that crash one of the fuel tanks was damaged when the undercarriage collapsed. Furthermore, air investigators spent months examining other engine designs to be sure a similar fault could occur.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EManufacturers worldwide compile enormous manuals of \u0022how not to build aircraft\u0022 that are kept in mind when new designs are being built.

They do make changes to cockpit design to try to reduce error, but ultimately nothing can make a job as complex as piloting an airliner error-free, because what keeps one pilot from making an error increases the chances that a different pilot will get something else wrong. This is why, even now, most air incidents are due to pilots making mistakes. (Let\u0027s not get started on airlines overworking pilots and employing under-experienced pilots!
