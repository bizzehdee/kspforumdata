I\u0027m trying to land on Eve; I\u0027ve done it a couple times but in both cases it was mostly luck. I use the big deployable ADEPT heatshield (after messing with the config file so it doesn\u0027t explode), but I haven\u0027t been able to keep things oriented properly. The center of mass is very low and the deployed heatshield is wider than the lander, but I think it\u0027s just too tall to want to be stable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI might try airbrakes if that seems workable, and have also thought about figuring out how to stick another big deployable heatshield on the opposite end. For the sake of general discussion, what\u0027s the best way to handle atmospheric entry of an inherently unstable spacecraft?\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey might, but it has an emissiveConstant of 0.95 so short of ablative shielding, they\u0027re pretty well protected.
