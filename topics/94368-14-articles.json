The file is cleared each time you restart the game, so you\u0027ll have to start, go in map view, then exit (alt-f4 for example), and check if there is any hint in the file.

You can also predict what kind of maneuver you can do with an aerobrake by putting a node at Jool\u0027s Pe to simulate a retrograde burn, which is usually the same as an aerobrake, and see if the new orbit can intercept your target. As atomicfury pointed out, because Jool has such a big gravity well, you are likely to go very fast near Jool, so beware the heat...
