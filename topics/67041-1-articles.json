This is because these heavy elements have the annoying tendency to \u0022follow their weight\u0022 and simply sink deep into the Earth\u0027s core instead of staying near the surface where we can conveniently grab them.

That\u0027s why there\u0027s so freaking much of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for crashing the market though - remember that sometimes, breaking something old makes way for something new. Planetary Resources likes to pull the Aluminium comparison. Back in Napoleon\u0027s times, nobody had any idea how to efficiently extract Aluminium, and thus it was so rare that nobles would serve only their most honored guests from plates of Aluminium - instead of gold, which was considered the lesser metal. Then new techniques were discovered, and the Aluminium value crashed through the floor. And yet, only because Aluminium suddenly was so cheap, we discovered that it had a myriad of uses. It\u0027s ultra-light yet strong, forms useful alloys and is 100% recycleable (which by far not all metals are) with minimum effort. Today, it\u0027s unthinkable for our society to exist without Aluminium everywhere. Aircraft, cars, construction, handheld devices and electronics... you name it, it\u0027s there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what then will happen if the price of platinum group metals crashes through the floor?

Convince investors to put forth the value of just \u003Cem\u003Eone\u003C/em\u003E offshore oil rig towards asteroid mining instead, and you have capital for the entire venture.
