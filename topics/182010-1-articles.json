Legendary pilot that she is,\u00A0Valentina was able to safely re-enter her historically significant, record-setting command/service module \u0022Jeb\u0022 under power, but it required every resource she had, and left her\u00A0and the now wide awake Bill bobbing in the Drink, totally helpless, and miles from shore.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn light of this emergency, your mission, fellow Kerbonauts, is to \u003Cstrong\u003ERescue Valentina, Bill, and Their Historic Ship from the Eve Ocean and return them to Kerbin!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe debate in Mission Control on how to accomplish this was lively, and unfortunately no consensus on the best approach was reached. Some argued that getting the rescue accomplished ASAP was the highest priority, while others reasoned that Valentina and Bill still had plenty of snacks according to the ship manifest, and moreover that since they had just blown the most incredible amount of funds jettisoning their massive Eve lifter,\u00A0 their rescue should cost as little as possible. In the end, Werner couldn\u0027t really make up his mind either, so he decided to fund both projects...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003ESo!\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile your mission in either case is to return both ship and occupants\u00A0to Kerbin, there are two ways to play:\u00A0You can get it done either as \u003Cstrong\u003Equickly\u003C/strong\u003E or as \u003Cstrong\u003Echeaply\u003C/strong\u003E as possible. For the \u0022quickly\u0022 challenge, money/mass is no object and you just need to do it in the shortest time possible, from launch to recovery on Kerbin. For the \u0022cheaply\u0022 challenge, there are \u003Cs\u003Etwo\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0three sub-categories: \u003Cstrong\u003Elowest launch cost, lowest total cost,\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Elowest launch weight\u003C/strong\u003E.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe rules:\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is required: \u003C/strong\u003EYou must return both the stranded Kerbals (alive), as well as\u00A0their ship (in one piece, without staging, burning, or breaking anything off) from some location at least 10km offshore in any of the major seas of Eve to the ground on Kerbin. The ship to be rescued must include a MK3 capsule and two Large Ore Holding Tanks, and have a dry weight of at least 10 tons and a total weight at the time of rescue of not more than 20 tons. The cost of this vessel will not be charged against your overall mission cost. Pretty much anything within those constraints is allowed, with the proviso that it \u003Cstrong\u003Emust not have any resources on board that are consumables for control or locomotion, nor can it have the intrinsic capability to create those without docking to another craft. \u003C/strong\u003EThat means\u00A0all on-board fuel/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks must be empty, and all reaction wheels must be either deactivated or without power.\u00A0You may furthermore not have any solar panels, RTGs, or ore converters on board the vessel to be rescued. Having said that, you may place ore in the tanks of the vessel to be rescued, but any ore that you actually convert\u00A0after docking to the rescue craft cannot be counted as part of the \u0022dry\u0022 weight of the craft to be rescued. The point here is that the rescue craft must actually bring the capability with it to create these resources, and that no matter what you start with,\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Eyou must lift to orbit and deliver to Kerbin a craft that weighs\u00A0at least 10 tons during all phases of this process.\u00A0\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAs long as you obey that rule, you may actually use unconverted ore purely as ballast.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is not allowed:\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EFor me, the goal of this challenge is to elicit the broadest variety of competitive solutions possible, so the rules are pretty loose. However, having said that \u003Cstrong\u003Eplease don\u0027t cheat\u003C/strong\u003E. I define cheating as anything that violates the intended physics of Stock KSP.\u00A0 This obviously includes\u00A0exploiting any and all clear bugs in the vein of Infiniglide,\u00A0Ladder Drive,\u00A0 Kraken Drive, etc. This also includes non-Stock parts that violate the basic Stock parameters in terms of mass, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E, etc, as well as any part clipping into non-hollow structures\u00A0that significantly cheats the drag model.\u00A0 That is, you can clip batteries, reaction wheels, etc. into hollow adapters and nosecones, so long as they are not clipped into each other, but not into fuel tanks or other non-hollow parts, nor can you clip non-hollow parts into each other.\u00A0If you want to clip backwards intakes into engines to reduce back-end drag, I guess that\u0027s OK with me.\u00A0 As to Alt-F12/Hyperedit, that is totally OK for testing, but for submission I expect all key phases to be fully flown and/or driven by the submitter and duly documented. \u00A0That\u00A0means that using MechJeb, etc. to fly the hard parts for you is\u00A0expressly forbidden. Having said that, if your mission depends on some repetitive resource extraction/conversion/refueling process that would take an eternity to execute\u00A0by hand, you may demonstrate just the first\u00A0cycle of that explicitly and then refuel your craft fully using Hyperedit, etc. Lastly, ore extraction/processing can only be carried out by any particular launch package \u003Cstrong\u003Eafter it reaches \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EWhat is allowed:\u00A0 \u003C/strong\u003EYou can place the vessel to be rescued any way you want, so long as it is floating at least 10 km offshore.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EAny and all\u00A0purely informational mods such as \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E are also fine. You may use any strategy within the constraints spelled out above to get the mission accomplished. This includes all sorts of detachable rovers/ships, reaction wheel-powered copters/ships, etc. Any way you can transport the vessel to be rescued back to Kerbin in one piece is OK,\u00A0 provided it does not violate Stock physics. You may use whatever engines/tanks/wheels/etc are present on your rescued module to get back home,\u00A0provided that all the consumables required are brought/created by the rescue craft.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Categories\u003C/strong\u003E:\u00A0 At this point, I am scoring four categories:\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ELowest Launch Cost:\u003C/strong\u003E The lowest cost on the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E indicator right before you launch, combined for all the separate modules you may launch. \u003Cstrong\u003ELowest Total Cost:\u003C/strong\u003E the lowest total net expenditure of funds, meaning that whatever parts and/or resources you may recover on Kerbin at the end can be deducted from your total launch cost as defined in the previous section.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003ELowest Launch Weight:\u003C/strong\u003E Smallest combined mass of all modules launched from Kerbin, at the time of launch. \u003Cstrong\u003EFastest Rescue:\u003C/strong\u003E The shortest time elapsed from the first Kerbin launch to touchdown of the rescued craft on Kerbin, regardless of any other parameter.

You may make your craft out of whatever parts you want excluding solar panels, ore converters, and RTGs, provided it includes the three required ones and is empty of all fuel/monoprop/xenon,\u00A0 and has either no electrical charge or all reaction wheels disabled. That is, it must be completely dead in the water at the time of rescue. If you can successfully dock your rescue ship to it while it is in that state, you may refuel it with whatever resources you brought with you, and then have it do whatever it is capable of doing under its own power thereafter, including processing whatever ore it may have had on board at the time of rescue, although I am going to update the rules at the top to clarify that\u00A0\u00A0the\u003Cstrong\u003E total \u003C/strong\u003Eweight of the craft on rescue must be between 10 and 20 tons rather than the dry weight, so that Valentina\u0027s historic pod is not reduced to a fuel barge. The upper weight\u00A0limit is also there to insure that cheeky contestants don\u0027t trivialize the cost/parts challenges by dropping\u00A0an entire unfueled Eve lifter into the water for free and then just tagging it with\u00A0a token rescue ship.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, definitely included in all that is ultimately using the rescued craft as an upper stage/Kerbin re-entry vehicle, \u003Cstrong\u003Eprovided you don\u0027t stage/break/explode anything off of it in the process.\u00A0\u003C/strong\u003EThat is, it must make it back to the ground on Kerbin in one piece, as found on rescue, regardless of whether that is in a cargo bay or under its own power.

You are right that there is a bit of ambiguity/loopholes here, so I tried to clarify it at the top. I changed to \u0022a dry wight of no less than 10 tons\u0022 so that people must deal with returning\u00A0at least that much\u00A0mass back to Kerbin, and a \u0022total wight of no more than 20 tons\u0022 so that people can\u0027t drop entire lifters in the drink or make their craft into an ore barge. IOW, ore may be part of the \u003Cstrong\u003Etotal\u003C/strong\u003E weight but not\u00A0 the \u003Cstrong\u003Edry\u003C/strong\u003E weight.* So the bottom line is you can have up to 10 tons of ore aboard that you may convert to fuel upon rescue, or else you can use that weight to add fuel tanks to your vessel that you may later fill using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E at some other site.\u00A0 I hope I get to see which strategy will prove more economical!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2.

After refueling on Minmus, the two craft make their way to Eve. The transfer from low Minmus orbit to an Eve intercept is very efficient and costs only 380m/s. I achieved thy by going into an elliptical Kerbin orbit first and then burning at Kerbin-Periapsis. This\u00A0also includes a ~50m/s normal burn after leaving Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E to make sure the descending node is at the place of the Eve encounter. By saving the fuel, I have enough fuel to capture and circularize at Eve using retro burning. I also have enough fuel left for the deorbiting.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI land Hydra and Hermes on the highest mountain of Eve. There Hermes undocks and flies down to the historic craft. The remaining fuel is enough for both Hermes and the historic craft to fly to land. There I dock all three craft together and fly back to the mountain top. One by one I push Hermes and the historic craft back to orbit. Hydra can push the upper stage into a suborbital trajectory. After circularizing the upper stage I can switch back to Hydra and land Hydra\u00A0back on Eve. With 2-3 hops I can fly Hydra back to the highest mountain of Eve and repeat the process.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen docked in orbit, Hermes and the historic craft do not have enough delta-V to go back to Kerbin. So Hermes shuttles fuel from the surface of Eve to orbit. Hermes has around 250-300 liquid fuel plus corresponding oxidizer\u00A0when in orbit. It needs 100 liquid fuel plus oxidizer to deorbit. So I perform 7 refueling runs until I have enough fuel in orbit. I decided to fly all refueling runs instead of using Hyperedit because as far as I know this is the first mission that uses repeated reusable missions to Eve surface for refueling. Deorbiting is the hardest part because of the low heat tolerance of the solar panels and the grabbing unit. One time I overshot the landing position and\u00A0landed Hermes 22.6km off shore. To rescue it, I used Hydra as a speed boat and docked with Hermes. After that I just had enough fuel to fly back to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAfter flying back to Kerbin I captured at Kerbin using\u00A0a Mun assist, aero capture and a small\u00A0bit of retro burning. After aero braking to a circular orbit, I\u00A0landed the historic craft and Hermes together on the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMission duration: 14y 401d 1:17\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMass at launch: 413.975 tons (Hydra) \u002B 11.73 tons (Hermes) = 425.705 tons\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCost at launch: 241 398 (Hydra) \u002B 13 028 (Hermes) =\u00A0254 426\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRecovered cost: 12 294 (Hermes, empty on fuel)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-09-14T20:26:16Z\u0022 title=\u002209/14/2019 08:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 14, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by EveMaster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tseitsei89","CreatedById":162979,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-09-16T20:31:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOh this is good!

The craft has three stages. In the front the orbital catcher with one mammoth engine, In the middle an orbital tug with two nuclear engines and in the back the Eve lander. With enough fuel to reach Minmus, the craft weights somewhat above 500 tons. Landing on Minmus is possible using only the nuclear engines.
