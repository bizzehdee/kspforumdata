I know the usual tricks for fixing this at this point, but I was wondering if there was a good way of predicting this kind of behavior from the stability derivatives prior to takeoff (you know, fix the problem ahead of time instead of getting up there and realizing the problem exists). So, how about it - is there a value in the stability derivatives that should say to me \u0022your pitch authority is going to go from suck to blow at this point\u0022? It\u0027d be a relatively high magnitude green number - I\u0027m thinking M\u003Csub\u003Ew\u003C/sub\u003E but I\u0027m not wholly sure.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you are looking at the FAR Control \u0026amp; Analysis tab in FAR, the one with all of the numbers, change the speed and altitude numbers to the altitude in KM and speed in mach that you are having the problem at. I am pretty sure you are going to see a Down Vel Derivatives authority number go well into the red. If the Mw number is in the red at a set speed you will find that you are having a loss of pitch authority.

Also swapped out the cockpit for a Mk2 inline, then added a Mk2-1 Adapter up front, attached a service bay to that so I could put the probe core into it, then an NCS Adapter to that, an Avionics hub onto that and finally an extended Communotron 16 to the end of that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERe-entry has proven...interesting. I\u0027ve been making un-kerballed space flights and the probe core I\u0027ve been using is an OKTO. Without fail, the OKTO has been the first (and only) part to explode on re-entry, this despite it either being nestled snugly in a closed cargo bay (and later in a closed dedicated service bay). I\u0027m thinking that\u0027s probably some kind of bug at work - the rest of the plane survives intact up until the point where it usually falls into the drink (you know, because the probe core exploded and so I lose control over the craft at that point).

I made it mostly with procedural fuel tanks. Apparently they\u0027re lighter than procedural structural elements, so I just took a load of them and removed a lot of fuel, and hey presto, a lightweight plane! The procedural parts allowed me to make a much sleeker plane than my previous designs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, it\u0027s another light fighter, this time with some additional inspiration drawn from the Mirage F1, in addition to other jets of a similar role. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also turned the difficulty up a notch by setting area ruling to full, and it still reaches Mach 2.2 with the same \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:arial;\u0022\u003ESNECMA Atar as the F1, courtesy of AJE.
