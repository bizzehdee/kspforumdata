Unfortunately it is also one of the trickiest when it comes to building any reliable foundation for which questions we\u0027d need to ask. The number of unknowns and the vastness of the unknown make it near impossible to know if we are asking the right questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor starters, we still have no definition of where the line between life and no life is, at least not one everybody can agree on.

The Question is intriguing but I\u0027m wondering if it\u0027s more a philosophical question than a scientific one, for the time being. It\u0027s very much like questions like \u0022is there a God?\u0022, \u0022are parallel Universes a physical reality?\u0022, \u0022is there something outside our Universe? Like more Universes?\u0022.

Granted, it\u0027s \u0022the only way to be sure\u0022, but...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs has been mentioned, the universe is a big place, and so is our home galaxy. But while individual star systems are tiny compared to galaxies, and planets tiny to star systems, they are still huge in an absolute sense. It\u0027s taken us tens of thousands of years to truly explore and settle our home planet, and it can conceivably take tens of thousands of years to truly explore and settle our home system. That should absorb most of our exploratory energies before embarking on a serious program to colonize nearby stars, let alone the entire galaxy. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile there may be some groups that will want to go to the stars before that point, they will face a huge barrier: economics. Interstellar travel requires a huge investment in resources, and any interstellar adventurers or manifest-destiny groups would have to get those resources from whatever governments exist at the time. Chances are, these governments - and the societies represent - will only give enough resources to exploration that they think they can spare, which may not necessarily be enough to build even one starship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo understand this, let\u0027s take a look at current world spending for space exploration. The best estimates I can find give global space exploration budgets in 2013 at approximately $72.1 billion. The Gross World Product for that same year, according to the World Bank, sits at $75.59 \u003Cstrong\u003Etrillion\u003C/strong\u003E. So, space exploration consumed roughly 0.095% of the GWP. Let\u0027s be generous and round it up to 0.1%. This is our baseline, and shows the general priority our species places on space exploration. Barring some fundamental shift in human thinking - which can neither be ruled out nor counted upon - we can safely say that this will be the level of funding compared to total economic strength for the lifetime of our civilization. As Gross World Product rises (and eventually becomes Gross System Product - the total GDP of an entire solar system), space funding will also increase - \u003Cem\u003Ebut will still remain the same percentage of the GWP / GSP.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow that 0.1% is not just one program, but many. Future explorers will find their interstellar dreams must compete with other programs - planetary colonization and development (including terraforming), continuing exploration of the home system, SETI, planetary monitoring, solar monitoring and space weather tracking, etc. So our starship-builders find they will have to content themselves with a smaller chunk of the very tiny piece of the GWP pie. We can safely say therefore, that, barring a sudden need to launch a starship Right. Freaking. Now!, a starship will only be built once the cost of building and launching one fits nicely inside that 0.1% either by the GWP climbing to a nicely wealthy level, or sudden science and technological breakthroughs lowering the needed cost, or both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut let\u0027s say that happens. Say a thousand or two thousand years from now, the resources are available, the starship is launched, and a new colony is founded. Hooray! The colonists of a new system now have an entire solar system to explore and settle, and will likely go through the same cycle of local, in-system expansion consuming all their energies before they start looking to the stars again. Their exploration budget will likely be a larger percentage of their GWP at first, but will drop to that same 0.1% as the colony expands and matures and more people become interested in building lives for themselves where they are, than fulfilling some nebulous \u0022manifest destiny\u0022 to Conquer The Galaxy for Mankind. So, once again, those wanting to go to another star must go, cap in hand, to their governments and ask for the needed slice of resources of that 0.1% to build the starship. Once again, the governments will not yield that slice from other, more practical and urgent programs until and unless they can safely afford it, or until and unless a Pressing Need to build a starship presents itself. Lather, rinse, and repeat for every interstellar colony that is successfully seeded. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThose few million years to colonize the galaxy is suddenly looking like it needs a lot more time to complete. Starships remain possible, but become much rarer, and hence less detectable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor those who may despair at the thought of several thousands of years between starships, or argue \u0022but exploration is in our NATURE!\u0022, I would remind them that the civilizations launching those starships are still living full \u0022lives\u0022, and that exploration of a single star system by its inhabiting civilization (either native-grown or seeded) will provide a healthy sink for exploratory urges. We may dream of colonizing the stars today, but Mars, Europa, Titan, and other in-system worlds are much closer, and many more people dream of exploring and settling those worlds than do those of settling the stars. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe can expect similar attitudes among alien civilizations, even though the particulars will vary.
