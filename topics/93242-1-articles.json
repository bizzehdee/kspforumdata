I seem to recall trying Kerbal some time ago, back when it was free, but then I forgot about it for awhile. Finally decided to buy a copy and I\u0027ve been loving it ever since. I\u0027m a long time flight-simmer but space sims not so much, so this is relatively new to me. I\u0027ve researched the planets, discovered the joys of mechjeb, learned a good bit about orbital mechanics and even got some Kerbals to the Mun and back. And it\u0027s just now officially in Beta? Meaning there\u0027s more to come? Wow, was worth the purchase even before the latest update in my opinion. I see this forum is extremely active, so I look forward to learning even more here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Luke\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T01:16:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan you eat 50 boiled eggs?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CoolHandLuke","CreatedById":132180,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T01:20:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vanamonde\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECan you eat 50 boiled eggs?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve never tried, but I would guess that I can not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E/goin\u0027 to the Mun here, boss\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
