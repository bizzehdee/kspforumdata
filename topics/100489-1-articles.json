The \u0022scale\u0022 part on the insides of the rings/arrows appears to have no transparency and instead shows the bright pink texture indicative of a color/chromakey overlay.\n\nMods or no mods makes no difference. The screenshot is from a complete re-install (Steam version).\n\n**Screenshot:**\n\n![gizmo-glitch.png](http://mended-drum.net/~jinks/pics/KSP/gizmo-glitch.png)\n\nHas anybody an idea what might be causing this? My GPU is a nVidia 560, using latest proprietary drivers. 32/64 bit version makes no difference either."},{"CreatedByName":"Yargnit","CreatedById":57535,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-23T04:24:43Z","Content":"You\u0027re using -opengl mode I believe.
