I\u0027m trying to get 6 satellites into a hexagonal arrangement in a 6000km orbit, and launched them into as close a position as I can get given our standard floating-point, velocity changes depending on orientation nonsense. To get them locked into a constellation that won\u0027t drift into uselessness within a couple years, I\u0027m trying to lock down the orbital parameters in the persistent.sfs file. Did a bit of figuring, and worked out that the target orbital period is 56690s, and (obviously) there should be a 60 degree angle between the sats. Here\u0027s an example of one of their entries:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003EORBIT\u003Cbr\u003E\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tSMA = 6600000\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tECC = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tINC = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tLPE = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tLAN = 60\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tMNA = 0\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tEPH = 9448.333333\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tREF = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\t}\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI entered the appropriate LAN values as multiples of 60, the EPH values as multiples of 9448.333333 (56690/6), and the \u0022lon\u0022 values in the VESSEL section equal to the LAN. This resulted in all 6 satellites being in exactly the same place in the orbit in a giant pile-up. I\u0027ve found lots of guides for 3 satellites in a kerbosynchronous orbit, but I\u0027m having some trouble working out the equations that will help me calculate the relevant values to get an arbitrary number of satellites at an arbitrary altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I know I can use HyperEdit to get them there more easily, but I like doing the math.
