I actually have 24 around Kerbin atm and it works about as good as current military GPS systems as far as location accuracy. I recently hi-jacked the mini satellite from RemoteTech, ripped out the RT functions and made it my dedicated GPSsat (untill the mod gets a proper one that is). I think i can get Eve and Duna with good GPS network in 2 launches each (launches from kerbin that is).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PakledHostage","CreatedById":8059,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T16:32:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThank you, KhaosCorp, for your help answering user\u0027s questions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to be aware of, bigmos, is that your satellites all need to have \u0022GPS\u0022 in their name and they must be above the horizon to be visible to the Figaro receiver. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am currently working on implementing \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24646-0-20-Figaro-Global-Navigation-Satellite-System-Launch-a-Working-Kerbal-GPS-System?p=314019\u0026amp;viewfull=1#post314019\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eialdabaoth\u0027s suggestion\u003C/a\u003E to include an antenna array/transmitter part in the mod package.
