Depending on how much fuel you have in front of the CoL will determine how stable your aircraft will be throughout it\u0027s whole flight. Liquid fuel depletes from the front to the back in KSP(without fuel lines). With this model you ideally want to make sure the CoL will always stay behind the CoM. My usual plane build will incorporate fuel tanks laterally along the CoM rather than a long fuselage to mitigate this effect.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaceisbeautifulul","CreatedById":68592,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-05T01:40:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou add wings.

If possible, try to pump fuel from the back of the craft to the front and then into the engines. This way, the CoM will actually shift forwards instead of backwards. Another helpful tip to make sure the craft\u0027s CoM doesn\u0027t move behind the CoL would be to place a small truss or linear RCS port on the CoL so when you are in flight, you can see if the CoM has moved behind it (the camera is centered on the CoM, so zooming in all the way will show you your current CoM).\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
