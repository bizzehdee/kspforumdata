I set the root part to the section of the rocket I want to attached, and now I can correctly attach the rocket to the radial decoupler on top of the spaceplane, but now the command pod comes off of the rocket when I merge it. It is almost like the program is still trying to grab the rocket by the command pod when it first loads the part and then realizes it is no longer the root part, removing it from the rest of the rocket. And once removed, it can no longer be reattached to the subassembly, rendering the whole subassembly worthless. I tried making the command pod one of the two root parts but then it goes right back to attaching only to the command pod again. Its a real pain in the rear.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny idea how to work around this problem?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T17:05:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell.

Too many things in this game or either hidden or not obvious. This is much more elegant than merging ships, but unfortunately succumbs to almost the same problems. I can again only attach the subassembly by either the nose or the tail. If I attempt to set new roots so I can attach it to radial decouplers, this time I am informed that it is not a valid subassembly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T01:44:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOK. Try this. Create the sub-assembly from scratch,\u003Cem\u003E starting\u003C/em\u003E with the part you will eventually want to use to attach to the decouplers. The correct part will then be the root. Save this craft as a sub-assembly.
