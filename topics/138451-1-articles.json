I have seen a lot of screenshots of stations, simple to very complex. My question regards girders and I-beams. How are these structural elements\u00A0added to an existing station as it grows? As I add modules and fuel storage tanks to my station, I can see a need, in the near future, for some added strengthening and solidifying of the overall station. How is that done? Also solar panels, again, as the station increases in size, I imagine I will need to add larger solar arrays instead of having half hazard arrays added to every module I fly up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVic the Newbal\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you go on about girders, it makes me think you expect to place girders or trusses between existing sections? I\u0027ve got bad news: you can\u0027t. Not in the VAB, and not after the fact with KAS. The \u0022tree\u0022 vessel structure does not allow such connections.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe only ways to create such connections are strut parts and multiport docking, and from what I\u0027ve read here multiport docking has suffered in the 1.1 engine port (someone please tell me I\u0027m wrong).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo struts are the only answer, and the only way to attach them after launch is using KAS. The only other thing is to make your station stiff enough without reinforcement. Clamp-O-Tron Sr.\u0027s help a lot here. Also, your station should rarely be under thrust.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"strider3","CreatedById":199830,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-29T21:34:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo it seems most of you attach fuel tanks to your stations\u00A0with a radial attachment.
