This means it will attach to the green attachment nodes and nothing else. That should address the attachment problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach satellite will need a probe core and power generation/storage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Looking at your satellites I think you\u0027ll have a problem when you decouple them. They are going to clip into one another, which will be tolerated as long as they are one vessel, but once you decouple they will either explode when they collide or end up intertwined and unusable. Inline would probably be better or you can use the BZ-52 Radial Attachment Point to build them on the side of a tank. Inline has the advantage that your center-of-mass will stay lined up with your thrust vector. Radial gives you more flexibility in putting things on top of your satellite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T15:02:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInstead of taking the satellites you have off to the side, re-build one of them on the decoupler.

That\u0027s critical with subassemblies. When you build a vessel from scratch, the first part you place is the root part. When you detach a subassembly from a vessel, the part you detached is that subassembly\u0027s root part. When you try to attach a subassembly, you can only attach it by the root part, which on your original satellites would likely be the probe core, which is not what you wanted.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote: You can change what the root part is in a vessel, but you can\u0027t change the root part of a disconnected subassembly like your satellites are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T15:02:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have surface attachment enabled.

Alternatively, in the 3x symmetry mode you can pick the Offset tool, pick the decouplers and move them farther apart. But that makes your payload even wider and the fairing will produce some serious drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy personal preference for sats this squat is to make them stackable on top of each other (using separators instead of decouplers). That makes a fairly lean payload and if it\u0027s wobbly, use the \u0022strut to fairing\u0022 trick. (put some long parts, like the longest SRBs at an angle along the fairing, then draw struts from the top-most probe to these SRBs through the fairing, and instead of attaching to the SRBs the struts will attach to the fairing,)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T17:05:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suggest building one satellite without mirroring and duplicating the whole thing using mirroring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-19T20:42:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/iFVkwRs.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022iFVkwRs.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBrining up one of my old pictures. 7 satellites one shot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
