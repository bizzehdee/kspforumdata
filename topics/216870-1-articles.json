So you can place C on top of B on top of A, but you can\u0027t stick B in the middle of A and C and expect all three to be connected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe bottom half of your assembly is attached to the top of the assembly only through that one Dart. It would appear from your comments that the other two Darts are attached to the bottom half. So while they may be touching the engine plate they are not connected to it. To fix this, you would need to pick up those Darts and place them on the engine plate by hand. Then they would be connected to the engine plate but not to the stack separators, or not to the three-way adapter.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is, assuming it\u0027s not a bug.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BechMeister","CreatedById":228007,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-26T08:06:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIll try things around, maybe i could also try attack the decouplers th other way around? so the explosive force goes the other way?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BechMeister","CreatedById":228007,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-26T15:57:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/228424-wetzelrad/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022228424\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/228424-wetzelrad/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Wetzelrad\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0I tried what you suggested\u00A0- it yielded the same result.

When i seperate.. for some reason i dont follow the 2nd stage.. but have to press [ to go to it.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSecond bug is that the stack decouplers pass over to the second stage, and when you press space, it turns off the engines. I made a new \u0022stage\u0022 and moved the engines infront of the stacks again, and then when i pressed space, they flew off and the engines worked.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut my craft works!\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Wetzelrad","CreatedById":228424,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-26T17:58:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSounds like you have it handled. Normally you want the decoupler triangle to be pointing away from the engine so it doesn\u0027t stay attached to the engine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith tri-couplers, in the way that you used them, only one of the three branches is being used structurally. The other two branches are hanging on by their top node. And in fact you only need one decoupler there, because the other two decouplers are not attached in full. Am I making sense? If you hover over with your mouse, you should be able to see by the green outline which parts are connected.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo with that type of design, the critical issue is build order.\u00A0 It\u0027s very easy to attach parts in the reverse order such that they end up on the wrong side of the decoupler. This is not so much a bug as it is a design quirk carried over from KSP1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrankly it\u0027s much easier to use the engine plate instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BechMeister","CreatedById":228007,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-26T18:15:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried to use the engine plate first.. but the large decoupler did not want to go to the fuel tank beyond the engines.. but instead to 1/3 engines.. and it made the vehicle very wobly understandable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scrufdog","CreatedById":228518,"CreatedDateTime":"2023-04-30T10:33:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI had a similar issue last night. I had a medium decoupler surrounding 6 engines. On decouple it would randomly knock off 1 or 2 engines. To solve I just turned down the decouple force from the default in the hundreds, down to 5 kN.
