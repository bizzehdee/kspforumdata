I was just about to go in with him, until he went a bit crazy and ran to a bush to do his business, dragging me along with him. As I waited for him to finish, I craned my neck upwards. It\\\u0027s very clear tonight, and although I didn\\\u0027t really think much about what I was doing, I suppose my general attraction to the stars just made me look above. After a brief moment of simply staring at the twinkling points of light, I saw it. For a meteor, it seemed to be travelling quite slow. It didn\\\u0027t burn up suddenly, rather it flirted with the prospect, slowly oscillating between a glowing yellow-white and a dim white blue, as if the meteor was becoming a part of the dark sky itself. It was in no rush, for a meteor, and so lasted 3 or 4 seconds, traversing a large distance in the night sky. Just as the spectacle was nearing the tree branches high above me, it faded away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that this was my best meteor sighting yet. Though it is still 5 days away and it is possible there is no relation, I hope that this is the beginning of a strong Lyrid meteor shower.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what are some meteors you guys have seen?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Unfortunately, after a brief check, the weather seems to be against me, with a forecast of showers on Saturday. Friday is also subject to some clouds. I can only hope things change for the better...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OtherDalfite","CreatedById":8317,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-17T02:42:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECareful around meteor showers kids, they\\\u0027re going fast enough to plow right through your skull.
