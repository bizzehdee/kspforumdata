The goal was to have this be a staging ground for crewed interplanetary explorations, and with time I\u0027m hoping to do the same on Duna and Laythe with time. These bases will also be where I build the required hardware (ships, additional base structures, etc).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo now that I\u0027ve gotten the base up and running, i\u0027m having some problems wrapping my head around Extraplanetary Launchpads and how it integrates with MKS, so my questions are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* What materials do I need (produced or flown in) to build ships? I\u0027ve accumulated a lot of MaterialKits from recycling leftover dropships while building. How do I turn these into rocketparts? (From what I\u0027ve understood, RP is what I need to build and launch the ships)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Which structures do I need? I see that both MKS and EPL comes with launchpads, so I must admit I\u0027m at a loss what to bring to my base.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n* Any other pointers/tips?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-04T07:29:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou use the UKS launchpad (or just some \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E survey markers for smaller projects). I don\u0027t know off the top of my head how the base module you need is called, but construction happens with that dedicated module. You need MaterialKits (lots) and SpecializedParts (few) to construct stuff. No conversion into EPL resources required.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
