I really wanted collision meshes so that you could land on buildings and fly though alleys, but I guess it isn\u0027t really necessary. I\u0027ll have to think about it some more. Right now, the lights fade due to the shader. As you get close to the sphere, the alpha drops out so that when you are standing on the ground you don\u0027t see lights beneath your feet. It was more or less a necessity to ensure the lights didn\u0027t look out of place if you weren\u0027t in the air.

I\u0027ll end up using a similar technique I use for the underside of the clouds. Detail Textures. I just have to make sure they fade at a decent distance otherwise it looks too tiled. From below it is fine as long as the clouds are close enough to the camera. I will probably have to make the underside fade to the main texture though, as clouds that are very high (eg, Duna) are easy to spot the tiling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other, well... KSP is very interesting in how it renders. there are three cameras: Near, Far, and Scaled. The Near camera renders ships, kerbals, etc. The Far camera seems to render the detail terrain, PQSCity stuff (Space center), etc. The Scaled camera renders the planetary and map view of bodies when you are ~100km away. The Far camera fades as you start moving away from a body to reveal the scaled camera render. So what I did was add a new camera that attaches to the scaled camera, and I attach clouds to the scaled planets. I can\u0027t use any other camera aside from my own and the scaled camera, otherwise the objects won\u0027t render to the correct size/position. So what I do is once I exit a certain distance away from the body, I move the layers onto the scaled camera so they don\u0027t mess with the Z writing. If I do it too soon, the layers won\u0027t be visible until you are up high, if I do it too late, they will overlap objects (as you saw). I will probably expose this value for different bodies in the near future. Until then, I would say have your stations at about 200KM up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NathanKell","CreatedById":75006,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-30T16:28:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo you suppose you could switch LOD distance based on radius?

I\u0027ll end up using a similar technique I use for the underside of the clouds. Detail Textures. I just have to make sure they fade at a decent distance otherwise it looks too tiled. From below it is fine as long as the clouds are close enough to the camera. I will probably have to make the underside fade to the main texture though, as clouds that are very high (eg, Duna) are easy to spot the tiling.\u003Cp\u003EAs for the other, well... KSP is very interesting in how it renders. there are three cameras: Near, Far, and Scaled. The Near camera renders ships, kerbals, etc. The Far camera seems to render the detail terrain, PQSCity stuff (Space center), etc. The Scaled camera renders the planetary and map view of bodies when you are ~100km away. The Far camera fades as you start moving away from a body to reveal the scaled camera render. So what I did was add a new camera that attaches to the scaled camera, and I attach clouds to the scaled planets. I can\u0027t use any other camera aside from my own and the scaled camera, otherwise the objects won\u0027t render to the correct size/position. So what I do is once I exit a certain distance away from the body, I move the layers onto the scaled camera so they don\u0027t mess with the Z writing. If I do it too soon, the layers won\u0027t be visible until you are up high, if I do it too late, they will overlap objects (as you saw). I will probably expose this value for different bodies in the near future. Until then, I would say have your stations at about 200KM up \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOut of interest, did you try having two cloud spheres? i.e. having one in the far camera layer and the other in the scaled space layer so that when it fades the far cam the other is already visible?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T14:36:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022tobyb121\u0022 data-cite=\u0022tobyb121\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOut of interest, did you try having two cloud spheres? i.e. having one in the far camera layer and the other in the scaled space layer so that when it fades the far cam the other is already visible?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI thought about that, but I couldn\u0027t find a POR to attach to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rbray89","CreatedById":48847,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-31T14:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tw1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tw1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOoo!
