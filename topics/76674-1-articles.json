In other words, being able to support packing a mod up using either a tool like Starbound\u0027s packer tool (which generates a .pak file) which can then be dumped into a general \u0022mods\u0022 directory which is then parsed by the game.To go further, maybe have a mod select screen like the TES games which allows you to de/select mods along with a small xml file built in which would tell you what version the mod is, who created it, and a short description of the mod. You don\u0027t even really need to compress the file if speed is a concern.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would allow you to have just a singular packed file instead of multiple folders, and allows people to upgrade mods at a glance.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
