There will always be a region near the poles where the satellite cannot provide coverage. This region is smaller the farther away you are and you only get full coverage when you are infinitely far away. However, it seems like you\u0027re interested in how far away you\u0027d have to be to utilize the full range of the dish\u0027s coverage so that the dish cone is tangent to the planet. In that case, the expression you\u0027re looking for is r=R/sin(theta/2)-R where r is the orbital altitude, R is the planet\u0027s radius, and theta is the dish cone angle. The minus R comes from the fact that KSP measures your altitude from the surface, not the center of the planet. An expression for the maximum latitude a dish can serve (assuming the target\u0027s altitude is 0m, the sat is in an equatorial orbit, and r is at least the minimum value you calculated from the previous equation) is coverage=90-arcsin(R/(r\u002BR)). As you can see, the only way to serve a sea level target at the pole with a sat in an equatorial orbit is if r is infinite.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T11:35:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHmm, yes, that is what I mean, the minimum altitude where the cone is fully used, not that it fully cover the whole thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, using the expression you give, for the DTS-M1 at kerbin, we would have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Etheta = 45 degree\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER = 600km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Er=(600/sin(45/2)) - 600 = -1831.59152348 km\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...Something seems seriously wrong here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Ok, loaded that expression in Wolfram|Alpha, and using degrees instead of radians, the result is: 967.87556\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill quite a bit away from the supposed answer of 1600km\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T11:48:43Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 11:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RainDreamer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T14:05:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERainDreamer,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI concur with jimbimbibble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA cone with an apex angle of 45* will lie tangent to Kerbin\u0027s surface at 968km altitude. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g13/GoSlash27/coneangle_zps7e451200.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022coneangle_zps7e451200.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps something\u0027s off in the tutorial or specs?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T14:24:52Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 02:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jimbimbibble","CreatedById":77859,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T14:35:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe that 1600km is measured from the planet\u0027s center?

Depending on what you\u0027re optimizing for; poles if you\u0027re going for coverage (requires more satellites) or satellites if you\u0027re going for minimum number of satellites (3 if you have enough range). Obviously you still don\u0027t get full coverage of the planet\u0027s surface, but you will have coverage anywhere in a reasonable orbit. As a specific example, at Kerbin for maximum coverage you want each satellite to be able to reach, say, 100km above the north/south poles (to allow for low polar orbits without having satellites in a polar orbit). If your satellite range is 1600km, assuming Kerbin doesn\u0027t get in the way, you want the satellites to be at an altitude of sqrt(1600^2 - 700^2) - 600 = 838.74km (rounding down).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-08T17:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002201/08/2015 05:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 8, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by armagheddonsgw\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-08T22:16:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022RainDreamer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAh, that explains it.
