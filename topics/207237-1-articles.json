From what I\u0027ve seen/heard, the precooler system required for SABRE to function has been developed and tested (although perhaps not at full scale?), while the engine itself will use expansion deflection to improve its \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E both in atmosphere and in vacuum, a technology that is relatively unproven but still very much possible. I\u0027ve seen concepts for a fully reusable launch up to geostationary transfer orbit, where the Skylon itself waits in LEO while an upper stage boosts the payload up, then returns to Skylon and docks to it again before returning to the surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWith modern composite materials to take the heat of re-entry, there\u0027s no reason why Skylon couldn\u0027t work, except for one pretty big one: cost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGetting Skylon operational will be expensive. If (and hopefully when) it does, it\u0027ll be entering a pretty saturated market- even without the much-hyped Starship-Superheavy lobbing a hundred tons to LEO per flight in a fully reusable manner, carving out a niche against both current and future conventional rockets will be difficult- Falcon 9, Soyuz, Ariane 5 and GSLV/PSLV are all in the ballpark of Skylon\u0027s payload to orbit, with plenty more rockets- Vega C, Angara, Neutron, Ariane 6 to name but a few- all under development or nearing operation. To compete with all of those, Skylon will have to be very reliable and have a very rapid turnaround time between flights, something that won\u0027t be easy when the whole thing goes to orbit and back every time. There\u0027s also the not so trivial issue of producing all the liquid hydrogen needed for such a rapid launch cadence. Once up and running, Skylon will be very cost-effective, but until that point money is the main problem to be overcome.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
