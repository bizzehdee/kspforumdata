The brighter area, takes the form of what appears to be a large rectangular region, taller than the screen, with the corner of which visible if the camera is swung round towards the poles (assuming an equatorial orbit).\n\nThe issue is very subtle and is not clearly visible in this image against the bright background of the forum page, but when viewed full screen, the bright region extends from the left side of the image to almost halfway to the left side of the Hitchiker can in the center.\n\n![6NJsQzH.png](http://i.imgur.com/6NJsQzH.png)\n\nSome information on this issue:\n\n- This bright area gradually creeps across the skybox, so it\u0027s not a break in continuity of the skybox textures\n- This artifact only occurred after updating to KSP v1.1 and the 1.1 compatible version of Scatterer\n- The artifact seems to be less apparent the higher the orbit and in the case of Kerbin seems to disappear at around 110 - 115km, with the screen always brighter on the same side of the screen as the planet\n- My PC is a Windows 7 setup with a GTX 670 graphics card and using DirectX 11\n- The issue occurs with Scatterer being the only mod installed\n\nThis isn\u0027t a really big issue as the artifact is very subtle, but it does break the illusion of the skybox when in lower orbits. Hopefully this isn\u0027t a previously reported issue, I did take a look through the postings after the release of KSP 1.1 and didn\u0027t see anything similar."},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-23T10:46:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 1 hour ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Extinction tint is the same as the sunset color, which tends to be the opposite of betaR at default atmosphere thickness.

Everything was ok after rebuilding.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E **upd**: found another issue:  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E This happened after quickloading from being close to the Kerbin (like 90km) to the surface of the Mun. Rebuilding the ocean did not help.  \n\u003E \n\u003E Quickloading just in place like hitting f5 then holding f9 right away does not cause the issue. I guess it has something to do with the drawing distance I mentioned in the first issue.  \n\u003E   \n\u003E \n\u003E Anyways thanks for the great mod! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) Keep rocking.\n\u003E \n\nAlright I\u0027ll check it out."},{"CreatedByName":"Guardsman111","CreatedById":162602,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T12:08:00Z","Content":"I hope this hasn\u0027t already been reported, but I\u0027m having this issue when about 70\u0027000 at kerbin:\n\n![eZPkdgq.png](http://i.imgur.com/eZPkdgq.png)\n\nIts playable, but very weird and I was wondering if there was a fix or whether I could provide info so you can work on a fix ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) It appears to be stuck to the camera, so if I move the camera, the clouded bit moves with it."},{"CreatedByName":"Poodmund","CreatedById":128643,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T12:16:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 7 minutes ago, Guardsman111 said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E I hope this hasn\u0027t already been reported, but I\u0027m having this issue when about 70\u0027000 at kerbin:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \\*snip\\*\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Its playable, but very weird and I was wondering if there was a fix or whether I could provide info so you can work on a fix ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022) It appears to be stuck to the camera, so if I move the camera, the clouded bit moves with it.\n\u003E \n\nDid you switch to this vessel from another vessel in orbit?"},{"CreatedByName":"Bengtsson1","CreatedById":162711,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T12:43:02Z","Content":"Looks amazing but its too realistic for my pc."},{"CreatedByName":"Guardsman111","CreatedById":162602,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T13:13:05Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 55 minutes ago, Poodmund said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Did you switch to this vessel from another vessel in orbit?\n\u003E \n\nNo, launched it, used map view to fly from probably 40\u0027000 to a stable orbit of 70\u0027000 - 400\u0027000. this image is taken halfway between that."},{"CreatedByName":"dryer_lint","CreatedById":162541,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-24T14:47:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 3 hours ago, blackrack said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E This has something to do with anisotropic filtering, try changing options from your driver.
