Other players are apparently seeing success with this mod in 1.12, so it\u0027s not simply a 1.12 issue. Something about my particular set of mods or configs is causing PM to poop out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks in advance!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLog file:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/zn8kswri5wls8t7/KSP.log?dl=0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://www.dropbox.com/s/zn8kswri5wls8t7/KSP.log?dl=0\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
