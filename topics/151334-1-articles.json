For one, if I have any automated mining operations, it could help me for interplanetary missions to further planets. I like Dres especially because of the dresteroids, which is perfect for an asteroid mining station. Once you drain that asteroid, just move the station to a new one, preferably look for E class ones. Eve is an interested planet to have a station around. It\u0027s also pretty convenient, since you want to mine Gilly as well. The best reason for that is to save fuel for future landings on Eve, just deploy a dry mass Eve lander and dock it in Eve/Gilly orbit to refuel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Jool, although I haven\u0027t sent any manned craft yet (and I only sent a probe to one of the moons thus far), I would definitely want a mining operation there, since there are a lot of moons to visit. Tylo is a tricky one to visit constantly for science, so you probably want a very specially designed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E lander for that which can mine and process fuel on it\u0027s surface. Otherwise, just use the other moons for stationing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"suicidejunkie","CreatedById":155878,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-09T19:34:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222914254\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151334\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483853279\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022134627\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Der Anfang\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 1/8/2017 at 0:27 AM, Der Anfang said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo is a tricky one to visit constantly for science, so you probably want a very specially designed \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E lander for that which can mine and process fuel on it\u0027s surface.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Jool, there is no need to locally source supplies for each station.\u00A0 A Tylo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E already has near zero margin for an up and down cycle when there\u0027s just a Kerbal for payload.\u00A0 You\u0027d fly way too many trips just to fill a small tank in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust ship all your supplies in to your orbital bases from a single surface base since moon to moon transfers are fast, cheap and frequent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket equation becomes far less oppressive if you can refuel on the surface AND refuel at the orbital station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Der Anfang","CreatedById":134627,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-09T19:55:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222915959\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022151334\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221483990454\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022155878\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022suicidejunkie\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, suicidejunkie said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor Jool, there is no need to locally source supplies for each station.\u00A0 A Tylo \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E already has near zero margin for an up and down cycle when there\u0027s just a Kerbal for payload.\u00A0 You\u0027d fly way too many trips just to fill a small tank in orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nJust ship all your supplies in to your orbital bases from a single surface base since moon to moon transfers are fast, cheap and frequent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe rocket equation becomes far less oppressive if you can refuel on the surface AND refuel at the orbital station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh yes.
