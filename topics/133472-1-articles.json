What is this thread for? Posting rockets that you made that have design elements of another member\u0027s/organization\u0027s craft. For a real life example, I point you to the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/autopia/2012/05/Liberty_Rocket_Elements-21-660x843.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ELiberty Rocket.\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0The Liberty Rocket is a mixed design, or sometimes referred to as a \u0027Lego\u0027 design. It takes American SRBs that the Space Shuttle used, ad places them on the bottom of the European Ariane 5\u0027s Core Stage. The idea of a \u0027Lego\u0027 craft inspired me to make this thread and see what people make in terms of a \u0027Lego\u0027 craft.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, here are some rules for the thread:\u003Cbr\u003E\n1) Do not post craft that you solely built! That would be off topic for this thread.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) You must have permission from the member who\u0027s craft you used to mix with yours. If they have uploaded the craft in a thread and have said, \u0022You are welcome to use my craft any way you like, just give me credit\u0022 or anything like that saying, you may post it without asking for their permission, but please link to the member\u0027s thread where they said that, and also give them credit.\u003Cbr\u003E\n3) Mod pack craft are allowed, such as mixing FASA\u0027s Saturn IB with Bobcat\u0027s Soyuz. (You don\u0027t need permission for posting craft using mods, but of course give credit where credit is due.)\u003Cbr\u003E\n4) You can mix as many craft as you want, there is no limit. You can have FASA\u0027s Saturn IB Stage one and two, with Bobcat\u0027s Soyuz\u0027s asparagus boosters, and have the command module be an Orion Pod from another mod.\u003Cbr\u003E\n5) More rules may apply in the future\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nQ\u0026amp;A:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ) I made a craft using my friend\u0027s craft, but they aren\u0027t on the forum, can I still post the craft?\u003Cbr\u003E\nA) Yes! Of course! But please give them credit! You don\u0027t have to give their name, just say your name and then your name\u0027s friend or anon.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ) We already have a craft sharing thread!\u003Cbr\u003E\nA) Yes, but that\u0027s any and all craft, this is to narrow it down, because people like narrowed down results.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ) Can we make real \u0027Lego\u0027 craft?\u003Cbr\u003E\nA) Yep, if you want to share the Liberty Rocket you made, go ahead!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nQ) I saw there was a Liberty Rocket already made by someone else, can I still post mine?\u003Cbr\u003E\nA) Designs are like cars, there\u0027s a lot out there, but they all have something that makes them unique. Yes! Post your design! You might have used a longer SRB then the one before you, or you could have added some flair to it!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nQ) I\u0027ve posted the A/I version of this craft, but I\u0027ve upgraded it and made it different in small ways, can I post it?\u003Cbr\u003E\nA) See answer to question above this one! \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nQ) YAY!
