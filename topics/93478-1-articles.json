Thought I\u0027d be the only one but this seems common... Not really tech savvy, but I love this game and I want to make it work. I have tried Claw\u0027s solution that he linked to regarding corrupt files stemming from firing previously hired Pilots (In my case it was Jeb). I must have done something wrong because after I edited the persistent.sfs to match the block that Claw posted, the game was simply showing up as \u0022Just started\u0022 in my saved files menu in-game. Also, wouldn\u0027t even load, it was just a functionless button. You can see this is my first post here, I have never once had an issue with this game, but I updated to 0.90 last week and this happened shortly after. If anyone can help me edit the persistent file properly (Maybe I\u0027m leaving blank space, but it\u0027s hard to use notepad to *not* include blank space?), but then I\u0027d be happy to upload my persistent.sfs and output log for study. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can contact me via Reddit also, I\u0027m under the same username scarf123.
