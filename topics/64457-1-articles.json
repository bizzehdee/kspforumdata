When I fly mine I try to gain altitude up to about ~15-20km asap and then level out to gain horizontal velocity. When your engines begin to flame out is when you want to switch to rocket power. I agree with Armchair Rocket Scientist about the use of rocket engines too. If you\u0027re using b9 you could also stick a sabre M on the back too. You shouldn\u0027t be losing too much altitude from having a somewhat low AoA. You might also need more lift. If you\u0027re not opposed to it and want to build sstos more often I suggest downloading the procedural wings mod. It\u0027s by far one of my favorite mods because it simplifies so many things and lets you customize your wings how you want them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh I just double checked your ssto and found a little of your problem. Your jets are all on the top of your wings causing your CoT to be above your CoM. This will push your nose down no matter what you do. You should put 1 pair of engines on top of the wing and 1 on bottom, or whatever makes you happy as long as the CoT is going through your CoM\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hodo","CreatedById":78218,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-28T04:44:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOk, several minor problems with your craft and flight profile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1- your CoT is slightly higher than the CoM which is pushing the nose down under max thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2- you have 1 intake per jet engine, which is limiting your overall altitude. I suggest adding another set of intakes somewhere on the aircraft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3- lower your climb profile. I usually climb at 35-45deg till 12-15km alt then bring it down to 10-15deg to gain as much speed as I can till 25-30km altitude. Those D30s will die off around mach 3-3.5 which means you are losing most of your thrust at that point. You will need another 1400m/s roughly to get to orbital velocity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4-The rockets you are using while cool, are horribly inefficient. I would suggest switching over to a pair of the standard boosters. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy goal when I fly my SSTOs is to gain as much speed as I can before I have to kill the jet engines.
