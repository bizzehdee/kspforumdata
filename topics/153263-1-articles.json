Some frame dropping and slow down on a minority of\u00A0launches until I get up a few kms. The real issue is when I\u0027m working with one or more very large stations or bases with lots of vessels about. At those times the performance can drop significantly and it gets a bit frustrating. But I wouldn\u0027t say that should scare anyone away. It\u0027s manageable and, at least for me, doesn\u0027t represent the majority of my gameplay. Though I guess a kid might be less forgiving. Also, 1.2 has improved those worst case scenarios a bit, but overall the game runs a little more poorly than 1.1.3. I\u0027m hoping that\u0027s due to some bugs I see crop up in the logs and that it will smooth out after a couple patches.
