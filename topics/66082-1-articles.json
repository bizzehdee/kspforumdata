As this thread is about the way jet engines should work, it concerns them in the same way as it concerns proper spaceplanes. It\u0027s easier to build and fly a jet-boosted rocket than a proper spaceplane, and the ascent profile and the engine configuration are similar. Vertical launching allows the form to follow function better, while vertical landing basically requires you to use a few parachutes to make the landing less risky.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESpaceplanes are more fun to fly, but for practical purposes, it\u0027s just better to remove the wings and add a bit more thrust.
