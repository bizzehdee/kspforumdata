Specifically, I am looking for a steep cliff (preferably steep enough that it looks rocky instead of having the normal sand texture) next to some flat ground. A ravine (cliffs on both sides) would be even better, but is not strictly necessary. If, in anyone\u0027s travels, they have come across such a place, let me know! I have been trying to find such a place using kerbalmaps but the resolution just isn\u0027t quite high enough, and of course if it were much higher I\u0027d have to spend days scouring the map anyway.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn a tangential note, I think it would be nice to have more severe terrain features in general on most planets.
