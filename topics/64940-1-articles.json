I\u0027m not after such a high altitude flight, I just want to get through the \u0022second atmosphere bar\u0022 or survive in it long enough for speed to build up. This almost works on even one of these turbojets \u002B Nerva, AS LONG AS I DONT touch the steering while over 13,000m (well, in the second layer). As soon as touch the heading or even sneeze, my craft aligns perpendicular to the airflow like a leaf\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow what I don\u0027t get is: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) how this is supposed to be possible on just ram intakes and turbojets? (according to KSPs part description) - I\u0027m having to entirely turn to rocket motor around 15,000m (as I lose intake air)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E how the stock turbojets are designed to work with stock delta wings? (in order to get more lift and intake air, I go faster but my own thrust bends, twists them and almost tears them off - as I said, like a leaf)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso I have a feeling that when I install B9 I will instantly have a long wing part which both provides lift from its aerofoil (not requiring high angles) in stratosphere and does not go crazy under it\u0027s own bending moment.

I\u0027m pretty sure I tested this with DCA on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anything I would say there is too little aerodynamic control at high altitude (the ailerons are too small to bite into the air any more - so I\u0027m having to throw in SAS... hmm, which may in fact be too strong as you say and be the cause of the problem). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s plenty of wing area though to promptly turn the aircraft into one giant airbrake.
