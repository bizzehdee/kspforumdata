I\u0027m about to update to 0.2 and thought it\u0027s time for a real playthrough after much testing and failing trying to figure this game out all by myself. I have a couple of questions that I haven\u0027t been able to figure out, I hope you guys don\u0027t mind me asking \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Let\u0027s talk struts. Do they like, break off when I connect something that will be decoupled? Can they mess up anything? Or should I just use as many as possible to improve stability? (I\u0027ve noticed my bigger rockets are far more stable that way, no accidents as of yet) Can they possibly break something while decoupling? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Those adapter thingies, which go from small-ish to large in one piece, do they improve stability? Should I always be using those to connect smaller pieces to larger pieces? Like a larger-ish fuel tank to an atomic engine, or is that not needed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Docking: I\u0027ve only tried it a few times and managed to finally assemble my so-far 2 part space station (don\u0027t judge me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E, it took forever), and I noticed that when I have like a small rocket with a decoupler and the \u0022space-station part\u0022 with a docking port, and I connect it, I can\u0027t figure out how to decouple the rocket from the part while it\u0027s docked to the space station :/. Is there a way to do this or do I need to decouple before docking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Is an interplanetary spaceplane possible/viable? I was so happy when I saw you can also construct planes but most of what I tried didn\u0027t even lift off, especially the heavier ones :/ I\u0027ve wanted to make a plane like that ever since I started with this game but not sure it\u0027s even possible?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!

A few well placed struts will improve rigidity a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. They look nice but you don\u0027t have to use them at all. In fact, try to use as few pieces as possible.

Learning is all about finding a better way to do things and that naturally demotes previous attempts into inferiority, but there\u0027s no shame in that. To separate stuff or split parts off use either a decoupler or a separatron. The difference is that a decoupler will remain attached while the separatron does not. It explodes both ways. You can also build 2 connected docking ports in the VAB, use struts to secure rigidity, then undock once you\u0027re in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Rockets can be made powerfull enough to have loads of fuel remaining after ascent. Spaceplanes rely on air as \u0022free\u0022 fuel but run out of this luxury around 20km altitude. From there they must have enough rocket fuel and thrust to complete orbital injection.

The only requirement is refuelling them. If they lack delta-V to get somewhere on their own, may need to use a tug and tow one.

A nuclear rocket can be very good for interplanetary travel, but it won\u0027t have enough thrust in the atmosphere. I recommend Aerospikes for in-atmosphere maneuvers. You can use jet engines, but you need to kill their throttle before they shutdown from lack of intake air. Try using an action group for that.

You can send some nice probes out. 0.20 has some new larger probe cores that are really nice, and let you make better probe lander. This is great for practicing entry and landing on various planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of other things that you can experiment relating to space planes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. There is nothing preventing your space plane from taking off vertically.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You should learn how parachutes change the behavior of your planes when attached to different points. This can make it much easier to land on planets with thin atmospheres, if you learn to do it right. (It also can let you splash-down a plane safely if you can\u0027t get to a runway.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. You should practice reentry a LOT. It is the most difficult part. You can also practice trying to recover from various flat spins.

If you want more realistic drag and lift models you should try the FAR community plugin. As was said by others they will eventually be implementing better drag and lift, but this plug-in can help until then.
