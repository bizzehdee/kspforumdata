Let\u0027s change that. Evenera will require\u00A03 relays in Eve orbit (must be able to get a greater than 50% connection to Kerbin 40\u00A0days after a transfer window) a lander, (must land on Eve) a rover,\u00A0(Also must land on Eve), \u00A0and a Gilly probe (Must land on Gilly). The rules are: no mods that affect gameplay and/or add parts, no Kraken drives, the cheat menu can\u0027t be used, 100% re entry heat, and normal Commnet settings. Entries will be judged by how many launches were used, how long it took (in game) to complete the requirements, how many parts the craft(s)\u00A0were, and also bonus points if this is done crewed.\u00A0 When entries will be due is TBD.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222021-08-28T18:06:32Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2021 06:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2021\u003C/time\u003E by Kerb24\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EI forgot to say when the entries will be do.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
