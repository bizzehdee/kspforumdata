I hope I\u0027m posting this in the right place...\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI recently fell foul of a very simple but long-standing problem: contracts which require you to dock two craft don\u0027t state that they must come from separate launches.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis bites everyone who launches, for example, a craft with a lander which leaves its parent, lands on a moon, and returns to refuel.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be very easy to add to the wording the explicit requirement that the two craft must be from separate launches. Most other contracts has everything carefully spelled out which makes this all the more anomalous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI replied to an \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/106938-docking-contract-terms/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Eold thread\u003C/a\u003E on this topic to say that the problem is still there, but \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022125662\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Snark\u003C/a\u003E responded and then locked the thread so I was unable to reply. Here goes: in response to the assertion that it\u0027s not a bug but in fact by design, you must mean the behaviour itself. And yes, despite the fact that many contracts are already nonsensically simple (e.g. test engine on launch pad), you\u0027re probably right about that.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, the issue that both I and (I believe) the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E in the old post are bothered about isn\u0027t the fact that you need two launches (because that\u0027s a \u003Cem\u003Egood\u003C/em\u003E thing), it\u0027s the fact that the contract description doesn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Esay so\u003C/em\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is the bug which should be addressed. I don\u0027t believe for a moment that the missing/unclear wording is by design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geonovast","CreatedById":179753,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-18T20:54:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree.\u00A0 This has bothered me for some time.\u00A0 That\u0027s why I just F12 them to complete after I do them, which is typically in an apollo-style mission.\u00A0 That way the difficulty is the same as if it was two separate ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso moving to Suggestions since this is a request to change something in the stock game, not a technical issue with running the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-01-18T21:54:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo argument here.
