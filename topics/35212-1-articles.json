He began as the patron of flintknappers and the builders of megalithic tombs and pyramids, but shifted his bailiwick through bronze and iron until today he presides over Kerbal rocket science. Mun is a clinker from his forge from back when Kerbals were in the Iron Age. Minmus is a patinaed drop of bronze that fell from his casting ladel back when Kerbals were in the Bronze Age.

Thus, no matter how often Kerbals see her without her make-up, in all the ugliness of her orange, dead, uninhabitable desolation, they still keep thinking she\u0027d make a beautiful new home for their species.

In The Beginning, King Kerbol decreed that Kerbin should build the universe for Him, just to see if it would explode or remain stable, to satisfy his Burning Curiosity. So Kerbin did about 99% of the work but then Eve caught his eye so he quit work early to go out with her, leaving his apprentice Dres to finish up. Dres realized that the universe would tear itself apart without some reinforcement, so he created the Sacred Strut that holds the whole thing together. His hanidwork can still be seen today as the bright bar of light all around Kerbin\u0027s ecliptic. Thus, when Kerbal astronomers realized that Kerppler\u0027s Laws required some small, dark, unappreciated and usually ignored body between Duna and Jool to hold the Kerbol system together, they naturally named it Dres.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJool is the god of the ostentatious display of bling (known as \u0022joolery\u0022 in the Kerbal language).

It was many billions of years later that the Kerbal race actually emerged, hence the discrepancy in the claims of one Rodemy Kerman that he personally saw the birth of the sun and that it was, in his own words, \u0027pretty neat\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Regardless of questions of origin, the Kerbal solar system is formed primarily of at least 7 planets and 9 moons, although there is some debate about how accurate this count is given that Kerbals are notorious for mistaking grains of pollen, specks of dust, and other such common detritus for planets and moons as well. It was several million years before any of them actually realized that \u0027that strange floating disc in the sky\u0027 was in fact a moon, despite the fact that they had already identified several planets and moons by this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The first planet that Kerbals readily identified was their closest neighbor, which they named Eve (after the ancient Kerbal tool for measuring the distance between the top of a really tall cliff and the bottom; the term roughly translates to \u0022really big rock with a wristwatch strapped to it\u0022). Its miniscule moon was dubbed Gilly, after the Kerbals\u0027 favorite snack food (a sort of gelatinous flavored substance which is believed to cause hyperactivity in young Kerbals, but actually just causes severe gilly addiction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Eventually, the Kerbals also realized that there was another planet further in from Eve, and dubbed it Moho (named for another ancient Kerbal scientific instrument that had been used in times of old to gauge how hard the wind was blowing; the term roughly translates to \u0022piece of cloth tied to a stick and jammed really hard into the ground\u0022, though strangely this is considered to be completely different in concept from a flag).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The next planet and moon discovered by Kerbals, much to their shock, was in fact further away from their sun than Kerbin. Prior to this, Kerbals had long believed that Kerbin was the most distant object in their solar system, mostly because none of them wanted to actually look too closely at the night sky due to fears of \u0022star blindness\u0022. This new planet was called Duna, after the most beloved Kerbal scientific instrument of the age (which, when translated out, means \u0022really cool thing that everyone needs to have but nobody is really sure what it does\u0022; this instrument makes an awful lot of noise every few minutes and flashes very interesting light patterns, but even Kerbal scientists have yet to discover what purpose it serves in spite of having invented it themselves). Orbiting Duna was a good-sized moon, which the Kerbals named Ike (after a fatty form of snack food which Kerbals eat religiously; the Church of Ike was founded specifically for the worship of these small, round, flat discs, in fact).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E After discovering that planets existed beyond Kerbin, the Kerbals then discovered that another small planet existed further out from Duna. One particularly clever Kerbal scientist decided to call it Dres, after the scientific instrument formerly used to measure water depth (which translates to \u0022extremely heavy rock with a Kerbal tied to it\u0022; use of dreses has fallen out of favor in recent years with the recent discovery of the principle of buoyancy).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Beyond Dres, a large gas giant was discovered, which surprised the heck out of the Kerbal scientific community since, according to Dr. Munbus Kerman, \u0027we were pretty sure nothing that big existed anywhere\u0027. This gas giant was named Jool, after the old scientific instrument utilized to measure the viscosity of gilly (which translates out to \u0022sticking your finger in the goop and seeing how thick it sticks to it\u0022; despite better instrumentation existing today, the use of jools to measure one\u0027s gilly viscosity remains very popular indeed).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Orbiting Jool, it was discovered, were no less than five moons. Laythe (named for a fizzy drink that tastes almost, but not quite, entirely unlike gilly mixed with ike), Vall (a fizzy drink that tastes exactly like gilly mixed with ike), Tylo (a hard candy which tastes nothing at all like gilly or ike, but an awful lot like bop), Bop (a truly nasty combination of seaweed and tree bark which nonetheless Kerbals love to pieces), and Pol (a concentrated mixture of laythe and tylo, often used by adolescent Kerbals to play pranks on their parents by pouring it into their morning coffee).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E One particularly cheeky Kerbal scientist pointed out that there was another planet even further out from Jool, and was promptly ostracized for it, as Kerbal society demands of its scientific discoveries. However, when a planet actually was found to be there, the scientist was apologized to and given a year\u0027s supply of minmus, which is also the Kerbal societal standard for this sort of thing. The planet was named Eeloo, after the long-used scientific instrument which measures the passage of time (which translates, strangely, to \u0022piece of rock tied to a string that is swung over one\u0027s head rapidly until it hits one in the face\u0022; primarily eeloos are used to pass time quickly more than they are to measure the passage of time; even though that\u0027s not what they were meant to do, they\u0027re exceedingly good at it regardless).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Kerbals then focused their attention locally, and discovered to their shock that there were in fact moons orbiting their planet. The first one discovered was named Minmus (after a form of sugary, rubbery plastic-like material that Kerbals for some reason chew when they\u0027re nervous). Perhaps most embarrassing, however, was when they realized that the large disc in the sky they always had so much trouble not looking at when trying to find other planets was in fact a moon. They promptly named it Mun, after the world-famous confectionary dessert which is comprised of sixteen layers of various seafood dipped in sugar, laythe, vall, and gilly. For reasons unknown to anyone else in the galaxy, Kerbals are very fond of making mun, even though they absolutely refuse to eat it since it tastes like sicky-sweet fish covered in seaweed and tree bark.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-02T00:12:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe planet Jool is named after the King of the Kerbal gods.

He was said to be able to divert any threat, which is why you always get a goddamn Ike encounter when you don\u0027t want it. He was also the god of magic; he was so afraid of his own strength that he is said to have sealed away the source of his powers in a boulder and cast it into orbit so he could never abuse it or lose control. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EDres: \u003C/strong\u003EDres was the god of courage, and is said to have served as a lieutenant to Duna in the war against Kerbol.

However, Bop secretly was in alliance with Kerbol during the war; as revenge for Jool imprisoning his master, Bop created the Deep Space Kraken and its variations in order to torment Jool\u0027s creations. Bop also serves as the god of fear. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPol: \u003C/strong\u003EPol is the youngest child of Jool and god of sorrow.
