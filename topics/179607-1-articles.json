And I came across this awesome old ESTES parachute pack by\u00A0 Narhiril . I thought it would be perfect to set up texture switching so they are all available in one part for the Mk16 chute. The mod was last updated for V-1.2.0\u00A0 . This is basically just a texture pack the chutes work fine and the textures are in dds format but I get this effect in the game.\u003Cimg alt=\u0022MbT1O3b.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/MbT1O3b.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E I think I have seen this before does anyone know what needs to be changed on the texture sheet to fix this ? I assume it\u0027s some layer that needs to have transparency value or a colour change to fix the problem? I\u0027M completely incompetent when it comes to artwork or working with textures. I am also handicapped by being on Linux with Gimp \u0022sorry\u0022 no Photoshop. I was hoping its something easy I can do by just clicking a layer and changing a value or something ? If any of you texture gurus know what I need to do I would appreciate it. If not no problems I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to spend any time on the problem . this was just something I was going to do for myself and if there isn\u2019t a easy fix I\u0027m certainly not going to.\u00A0\u00A0 \u0022Thanks\u0022 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-11-07T03:21:59Z\u0022 title=\u002211/07/2018 03:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 7, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Delbrutis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Manwith Noname","CreatedById":117203,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-07T17:38:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom what I can see in your pic, everything is being rendered correctly with the exception of the bits that should be transparent so,\u00A0 I strongly suspect this a shader issue rather than texture.

I\u0027ve downloaded the mod,\u00A0put it in my install and loaded the game. For me, the chutes work and display correctly without any changes, well, the one I tried which was the \u0022red\u0022 one based on what I saw in your screenshot. I guess that something you have installed is interfering with them. My first hunch would be anything that is capable of modifying textures and shaders like Textures Unlimited or\u00A0one of the many Texture Replacers. Do you have TU configs other than TURD?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Delbrutis","CreatedById":144613,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-11-09T07:41:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s Interesting Because I took that screen shot in a completely stock install ? It was a game instance I was using for testing ? I suppose I might have missed deleting a part pack but I am 100% sure it was a clean copy without ever using TU or any configs ? I\u0027m away from my gaming rig at work but I\u0027ll check it on a totally clean install and see what\u0027s going on when I get time. I run under Linux and my batch launcher uses\u00A0 -force-glcore\u00A0\u00A0 Taskset and a bunch of other parameters to optimize the game. Did you test with TU installed and are you windows with DX11 or Glcore? Seems like I remember seeing this chute cord bug before ? I wonder if its a Linux thing?\u00A0 Thank\u0027s for looking into it! Really appreciate it. I\u0027ll\u00A0 do a clean install and try out the fix you posted above\u00A0 when I get a chance probably this Weekend.

The file in the editor and the thumbnail looked jut like the old DDS ? But it loaded in game as solid white. Maybe I screwed something up in the settings converting it back?
