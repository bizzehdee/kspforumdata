Each fleet admiral takes it in turns to move one ship and engage one target, before handing the save file back. All all available ordinance may be fired at a single target, but a second target will have to wait for the next turn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Ships move in order of tonnage (fighters first, destroyers and frigates next, and capitol ships last). Once the three game \u0027phases\u0027 are completed the process is then repeated until all ships are destroyed, or one side withdraws.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese rules are based on the exact wording posted in the episode and if you did not see the episode i would recommend watching it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzqBXKXch6c?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve watched the video many times studying the tactical advantages of each ship class and type. I\u0027ve even designed my ships specifically to avoid some of the problems encountered by both sides. One of these problems I\u0027ve discovered is the reliability of the standard torpedo. They are a hit and miss when it comes to penetration especially when the target is armored. I have found that grouping these torps in sets of at least three makes then far more reliable and close together. They act like a weapon several times more massive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA tactic i would have also taken that may have even prevented the destruction of the Spirit of Kerbin would have been to keep her at a much higher orbit or even near another moon and launch fighters from there. Carriers are not front line fighting platforms they are designed to stay back and support their fighters from a distance. As a rule of thumb if its not armed don\u0027t put it in combat. Keep in mind I\u0027m not rebuking Macey by any means. If his opponent was not suicidal he would have been on top the entire time and considering he was seriously out gunned that is very impressive. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be using actual examples of tactics in naval history listing the uses of these scenarios and how to prevent disaster in your fleet. Also any commentary is welcome even critique and healthy respectful debate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly though I have mentioned Macey\u0027s show and his battles I am not directly affiliated with his page, and i do not represent his views or beliefs on any subject. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EI would however like to discuss some amendments to the combat rules seeing as they will now include the possibility of several different admirals at the same time. I enjoy coming up with gaming mechanics and hold to the standards of the simplest solution tends to be the correct one in most cases. Macey agn this is not an attack on your process but there are a few sections that should be debated a bit including the use of smart missiles, weather initiative should be counted by mass or speed, and should there be special ramming rules to prevent the meaningless loss of Kerbal life? These are just a few of the questions i have encountered in the forums.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-30T11:01:22Z\u0022 title=\u002210/30/2013 11:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 30, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by camulus777\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T16:38:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think ramming should be banned except in Unmanned ships.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Valley","CreatedById":73883,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-06T18:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure I like ramming at all - what happens if a carrier has a load of unmanned drone fighters? They fire their torpedo or missile or what not and than slam into a ship - they could do more damage than the weapons they carry. Heck - a fleet could be all unmanned ships. There has to be rules about tonnage vs. number of crew or something. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso if you have noticed the SpiritWolf/Hanland thread tonnage seems to be all over the place (as does the naming of ships - what I think of as a frigate some people think of as a over-sized fighter). There might be more than one phase!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I like the idea of developing tactics... for example, my testing with my own military craft show that the smallest missile should be able to hit a target from more than 300 meters away, easily, if properly designed and aimed. At that distance the warhead picks up so much speed that a single layer of armor, if too close to the hull, is pretty much useless. Many a pilot died to give me this information. In other words, I think the SpiritWolf and Hanland ships are going to be firing from farther away in future episodes. Otherwise they leave themselves open to a counter attack by the very ship they fired at. Of course, some of the bigger missiles will have the range of a 1 km or more.

Hmmm, it\u0027s tough to see the future of warfare or how Macey will want to deal with scouting and contact and combat range, but for me the carrier is still a must. Just think of it as a mobile resupply base, that\u0027s what carriers are. Once you get it out to where you want it you can launch a wave of attacks on a distant target without putting an expensive 100t (or 140t in the case of the Spirit of Kerbin) target in a direct line of fire. Designing a carrier is a daunting task and though the Spirit of Kerbin is cool its only one of the first designs. There may be a way to maximize a carriers potential so that it is more of a carrier. A few more docking ports on the exterior and you can support some larger fighter craft. A few smaller docking ports and you can put defensive drones to protect against attacks on your carrier. Battleships hare heavily armored and armed and should be maneuverable enough to get a good lock on their target. Carriers in theory don\u0027t even need RCS and can maneuver with a few advanced SAS and gimble. You don\u0027t need to dock them with enough transports and tankers you can use them as the station and just dock things to them. The main reason I separated the carrier sizes is because unlike other ships carriers a tonnage should not include its docked ships. Its got a standard weight that should be observed not including all the fighters and drones and sats attached to it. This should give the carrier an advantage over the larger capitol ships like a real carrier. If you put weapons on the carrier, not including storeable ordnance, those weapons are counted in the base weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gauss H2K","CreatedById":67066,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T00:07:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy SSTOs do have small docking ports, 4 on the heavier class, and 2 on the smallest one. I still just consider them fighters, because they don\u0027t have room for bigger bombs. However I can see them not being anything smaller than medium fighters. As many vessels have their own roles, I would assume your interceptor is meant to reach target coordinates fast and fully armed, whereas these are more of a reconnaissance force more than anything. They each have around 4-4.5 km/s delta v, but their nuclear engines only give slightly above .5 TWR, they can use their radial engines as \u0022afterburners\u0022 that put their TWR ~1.1 at the cost of severely reduced delta v, but combat is combat. I also didn\u0027t put ordinance on my SSTOs because the more effective torpedoes I made started to weigh too much to carry from the runway. Also I thought that it takes like half an hour real time, so a quick interception where speed is important, and there is no time to arm the vessel in orbit would be pointless if it takes that long to reach orbit. This is why I equipped my vessels with nuclear engines, so they could have the delta v after LKO refueling to potentially go to Duna/Laythe, and have more than enough delta v to perform reconnaissance missions.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-08T00:26:50Z\u0022 title=\u002208/08/2013 12:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Gauss H2K\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gauss H2K","CreatedById":67066,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-08T00:13:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would build a central command hub that would be akin to a Supper Carrier/ Refueling Vessel, that would be a forward base, but removed far enough from combat, and be protected by a battlegroup, so that direct attacks from anything less than another carrier battlegroup would be futile.

It replaces my Mk I witch had the same armament on takeoff but cant be rearmed with torpedoes and has no extra docking ports for added modules. It makes a great planetary defense vehicle but would be hard pressed to take out anything with heavy armor. Its cost is low made mostly of wings and smaller inexpensive parts. The new Mk V i am most proud of it is a jet VTOL that can reach orbit, it has 4 smaller docking hardpoints and 2 larger ones with a variety of modules and weapons load-outs. The Mk V only weighs .3 tons more than the Mk IV and Mk VI I got rid of the tail fins that the Mk I\u0027s - III\u0027s had reducing the part count and wight and not hindering its stability at all.
