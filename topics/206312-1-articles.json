I know people have done a whole Jool 5 with a kerbal stuck on a ladder the whole time. For extra safety, I thought I\u0027d stick them in a cargo bay too\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, my attempts were unsuccesful.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022qktXlpZ.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/qktXlpZ.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nso here\u0027s the kerbal, cozy in her protected space\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut the rocket was behaving strange. Like it had a huge aerodinamic problem. I tested this specific rocket a lot of times, and it flies well enough. so I activated aerodinamic overlay\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022Pqbbtxk.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://imgur.com/Pqbbtxk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd look that huge red arrow, that\u0027s the kerbal in the cargo bay, getting aerodinamic drag like she wasn\u0027t protected at all.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nShe also was overheating, though - again - the caargo bay should protect her. It\u0027s clear that the game is modeling the kerbal as if she\u0027s independent from the cargo bay.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce in orbit, the ship was drifting, experiencing a constant push - I guess, when people were talking about the ladder kraken drive, they were describing this exact situation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd finally, it was impossible to time warp. Well, the game is supposed to not let you time warp with a kerbal on a ladder. But, at least in older versions, I was always able to go back to tracking station, and then time warp. And hey, those people doing the jool 5 did manage to time warp in the three years it took to travel.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey also did a laythe atmospheric reentry with the kerbal on a ladder, protected by the rest of the craft. I tested it, and it turns out a kerbal on a ladder is not protected at all, the game models it as a completely independent craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I\u0027m asking, is this something new they did in the later versions that changes how kerbals in eva behave?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd if not, then what is the trick I\u0027m missing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-07T19:26:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe it\u0027s something that was allowable in really early versions of the game that they \u0022corrected\u0022 in later versions.\u00A0 And, based on the description you gave there, it seems this wouldn\u0027t be allowable due to the kraken ladder drive effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"king of nowhere","CreatedById":204876,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-07T19:48:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224074338\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206312\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641583592\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022210112\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scarecrow71\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n20 minutes ago, Scarecrow71 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI believe it\u0027s something that was allowable in really early versions of the game that they \u0022corrected\u0022 in later versions.\u00A0 And, based on the description you gave there, it seems this wouldn\u0027t be allowable due to the kraken ladder drive effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe kraken ladder drive, though, only happened as long as the kerbal was in the cargo bay. if it was on the ladder of the crew pod, there was no problem - i suspect the kraken starts from some small clipping between the comically large helmet of the kerbal and the cargo bay which is just too small to contain it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, even with the kerbal in the \u0022right\u0022 place, being unable to time warp would prevent any mission beyond kerbin orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow71","CreatedById":210112,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-07T20:32:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224074346\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022206312\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221641584936\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022204876\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022king of nowhere\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n41 minutes ago, king of nowhere said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nthe kraken ladder drive, though, only happened as long as the kerbal was in the cargo bay. if it was on the ladder of the crew pod, there was no problem - i suspect the kraken starts from some small clipping between the comically large helmet of the kerbal and the cargo bay which is just too small to contain it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, even with the kerbal in the \u0022right\u0022 place, being unable to time warp would prevent any mission beyond kerbin orbit\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, after re-reading your post that makes total sense in when the kraken shows up.\u00A0 It is honestly too bad that the external command seat isn\u0027t available until way later in the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough, I\u0027m wondering if it may have something to do with WHERE the service module is as much as with the Kerbal\u0027s head being clipped.\u00A0 That module is directly beneath the command pod.\u00A0 What happens if you flip where the service module and the SC-9001 are?\u00A0 Same effect?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EveMaster","CreatedById":199588,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-08T11:20:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA cargo bay does not offer any heat protection at all.
