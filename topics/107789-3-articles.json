The Contract Slot Machine strategy isn\u0027t significantly different from other strategies that modify contract rewards (including stock ones) - it just uses the modifier query to apply a random % modifier.  The key difference is that I don\u0027t have information to tie the rewards to a specific contract, so I just cache it in a Least Recently Used cache using what I have available as a key (which is the Funds/Science/Rep values).  So it\u0027s possible that CapCom is getting the values in such a way that overwhelms the LRU cache (it\u0027s limited to 100 entries).  The other possibility is CapCom does the currency modifier queries differently than stock (stock does a single query for all three currency types, maybe capcom does one each)?\n\nFor reference, this is what the Strategy is using:  \n[https://github.com/jrossignol/Strategia/blob/master/source/Strategia/Effects/CurrencyOperationRandomized.cs](https://github.com/jrossignol/Strategia/blob/master/source/Strategia/Effects/CurrencyOperationRandomized.cs)"},{"CreatedByName":"Rodger","CreatedById":153575,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-21T13:59:58Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 16 minutes ago, nightingale said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Not a bug I\u0027ve ever heard of before, most likely it\u0027s an exception happening when you click the button.

If you still have the same issue there, I suppose it could be a display issue with CapCom.  Do you get strategy modifications displayed correctly for other Strategia strategies that touch contracts?
