If you use a regular 1.25m sized capsule with 1.25m sized heatshield (I\u0027m guessing this is your craft) you can empty pretty much 90% of all the ablator which consumes most of the default weight the heatshield comes with and you still have enough to survive re-entry from the Mun without overheating. If you have no heat intolerant parts you require no heatshields when coming back from the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe reason all that ablator is there to begin with is because the game might think you attempt to do a aerobraking at high interplanetary speed to the Gas Giant Jool among other such places. Such a thing is one of the design implementations one might require in this game, but for aerobraking from the Mun it really isn\u0027t necessary to have all that ablator.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis ablator saving trick saves quite a lot and if you managed to get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to 250km on Kerbin you\u0027ll definitely make it just by removing the ablator.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother tip is that crew capsules hold monopropellant by default which is also weight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you do not use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on board you don\u0027t need this monopropellant, which saves weight and you\u0027ll have a greater mileage albeit marginal.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, you should know that wing segments also work as radiators and protect all parts behind it when strained under re-entry heating. I\u0027m just saying to expand your horizon in terms of build options.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m also saying this because I myself have unorthodox configurations of my SC-9001 science Jr. Sometimes I do a re-entry where weight displacement causes me to bank slightly into the incoming air. Having a heatshield on the bottom of the science instrument bay then fails to protect that part anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo often I just put a wing segment on the science jr. Firstly this acts as a radiator so it doesn\u0027t blow up, secondly it actually shields it from the air assuming you can actuate your vessel during aerobraking so that the wing covering heat intolerant parts can actually shield it properly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is trickier because you\u0027ll have to know how to balance lift versus weight for which no mod is needed by the way. Lots of blablabla but maybe you don\u0027t like wings on a rocket upper stage. It\u0027s just a design option I use myself very often that I wanted to get of my plate, maybe you like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystifeid","CreatedById":187479,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-08-30T13:40:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did that tutorial without a heat shield (did some aerobraking) and the only extras I took were: a battery, two radial drogue chutes, a reaction wheel and two solar panels.

If you use a regular 1.25m sized capsule with 1.25m sized heatshield (I\u0027m guessing this is your craft) you can empty pretty much 90% of all the ablator which consumes most of the default weight the heatshield comes with and you still have enough to survive re-entry from the Mun without overheating. If you have no heat intolerant parts you require no heatshields when coming back from the Mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe reason all that ablator is there to begin with is because the game might think you attempt to do a aerobraking at high interplanetary speed to the Gas Giant Jool among other such places. Such a thing is one of the design implementations one might require in this game, but for aerobraking from the Mun it really isn\u0027t necessary to have all that ablator.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis ablator saving trick saves quite a lot and if you managed to get \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Periapsis\u0022\u003EPe\u003C/abbr\u003E to 250km on Kerbin you\u0027ll definitely make it just by removing the ablator.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnother tip is that crew capsules hold monopropellant by default which is also weight.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you do not use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on board you don\u0027t need this monopropellant, which saves weight and you\u0027ll have a greater mileage albeit marginal.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, you should know that wing segments also work as radiators and protect all parts behind it when strained under re-entry heating. I\u0027m just saying to expand your horizon in terms of build options.\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0027m also saying this because I myself have unorthodox configurations of my SC-9001 science Jr. Sometimes I do a re-entry where weight displacement causes me to bank slightly into the incoming air. Having a heatshield on the bottom of the science instrument bay then fails to protect that part anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo often I just put a wing segment on the science jr. Firstly this acts as a radiator so it doesn\u0027t blow up, secondly it actually shields it from the air assuming you can actuate your vessel during aerobraking so that the wing covering heat intolerant parts can actually shield it properly.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is trickier because you\u0027ll have to know how to balance lift versus weight for which no mod is needed by the way. Lots of blablabla but maybe you don\u0027t like wings on a rocket upper stage. It\u0027s just a design option I use myself very often that I wanted to get of my plate, maybe you like this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThank you!
