Entry appears to be pretty ballistic most of the time; I can\u0027t affect the direction by much until I\u0027ve slowed down to \u0026lt;1500m/s \u003Cspan\u003E@ \u003C/span\u003E30km or so. At that time, my cross-range capability is limited to perhaps 500km. So, in order to return to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E, I need a reentry that at least hits Florida.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven though I can\u0027t affect direction by much, I\u0027m pretty sure that I have a lot of freedom regarding the length of the trajectory. That is, starting from the same PE/AP I can fall short and and come down at the longitude of the Mississippi, or overshoot to Bermuda. \u003Cstrong\u003EI figure that I should be capable of making it to any point in between, but I don\u0027t really know how.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould anyone advise me on what to do (and which metrics to watch) in order to make my landing in the designated landing area?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ARS","CreatedById":168061,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-30T07:47:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAerobrake several times. Don\u0027t commence reentry directly from orbit if you cannot slow your craft enough for precision landing. Aerobrake (lowest point in orbit is inside atmosphere but not getting into the ground) allows you to slow your craft down for a more controlled landing. If you want an extra help, installing \u003Cstrong\u003ETrajectories\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0mod helps a lot since it gives you in-atmosphere rough trajectory estimation where you touchdown\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Foxster","CreatedById":113764,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-30T09:52:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo air-breathing engines on the craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-30T11:11:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223339508\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022173241\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221522403523\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022113764\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Foxster\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Foxster said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo air-breathing engines on the craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNope. Think DynaSoar, or Space Shuttle. More generally, this question isn\u0027t about how I could work around the issue by adding more stuff, but about how to use the stuff I have: namely, quite a bit of wing which should give me a lot of cross-range capability... if I only knew how to use it well.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings I figured out in the mean time (should\u0027ve been obvious, but ...well):\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\npitch to brake.

I recall having heard of planes that were supposed to skip along the upper atmo, so i guess it allows for a longer range... at least for a while. But every time you come back down, you do so at a steeper angle than before.

On the other hand, controlling how much surface area of your craft being exposed with atmospheric drag is crucial in determining whether you can pull off successful aerobrake or your craft getting spinning out of control. Exposing too small surface area would result overshooting your landing site, and exposing too large surface area would result your craft stalling\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bornholio","CreatedById":173101,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-03-30T11:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you are using trajectories it is important to know that it assumes the l/d and drag will remain stable, that is the orientation you have at each point it is calculating.\u00A0 If you are using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E it has \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E tools for seeing the stability and drag.
