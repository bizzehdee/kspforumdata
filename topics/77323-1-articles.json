I\u0027m trying to figure out the most efficient way to bring materials up from the surface to the yard. I\u0027m debating whether to make it a zero inclination and have all my supply ships burn for the equator, or set the construction yard at a higher inclination so that it can pass over more real estate. The way I see it, with zero inclination, I can launch my supply craft anytime and link up, but with a high inclination orbit, my windows will be limited. Any help would be appreciated...\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
