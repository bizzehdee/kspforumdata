I am going into college soon and think that I have narrowed down my prospective fields of study into a subject I hope to have a career in someday. As you can probably guess from the title, that falls under Astrophysics and Planetary astronomy- specifically the formation of the planets, theoretical planet formation, things that could have influenced the formation history and current orbital positions of the planets in our sky, etc. I am looking into universities in the state of Michigan with a decent program at least in astrophysics. I was wondering if their were any recommendations for schools besides U of M, MSU and CMU that have good programs in these fields. I was also wondering what sort of careers that a major/ minor in these areas could land me. I love to research this sort of stuff and the theoretical work allows some room for creativity and imagination that fits in with how we understand the natural world, enough to make a research position interesting. Any help here is greatly appreciated!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UmbralRaptor","CreatedById":2767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-20T04:13:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour undergraduate school doesn\u0027t matter that much, as long as it has a decent physics and/or geology program.
