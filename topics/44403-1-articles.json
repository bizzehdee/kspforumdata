Activate the action group as soon as the physics engine releases your rocket. Alternatively, you could try the cubic octagonal strut trick I mentioned earlier.

Again, you\u0027d need to set it up to decouple as an action group.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight also try one of the large stack seperators to see if you get any improved results.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have to question why you would want to set your staging up in that particular way. As a rule an engine in the center stack provides your rocket with some stability (meaning it doesn\u0027t spin around like a damn blender when you go to launch the stupid thing). If the idea is to conserve fuel for a later engine, you could get the same effect by putting the big fuel tank below the decoupler - it\u0027d give you a much simpler setup.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"M4ck","CreatedById":74138,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T21:03:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can get rid of the problem and have the exact same part in the end(even without the now unneeded fuel line) bu using a Sr docking port oriented the docking side up, instead of the decoupler.
