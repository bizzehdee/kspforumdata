Better yet if there is an easy non mod way to accomplish this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve restarted my campaign game from scratch many times now, usually \u00A0to try different mods or to recover from buggy behavior that wouldn\u0027t quit. I don\u0027t really mind starting from scratch, and I\u0027d rather play campaign than sandbox mode.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am aware you can fairly easily save game edit money, repuation, science points.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I am a bit if a perfectionists, \u00A0and I hate having to recollect the actual \u00A0science \u00A0that I earn, so is there a way to \u00A0backup the specific research along with the science /research unlocks?\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso it would be nice to save your roster of kerbals, along with their \u00A0experience gains, I\u0027m not aware of an easy way to accomplish \u00A0this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn short, I can always use a mod\u00A0like hyperedit to restore a sat\u00A0relay network, or other craft position, but I would love a way to start a campaign with a saved roster, science \u0026amp; research achivements, and throwing in funds and reputation wouldn\u0027t hurt.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
