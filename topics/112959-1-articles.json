Picture in the post. \n\nNow that I\u0027ve run out of fuel I need to get a rescue mission going to get him back! This is what is great about this game, there is always a reason why a plan doesn\u0027t work, and tweaking one thing leads to unexpected consequences somewhere else which requires more tweaking. Thanks to the community I can always get help and that keeps me going. \n\n![GEYId87](http://imgur.com/GEYId87)\n\nTin Pot Koala\n\n![GEYId87.png](http://i.imgur.com/GEYId87.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-14T20:00:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/14/2015 08:00  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 14, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde**\n  \nPic fix."},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T20:01:50Z","Content":"Welcome TinPotKoala. \n\nThe Imgur link you want to copy and use here is the BBCode one.
