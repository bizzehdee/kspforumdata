This worked the first time I tried it; the separate units floated down: the command module landed first and then I could watch the passenger cabins splash down and I recovered them and got my cash.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen on one trip I was a bit high when I split the modules. I was watching the passenger modules float down from the command module view and at some point on the way down (pretty close to the ground actually) the view flipped by itself and the passenger modules disappeared. When I went to the tracking station they had gone. The tourists were gone, nowhere to be seen. Not in the astronaut complex or anything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI concluded that the modules must have drifted too far away from the command module and that ksp \u0022cleaned them up\u0022 or something, so on the next trip I waited until the last minute before splitting the modules.

As long as everything stays within that radius of you\u00A0it will all be carefully modeled, because it\u0027s within the physics bubble.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, you said there was one special thing about your situation.\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003EYou said your command pod had the focus and had just landed.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0The default physics bubble size for a landed vessel is\u00A0\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eonly 300 meters.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, a few seconds after you land, the game changes the physics bubble size.

It\u0027s not quite clear to me why it worked a few times without doing this, but maybe I was just lucky. I also set the capsule parachute to open higher than the cabins so it lands last. I added some extra boosters to give me more fuel for a deceleration burn and that allowed me to leave activating the decouplers to the last minute (about 20km); the parts then usually stay within 1.5km of each other. Finally, after touchdown I wait a bit for things to settle, recover the capsule and then the two cabins via the tracking station.
