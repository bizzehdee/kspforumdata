Whilst, yes, this does allow me to use my thumbstick to control my craft, it is still treating it like key strokes rather than an stick. there is no 0-100% for it. If u slightly nudge the thumbstick it still goes full tilt so there is currently no benefit for me to fly with the controller.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nTheres got to be something i am missing?

I\u0027m having spotty success getting my steam controller working, even though the game seems to detect it, and gives me status notices about the steam controller shifting to menu/flight/etc. modes. In fact, I\u0027ve gotten it to work as a flight control exactly once so far. I\u0027ll give up for now this morning, but I was wondering if you found any success on this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
