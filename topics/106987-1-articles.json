I play on hardcore mode, with a few delay-tactic mods (RemoteTech, Kerbal Construction Time, etc.) Even without mods, the Sci and Fund awards for contracts and accomplishments are nerfed, and penalties and costs are higher. These suborbital tourism contracts are the only things that can reliably get me past a few key humps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome tips, though -- test all craft designs, even small changes, before loading tourists (even at normal difficulty, reputation penalties for losing one are substantial). Also, multi-tourist contracts help a lot too. Even with Mk1 pods, the upside is that you have benefit of all that torque, often before SAS modules, RCS, or steering fins get unlocked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you make your first orbit, however, most of the tourists start asking to go to orbit with you, and incorporating detours to Mun and Minmus. Without docking ports or RCS yet, those are generally not yet feasible for me on T3 tech, so it does pay to read the contracts before accepting them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jadis","CreatedById":17957,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T08:36:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone!
