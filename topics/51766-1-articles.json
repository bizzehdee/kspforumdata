I want to make sure he comes home. I would like to request help with figuring the total \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv I need for the entire mission, point-by-point. I\u0027m not terribly good at math, but I can usually figure formulas out, so feel free to give me whatever you have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, I\u0027m needing to figure out how much \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv I need for each stage. I\u0027ve started at the end of the mission and am working backwards, so I have so much for aerocapture and deorbit, so much for return to Kerbin from Eve, so much for Eve orbital maneuvers (which includes releasing a probe, releasing a robot lander, and sending a Kerbal to land on Gilly), and then so much for transfer from Kerbin to Eve. If I can figure those out, I can do the rest. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom what I\u0027m reading, he\u0027s calling for a Kerbin ejection of 1039m/s, a course correction burn of 5, and an Eve insertion of 722 for a total of 1766m/s. Then to come home it\u0027s 616m/s ejection, 129 correction, and 1071 for Kerbin insertion, totalling 1817m/s. Which would make the mission total, before Eve orbital work and Kerbin deorbit, 3583m/s. How accurate is this, and how close can I cut it? Should I increase my \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv budget by a certain amount for insurance? (Note, I begin in a 100km Kerbin orbit and finish at a 50,000km Eve orbit; I know that\u0027s awfully high but it fits my mission parameters better than dropping to a low Eve orbit and then having to ascend again.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI fiddled around in the VAB this afternoon and came up with a transfer stage with about 8km/s, before adding the aforementioned landers and probe. I was worried it wasn\u0027t going to be enough, but this looks like it\u0027ll be about double!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, any tips would be appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-04T02:00:21Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2013 02:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Barefoot Friar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Specialist290","CreatedById":58489,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-03T23:41:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour math sounds about right, but I\u0027d like to add a few notes and caveats:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The calculator generally assumes a machine-perfect transfer, which is extremely difficult for a human being to execute manually using stock-only tools, so I\u0027d definitely include a little extra buffer fuel, just to be on the safe side. Usually about 25-50% extra delta-v (which doesn\u0027t exactly correlate to 25-50% extra fuel mass, but that\u0027s a whole different topic of discussion) for your transfer stage is a safe estimate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. On the other hand, you\u0027ve got an atmosphere at both of your destinations, meaning you can reduce the delta-v for insertion considerably using a technique called \u0022aerobraking\u0022 -- basically, you dip partway into your target planet\u0027s atmosphere to let air drag slow your craft down, allowing you to save fuel. That means that you can effectively almost zero out the insertion requirements if you perform your aerobraking correctly, although it\u0027s probably a good idea to carry a little bit of reserve fuel (or use your leftover maneuver reserve) anyway, just in case you need it (for instance, for correcting your trajectory after reloading your quicksave upon discovering that your first aerobraking pass takes you straight into Eve\u0027s surface \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E ).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Since you\u0027re releasing both a probe and a robot lander (and possibly a separate manned lander, if that\u0027s a different vehicle from the Kerbin return vehicle you\u0027re using), your final vehicle is going to be lighter leaving Eve than it was arriving. Thus, you can probably cut your Kerbin return delta-v estimates a little closer than you would for just a single there-and-back craft, since your engines won\u0027t have nearly as much mass to push back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, an 8k transfer stage should definitely be enough to make it to Eve and back, even if your piloting gets a bit sloppy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Barefoot Friar","CreatedById":77638,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-04T02:00:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAwesome, thanks!
