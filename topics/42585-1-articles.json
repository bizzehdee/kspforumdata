Warning these are the ramblings of a middle aged nutter with aviation experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. With the proposed tech tree and R\u0026amp;D building been worked on I propose for discusion that we have a wind tunnel test facility added (obviously in time). After installing Kerbal 1, Bobcats excellent Soviet Pack and the CSS Shuttle mods the wings with those mods are significantly better than those available in the stock packs and the B9 mod. Could we have a wing design option along the lines of what the team behind procedural fairings have done with there recent release and they offer a semi bespoke fairing design (big thumbs up for that). Could that process be implimented to work with wings? I personally dont know I have absolute zero programming skills but the idea of having a plan and head on view of a wing to then test in a wing tunnel would be an advantage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the advent of CAD more conceptural work is being done CFD computer fluid dynamics which if any F1 fans will remember from Virgin Racings debut season didnt give the results that matched real world parameters, hemce why I suggest that the new R\u0026amp;D building adopts the use of a wind tunnel to cross reference CFD\u0027s findings. This process if done succesfully could improve a players Aerodynamic traits and would certainly add more science to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Personal annoyance I have with the MK 3 cockpit, its ugly and in my opinion needs a big overhaul and a lot of love.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Landing gear systems in stock need embelishing to provide a light / medium / and heavy undercarraige option.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. PAPI\u0027s (precision approach path indicator - 3\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0) should be a standard fit at KSP and not a mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Stock robotic arm nad not a mod, regardless of how excellent they are. I personally use Ronfarers mod, excellent work. Infact if NASA have it we should have an equivilant as stock (in time) and that should include a stock auto pilot.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENationality Idea,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs Kerbin a single nation planet?, probably not. What would be the chance of been able to select a Kerbal nation, with differing traits regarding its space programme. For example NASA would be refined technically and well funded, ESA have good lift capabilities with efficiency, RSA would have heavy / massive lift capabilities and rugged design. Also would there be scope to including private companies, Space X and Burt Rutans Scalled Composites. JAXA (Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, formed in 2003) and other nations such as chinese and Indian equivalent agencies could be added in as a more challenging side to the game were you have to develop your own facilities alongside a market share of the available business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow there are my thoughts, even at this early stage of the game its fantastic and has massive scope for the future WELL DONE.\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Outlander4","CreatedById":20008,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T13:25:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E1 and 3 - spaceplanes update is planned; I am sure some of your concern will be addressed.
