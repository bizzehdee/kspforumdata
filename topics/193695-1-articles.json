I mean, they look very bad being in space, or in an eva in a body without an atmosphere. I don\u0027t see any command to remove them (like helmets) ... I would prefer an answer that is typical of the game, not a mod ... and if there is no way ... what \u0022simple\u0022 mod does it?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2-drastically change everything, from the values of a tank to new things ... I take it into account not to use anything \u0022old\u0022 (my old ships). but the biggest problem was the graphics .... before with verion 1.2.2, the RAM reached up to 3-4 gb .... now it reaches up to 6gb! from ram ... WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHING ON MY PC, and the fps fell very, very much ...\u003Cbr\u003E\nespecially with the fps is where I need help, being in space, if I look at kerbin, it slows down a lot ... to the limit of the \u0022yellow letters\u0022 of the clock ... even lowering the graphics to the absolute minimum, it is like this.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you have any trick, mod, community guide or whatever helps to improve the fps, please do not hesitate to answer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks a lot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-07T18:14:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m recently returned, myself.\u00A0 I find the game so different that I\u0027m having to relearn almost everything again - which is fun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThey\u0027ve added quite a bit visually since I was last here, and that kind of stuff tends to be pretty demanding on a system.\u00A0 I\u0027m certain that much of the other stuff (not visuals) is also pulling at system resources.\u00A0 Thankfully - I\u0027ve (kinda) kept up pace through the years with my system builds (also playing on a desktop not a laptop) - so my system can handle KSP in its current state... but like you, I see it struggling a bit at times.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d suggest playing with the settings.\u00A0 Turn off the usual stuff that drags at games and see if it helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs far as the \u0027don\u0027t like the \u0027chute in space thing\u0027 - I don\u0027t think that\u0027s part of Vanilla.\u00A0 Good luck resolving it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AHHans","CreatedById":197939,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-07T19:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223781992\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193695\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221588871510\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022178603\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022pipi22\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 hours ago, pipi22 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1-how do i remove the eva parachutes from the kerbales?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean the backpack with the parachutes?
