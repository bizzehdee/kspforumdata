Is it possible to add a \u0022built-in heatshield\u0022 for this vessel? I don\u0027t know anything about programming so I appreciate if somebody could help!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SZDarkhack","CreatedById":57439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T20:47:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022andqui\u0022 data-cite=\u0022andqui\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EShould I be doing anything differently? I can\u0027t really slow down much more- did I come in too shallow, resulting in too gradual deceleration and too much prolonged heating? Is there a different perigee altitude I should use? I\u0027m afraid that if I come in steeper I\u0027ll either not slow down in time or pull too many G\u0027s in reentry.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not an expert on DRE or anything, but you might want to come in a bit more steeply. I think the problem here is that, although the shield is heating up, there is not enough density to really get the ablation going (refer to Nathan\u0027s post above). Try a perigee of around 35k-45k from LEO. Around that value you get a maximum of around 8G deceleration (which the probe should be able to handle comfortably, even a manned capsule is fine with it).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a more technical explanation of the issue, an ablative heatshield isn\u0027t supposed to \u003Cstrong\u003Einsulate\u003C/strong\u003E the craft from the heat, but rather \u003Cstrong\u003Eremove\u003C/strong\u003E heat via ablation. If the ablation doesn\u0027t happen fast enough to remove the heat, it will flow through the shield and damage it (and the craft).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FlowerChild","CreatedById":74289,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T21:18:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NathanKell\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NathanKell\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe good news: I finished an update to DRE.
