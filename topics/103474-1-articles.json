You have a couple of options regarding how to actually plug the bits together in orbit. Some people will take the module they are installing, add a probe core, torque, power and rcs, then launch it, rendezvous with the assembly point and use the rcs to dock it to the ship under construction. The drawback to this method is that every module must have control, torque, rcs, power, all that stuff. Once your ship is assembled you then more than likely have to disable some rcs ports and torque rings to make the craft balanced. In the longrun this reduces the dV of the finished ship by a bit due to the dead-weight of unnecessary parts (not to mention escalating the part-count)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid over-engineering each module like this you can either mount a small docking tug to it and then strap on the launcher, or make the upper-stage of the launcher into the tug. This lets you launch each module exactly as you want it to be on the finished ship, without superfluous control mechanisms. The beauty of this method for me is that you only need 1 tug, usually sent up with the second launch. Future launches can drop immobile/uncontrollable modules next to the assembly and the tug can then slot them in. It takes a little practice to design a tug suitable for installing a variety of modules, its RCS/torque needs to be well balanced with somewhat varying dimensions/masses of module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as splitting it into reasonable modules I tend to launch the control unit first, this is capsules/pods/probe cores, batteries/solar and RCS tanks (since they ignore fuel-flow rules). I then add the fuel section, which isnt particularly easy to break up further if you are planning on dropping tankage during your mission (highly advised). Anything that is going to involve a fuel-line needs to be 1 module for instance, since you cant set these up after the VAB, likewise anything on decouplers. I then usually launch the drive section last since engines are massy (though compact). If your craft is to carry landers, satellites, anything like this then these can be plugged into their docking ports once everything else is assembled. Remember to leave a port free if you need to refuel any of the tanks in low kerbin orbit, i usually refuel through the nose where my lander will ultimately sit. Dont be scared to launch empty/part-empty fuel tanks if the mass of a module is getting too much for your launch vehicles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@juanml82: Those wings are probably cosmetic, they are well overblown even assuming he has FAR and might need aerodynamic stability at some point. They look pretty pimp, so I think we\u0027ll let him off. If you look really close, I suspect he has landing gear mounted on the end of each fin, which in that case is designed to clear the mainsail and let him land the mothership. His Ions are probably meant for fine-tuning, you are quite right in assuming day-long burns. The mainsail on the back of that ship will be too overpowered to fine-tune distant intercepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe RCS is probably so that the individual modules of his ship can undock and rearrange themselves, if you look carefully you realise every independant section has its own RCS fuel/ports, probe core and Torque. Finally, RCS is oft-overlooked as an actual propulsion method. With the number of ports on that thing he can thrust harder with RCS than the Ions and it becomes a third propulsion option.

It was first because the engines could not have any stages below them - this module was flown up \u0022backwards\u0022 that is, engines facing forward and placed into a 100x100 parking orbit. It came with a pair of LV-Ns for deep space efficiency and a pair of LV-T30s for critical maneuvers where higher TWR was needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe second module docked to the first was the fuel module. It had a lot of extra fuel tanks which could be staged off radially - feeding into a central fuel tank to fuel the core engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third module was the science kit, it was a central section with all the science instruments that I wanted to bring along, and a handful of probes as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELastly the cockpit flew up with the crew, could position and dock itself (had RCS) and connected to the mother-ship.

Each module may have its own control mechanism, but that needs to be disabled in favor of the central one. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother idea is to have each of the modules be kinda dumb - no probe core or SAS - and use a reusable tug to connect all the modules.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, since all the module will be docked together, there will be some stretch and wiggle - make sure you don\u0027t have too much thrust, or the thing will be really unruly to pilot!
