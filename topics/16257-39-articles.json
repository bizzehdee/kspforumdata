Remember that you can do both; if you\u0027re putting satellites with antennas up in orbit, you might as well slap some dishes on them for later use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhere do I need the signal?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027ve decided you want to launch many satellites around a particular planet, e.g. Kerbin, you\u0027re going to want coverage with antennas. You want to do this with as few satellites as possible. Using strong antennas will help, of course, but the main challenge is to stop the planet you\u0027re orbiting from blocking the signal. Two satellites orbiting a planet can provide perfect coverage if they are exactly opposite each other in the same equatorial orbit, but they can\u0027t send a signal to each other (as the planet is right in between), which means you\u0027ll usually want to have three satellites space out 120 degrees, instead. To give you a better margin of error with satellite placement, consider use of four satellites. These designs will not cover the poles at very low altitudes (within the atmosphere, on Kerbin), but this is not a big deal for most purposes. Keep in mind that when you use dishes, a dish can still be blocked by Kerbin. If you have two satellites at opposite points in a rotation, one will always be clear while the other is obscured, guaranteeing a signal to a probe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWhere is the signal going to come from?\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn most cases, your signal is going to come from Kerbal Space Center. To get it \u003Cem\u003Eanywhere\u003C/em\u003E reliably, then, you will always need a satellite to be within range of KSC. The most efficient way to do this is to place a single satellite in geostationary orbit over KSC (there are guides on other parts of the forum on good ways to do this), so it will always be overhead and able to relay the signal to the rest of your network. For missions to far-off planets, you may consider having a manned spaceship with a RemoteCommand module in an orbit nearby. If this ship can form a shorter connection to the probe, it will do so, potentially saving use of satellite dishes and reducing the communication delay that results from the signal having to travel long distances.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can do it in other ways, of course.

Dish point becomes relevant when relaying a stream to the Mun or beyond. the dipoles are effectively omnidirectional. Assuming you time your placements right with 4 KeoSynced sats the distance between them will be ~4549km, just under the 5000km limit of the dipole, so they should network just fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RKHVTC","CreatedById":71959,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T23:52:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jasonhpickering\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jasonhpickering\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo if I have dishes in orbit around kerbin, can I just set their target as Minmus to talk to the dishes there, or is it better to target specific Sats.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou can safely and reliably target Minmus and Vice versa\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MR4Y","CreatedById":66897,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-30T23:55:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd what about the drone?
