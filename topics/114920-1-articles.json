However it\u0027s not possible to make any larger (or smaller) heat shields like the ones you see in the movie Sunshine with the ship \u003Cem\u003EIcarus\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.worldofspaceships.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/sunshine1.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sunshine1.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe current heat shield sizes also assumes that the ship attached behind it is in a linear configuration and doesn\u0027t leave a lot of design options to make the ship more controllable by moving components in a flat configuration and thus shifting the CoM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/IMAGES/HIGH/8667000.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00228667000.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus I propose having procedural heat shields added to the game. I have several points on why this is a good thing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Stock procedural fairings are a positive proof of concept where you can procedurally cover portions of a craft to protect it from heat and aero forces. The same can be applied to heat shields.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Having procedural heat shields allow for more diverse ship designs and to allow for landers to have encompassing heat shields. Small probes will have heat shields that match their size too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Procedural heat shields reduce the part count. There will be no need to spam heat shielding on the bottom of crafts to cover every protruding part. You could have, only a single large heat shield to cover it all. (This of course increases the weight the larger the shield is).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. It is aesthetically pleasing on craft, even when not used for heat shielding, they can be regarded as meteor shields. It\u0027s nice to look at \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat does the community think of this?
