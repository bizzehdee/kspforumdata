They\u0027re the only part that has problems.\n\n![VYvtlD5.png](http://i.imgur.com/VYvtlD5.png)\n\nWhen I\u0027m coming in, I keep the nose pitched up between 15 and 20 degrees. I have two tail fins and two sets of wings and strakes where the top set of control surfaces raises like flaps and the tail fins open to either side for drag. I also raise all 6 air brakes. The wing strakes are the only part that heat to an unacceptable level and explode . . . the rest of the re-entry is fine but it\u0027s difficult to land without that extra lift.\n\nCan anyone provide any input?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T02:38:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Styles2304**\n  \nSwitched to answered for lack of a better option"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T13:51:26Z","Content":"I think that it\u0027s because the strakes are too high blast of heat from your reentry. Try reentering from lowest possible orbit and with a very shallow trajectory."},{"CreatedByName":"Styles2304","CreatedById":109841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T14:09:14Z","Content":"I\u0027ll give it a shot . . . as shallow as possible."},{"CreatedByName":"ainurakne","CreatedById":140862,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T14:27:57Z","Content":"I have the exact same problem with the same parts with pretty similarly shaped shuttle-like spaceplane.\n\nI have tried my descent many times over and over, using heat debug colors/temperatures to see what\u0027s going on, and they always get really hot and go \\*poof\\* much before the reentry effects kick in. At the time everything around them remains relatively cool.\n\nIt seems there are some problems with heat flux for this part - for some reason it absorbs heat really fast but gives it out very poorly, compared to other parts. I have thought about raising its heat capacity by filling it up with liquid fuel, but haven\u0027t had time to test it out yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Screeno","CreatedById":141893,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T15:44:48Z","Content":"You have to pitch high in the thin atmosphere, as soon as you get in, pitch 45 and see how that shaves loads of speed in the upper atmosphere ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Styles2304","CreatedById":109841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T18:03:22Z","Content":"I\u0027m going to run some more test flights before I settle on the design so I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t get my ship back to KSC and then I\u0027ll try another flight with fuel in the strakes.

It was a really close call as the temperature of those wing strakes rose up to over 1800 degrees, but fortunately the speed was already low enough by that time. So it is doable, but really hard.\n\nI guess what amplifies the problem is that the wing strakes are attached to the cargo bay, which is hollow and thus has less thermal capacity, which means it gets hot faster than non-hollow parts (which was also visible using the thermal debug overlay). So the wing strakes that already have quite low thermal capacity have nowhere to conduct their heat to."},{"CreatedByName":"Styles2304","CreatedById":109841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:55:56Z","Content":"I was wondering about that. It seems almost like the cargo Bay is using the strike as a radiator. I\u0027ll see if I can come up with some sort jury rigged solution to offset the heat"},{"CreatedByName":"Styles2304","CreatedById":109841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T00:42:01Z","Content":"So here\u0027s my report:\n\nI attached the strakes to the big-s delta wing and maneuvered it into place, no change. I filled them with fuel, survived! But barely. The cargo hold was quite yellow also. \n\nLastly, I replaced the strakes with structural wings type A. They barely heated, the craft over all didn\u0027t change color...

Here\u0027s a diff between Type A wings and Big-A strakes part.cfg:\n\nBig-A strakes have \u0022heatConductivity = 0.06\u0022, which is half the 0.12 default value.\n\nThey also have \u0022dragAtMaxAoA = 0.6\u0022 compared to 0.3 for the Type A wings\n\nIt\u0027s probably the HeatConductivity flag. The Big shuttle Delta wing also has the same half-value heatConductivity, but it\u0027s so huge (and fuel filled) that perhaps it doesn\u0027t matter?"},{"CreatedByName":"Styles2304","CreatedById":109841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-01T13:04:39Z","Content":"I can only assume it\u0027s bugged.
