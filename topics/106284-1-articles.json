The wing strakes are the only part that heat to an unacceptable level and explode . . . the rest of the re-entry is fine but it\u0027s difficult to land without that extra lift.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECan anyone provide any input?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-01T02:38:31Z\u0022 title=\u002205/01/2015 02:38  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Styles2304\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003ESwitched to answered for lack of a better option\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"InterCity","CreatedById":98462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T13:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that it\u0027s because the strakes are too high blast of heat from your reentry.

It was a really close call as the temperature of those wing strakes rose up to over 1800 degrees, but fortunately the speed was already low enough by that time. So it is doable, but really hard.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess what amplifies the problem is that the wing strakes are attached to the cargo bay, which is hollow and thus has less thermal capacity, which means it gets hot faster than non-hollow parts (which was also visible using the thermal debug overlay). So the wing strakes that already have quite low thermal capacity have nowhere to conduct their heat to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Styles2304","CreatedById":109841,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T21:55:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI was wondering about that.
