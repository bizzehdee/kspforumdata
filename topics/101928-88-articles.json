Specifically, 1.2.6 was incompatible with a certain mod (could not pin down which one, will attempt to do so later after work).  I tried installing the oldest version available on Github as someone on reddit in an older thread suggested to that OP to no avail.  Checking out the debug menu at the time of bug showed exceptions of attempting to load 1.2.5 but failing.  It did not list KIS as 1.2.5, but after checking the exact current and recent versions of KIS and going off of what others have said about KIS being related to this issue, I installed 1.2.5 from Github and POOF, no more duplicate Kerbals.\n\nFor future people that may experience this problem after installing a bunch of random addons/mods from CKAN: try uninstalling KIS to make sure that it IS part of the problem, then download 1.2.5.
