I think it\u0027s simply crazy and those shouldn\u0027t be controllable since you have put those in correctly orbit. And obviously this speech extend to space stations, you should have control only when you put it in orbit or when you add more modules. Absolutely not every time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think about?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T19:58:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think this has come up a few times.
