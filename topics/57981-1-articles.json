Any help would be amazing!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI made this pretty simple ship. I put 2 decouplers on it, one to separate the main stage and another to separate the capsule from the secondary rocket. I set up my stages to burn the liquid engines, then boosters, then activate decoupler 1, burn the last liquid engine, then activate decoupler 2. My problem is that when I launch, the first decoupler activates with the first set of liquid engines. Please!
