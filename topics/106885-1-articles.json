The tech tree was pretty illogical back then (and still is now) and really needs some work. There\u0027s also a bit of a grind in the early game to get enough science for the parts you need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe new contracts, funds and reputation mechanics are pretty broken at this point IMHO.

There\u0027s a few moments of brilliance in the early-mid game when you manage to pull off your first few Mun missions with limited parts, but before that point the game is too limiting so you have to grind to get the parts you need to advance and once you get to the Mun/Minmus you can easily get all the science you need to unlock the entire tree, so it ends up being basically sandbox mode anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s been a few mods to rebalance career (SETI is my favorite) but none of them have been updated for 1.0 yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would recommend at least trying out a regular career at least once just to form your own impressions, but for maximum enjoyment I would recommend doing what worir4 said in his post (use the debug menu to give yourself funds and science so you don\u0027t have to grind).

Hell, if you install mechjeb you don\u0027t even have to do anything, you can just click \u0027GO TO SPACE\u0027 and get a bagel. In career I have to manage my science, contracts and funding, and keep an eye on reputation if I want to make sure my program stays profitable.
