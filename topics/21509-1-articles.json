This feat has been brought to you by our very own project HIVE(Hyper Injection, Velocity \u0026amp; Efficiency).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy using advanced rocketry design, and staging with efficient engine types at all stages the drain on our fuel resources should be minimised so long as you keep to the bellow flight plan.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBegin the first part of the launch at 100% throttle, the air breathing turbo jet engines will take a few seconds to reach high enough thrust for lift off.. keep your heading at 90\u0027 and Pitch at 90\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery 3000meters in Altitude reached reduce your pitch by 10\u0027, until you reach 50\u0027 @ 12000m, then at 13000m please start the Airospike stage, keep holding 50\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Apoapsis reaches 80kms perform a MECO, alter your pitch to 20\u0027 and hold until you are about 5 seconds from Apoapsis at which point you should start your burn to ride the AP until your trajectory reaches 90\u0027 around Kerbin from the space centre.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs your trajectory reaches this point you will need to start the high efficiency Nuclear stage and also at the same time alter your Pitch to between 60\u0027 and 70\u0027, this should allow you to continue to increase your orbit whilst saving fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease keep an eye on the AP, and if it gets further rather than slowing down please decreases your pitch by 5\u0027 or 10\u0027 each time until you reach a pitch of around 10\u0027 only then should you start slowing down to ride the AP. Keep riding the AP until you reach a nice 80km orbit, but keep an eye on the fuel, as you will need to drop those 4 main tanks when they empty, and that could happen at any time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter circularising your orbit, begin a 100% pro-grade burn when the Mun rises over Kerbin, keep an eye on your pro-grade heading, and cut the engines when you reach your intersection with the Mun. I generally use this time to slowly alter my heading with very small burns either pro or retro grade and bring my Periapsis on my Mun encounter down to 10kms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow you sit back and wait until you reach the Muner Periapsis, at which point you burn 100 where your current retrograde maker is until your Retrograde marker moves most of the way upto the top of the nav ball, then follow it up and begin landing\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter that its just a hop skip and a jump back to Kerbin for your fabulous return! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://ksp.sjwt.org/2012-10-07/screenshot01.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot01.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.sjwt.org/2012-10-07/Vespertilio%20MkI.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:18px;\u0022\u003EVespertilio MkI\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStuart Kerman, President of SKRAM - bringing you tomorrows engineering problems today!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpcoming projects from SKRAM include an interplanetary return craft.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T18:26:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESo many decouplers!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sjwt","CreatedById":9268,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-07T04:28:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Giggleplex777\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESo many decouplers!\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, I felt it looked nicer than using the longer decouplers, and gave a more stable base!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
