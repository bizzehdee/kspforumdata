I think alot of it has to do with my techniques for how I overcome not using any mods. Example, purposefully cross my rendevous orbital with my own trajectory so that on the return cross I get my interception. Small tweaks (means a bit more fuel) allows a capture almost every time. It takes longer, but I find more fun in flying then having software calculate. Also I always need to keep my engineering mindset in control as I have a nasty habit of making things way too complex which brings up a good point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egreater complexity leads to greater chance of failure (plus more lag)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaking a basic plan in your head is a good way to also plan your staging. Always start from your last task and make a list to your launch. Only carry what you need (plus a bit extra in case of oopses). Example for getting to Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Kerbin orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Kerbin launch\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis will get you a most basic setup to get going. The nice part is that if you are like me, if any stage is insufficient, you always can return and land again to redesign. No kerbals stranded ever in my space (much). Following this design, you can do one part and test each until you reach your final goal of all 6 stages. So for example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1: Design a lander, launch it into space and see if it comes down. Do this and if ever a rocket fails, you can deploy your kerbin lander, always back alive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2: Launch lander plus stage into orbit that can get you from the moon. Note that it takes much less fuel to return from the moon as it does to get there. So a good test is if you can get out to mun orbit then this stage is good. Remember fuel efficency is key once you have orbit. Want to return, then when at Apo, do a braking to cause your peri to scrape atmosphere. Two tasks at once done there. You know you can return from mun plus you practiced aerobraking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3: Lander, tough to test this exactly. But it doesn\u0027t take too much fuel to come down. the nice efficient and light 1m engines with pretty much any tank will work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4:If you can get this point, then you are at the moon. Build your stage that gets you from orbit kerbin into orbit of the moon into space. Your extra fuel can be used to suppliment any other stage. For example, you can use remaining mun capture components to begin your decent.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"szpw","CreatedById":25964,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T19:42:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll get it soon.
