I am using TAC life support mod and thought about adding these to my life support section but I noticed that when added, they don\u0027t extend the number of days your resources last (at least not in the TAC window in the VAB). \n\nI assumed that if a large water and waste containers gave you X number of days worth of water and Y number of days worth of waste storage, that adding a purifier would give you X\u002B days worth of water and Y\u002B days worth of waste storage since you would be reclaiming some of that water instead of sending it to you waste tank.\n\nSo how exactly do these things work?\n\nAlso, I found my first anomaly today while landing at Minmus\u0027 Slopes biom. (was so excited when I realized what it was that I nearly crashed my lander lol) I put the lander down right next to it and sent Jeb on an EVA, but neither Jeb nor any of my equipment acknowledge it\u0027s presents. Is there a way to get science from them, or are they purely decorative?"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T21:28:21Z","Content":"As this question seems to be specifically about using mods, it has been moved to the Add-ons section."},{"CreatedByName":"Netskimmer","CreatedById":144822,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-26T15:51:28Z","Content":"Wow, almost 24 hours and 85 views later and not one response.
