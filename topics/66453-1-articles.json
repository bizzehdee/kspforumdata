These massive landing gears (in comparison to the size and weight of the craft) should be able to take a good amount of the force of a landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a large SSTO (say 100 tons) no matter what the configuration, most commonly only 2 of the wheels would hit the runway at the same time. This means each wheel needs to take 50 tons of force on landing without much room of elastic compression like the landing legs. Quite often at a 5 m/s vertical and 30 m/s horizontal landing this impact has caused a wheel to break off resulting in... well... problems.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would love to see a smaller say 0.2-0.3 tons landing gear with less impact tolerance and a larger maybe 1 ton but twice or more impact tolerance landing gear just to deal with the HUGE difference in aircraft sizes.

So there probably should be some reasonable top speed at which these wheels start failing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other side, when I land at high speed my plane usually crashes anyway. Because it\u0027s not just about speed but also about the impact shock.
