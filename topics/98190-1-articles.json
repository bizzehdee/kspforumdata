This leaves players with large but unusable stockpiles of science while they grind through funds-heavy contracts. I want to look briefly at why this is bad, and why this is failing to provide a meaningful \u0022hard\u0022 mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn my current career game, I am playing \u0022Moderate\u0022 difficulty with the two \u0022Hard\u0022 toggles unchecked (no reverts, no quickloads). I\u0027ve got a handful of buildings upgraded once, and am staring down the barrel of the first R\u0026amp;G upgrade at 785 kilofunds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have science-\u0026gt;funds and rep-\u0026gt;funds strategies on, have unlocked all of the tier 1 science, and have a 90% profit margin on Kerbin-orbit satellite missions. I can complete any Kerbin-orbit satellite mission with a 10k craft, and get over 90k in reward. This means I need to do 8-10 satellite missions just to unlock the R\u0026amp;D center, so that I can get the tech I need to reasonably move on to interplanetary missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt my very fastest, a satellite mission takes at least 5 minutes to do, and usually more like 10. This means I\u0027ve got an hour or two of monotonous grinding to do in order to move on in the game. I thought I\u0027d left that behind when I quit World of Warcraft. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what is the purpose of the funds currency? It seems to me that funds probably has two basic purposes:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EPenalize failure by sinking funds when missions are performed inefficiently or are failed, and\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERestrict scope in the early game to promote education\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, Funds are failing at both of these goals on harder difficulty settings. With a profit margin of 90%, failing a mission is effectively no penalty at all. Considering the price disparity between my satellite craft (10k) and the progress gate (785k), losing a ship costs me about 1% of my goal. This is not a meaningful penalty; losing the 5-10 minutes of real-world time that it took to execute the mission was way more painful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EToo, \u0022hard mode\u0022 is something that is ostensibly undertaken by more expert players. Expert players need \u003Cem\u003Eless\u003C/em\u003E time sink in the name of education, not more. Lengthening the early game in the name of \u0022difficulty\u0022 is frustrating to expert players, not rewarding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suggest that -- at least in hard mode -- the price of rocket parts be increased substantially compared to contract rewards. A 90% profit margin is unrealistic, and a unit cost on the order of 1% of the cost to progress in the game trivializes the penalty for failure. Further, I suggest that the price of building upgrades -- especially upgrades that are effectively mandatory to continue progress within a game -- be substantially reduced. A ratio of 10:1 or even 5:1 would probably provide a more natural feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf part costs were increased by a factor of 5, satellite missions would still be 45-50% profitable. If building upgrade costs were reduced by a factor of 4, this would achieve greater parity between mission costs and upgrade costs. The 785k R\u0026amp;D upgrade would instead cost 196k, reducing the number of missions to 4 or 5. At this ratio the loss of a 50k mission vehicle will be a more noticeable loss of 25% of the goal. This is a meaningful penalty that requires an entire mission to overcome, instead of the current \u0022nothing but lost time\u0022 feeling that accompanies a mission failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, \u0022hard mode\u0022 is intended to offer a feeling of reward for more-expert players who can overcome risk in order to more efficiently perform a difficult task. Currently, the funds balance in \u0022hard mode\u0022 does nothing other than lengthen the early stages of the game -- the educational portion meant for beginners -- and as such has the opposite effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDiscussion is welcomed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T21:30:30Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 09:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by toadicus\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EChange a blanket statement or two to specifically address funds, in case context wasn\u0026#039;t enough.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T19:40:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAgree completely, hard mode is grind mode.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T19:43:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022toadicus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022toadicus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EToo, \u0022hard mode\u0022 is something that is ostensibly undertaken by more expert players.

A 90% profit margin is unrealistic, and a unit cost on the order of 1% of the cost to progress in the game trivializes the penalty for failure. Further, I suggest that the price of building upgrades -- especially upgrades that are effectively mandatory to continue progress within a game -- be substantially reduced. A ratio of 10:1 or even 5:1 would probably provide a more natural feeling.\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EIf part costs were increased by a factor of 5, satellite missions would still be 45-50% profitable. If building upgrade costs were reduced by a factor of 4, this would achieve greater parity between mission costs and upgrade costs. The 785k R\u0026amp;D upgrade would instead cost 196k, reducing the number of missions to 4 or 5. At this ratio the loss of a 50k mission vehicle will be a more noticeable loss of 25% of the goal.
