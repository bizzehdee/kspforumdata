Eventually when a probe has no more life in it i\u0027ll just go to Rename Vessel and change it\u0027s type to Debris. That works well enough, but it makes it difficult if I ever want to find that probe again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy suggestion is to add a little checkbox labeled \u0022Decommissioned\u0022 under the ship types. Doing this would treat it like debris, but it would retain it\u0027s original icon. So you could leave satellites displayed on the map, but only your active ones, and then you could toggle on the decommissioned ones if you want to see them, and it would help you differentiate it from the spent stages and whatnot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso please note, I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a mod for this somewhere, that\u0027s cool, but I\u0027m suggesting this as something for stock. Just had to get that in there before the inevitable \u0022There\u0027s a mod for that\u0022 first reply.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T09:06:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like that idea, good thinking.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf and when they get around to giving us better sorting tools *cough*folders*cough* in the tracking station that would still be a useful extra feature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Somtaaw","CreatedById":109192,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-27T16:20:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell in addition to something like Decomissioned, it would be nice to actually have a \u0022Satellite\u0022 ship type as well.
