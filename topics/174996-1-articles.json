From looking at a side view while it is unstable, I can see that the fuselage is slightly flexing back and forth, which is the likely cause of the instability. I\u0027m not sure how to use struts or any structural part to properly tie together the different parts of the fuselage together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for any help!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RizzoTheRat","CreatedById":123362,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-16T08:26:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you turn on \u0022Advanced Tweakables\u0022\u00A0in the game settings, you\u0027ll get the option to add autostruts when you right\u00A0click on a part in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u00A0 You get the option to strut stuff to the root part, heaviest part, or grandparent part.\u00A0 I tend to sue grandparent to link parts to the next one along from the one they\u0027re attached to, and you\u0027d also add some stiffness by strutting the wings to the fuselage section next to the one they\u0027re already attached to.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
