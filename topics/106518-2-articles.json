You will still need to add a command to jettison it after a normal launch.  Probably the next thing I will do is add some tweakables so that you don\u0027t have to mess with the config files if you\u0027d rather the jettison actions be staged.\n\nAnother thing I might do at some point is collapse the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Launch Escape System\u0022\u003ELES\u003C/abbr\u003E for the larger pod into a single part.
