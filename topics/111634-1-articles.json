Why couldn\u0027t the forum introduce a tag system for mods in add-on releases? So that when a mod author creates a new thread, and on the bottom, he can choose between different categories, where he would say that his mod fits in that categories. For example, Real Solar System would go into the \u0027Realism\u0027 Category, Tantares into the \u0027Stockalike\u0027 Category, Scatterer into the \u0027Game Beautifierer\u0027 (LOL) category etc. Then, when you go to Add-On Releases, you can tick on ore more categories, and then, you only see results for those categories. That would make it easier if you look for a special mod but don\u0027t know the name, or that you can see new mods faster and better because it wouldn\u0027t disappear in the whole mess of all the other mods. That happens quite often.\n\nI think that would be a really cool idea!![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-01T16:43:54Z\u0022 title=\u002206/01/2015 04:43  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kartoffelkuchen**"},{"CreatedByName":"WinkAllKerb\u0026#039;\u0026#039;","CreatedById":78047,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-01T16:48:35Z","Content":"And the mutli/single tag battle accuracy threads war just begins. why not after all (i can feel the mod team starting giggling loudly ; ).
