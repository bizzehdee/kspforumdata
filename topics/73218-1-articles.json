Ever. I would go out of my way to drive around it, and I would in fact go out of my way to convince my local administration to stay the hell away from it. It is an utterly awful idea to have a road surface that is not macroscopically smooth, especially on highways. What in the world were they thinking? Not only will this cause \u003Cem\u003Eimmense\u003C/em\u003E noise pollution, which is just as much an environmental hazard as exhaust fumes are (to both nature and humans alike), it will also make traveling on these roads an aggravating chore. For bicycles too, by the way. And have you ever walked a long distance on cobblestone and then stepped back on smooth dirt or tarmac? Yeah... Oh, and it causes increased wear on your tires too, flushing more rubber dust than usual into the environment with every rainfall or gust of wind (such as those created by cars driving fast), and require you to replace tires sooner, which costs you money. Shocks and springs, too. And whatever else may come loose in your car by rattling it constantly over dozens of thousands of miles.

And integrated heating elements? How are they supposed to keep the road from freezing over at night, if there\u0027s no sun? Why, batteries of course. Which is another pollution heavy production process - it\u0027s been estimated, for instance, that every first generation Prius\u0027 battery caused more pollution in production alone than the vehicle could ever have hoped to save during said battery\u0027s expected operational lifetime. Because yes, batteries have a limited lifetime. Solar panels do too, by the way. You need to replace them regularly. Not every 20-30 years like tarmac, but every 2-3 years.
