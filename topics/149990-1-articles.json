There\u0027s also a smooth cap that might be an aerodynamic nose cone flipped around.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t see how to build this merged-fueltank assemblage, but I\u0027d like to know how as it looks pretty sleek. Is it possible to build the vehicle that\u0027s presented in \u0022To the Mun (part 1)\u0022?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mason","CreatedById":169887,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T16:46:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd, some friendly folk on the IRC channel told me to try the offset tool, and that worked beautifully. I\u0027ll see about reproducing the craft more exactly, but for now after using the offset tool: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/41Fsm\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/41Fsm\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-14T20:54:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYeah, offset and rotation are what unlocks a huge amount of aesthetic design potential. I mean, if you abuse them you can easily get something that looks like it defies all laws of physics, but used with care it can replicate realworld designs or produce body shapes you could never achieve with just sticking stock parts together.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Clipperride","CreatedById":149816,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-10-16T10:55:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you get onto building planes, the offset tool is very useful indeed. \u00A0It enables you to tweak the position of wings and landing gear without having to remove them and reattaching by eye. \u00A0That was a real source of frustration when I first started and before I discovered it\u0027s usefulness.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHappy landings!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS I know some will disagree, but I always like to head to Minmus before the Mun. It\u0027s only a \u003Cem\u003Elittle\u003C/em\u003E more complicated, as you need to adjust the plane of your orbit (\u0022set target\u0022 on Minmus will show you the points where your current orbit intersects the Minmus orbit. Set a manoeuvre node on either the ascending or descending node and use the \u0022up\u0022 and \u0022down\u0022 sliders until they match. 0.1\u00B0 is plenty close enough) It\u0027s also good practice for later, when you are matching your orbit to that of a space station so you can dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe low gravity on Minmus makes landings less frantic than the Mun. All of the \u0022flats\u0022 are flat (obviously) and at 0m elevation, making it easy to know your altitude above the ground. \u00A0The low gravity also means you need very little thrust and propellant (delta V) for the trip home. It is also usually possible to right a toppled vechile on Minmus, should your landing be a little off. Finally you get a good amount of science points for conducting experiments.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Mun, on the other hand, has a much less forgiving gravity well and flat landing spots are harder to find.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
