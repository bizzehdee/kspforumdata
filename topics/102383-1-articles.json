Behringer makes a line called Xenyx. Google that for an example of what I\u0027m talking about. One channel in from the amp, the other channel in from the PC, mix and out to headphones. Most of the Xenyx line are also USB interfaces. Your amp is one too, if you can send audio into the PC over the USB.

If your guitar fails either of these and you\u0027re serious about playing, take it to a professional to see if there is any hope of having it set up correctly. If there is not, get a better guitar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) playing guitar takes a lot of patience and discipline, especially at first when you have no calluses and it can be literally painful.
