About 50% of tgas failed to appear in KSP after conversion with the latter. 100% are appearing reliably after conversion with Paint.NET.\n\nI\u0027m still experimenting with the settings of Paint.NET\u0027s converter. So far, DXT5, Compressor Type: Range fit, Error Metric: Perceptual, Generate Mip Maps: Fant has given good results, although results can be poor where any texture was scaled on the model.\n\nEDIT: And no .mu hex hacking is required. KSP natively loads DDS."}]}
