The switch panel wasn\\\u0027t configured in a logical manner and required each set of rockets to be activated independently. Because of this, the FE got out of sequence when one of the rockets failed to fire and started working in the wrong sequence. A later test was scheduled but cancelled not because of the risk but because of the cost. They had a set budget and ran out of money. The DoD wouldn\\\u0027t approve more because they had already run over budget on what became \u003Cem\u003EDesert One\u003C/em\u003E. Sadly both operations were a highlight of why so much was wrong with the US Military in the 1970\\\u0027s, mainly due to the policies of Robert MacNamara and the civilian Executive Branches that followed the Johnson administration who alternately punished the DoD for their \u0027failures\u0027 during Vietnam and restricted their budgets because of wanting to \u0027keep the peace\u0027 while still trying to fight every little fire that sprang up in the world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to invest in commas or full stops \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Melfice","CreatedById":3143,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T21:31:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The_Architect\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The_Architect\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou need to invest in commas or full stops \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth are available in plentiful (or, at the very least, sufficient) quantities.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven investing in paragraphs (which would be superfluous, since there is only one subject being discussed) is money better spent in creating other high-quality posts, like the post you quoted.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Serratus","CreatedById":12069,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T22:47:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those unfortunate, I\\\u0027ll give you guys what you desire:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E, . / \u0026lt; \u0026gt; ? ; \\\u0027 : \u0027 [ ] { } \\ | _ - \u002B = ( ) * \u0026amp; ^ % $ # @ !
