It\u0027s been quite the ride, as all of you well know from your own experiences. I did things a little differently from some - I learned gravity turns, docking, landing, planetary transfers, etc. on my own without the help of YouTube or any other materials. For the most part, it was only myself, my patience, and the in-game tutorials that got me to where I am today.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the beginning when I realized what this game was, and how it was everything I wanted in a space game, I just couldn\u0027t let myself spoil the journey of learning orbital mechanics and building up a space program from scratch. All the while not even initially knowing what it actually takes to get a rocket off the ground. I wanted to learn from the game while pulling from my own background in physics, my interest in aerospace, and through trial and error. It made for the most rewarding game experience I\u0027ve ever had. I went from rockets\u0027 pointy ends being where the flamey end is supposed to be, and gravity turns consisting of going straight up until leaving the atmosphere and burning horizontally like crazy, to incrementally becoming more and more efficient in all aspects of the various standard missions that can be done, to the eventual successful landings on all 13 of the other terrestrial bodies.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m mentioning all of this because now with Kerbal Space Program 2 closing in, I\u0027m worried there are things that perhaps I\u0027ve missed out on in the original game. While I will state my own accomplishments and playstyles, I\u0027d like to hear from the KSP community about what we think are the essential items that should be on everyone\u0027s bucket list before the sequel arrives. Whether it\u0027s accomplishments that can be done in the stock game, like seeing the Mohole or an \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Single Stage to Orbit\u0022\u003ESSTO\u003C/abbr\u003E on Laythe, or things entirely different that are only achievable in a modded save like exploring some of the Kopernicus planet packs.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me, I\u0027m mostly a stock player, and there are some experiences I want to save for KSP2. So I don\u0027t really need suggestions like extraplanetary launchpads or near-future/far-future/interstellar missions - although you can certainly still list them for other people that tune in here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve personally never done an Eve-return vehicle, nor a Jool V or grand tour mission. So those are on my list for sure. I\u0027ve done plenty of crewed surface bases and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022In-Situ Resource Utilization\u0022\u003EISRU\u003C/abbr\u003E refueling stations. I\u0027ve also done \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E-LS and OPM. What else am I missing out on though? I feel like there\u0027s a lot of KSP out there to be played that I just haven\u0027t taken the time to experience, whether it\u0027s exploring new worlds or ultra-realism or whatever else may be out there.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlease, feel free to give your recommendations.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hyperspace Industries","CreatedById":212417,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-22T11:44:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTrying out visual mods, I have a regular laptop (same type one of my former teachers had), and it runs eve (default configs) and scatterer plenty good enough, it\u2019s not perfect, I still get the occasional lag spikes especially when starting up, and blowing up, but believe me it\u0027s worth every second of lag you get.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, landing on every body in the kerbol system, not necessarily in the same ship.\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u00A0I still have to do this one, farthest I\u2019ve got is Vall, well, farthest without cheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222022-04-23T14:40:03Z\u0022 title=\u002204/23/2022 02:40  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00222 yr\u0022\u003EApril 23, 2022\u003C/time\u003E by Hyperspace Industries\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aerodynamic Kerbal","CreatedById":211338,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-04-23T06:42:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTry making some rocket replicas.
