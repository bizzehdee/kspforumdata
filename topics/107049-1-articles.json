Wait until the moon is a bit more than 90 degrees off from the KSC and then launch, then continue your burn until you lift your apoapsis up to the mun\u0027s altitude. You may have to try a couple times to get a feel for how to do it, but it is actually pretty easy and modestly more efficient than circularizing in between. As a shortcut simply target the moon (so you are going to need some career building upgrades if you are doing this there), then end your gravity turn with your nose pointed directly at the Mun. Ideally it should be at or near the horizon, though the Mun\u0027s SOI is pretty big so you have a fair amount of fudge room.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:00:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHave 5 kickback solid rocket boosters and tweak the thrust limiter to not burn up, use stayputnik as control and you should escape kerbin but it means orbiting kerbol, the star!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xrayfishx","CreatedById":76147,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T19:52:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing an RO player I always try to do it this way. Basically you need a little more than half of your dV in the first stage and then you have a low TWR second stage which needs you to burn continuously or it won\u0027t reach orbit at all. That\u0027s how I try to design my rockets and it gives me a nice single burn to orbit if I follow a good trajectory.

If you want to do it really real-like, you probably have to pre-calculate the ascent and then execute it with high precision -- the game interface doesn\u0027t lend itself too well to that kind of thing, and even MechJeb is of limited utility. If you do it the Kerbal way, by the seat of your pants, you have to adjust apoapsis by pitch.
