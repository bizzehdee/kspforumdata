The release version will be known as DeepFreeze Continued...\n\nUses:When kerbals are frozen they do not consume life support resources. If you don\u0027t use life support mods, this mod doesn\u0027t really do much, except provide a few cool parts and ability to thaw and freeze kerbals.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Compatible with TAC Life Support, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Umbra Space Industries (a collection of mods)\u0022\u003EUSI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E Life Support, Snacks, Interstellar Flight Inc and Kerbalism!.\n- Small 1.25M in-line CRY-0300 DeepFreezer for 1 kerbal (with animated internals, animated external doors, and TRANSPARENT doors - Yes see the Internals from the outside).\n- CRY-0300 has an on-board Glykerol tank which can store up to 10 units of Glykerol.\n- Small radial CRY-0300R DeepFreezer for 1 kerbal (with TRANSPARENT pod window - Yes see the Internals from the outside).\n- CRY-0300R has an on-board Glykerol tank which can store up to 10 units of Glykerol.\n- Medium 2.5M in-line CRY-1300 DeepFreezer for up to 3 kerbals (with animated internals).\n- CRY-1300 has an on-board Glykerol tank which can store up to 15 units of Glykerol.\n- Large 2.5M in-line CRY-2300 DeepFreezer for up to 10 kerbals (with animated internals).\n- CRY-2300 has an on-board Glykerol tank which can store up to 50 units of Glykerol.\n- RS-X20R radial glykerol tank for up to 20 units of extra glykerol storage.\n- Full featured GUI allowing you to see all frozen kerbals and freeze/thaw kerbals.\n- Kerbals can also be frozen/thawed via part right click menu.\n- ANIMATED CRYOPODS. Yes - Animated Cryopods! See for yourself. When you Freeze or Thaw from external view, you will see the Pod open/close in the portrait cameras. If you are in IVA/Internal mode when you freeze/thaw the camera will switch to an internal camera viewing the pod of the kerbal you are about to freeze/thaw. It will then animate open/close of the cryopod. Yes the internals change. All Rep to [@MerlinsMaster](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/112079-merlinsmaster/) for his Amazing!! Internal modelling and texturing. You can switch around all the un-frozen kerbals seat cameras to take a look around. There are also alternate internal cameras via Alt-D.\n- Remote Tech is supported - Detects if RT is installed and if it is:-  \n\nYou cannot thaw kerbals unless you have active crew on-board or an active connection to your vessel if un-kerbal\u0027d. When you attempt to freeze your last active crew on-board, you are given a warning that you will need an active crew on-board or active connection to thaw kerbals - you then have to click thaw a second time to confirm your action. You cannot modify \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E - DeepFreeze Continued Alarms unless your vessel is crewed or connected.\n- Provides monitoring capability of frozen kerbals at a cost of Electrical Charge. WARNING!! - use of this feature means kerbals will die if you run out of electrical charge if you set the fatal option to on. A non-fatal option is available. To use this feature you must change thesettings as the default for this feature is off. EC usage to keep kerbals alive NOW DOES (from V0.18) operate when vessel they are aboard is not the active vessel. But it will only drain up to 95% of your EC when you switch to the vessel without BackgroundProcessing installed. If you optionally install the BackgroundProcessing mod then EC usage is processed even if your vessel is NOT the active vesel. EC usage turns off for all vessels when timewarp is \u003E 4x due to bugs in EC usage at high timewarp.\n- Temperature Checking function (switch on and off via config settings: RegTempReqd = true/false). If switched on the Freezer Part temperature must be \u003C the RegTempFreeze value (in settings)to be able to freeze a kerbal. If switched on you must maintain the Freezer part temperature BELOW the RegTempMonitor (in settings) value. If you do not, then there is a good chance the freezer will fail and your kerbals WILL start dying if you have the EC fatal option turned on. If switched on Freezing/Thawing and Holding Frozen Kerbals will cause the freezer parts to produce Heat which you will then need to manage. - This function only operates on the active vessel as Temperature control on unloaded vessels is too risky in the current KSP version. If you wish to use this function, do so at your own risk.. (or rather the Kerbals) and use a heat control mod and parts like[this one.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/124391-1-02-Heat-Control-Manage-your-ship-s-heat!-%2815-06-2015-new-radiators-and-heat-exchangers%29)\n- If that\u0027s not all, NEW from Version 0.18 of DeepFreeze Continued... now includes Kerbal Alarm Clock (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) mod integration.

This ONLY works once the alarm fires and you switch to the vessel that these events are attached to (if it isn\u0027t already the active vessel). DeepFreeze will remember these commands forever and execute them once you switch to this vessel but keep reminding you to do so until you do switch to the vessel or you delete the alarm from within Deepfreeze (not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E). If you also have Remote Tech mod installed you can only modify DeepFreeze alarm events if the associated vessel has a valid remote connection or a kerbal in command. DeepFreeze will however execute your alarms even if the vessel does not have a connection or kerbal in command as they are stored and executed by the on-board computer.\n- RasterPropMonitor enabled light switches, door handles, and RPM Transparent Pod functionality.\n- Full integration and support of Ship Manifest mod by Papa\\_Joe. -SM knows about Frozen Kerbals and also enables freeze and thaw for the SM crew GUI.\n- Module Manager config file included for support of CLS mod supported by Papa\\_Joe.\n- Localization texts for Russian and Spanish.\n\nFor more information please refer to the new W.I.P.

You need RPM - JSITransparentPods V0.25.0 or above.\n    Support for Kerbalism Mod.\n    Minor Bugs (can live with):\n    ---------------------------\n    1) When you freeze/thaw from internal cam (alternate camera) the camera loses the transform reference point at the end of the process.\n    2) When inside the CRY-0300 with the External Doors closed, if you zoom out strange camera effects mean the door is only partially visible.\n    3) The screen messages when in Cryopod-Camera mode are not showing all the kerbal\u0027s names.\n    4) When you change settings from Stock to Toolbar and change scenes, the toolbar appears, but stock button is still there. A restart or several scene \n    changes fixes it.\n    5) When there is a Kerbal on the ladder in front of the CRY-0300 and the doors are open the Internal Overlays the kerbal and blocks them from view.\n    This is actually an RPM - JSIAdvTransparentPods bug.\n    6) The CRY-0300R has lost it\u0027s ability to show cool Window Freeze/Thawing animation effects.\n    Issues with release:\n    --------------------\n    Background Processing is not available under KSP 1.1. Unless the mod author updates it soon I will look to put my own EC background processing\n    into DeepFreeze. For now if you are using EC usage the non-Background Processing method still works (it plays catch-up when you swith to the vessel).\n    There is no version of TAC LS for KSP 1.1 - so it is not currently supported.\n\n    V0.20.4.0 \u0022More Fixes\u0022\n    Fixed bug when using EC for frozen kerbals is turned ON and BackgroundProcessor is not installed. When you switch back to a vessel after a long period of time and you don\u0027t\n    have enough EC to catch-up on the EC usage DeepFreeze was not correctly consuming 95% of remanining EC and was executing the Kill/Emergency Thaw procedure.\n    Fixed GUI when EC usage is on where the fields were not spanning the resizable window correctly.\n    Improved error handling for a spurious bug in Tracking Station that cannot be tracked down.\n    Removed DFInterface.DLL API. Wrapper API now provided for other Mods to interface to DeepFreeze.\n    Removed use of SMInterface.DLL API to interface to Ship Manifest. Replaced with Reflection Wrapper class. Requires Ship Manifest V5.0.1.0 or above.\n    Changed DEFAULT CLS setting for the CRY-0300 and CRY-0300R to be Passable (allowing unrestricted crew transfers), this is due to a known bug in CLS/Ship Manifest mods.\n    Will change this setting back once Papa_Joe fixes that bug in CLS/SM.\n    Earlier versions of Ship Manifest no longer supported.\n    Updated Mini-AVC included to newer version to stop log spam.\n    Added Community Tech Tree science node definitions (via Module Manager file, requires Module Manager).\n    Re-Factored a lot of code and utilities (Code Housekeeping).\n    V0.20.3.0 \u0022bug Fixes\u0022\n    Fixed bug when thawing some kerbals vessel where vessel reference transform was not set in some cases.\n    Modified debugging and error messages during thawing to assist easier bug hunting in the future.\n    V0.20.2.0 \u0022Bug Squashin\u0022\n    Fixed null ref bug when vessels are destroyed.   \n    Fixed null ref bug when KSP vessel list cannot be accessed.   \n    Fixed null ref/NAN bug when revert to editor (from vessel with DeepFreeze part) and launch another vessel.   \n    V0.20.1.0 \u0022Fix Radial Pod \u0026 Wrapper-less API class\u0022\n    Fixed sound glitch/issue with CRY-0300R when attaching more than one in symmetry mode in the editor.   \n    For Other Modder/Mods API interface re-written providing API via reflection class (no hard dependancy) - of no relevance to users.   \n    V0.20.0.0 \u0022External Radial Pods\u0022\n    Added new Radial External Cryopod - The CRY-0300R. A single kerbal Cryopod part that can be radially attached. \n    The CRY-0300R also has an attach point at the top of the pod.\n    Great for adding radial pods to your vessel or inside a SpacePlane CargoBay! \n    Fits inside the Mk-2 \u0026 Mk-3 Cargo bays, the part does clip through the base of cargo bays as it is primarily designed to \n    attach to the outside of a curved part. However, if you get creative you can fit it into a Cargo bay using girders \n    or octaganol struts.\n    The CRY-0300R supports RasterPropMonitor transparent pods (yes it\u0027s transparent if you have RPM installed).\n    The CRY-0300R also has an external EVA hatch. \n    The CRY-0300R only weighs 0.87t (the full CRY-0300 weights 2.62t) and appears in the TechTree at spaceExploration (same as the CRY-0300).\n    This now completes the set of all the originally planned DeepFreeze parts.\n    MerlinsMaster has re-textured more details into all the Cryopods.\n    Fixed Pod transparency for the CRY-0300 (and the CRY-0300R) based on RPM transparency setting in flight and also now works in the Editor (VAB/SPH). \n    However, due to the complications of DeepFreeze parts transparency can either be ON or OFF (RPM AUTO setting is treated as Transparency OFF).\n    Fixed bug where the External Door Open/Close sound effect was not working for the CRY-0300.\n    Rationalis(z)ed all the part models and textures into one folder, as a lot of them are shared. This will save some memory. \n    Thanks goes to khr15714n for kicking me into doing this as I have been meaning to for a while.\n    Due to this however, if you are upgrading from a previous version of DeepFreeze you MUST delete the \n    /GameData/REPOSoftTech/DeepFreeze entirely BEFORE installing this version. If you want to save your DeepFreeze\n    settings make a backup/copy of /GameData/REPOSoftTech/DeepFreeze/Plugins/Config.cfg file BEFORE deleting your DeepFreeze folder then \n    copy your backup/copy of this file back into the /GameData/REPOSoftTech/DeepFreeze/Plugins folder once you have upgraded.\n\n**V0.19.3.0 \u0022KSP 1.0.5\u0022**  \n\nRecompile for KSP 1.0.5  \n**V0.19.2.0 \u0022Bug fixes and Enhancements\u0022**  \n\nFix distribution to include missing Editor group icon from V0.19.0.0 that somehow got left out of V0.19.1.0.  \n\nFix bug that V0.19.1.0 introduced that was causing invalid seat placements and  \n\nAdd more robust checking of Seat placements for frozen kerbals to avoid bugs that have been occurring for some users.  \n\nFix seat placement when a freeze/thaw process is aborted.\n\n**V0.19.1.0 \u0022Bug fixes \u0026 Enhancements\u0022**  \n\nAdded comatose function for when EC or Heat options are ON and Fatal option is OFF. Now when you run out of EC or overheat with these options set kerbals will be emergency thawed  \n\nand become comatose (tourists) for a period of 5 minutes (can be changed in the settings menu).  \n\nFixed bug with new pop-up windows when EC is critical or overheat - this pop-up will now NOT appear if the active vessel is the vessel that has run out of EC or overheat.  \n**V0.19.0.0 \u0022Bug fixes \u0026 Enhancements\u0022**  \n\nAdded Fatal EC/Heat option. If this is ON kerbals will die if EC runs out or it gets too hot (if you are using the EC and Heat options). If this is OFF  \n\nthe Kerbals will be emergency thawed and become available again, and start consuming LS resources again. (to-do - expand this to perhaps make them unusable for a period of time due to  \n\nemergency thaw effects, but not in this version) Default setting (for compatibility) is set to ON. - IE: running out of EC or over-heating will Kill kerbals.  \n\nAdded pop-up window when EC is critical for vessels that are not the active vessel and you can automatically switch to that vessel.  \n\nAdded flatline sound effect if kerbals die due to lack of EC or over temperature condition.  \n\nSupport for Texture Replacer V2.4.10, you MUST have this version (or above) of Texture Replacer installed. Thawed kerbals will no longer lose their customised texture settings.  \n\nSupport for RasterPropMonitor V0.23.0, you MUST have this version (or above) of RPM installed.  \n\nChanged the Editor Icon for DeepFreeze parts category to use Snowflake/Freeze icon instead of EVA Kerbal (stock) icon.  \n\nAdded Engineer Info report check where there is a DeepFreeze Freezer attached that the vessel has 5 or more units of Glykerol available.  \n\nFixed Engineer report in editor so that DeepFreeze Freezers are now considered parts that use Glykerol and ElectricCharge.  \n\nFixed bug where ships docking/un-docking with frozen kerbals results in unable to thaw frozen kerbals.  \n\nFixed bug in new Internal Camera system when swapping to other DeepFreeze vessels that are in range the cameras do not move/update to the correct vessel.  \n\nFixed bug if you have multiple vessels in loaded range on initially switching to flight mode on one vessel, if you swap to a DeepFreeze equipped vessel (with DeepFreeze part) and you attempt to thaw a previously frozen  \n\nkerbal, the thaw may not work or it will work but the kerbal is not visible on thawing.  \n\nFixed issue where a freeze/thaw is in progress and the player switches vessels. DeepFreeze will now abort any in-progress thaw/freeze in this case.  \n\nFixed NullReference bug in DFIntMemory with the internal cameras function.  \n**V0.18.2.1 \u0022add missing dll file from distribution\u0022**  \nAdded missing DFInterface.dll file from distribution. If you are not having issues (probably because you installed over the top of previous version) you do not need this update.  \n**V0.18.2.0 \u0022Bug Fixes \u0026 Enhancements\u0022**  \nFix Radial attachment points for CRY-0300 exclusion zones around the external doors.  \nThe CRY-300 now correctly allows you to attach radial parts to the outside of it except for where the external doors are.  \nThere is a EVA Access point at the bottom of the external doors. If you block this with radial parts your EVA access will be blocked by KSP and you will get the \u0022Hatch Obstructed\u0022 message.  \n\nIt is recommended you do not attach parts to the doors or the lower front section of the CRY-0300.  \n\nFix DeepFreeze partmodule to support re-use on non DeepFreeze parts. To use you must add partmodule to a crewable part but you must NOT have an internalmodel defined for that part.  \n\nRefer to the WIKI page on how to configure your own parts (WARNING: No support will be provided for parts you have made yourself using this method).  \n\nAll Cryopods now have windows that freeze and thaw (as was our original intent) so they go transparent when empty or a thawed kerbal is seated, and they appear frozen when a frozen kerbal is within.  \n\nYou can now switch to Internal Cameras (same cameras used when in IVA and you freeze/thaw a Kerbal) using Modifier key (Windows this is ALT) and d key.  \n\nSwitch to the next Cryopod Internal Camera using the \u0027n\u0027 key. Switch to the previous Cryopod Internal Camera using the \u0027b\u0027 key.  \n\nPress the \u0027c\u0027 or whatever key you have mapped to camera to switch back to IVA/Flight Camera mode.  \n\nYou can change the key settings in the \\GameData\\REPOSoftTech\\DeepFreeze\\Pluginf\\Config.cfg file using a text editor (not available via the in-game settings menu).  \n\ninternalFrzrCamCode = 100 - this is the decimal ASCII code for the CameraMode Key, the default is 100 which is the \u0027d\u0027 key.  \n\ninternalNxtFrzrCamCode = 110 - this is decimal ASCII code for the Next Freezer Camera Key, the default is 110 which is the \u0027n\u0027 key.  \n\ninternalPrvFrzrCamCode = 98 - this is decimal ASCII code for the Previous Freezer Camera Key, the default is 98 which is the \u0027b\u0027 key.  \n\nThe numeric values are from the standard ASCII key code table [http://www.asciitable.com/](http://www.asciitable.com/)  \n\nMinor adjustments to the CRY-2300 and CRY-1300 Internal models.  \n\nTweaks to the animations - on vessel load pod window states are set immediately, before it used to run the animation loops. The same for when a freeze or thaw event fails.  \n\nThe Freeze and Thaw Process have been tweaked: On initiating a Freeze or Thaw process the Pod will first Charge the required EC before executing the freeze or thaw process.  \n\nNew sound effect for charging the Pod EC on Freeze and Thaw. Monitoring equipment sound effect when in IVA/Internal view mode.  \n\nNew RPM props for EC and Glykerol monitoring.  \n**V0.18.1.0 \u0022Small Freezer but huge changes\u0022 Bug-Fix Version**  \nFix GUI LastTimeUpdated field to stop tracking time when settings are changed to turn off ECreqd/Monitoring option.  \nFix GUI Colours for EC monitoring, Temp Monitoring and LastTimeUpdated field.  \nFix error accessing Kerbal Alarm Clock entries with invalid vessel id\u0027s (alarms not attached to vessels) and reduce log spam.  \nFix Error in Texture assignments for models.  \nFix error loading/saving cryopod states on part load/save.  \nFix CRY-0300 transparency issue for some users.   \n**V0.18.0.0 \u0022Small Freezer but huge changes\u0022 Version**   \n\nThis Upgrade should not be SAVE game breaking. But as always, backup your Persisent save file before upgrading.  \n\nIf you are upgrading from a previous version it is recommended on first startup of your save game to switch to each existing vessel that has DeepFreeze Continued...  \n\nparts attached for about 5 seconds to allow the mod to make updates to each part and save configuration details.  \n\nPlease ensure you follow the download and install instructions.

It can hold 10 glykerol and one kerbal.  \n\nThis part has two unique features. It has External Doors that you can open and close IF and only IF you have RasterPropMonitor 0.22.1 (RPM) mod installed.  \n\nIf you have RPM installed not only can you open and close the external doors, but the internal IVA space is visible from the outside using RPM\u0027s transparentpods  \n\nfeature. To use this feature you will need to install RasterPropMonitor mod and Module Manager mod (required for RPM and DeepFreeze).  \n\nIf you do not install these mods the CRY-0300 functions in the same way as the other freezer parts.  \n\nDue to the external doors you cannot radially attach parts to the doors themselves. As this part is small (1.25M) it is configured to NOT be passable if you are  \n\nalso using Connected Living Spaces mod.  \n\nImplemented Background Electric Charge consumption if you have BackgroundProcessing Mod installed. This is ONLY applicable if you have the Consume ElectricCharge  \n\noption switched ON in settings.  \n\nIf you do not have BackgroundProcessing Mod installed, Electric Charge consumption will stop when vessels are not the active vessel, but when you return to them the consumption calculation is made based on how long you were away from the vessel and up to 95% of your EC will be used. This gives you little time to recover and save your kerbals before your EC runs out. You can install BackgroundProcessing from this link: https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/302/BackgroundProcessing  \n\nThe choice is yours depending on what gameplay experience you want.  \n\nUnfortunately I have not implemented background Temperature processing yet as I haven\u0027t figured out if this is even possible with an unloaded vessel yet.  \n\nIt appears that it can\u0027t be done, but I can and have been proven wrong on lots of things. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)  \n\nDeepFreeze has it\u0027s own rough calculation processing that it does on all unloaded vessels to calculate when it thinks the vessel will run out of EC and updates the DeepFreeze GUI accordingly.  \n\nIf that\u0027s not all, DeepFreeze Continued... now includes Kerbal Alarm Clock (\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E) mod integration.

So when the alarm fires in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E DeepFreeze will automatically  \n\nexecute whatever Thaw and Freeze commands you have attached to that alarm. This ONLY works once the alarm fires and you switch to the vessel that these events  \n\nare attached to (if it isn\u0027t already the active vessel). DeepFreeze will remember these commands forever and execute them once you switch to this vessel but keep  \n\nreminding you to do so until you do switch to the vessel or you delete the alarm events from within Deepfreeze (not \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E).  \n\nIf you also have Remote Tech mod installed you can only modify DeepFreeze alarm events if the associated vessel has a valid remote connection or a kerbal in command.  \n\nDeepFreeze will however execute your alarms even if the vessel does not have a connection or kerbal in command as they are stored and executed by the on-board  \n\ncomputer. ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)  \n\nFixed internal model/part orientation bug with the CRY-2300 internal showing in the portrait cameras of attached parts that also had crew.  \nDeprecated the original CRY-2300 Part (which was inherited from ScottPaladin), and replaced it with a renamed part.  \n\nThis is in order to rename the part as it is known internally to KSP in or der to align with the new parts. This means that in sandbox mode you will noticed TWO CRY-2300 parts (one of which is marked as Deprecated). Please DO NOT create new vessels using this part and it is recommended that all in-flight vessels using this part complete their missions. The deprecated part will be deleted in coming versions. The deprecated part does not appear in career mode, but it will continue to function for all in-flight vessels using the old part.  \n\nFor those that have no in-flight vessels with a CRY-2300 part attached you can delete the deprecated part from your install by deleting the file:-  \n\n\u003Ckspinstalldir\u003E\\GameData\\REPOSoftTech\\DeepFreeze\\Parts\\Cryo2300Freezer\\partDepricated.cfg\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdded DeepFreeze Parts Filter category to filter and show Deepfreeze parts in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E. - There is now an icon to filter and show DeepFreeze Continued... parts.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAdded REPOSoftTech Agency configuration and logo/flag.\u003Cbr\u003E\nReFactored RemoteTech Integration -if you have R/T installed and the vessel has no active connection:-\u003Cbr\u003E\nKerbal Thaw/Freeze events will not appear in part right-click menu\u003Cbr\u003E\nThaw/Freeze icons are disabled in the DeepFreeze GUI\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou are unable to Modify \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003E\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Alarm Clock (mod)\u0022\u003EKAC\u003C/abbr\u003E\u003C/abbr\u003E alarms (but existing alarms will still execute)\u003Cbr\u003E\nKNOWN ISSUE: RemoteTech seems to not report connectivity correctly for vessels so the DeepFreeze GUI is only showing what RemoteTech tells it with regard to connectivity, this is not\u003Cbr\u003E\na DeepFreeze bug.\u003Cbr\u003E\nREPOSoftTech Agency and flag added.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMinor adjustments to internal model glitches and textures on the CRY-2300 and CRY-1300.\u003Cbr\u003E\nNew Cryopod model - moved the Status screen on the pods from the bottom of the pods to the top of the pods, so that they are visible when the pod doors are open or closed (before they were obscured when the doors were open).

So let\u0027s see how and when he responds.\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\nWhile a small change in TAC-LS code (to recognize what DeepFreeze does) is certainly the most elegant long-term solution, there are other possibilities, you probably already considered them but I would ask what\u0027s your opinion about:\n\n- fork TAC-LS code and apply the proposed change; distribute the new DLL respecting TAC-LS original license with DeepFreeze (of course this will work only until a new TAC-LS version comes);\n\n- counter-do in DeepFreeze any of TAC-LS consumption of resources and creation of waste for frozen kerbals (re-adding the amounts TAC-LS subtracted for the time kerbals were frozen). Not really elegant, overly complex and possibly needs to sort recycling, but still better then a save-reload (from a user perspective at least)."},{"CreatedByName":"Papa_Joe","CreatedById":10788,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T04:27:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While a small change in TAC-LS code (to recognize what DeepFreeze does) is certainly the most elegant long-term solution, there are other possibilities, you probably already considered them but I would ask what\u0027s your opinion about:\n\u003E - fork TAC-LS code and apply the proposed change; distribute the new DLL respecting TAC-LS original license with DeepFreeze (of course this will work only until a new TAC-LS version comes);\n\u003E \n\u003E - counter-do in DeepFreeze any of TAC-LS consumption of resources and creation of waste for frozen kerbals (re-adding the amounts TAC-LS subtracted for the time kerbals were frozen).
