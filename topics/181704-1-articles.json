I play ksp 1.3.1, and after intensive testing, I found that ppds are no scrubbing at all, and ECLSS process exactly 99% of a kerbals breathing. The biggewt problem is that, althought\uFEFF\u00A0I can set 3 slots of a ECLSS to scrubbing, two ECLSS dont\uFEFF\u00A0stack, so I will never be able to put more than 2 kerbals in a ship!\uFEFFAnyone has experienced something similar?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
