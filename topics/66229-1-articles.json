I\u0027m fairly confident that he (or anyone else attempting this) has a pretty good shot at it, simply because no nuclear thermal rocket has been built since the cancellation of the NERVA program, and we\u0027ve had a lot of technological advances since then. It\u0027s a given that there will be several low-hanging fruit to pick that instantly provide a sizable boost over NERVA. There just needs to be someone committed to building it.
