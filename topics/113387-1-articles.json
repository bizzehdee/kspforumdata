After you finish the tech tree, there is really no incentive to do anything else. I mean, since KSP is a sandbox game, you can always continue, but every time I get to the end of the tech tree, I lose interest because there\u0027s nothing left to \u0022earn.\u0022 This kind of sucks, because when you get access to all the cool stuff, you should really want to put it all to use.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course there are some (maybe even most) who don\u0027t have this problem, but I\u0027ve noticed it with me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my suggestion is that there should be kind of a final \u0022Grand Campaign.\u0022 This should be a series of missions that only true Steely-Eyed Missile Men will be able to achieve. Some ideas for this, just off the top of my head:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Return a material sample from Eve. This will of course require landing a Kerbal on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Return a material sample from Tylo. Landing on Tylo was the second hardest mission I ever did. The combination of Delta-V and TWR was really hard to pull off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Build a fully reuseable space plane that can ferry four Kerbals to an orbit of the Mun and return them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just ideas. The point is, when you finish the tech tree, there should be some incentive to do something grand, rather than just \u0022oh, I guess I\u0027ll go land on Tylo... not sure why, but... meh...\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes this sound like a good idea?
