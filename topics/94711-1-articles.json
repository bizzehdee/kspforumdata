Okay, I think I understand more clearly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, there are no clear markings or borders of regions. Fortunately, the regions are not exactly pin-point: I\u0027m fuzzy on the exact dimensions, but they seem to cover circular areas about 5-10 km in diameter (EDIT: technion points out and I\u0027ve confirmed that the surface regions are a lot smaller than mentioned - more like a few hundred meters across). So long as you\u0027re inside that area, you\u0027re good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t have any screenshots handy but I\u0027ll give you a basic rundown of how I handle a EVA surface survey, step-by-step.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. The first step I do comes before I accept a survey contract. The Tracking Station displays all waypoints for any available or active survey contracts. This lets me judge if a certain contract may or may not be beyond my abilities (for example, a contract requesting a surface survey in a heavily mountainous region is beyond my current capabilities as I don\u0027t have the ability to just \u0022drop in\u0022 with a plane with guaranteed accuracy... or safety). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. For simplicity\u0027s sake, I generally aim for areas that will be experiencing local morning or local day, so I will have plenty of light to see by. Lamps can add to part-counts for planes, plus, landing at night even with them is a pain, I\u0027ve found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Once I select a contract and have my plane on the runway, I go into Map View and look for the EVA waypoint I\u0027m aiming for this flight. Clicking on the waypoint brings up an \u0022Activate Navigation\u0022 button, and clicking on that brings up a little icon on my Navball. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Navigation set, I take off, ascend to a good altitude (usually 2-3,000 m) then turn until I\u0027m pointed in the direction of the icon. Away we go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Depending on some people\u0027s computers, flying can take longer than the game clock says it does. I usually go to Map mode for the most of the journey, keeping an eye on my altitude, speed, and heading, jumping out of Map every so often to make sure the ground isn\u0027t rising to meet me (a problem when flying over highlands and mountains). I do this until I have covered 3/4 to 4/5 of the way to the waypoint (measured by eye in the Map view).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. QUICKSAVE!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. Here is where things get tricky. Sadly, there are no distinctive features beyond that \u0022You are entering X\u0022 / \u0022You are leaving X\u0022 messages, so once I\u0027ve reached the distance mentioned above, I switch back to normal view. Keeping my heading aimed for that icon on the navball, I start reducing altitude and thrust, and keeping an eye ahead on whether the ground is flat enough to allow a landing. If it\u0027s not and I have plenty of fuel, I will abort the landing, climb up and pass through the region without landing, noting the terrain and trying to decide where would be a good landing \u0022strip\u0022. This depends very much on experience so be prepared to suffer a few crashes along the way. That quicksave will prove very handy, trust me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. From my experience, it\u0027s usually good to touch down at a velocity of 50 m/s or less. I try to touch down before I see the \u0022You are entering X\u0022 message - again this will be trial and error, and sometimes I need to use that quicksave to salvage the situation. Once down, I brake until my speed is below 20 m/s. I make sure to throttle my engines to zero once down.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Now I just taxi ahead until I see the \u0022You are entering X\u0022 message. As I might have landed up to 10 km from the region\u0027s \u0022border\u0022 this might take a few minutes, and I might have to throttle my engines up a notch to keep from stopping (but not so fast that I take off again). Once the message pops up, I shut my engines off and brake for all I\u0027m worth. In a few seconds, I\u0027m stopped and inside the target region. Time for EVA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. As of this writing, I hadn\u0027t unlocked ladders, so when my Kerbal leaves for EVA, I generally can\u0027t get him back inside. I collect my EVA report and that\u0027s all I need to do for the contract - then I recover the Kerbal and plane seperately. Once I get ladders unlocked, I\u0027ll be able to fly back to the KSC, thus cutting my losses from recovery operations. But that\u0027s in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope this helps better than my last response.
