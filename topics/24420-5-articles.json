So long as they\u0027re sturdy enough to survive the recoil without getting torn apart, a momentum change is just a course change. No big deal really.\u003Cp\u003EBut, math. Let us take a UNSC frigate as an example. I don\u0027t think they\u0027re given a mass anywhere, but they are given some dimensions on the halo fan wiki. The smallest is the Stalwart class, at 478m by 152m by 112m. If I had a model of one handy I could get the true volume, but I don\u0027t so I\u0027m just going to eyeball it as a block coefficient of .3, so that is 2.4 million cubic meters of volume.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaterial is hard too. My instinct is to assume they\u0027re about as dense as a modern naval vessel, but I don\u0027t really know that number either. But I know a naval vessel can\u0027t be more dense than water, while a space ship doesn\u0027t have that restriction. So water might actually be a decent ballpark, and it\u0027s neat. 2.4 billion kilograms.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe standard MAC is described as firing a 600 ton slug at 30,000 m/s. Force = mass*acceleration, so it\u0027s pretty easy to get our force out of this. 18 billion newtons, though it depends on what ton you use(I hate tons for this reason.). Dividing that by our previously arrived at mass.... gets us an acceleration of 7.5 meters per second. Which is fairly piddling as these things go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course the mass estimate of the frigate could be way off, but probably is good enough to get a rough idea of scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the first, yes that\u0027s definitely true. That\u0027s why I pointed out that to fusion powered space warships other options might be available, such as the free electron laser Rune mentioned.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo the later, that is true, but the MACs were originally built before the covenant showed up with their highly accurate slipspace jumps, and are frequently used at long range in closing engagements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve also spoken with engineers who work in related fields who\u0027ve told me that the powers and switching times for c-fractional coil guns might actually be physically impossible. The ease of building personal scale hand made weapons says nearly nothing about their applicability to space combat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Klingon Admiral\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Klingon Admiral\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELets put some science into Halo. Unfortunately, Halo did never run on science.\u003Cp\u003ESo we have this so-called super-MACs, propelling a 3000 ton projectile at .04c. We know that the kinetic energy of a mass is E=1/2*3000kg*(11,991,698.32m/s)\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2=1/2(6000kg*143,800,828,597,890.8224m\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2/s\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2) = 2.16*10^17 J. Now we remember that there are 300 of these in orbit. This puts a full salvo of all 300 super MACs at 6.5*10^19 J. To put this in reference, the energy output of the Sun is estimated at around 3.85*10^26 watts or J/s, and the global energy consumption in 2008 were about 143.9 pWh, or 143,900,000,000,000 kWh or 518,040,000,000,000,000 kJ or 518,040,000,000,000,000,000 respectively 5.184*10^20 J. This means every salvo of the EDG equals about 1/8 of the annual global energy consumption. And no, it is never explained where all this power comes from, although you will need a massive network of fusion power plants to keep such a system running. At least it suggests that Halo-humanity is a very solid type 1 on the good old Kardashev scale. I hope you see why the coilguns Halo uses are horrible weapons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut according to Newton every action triggers a reaction, so according to conservation of momentum the same amount of energy pushes the MAC \u0022backwards\u0022. To calculate the resulting delta v we would need the mass of the station ... which we sadly do not have. What we do have, however, is the mass of UNSC warships and the MAC rounds they fire (although it is implied that super-MACs are relatively lightweight). A Marathon-class heavy cruiser has a mass of 100,000 tons (yes, a kilometer-long scifi-warship is lighter than WW2 battleships. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E) and fires 600 ton slugs.
