Baxter\u0027s novel Voyage. \u00A0I\u0027ve been enamored by the idea of a Mars mission using Apollo-era tech, and I\u0027ve been wanting to fly it both as a challenge and for fun. \u00A0I\u0027ve

I can do this. \u00A0As of right now, I have a Saturn VB/Ares Command Stack and Ares Propulsion stack built, and have made some test flights of the Saturn VB to make sure it makes orbit and everything more or less functions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI should mention before I go on that I have only 100 hours or more total in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Real Solar System

practicing and learning by both flying the Saturn VB and playing some RP-0 career mode, so I\u0027m not going to go into this blind. \u00A0I plan on practicing every part of the Ares mission until I get good enough to fly the entire mission with confidence.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUsing Chris\u0027 video on the mission combined with what I know of the mission itself from the book and other sources, I constructed my own Saturn VB and Ares command module. \u00A0FASA has everything I need to make the launch vehicle including configs for the F-1A and J-2S rockets, so that was as easy as pie to put together. \u00A0Combine it with 4 UA1564 SRMs, and I get a Saturn VB capable of lofting the Ares command stack into orbit (even with my horrific

module, aerodynamic forces would tear the antennas off and cause the rocket to fall apart. \u00A0I instead opted to build a clone of the Skylab module with procedural parts instead. \u00A0This means I can\u0027t simulate the Kerbals living in the mission module during the journey to and from Mars, but I\u0027m able to live with that. \u00A0Some good news is that I\u0027m able to create procedural tanks for both life support and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel with more than enough of both for the mission. \u00A0I was also able to use the solar panels from the Skylab pack with a little bit of trickery to get them to attach and function properly. \u00A0They work great, look great, and actually swing open without the need for IR hines, and it saved me some time recreating the solar panels from scratch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also used a different texture for the MS-II interstage and the fairing shroud for the MEM. \u00A0I wasn\u0027t sure how to recreate the look of the fairing from Chris\u0027 video, and using the Saturn/Nova stripes actually created a better aesthetic for me, so I plan on sticking with this pattern. I was able to recreate the shape though, so it\u0027ll look nice when docked to the propulsion stage.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the MEM itself, I\u0027m using \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/136290-tiktaalikdreaming/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022136290\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/136290-tiktaalikdreaming/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@TiktaalikDreaming\u003C/a\u003E\u0027s NKR MEM mod. \u00A0I can\u0027t thank him enough for creating this mod, and I can\u0027t thank the people who created \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E configs for this. \u00A0This was a major time-saver as I didn\u0027t have to spend a lot of time creating a procedural parts MEM, which is a huge hassle if you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing and what you\u0027re trying to build. \u00A0I believe in the book, the MEM used cryogenic propellants and not Methane/FLOX-88 like in the mod, but I\u0027m not going to worry about that part and use the Methane/FLOX-88 version as I\u0027d rather have a working MEM that\u0027s close to the book than a version that\u0027s perfect yet a pain to create and use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EAAFB72F8CAAEB9F51FC812FE78C16DBFF966BF8 (1280\u00D7720)\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/266097744480858098/EAAFB72F8CAAEB9F51FC812FE78C16DBFF966BF8/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurrently, for the OMS for the command stack, I\u0027m using the SPS engine. \u00A0I believe this was used in the book to propel the Ares command stack to rendezvous with propulsion stack, but I may be wrong. \u00A0I may change this in the future depend on how well the SPS functions, but I\u0027m sticking with it for now. \u00A0I also have four sets of four \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters powered my MMH/NTO bipropellant. \u00A0Only two sets are active at any time depending on the center of mass. \u00A0I did this to make sure the command stack translates with as little hassle as possible. \u00A0This is probably a break from the book (though the book AFAIK never mentioned \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E configs), but I feel NASA engineers would have thought ahead about \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Center of Mass\u0022\u003ECoM\u003C/abbr\u003E changes for different configurations of the command stack and compensated for it in a similar manner.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u00224878CE6CCEACFE8C0EBACFDDCE3FBD1C97AB9ABF (1280\u00D7720)\u0022 src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/266097744481314409/4878CE6CCEACFE8C0EBACFDDCE3FBD1C97AB9ABF/\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve built the propulsion stack to pretty much the same look at Chris\u0027 except for the top fairing, which will use the Saturn/Nova texture. \u00A0This was pretty straightforward and easy to build from looking at the video. \u00A0The only differences are the use of the Skylab solar panels and the APS flight packs on the MS-IVB. \u00A0Also, I need to figure out how to make the FASA S-II and S-IVB tanks cryogenic so the LH2 doesn\u0027t boil off, but I think I found where to change the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Realism Overhaul (mod)\u0022\u003ERO\u003C/abbr\u003E configuration of these tanks so that they register as cryogenic. \u00A0At worst, I\u0027ll have to make all of the tanks procedural cryogenic tanks, but I don\u0027t think that will be necessary. \u00A0I\u0027ll also be giving the J2-S five ignitions instead of three given that I may need to make mid-course corrections (MCCs), and given that the mission profile calls for the MS-II to be ignited 3 times without MCCs, I\u0027d better break from reality there and give myself a couple extra ignitions. \u00A0I may also put smaller motors on the MS-II for MCCs, but I won\u0027t be sure until I start practicing the flight itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs of right now, I\u0027m close to completing the Ares launch vehicle and Ares propulsion stack. \u00A0Only minor tweaks remain. \u00A0Then I plan on testing the MEM in orbit and setting the staging up. \u00A0Then comes everything else I need to do to make this mission happen, from practicing rendezvous and docking to using Fly-By Finder or other planning tools to do the Venus gravity assist to Mars to finally landing on Mars itself. \u00A0Hopefully, I\u0027ll be able to put this all together soon and finally fly the mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ll be posting updates here as I prepare for the mission, and then my attempts on the mission itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nP.S.

it\u0027s Space Shuttle-era tech, except they never made the Space Shuttle and instead improved Apollo tech. \u00A0So Apollo \u002B 15 years of development and re-development. \u00A0I think Baxter\u0027s NASA would have had improved cryogenic storage for the propulsion stage (and it hints at that in the book). \u00A0I also think the MEM in the book ended up with cryo fuels because the hypergolic ones were destroying the hardware for the MEM, but I\u0027m not going to bother with switching fuels for the MEM.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, in the book, they were originally going full-force with NERVA tech and a direct shot to Mars\u00A0until an accident with the first NERVA-powered Saturn V killed three astronauts. \u00A0After that, NASA wouldn\u0027t touch nuclear rockets, but they still wanted to go to Mars, so they went with an opposition-class (Earth -\u0026gt; Venus - \u0026gt; Mars -\u0026gt; Earth) mission proposed previously in the book but shot down when everyone else was giddy about NERVA tech at the time. \u00A0This is why the mission was flown with normal chemical tech and not NERVA. \u00A0If they have stuck with NERVA, then they would have gone with the nuclear shuttle proposal Van Braun had envisioned as part of his post-Apollo plan (the same one where we got our Space Shuttle). \u00A0Been thinking of making an Apollo-N for fun\u00A0and making a Saturn-Shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing, the F-1As in the book had throttling capability so the Saturn-VB didn\u0027t break up on Max Q. \u00A0I\u0027m not sure what that throttle range was, but I may or may not add it into my F-1As. \u00A0Honestly, I don\u0027t get breakup unless I pitch too hard on ascent, but it would be nice to throttle and not waste delta-V on ascent or getting in a high orbit (I tend to end up with 300km apogees, but I\u0027m not the best at gravity turns, and anything too high ends up suborbital).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan

\u00A0Thanks. \u00A0I think the other reason is because the antennas on your Skylab don\u0027t fit into the standard conical fairings for an Saturn/Apollo config, so RT might count them as exposed and thus break them off. \u00A0They\u0027re actually quite long, so they may not even fit in modified procedural fairings that are conical in shape. \u00A0Furthermore, I\u0027m not sure if those antennas have the range to go to Mars, but if they do, great. \u00A0If not, I can add a relay dish.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI planned on adding a parabolic dish to my Skylab mock-up anyway and having it extend on an IR part.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen there\u0027s the radiator on the end, which (I don\u0027t think) exists on the Ares Mission Module version of Skylab.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis starts to present an interesting but potentially rewarding challenge of either modifying your part to fit the book\u0027s version (cutting off the end radiator and antennae and adding more life support) or trying to somehow turn my procedural parts mock-up into a part and swapping in your IVA so I can get a few screenshots of the astronauts riding in the Ares mission module. \u00A0Might not have the tools or expertise to do either, but I may try anyway once I\u0027m done tweaking and balancing everything.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt worst, I just go without the IVA. \u00A0At best, I learn some new tricks and impress myself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium

\u00A0This is because Tiktaalik\u0027s MEM is designed to operate differently than the one in Voyage, despite being the same craft in general. \u00A0Tiktaalik\u0027s requires a chute and ballute for a safe descent. \u00A0Voyage ditched these two parts and had the MEM just use aerodynamic braking and a powered descent phase. \u00A0Therefore, trying to do a Voyage-style descent in the base MEM results in death and destruction.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022EF5867279E62E473A54584902D4BCD15A68C4889 (1280\u00D7720)\u0022

practice descents in total, and they\u0027ve all ended in crashes. \u00A0First two were from 150km circular orbits, the next couple from 300km circular orbits. \u00A0Both times, I couldn\u0027t slow down fast enough to prevent a crash. \u00A0Furthermore, I discovered that the descent stage lacked enough fuel to make a safe descent, only containing 900m/s delta V. \u00A0My solution was to add more fuel in the descent stage to extend the usable descent burn time and hopefully have enough delta V to slow the craft down for a safe landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg

this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was able to squeeze in enough fuel to bring the descent stage delta V to about 1800m/s while keeping the Martian \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Thrust-to-weight ratio\u0022\u003ETWR\u003C/abbr\u003E at 1.0. \u00A0A few more descent tests resulted in the craft being better able to kill velocity, but I still ended up crashing due to bad piloting (practice makes perfect). \u00A0Also, the additional fuel meant additional weight, but the deorbit solid motors were still able to get the MEM into an orbit that either fell below the ground at 150 km or resulted in aerocapture at 300km.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnfortunately, even with the additional fuel, this may still not be enough to allow for a Voyage-style ascent. \u00A0Delta V margins are still tight, and so are \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel margins. \u00A0Turning the craft ate up precious \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel and descent delta V, so\u00A0I found that I would always run out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E trying to keep the craft stable during powered descent, and on the last test, even with the large gimballing range of the aerospike engine, I ended up tumbling and crashing after running out of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E. \u00A0Every other time, I was fighting to keep the vertical velocity low enough to hope that the MEM slowed down enough from air resistance to get the surface speed below the remaining delta V. \u00A0This took practice, and I almost achieved this on my last descent attempt before the tumbling hit and I lost the lander and crew to a fiery crash. \u00A0The other times, I would end up unable to kill my descent fast enough with the engine, and I\u0027d pancake. \u00A0This is not including my attempts at doing a skip re-entry, which uses up \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E as well as I need it to angle the MEM in the hopes of gaining a bit of lift on descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTherefore, I\u0027m stuck with this issue of needing more \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E fuel for descent, which adds more weight and thus requires more descent fuel, eventually leading to an unsolvable problem thanks to the law of diminishing returns and the rules of the book. \u00A0The only possible solution to this is to use some of the ascent stage \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E on descent, but I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s enough margin for that. \u00A0Furthermore, I still may need more descent fuel as it is to ensure I don\u0027t run out, as I have never got the craft slowed down below 400 m/s before a crash or unrecoverable tumble (most of this velocity being horizontal).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs a result, I\u0027m stuck wondering if it\u0027s even possible to do a Voyage-style descent in the NAR MEM. \u00A0I\u0027m also stuck wondering what Columbia did in the book to supplement the removal of the chutes and ballutes. \u00A0I vaguely remember them removing them because they weren\u0027t going to make much of a difference, but i don\u0027t have a copy of the book with me to check what they did, or if there\u0027s any indication of how Gershon landed the Challenger. \u00A0Maybe the book took an artistic license on the whole thing, which would seem odd for a hardcore science fiction novel. \u00A0As a result, I may have to break the purity of this recreation and use chutes and ballutes for my descent, or add aerobrakes. \u00A0This is not something I want to do because I think it would ruin the challenge of doing it by the book, but if the book presents something that is impossible in the game, I may have to just ignore the book and think outside the book.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m open to suggestions.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium
