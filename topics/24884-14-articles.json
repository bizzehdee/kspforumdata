Why not use the Apollo data? Or research how it\u0027s handled on modern space flights? Research the International Space Station. 100x???? That\u0027s pretty arbitrary and unrealistic. I mean, if you wanted to make the oxygen resource more massive I could understand that; unless my math is wrong the amount of oxygen consumed in kilograms is pretty low (nearly 100 times less dense actually...).\u003Cp\u003EBut leave the rate of consumption alone, let that be equal to the amount of oxygen being used by one Kerbal in an hour, the way it\u0027s calibrated now. Also, recyclers shouldn\u0027t take so much energy. The power is mostly just for fans to move the air around.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou\u0027re right about the energy, I changed that back after finding you can\u0027t power life support from Solar Cells. But I found it too easy not needing any life support at all for Mun trips and I wanted trips to Jool etc to FEEL like a big expedition, maybe even have a reason to want to fill up on Oxygen in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere. Just trying to challenge myself in the game maybe to balance that I added the bigger rockets from the popular packs, and modded engines a bit to simulate near-future sci-fi - I mean, the \u0022Ariane 5 Clone\u0022 craft I downloaded FAILED to make orbit, and I\u0027m pretty sure the real one works just fine, so I use better rockets but I make life support and caring for crew comfort more of a challenge. I hope this gets updated and becomes able to prevent cheating ie/kill kerbals in non-active ships.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAccuracy/Apollo data? I\u0027m not sure. Scrubbers don\u0027t use much power, but do use up some chemical instead. Recovering the Oxygen from CO2 would take power, its not just fans. But.. yeah.. in KSP you can get to the Mun in hours not days, so you\u0027re right, but for gameplay/roleplay I think my way fits (when I changed power back to normal) and gameplay is what matters to me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks, mainly I want Yongedevil to see how awesome he is.

I can\u0027t remember, but I think the total came out to a bit over 300 days, just to be on the safe side. One big oxygen tank plus two of the smaller ones (radially mounted w/ the radial mount adapter thingy) got me to the target amount with oxygen to spare. (I might have added a few of the tiny sphere ones, too.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do agree that we need some sort of greenhouse module and/or something that can split LOX into LiquidFuel and O2 -- the first being bulky and requiring sunlight, and the latter being heavy and requiring a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYongedevil mentioned earlier that he doesn\u0027t have the ability to craft new models, so maybe if we got a volunteer? As a last resort, I could certainly try. I\u0027ve got Lightwave, and I\u0027ve seen instructions on how to roundtrip the models through Blender so they\u0027ll be Unity-compatible. \u003Ca href=\u0022http://jrandom.smugmug.com/Art-1/Computer-Generated/12161631_7TwBKV#!i=2425496311\u0026amp;k=JQZL6qj\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI\u0027m not that great of a modeler\u003C/a\u003E, so that\u0027s the downside.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spyritdragon","CreatedById":70515,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-09T06:46:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELOX is really just that: Liquid Oxygen.
