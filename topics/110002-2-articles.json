It may seem a bit too easy when coming back to Kerbin, but have you tried going to Jool? It\u0027s extremely unforgiving.

Jool is entirely different because you\u0027re entering at high speeds (usually much greater that 3km/s) from interplanetary transfer and have to scrub a lot of delta-V to aerocapture, which means your parts are subject to a lot more heating most especially because you\u0027re in a thinner atmosphere for much, much longer than reentry on Kerbin. In fact, it\u0027s pretty safe to say that aerocapture on Jool from an interplanetary transfer would be fairly close to actual reentry here on Earth, at least higher up.\u003Cp\u003ESo, yeah, it boils down to the fact that Kerbin is stupid tiny, like pretty much everything else in this game.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-19T23:45:11Z\u0022 title=\u002205/19/2015 11:45  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by regex\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DavidBowman","CreatedById":111419,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-19T21:55:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI knew we\u0027d have devnotes when Modding Mondays came out!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnity5!
