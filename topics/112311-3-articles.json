I was thinking about value in this context from the \u0022Zen\u0022 standpoint. I think of those monks who give up having lots of material possessions, and who practically aren\u0027t much different in some aspects than a homeless person. They seem to be a good example of how value can be determined.. subjectively? Does this relate to the earlier post regarding the \u0022subjective theory\u0022 of value?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, using our hypothetical zen monk, we insert him into different thought experiments. Would he, in fact, accept neither the 100 ounces of gold nor the swiss army knife if placed in new york? Clearly most people would opt for the gold and sell it as was mentioned in the post to which that example belonged, but perhaps our zen guy would not value either object. Let\u0027s assume he valued having nothing so much that he even turned down food and fasted for a few days, simply meditating the entire time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it be said, then, based on that example, that value is fundamentally linked to perception? I admit this isn\u0027t far off, and possibly the same by virtue of economic terms as \u0022Value is how much someone is willing to pay for it\u0022. However, I do think it is distinguished from it philosophically to some extent. For instance, the monk is willing to pay 0 tynes for your gold or your knife. But - you see, the willingness to pay or not, how much, or how much even perhaps the monk would give you instead just for offering the items, would seem to be linked to his perception. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo my amateur philosophical rambling ends with an idea that value is based on perception.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T04:39:14Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 04:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by MunGazer\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T06:09:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have the weirdest life...

If he did, which item would he choose? Perhaps since he places a value of 0 on the items themselves, it wouldn\u0027t matter which item he chose. Maybe he\u0027d accept the offer and just not do anything with the item that was given to him. For instance, he might smile at the offerer, and hold the 6 pound hunk of gold or the knife in his hands for a while, then sit back down and place the item on the ground and return to his meditation, never touching it again. Or, maybe the monk would try to kindly refuse the offer, much like how many of us do when we feel that someone is being too generous. For instance, if my grandmother offered me all the money in her bank account, which was $700, and that\u0027s all she had, I\u0027d turn her down immediately and tell her she needed it much more than I did. Or, maybe the monk would accept the gold, and then go find a beggar and give it directly to him. Zen philosophy can get pretty wild in how it tears down conventional perceptions of things and builds it back up from nothing. I had a little hand book once with lots of zen parables and sayings in it. In one instance (I\u0027m going to paraphrase it since it\u0027s been years since I read it), a student was near a pond with some geese in it that suddenly took flight and he said to his master, \u0022Look master, the geese are flying away!\u0022 The master promptly grabbed the student\u0027s nose, and twisted it, saying \u0022WHEN DID THE GEESE EVER FLY AWAY!?\u0022. Another passage said something like \u0022The fundamental delusion of humanity is that I am here and you are there.\u0022.
