and 1.3.\u00A0 Even when to do push major updates, it\u0027s not as if mod authors have to re-write their mod from scratch.\u00A0 Many of the times when a mod does break, all it needs is a reference update (recompile against the new DLL) without actually changing any code at all.\u00A0 It\u0027s actually pretty infrequent that a massive breaking patch comes along, 1.2 was an engine change, so
