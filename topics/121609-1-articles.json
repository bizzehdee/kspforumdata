I had put a satellite in the correct orbit, but forgot to add the scientific equipment to complete the contract. I tried this before, but forgot the tool kit and parts! I have them with me this time, so will KAS let me complete a contract for a satellite already in orbit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BR87Tn_MyEA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/BR87Tn_MyEA?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlease feel free to comment on the lets play Style as well as the Kerbaling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for watching!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJarratt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Aylwick)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tailwind","CreatedById":151505,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-25T21:32:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi Jarratt\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working through your 1.04 playthrough, and enjoying it.
