Anyone else seen this?\n\nI am really upset because it was for a challenge and I had spent 3 hours aero breaking and rendezvous with the craft.\n\n![F526p2R.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/F526p2R.jpg)"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T02:47:37Z","Content":"There are a number of factors that play into this. The faster you\u0027re moving, the more force is applied to the underside of your wing, which can only endure a force directly proportional to it\u0027s size and length of the contact point of the part it is connected to."},{"CreatedByName":"UnusualAttitude","CreatedById":129962,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T11:36:50Z","Content":"Did you check F3 after the crash? This [bug](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/105214-Share-your-experiences-with-the-parts-hitting-building-bug) still rears its ugly head from time to time, especially after long flights/missions.\n\nThe only solution: always quicksave before final approach and try again. If symptoms persist, then land a couple of kms from the KSC and taxi to destination."},{"CreatedByName":"Nich","CreatedById":145678,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-29T19:43:42Z","Content":"BAH it happened again.

Perhaps that\u0027s the issue if you\u0027re not colliding with invisible buildings."},{"CreatedByName":"Claw","CreatedById":100668,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T04:35:18Z","Content":"Not just \u0022quicksave and try again,\u0022 but \u0022quicksave, restart, and try again\u0022 might be a good idea.

It was just a matter of stopping before I hit the invisible wall and wings would still blow up while rolling on the ground or texting at 10 m/s\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-30T05:08:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/30/2015 05:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Nich**"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T05:20:39Z","Content":"Don\u0027t text and fly"},{"CreatedByName":"Korizan","CreatedById":142032,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T11:00:35Z","Content":"As you are controlling the craft all you need to do is read the log when it pops up.\n\nIt will say such and such items collided with or over heated.\n\nUse that as a starting point."}]}
