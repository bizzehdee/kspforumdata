I am coordinating over 20 observatories located in 5 continents.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nWe are searching for habitable exoplanets around non-flare G, K and M-type stars located within 100 ly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nThe stars we are monitoring already have known transiting exoplanets, but none of them are potentially habitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nWe are monitoring each star 24/7 for several months. By doing so, we believe that the chances of finding an exoplanet increase for particular targets. Moreover, we are focusing on stars closer than 100 light years because, on the one hand, the closest habitable exoplanets will be the first destinations of interstellar missions and, on the other, because very few nearby habitable exoplanets around G and K-type stars have been discovered: only 2 of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nThe number of potentially habitable exoplanets that we could discover is, in theory, around 25. This calculation was obtained by taking into account the number of non-flare stars within 100 light years and the percentage of them that should show transits in the habitable zone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nEach observatory observes the same star and, when the transit of a hypothetical habitable exoplanet becomes unlikely, we move to another star.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nWithin 100 light years, we only found 10 non-flare G, K and M-type stars with known transiting exoplanets not potentially habitable.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nBig telescopes are not necessary, but CCD cameras with a resolution of at least 16 bits are advisable because we are searching for exoplanets that produce a change of brightness in the star of around 0.1%.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nIf you are interested, feel free to contact me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022color:#222222;font-size:15px;\u0022\u003E\nMore info:\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022https://youtu.be/0A7gEaewOws\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://youtu.be/0A7gEaewOws\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"munlander1","CreatedById":168560,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-14T02:55:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMight also want to drop this in the astrophotography thread over in science and spaceflight\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
