However, the tweakscale issue I can help with to some degree. First I will make the assumption that you have the latest version, next I will ask what problem your having. I use tweakscale rather extensively and while I have not seen to much of an issue asside from the issues from kspapi compatibility issues and issues when used with modular fuels, all of which have been fixed as of the resent release of modular fuel tanks and kspapi by Taniwha. If you can be specific, I may be able to assist you, but as of right now I have no issues with tweakscale and LLL.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceCommanderNemo","CreatedById":110846,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-10T13:16:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t use modular fuel tanks, should I be?
