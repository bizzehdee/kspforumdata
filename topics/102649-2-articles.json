That is the best thing ever.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E This is exactly what I mean. People make all kinds of fundamentally faulty assumptions. Wheels do not count, as they are not powered.\n\nSince this question cannot be answered without assumptions, that is inevitable. You are both right and wrong. While I am tempted to let the trolling carry on, this thread got put in a serious area instead of residing in \u0022games\u0022. Really I suppose it is more of an experiment that a game. \n\nThe fact is that the question cannot be answered with the information given. You must make assumptions to answer it. People from both camps (though I am not entirely surprised to find the inhabitants of this forum are of a higher grade than the usual bait-takers) instantly make assumptions that suit their desired outcome. It is possible both for the plane to take off (in all likelihood) and it is also possible (theoretically) for it not to take off, given certain conditions. The actual correct answer came up on page two.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Assuming that the engines are able to push the plane at the same speed the conveyor belt is moving (both being a constant), the result is a function of the wheel bearing friction and plane weight.\n\u003E If the wheel bearing friction is small and the plane is light, you get the results that the Mythbusters got. Increase the weight of the plane and/or the friction coefficient of the wheel bearings, and the belt will start to drag the plane with it, slowing the forward motion. At a certain point, the plane will not be able to accelerate, and therefore to lift off.\n\u003E \n\u003E You can conduct a simple experiment dis/proving this, just start braking to increase wheel bearing friction and/or add something heavy for additional weight. If you have the belt and the plane, that is.\n\u003E \n\u003E Did I amuse you enough with my post? ![k_tongue.gif](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/images/smilies/k_tongue.gif)\n\nThe assertion that the wheels do not matter relies on them being able to spin at speeds exceeding the belt speed. Since they are mechanical devices, they have limits that *can* be exceeded. Obviously in reality it would be highly unlikely that the plane would be on such a powerful belt (or on a belt at all), and would take off. Regardless, anyone arguing over it has made assumptions that suit their argument.\n\nExcept me, of course, I\u0027m just an evil troll.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-26T00:23:51Z\u0022 title=\u002203/26/2015 12:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 26, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T00:21:07Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Since this question cannot be answered without assumptions, that is inevitable.

Thus, the only case where the belt\u0027s own movement directly prevents an aircraft\u0027s takeoff is not possible.\n\nOn the other hand, there\u0027s mechanical limits to how fast those wheels could rotate before breaking off. If you determine those limits, you may find a point at which a conveyor belt would prevent takeoff by breaking the plane - but the belt cannot prevent takeoff simply by pulling a plane back, only by causing physical destruction of required components. Moving the belt does not actually provide noticeably more mechanical resistance than the plane rolling forward under its own power on a runway, so the fringe condition people are suggesting, where the belt is moving fast enough to pull back on the plane, is a non-existant condition.\n\nIn fact, the belt would sooner help the plane takeoff, as its movement would pull air along with it, and if it is moving contrary to the attempted takeoff direction, then that is simply increasing air velocity over the wings, meaning a lower ground-relative velocity is needed, even if the conveyor-relative velocity is considerably higher."},{"CreatedByName":"Camacha","CreatedById":59088,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T01:18:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In fact, the belt would sooner help the plane takeoff, as its movement would pull air along with it, and if it is moving contrary to the attempted takeoff direction, then that is simply increasing air velocity over the wings, meaning a lower ground-relative velocity is needed, even if the conveyor-relative velocity is considerably higher.\n\nThat is a good approach.
