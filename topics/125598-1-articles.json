Them have have gotten that far, please post your observations. Me, I\u0026#39;ve just noticed some significant differences with aerobraking at Kerbin in 1.05 compared to 1.04. For instance:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[U]Returning from Mun/Minmus[/U]\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt used to be my SOP that my 1st pass from either of these places was at 37km. This would usually put me with an Ap of around 1Mm and nothing would get hot. Then I\u0026#39;d do 1 or 2 more passes at the same Pe of 37km, or maybe let it fall naturally down to 36-35km, until my Ap was 150-300km, then circularize. All this was with a final rocket stage still attached. Then I\u0026#39;d do the deorbit burn so I\u0026#39;d land close to KSC, dump the last rocket stage, and come down with just the pod, any science parts I was returning, the heat shield, and chutes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNowadays, however, things don\u0026#39;t work like that. The 1st pass at 37km, the engine comes close to exploding from heat. IOW, engines are no longer good heatshields. Also, my Ap after the pass is still out at 1.5-2Mm. If I leave the Pe at 37km for the 2nd pass, the atmosphere sucks me down and I land right then, ready or not. Which seems quite strange. If the atmosphere is thinner, so that the same Pe and velocity gives me a significantly higher Ap on the 1st pass, and if wind resistance increases with velocity, then keeping my Pe at 37km for the 2nd pass should NOT cause me to land that pass because I have less resistance than before (from an Ap of 1.5-2Mm compared to out at Minmus or even Mun). \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd there\u0026#39;s a really sharp division between a Pe of 37km and 38km. After the 1st pass, if I raise my Pe to 38km, then it will take me several more passes to bring my Ap downt to where it costs nearly nothing to circularize just above the atmosphere. But 37km and below and I\u0026#39;m landing right then, usually halfway around Kerbin after a rise back up to about 45km.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote that all this is leading with an engine. Which, as noted, gets dangerously hot.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnybody else seeing this?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OgreMagi","CreatedById":103767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T03:33:41Z","Content":"\nI played with a career mission to Minmus, I dropped to 45km and noticed it took me several more passes to make orbit. the Heat affect was still siginificant but dropping lower heated up the engines and exposed surfaces too much .\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T03:36:43Z","Content":"\nThe important thing I\u0026#39;m seeing:\u003Cbr\u003E\nA simple Mk.1 capsule with \u0026#39;chute is too clean when equipped with a heat shield.

I have the same Pe (37-38km) on both the 1st and 2nd passes. I do the 1st pass, at Ap raise the Pe back to where it was, then make 2nd pass.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nOn the 1st pass, the Ap is way out near Mun or Minmus so the orbit is very eccentric. On the 2nd pass, the orbit is much more circular although still eccentric (Ap ~1.5Mm). So while on both passes the ship is in the exact same \u0022layers\u0022 of the atmosphere (70km down to 37-38km), on the 1st pass the high eccentricity causes it to spend more time in the atmosphere, nearly 1/2 of Kerbin\u0026#39;s circumference. Wth the 2nd pass, the ship WOULD only be in the atmosphere for about 1/3-1/4 or so of Kerbin\u0026#39;s circumference. However, actually it never exits on this pass and lands about 1/2 to 2/3 of Kerbin\u0026#39;s circumference from where it entered the atmosphere).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ship is the same on both passes (except for a tiny amount less mass from the \u0026gt;5m/s Pe-adjusting burn between the passes). So on both passes, it has the same drag coefficient, (essentially) the same mass, and goes through the same density layers of the atmosphere. On the 2nd pass, the ship\u0026#39;s speed at Pe isn\u0026#39;t THAT much less than it was on the 1st pass---it\u0026#39;s still well over 2000m/s. But it is slower, so in the same atmospheric density and with the same drag coefficient and mass, it should be experiencing somewhat less drag force than on the 1st pass. And its trajectory would have it in the atmosphere for less time, so this lower force SHOULD have less time to act on it. This leads to the expectation, which was supported by observations in all KSP versions from 0.20 to 1.04, that using the same Pe on the 2nd and subsequent passes. somewhere between 35-40km, should result in gradually bringing the Ap down over multiple passes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut in 1.05, the 2nd pass sucks you right on down to the ground. Why? The only explanation that fits observations now is that the 1.05 aero model imposes more drag on the same ship in the same air if the ship is going slower. Which IMHO is wrong. Further, this increase in drag is grossly disproportionate to the difference in speed. Which also IMHO seems wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow, I\u0026#39;m no rocket scientist so I could be wrong about the expected behavior in this example. But higher drag for the same ship in the same air at a lower speed strikes me as bogus.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n[quote name=\u0027Warzouz\u0027]At Duna, I found a bug : Chutes safely opens at 220m/s instead of nearly 600 or 700m/s in 1.0.4.

If both passes have the same periapsis, then the one with higher apoapsis ALWAYS spends less time in atmosphere. Since dynamics in space is reversible, make a thought experiment. You are starting from periapsis, and setting your velocity to some arbitrary V0. If V0 is higher, your trajectory will be always flatter (less curved) and therefore at any point further away from Kerbin than the lower-V0 trajectory, right ? Now, as we all know, the higher the velocity, the higher the apoapsis. Hence the high-apoapsis trajectory is always flatter near periapsis and therefore spends less time in atmosphere. Which means that the higher the starting point of a dive, the less distance will be through the atmosphere, provided the periapsis is the same. Of course it is possible to do higher dive with more atmospheric time, but it will always require lower periapsis.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHigher apoapsis = less distance in atmosphere, given fixed periapsis\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Armisael","CreatedById":152425,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T15:40:36Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027LostOblivion\u0027]I know, and agree, however I think it\u0026#39;s a nice game limitation restricting the upper limit of how much ablator a heat shield can have for its size, and although a lower limitation of 0 is unrealistic without changing the looks of the heat shield, it makes for more freedom in gameplay.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThat limitation doesn\u0026#39;t really exist.

Spaceflight is reversable in total energy needed going in both directions, but the times and places you use that energy changes depending on whether you\u0026#39;re going outwards or inwards.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt goes like this\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSetting up for 1st pass:\u003Cbr\u003E\nI\u0026#39;ve just escaped Mun and am at my Ap out there next to Mun\u0026#39;s orbit, and my Pe is say 400km. So I do a retrograde burn at Ap, which tightens the radius of the curve near Pe as the Pe comes down. Before I\u0026#39;m not in the atmosphere at all. As my Pe reaches 69km, I\u0026#39;m only in the atmosphere for an instant. As the Pe continues to decrease, the arc of my flight through Kerbin\u0026#39;s atmosphere increases, until by 37km it\u0026#39;s approaching 1/2 of Kerbin\u0026#39;s circumference (say 3/8). The more your lower at Pe, the tighter the radius of the curve in the vicinities of Pe, until it\u0026#39;s nearly an instantaneous reversal of direction when the Pe is at Kerbin\u0026#39;s center.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSetting up for 2nd pass: \u003Cbr\u003E\nDuring the 1st pass, my Pe will fall to about 34km while my Ap drops down to about 1.5Mm. The orbit has changed from a comet-like long, skinny ellipse to a fairly circular oval, with a significantly greater proportion of the change in shape happening on the major axis compared to the minor. If this was not so, then you\u0026#39;d never change eccentricity. And the closer the orbit is to a circle, the shorter the distance between the foci, so the closer 1/2 the major axis approximates the radius of a circle centered between the foci and intersection the Ap and Pe. This \u0022squishing\u0022 of the ellipse flattens out the curve in the vicinity of Pe, making it more like a circle instead of a hairpin. The Pe has moved in a bit, the Ap has moved in a lot, while the minor axis hasn\u0026#39;t changed nearly as much. Because the curve is flatter, the distance in the atmosphere is less than before, like about 1/4 of the circumference of Kerbin. When I burn at Ap again, prograde this time, I raise the Pe back to 37km, it has no noticeable effect on curvature because it\u0026#39;s a not enough of a change, in proportion to the ellipse axes, to matter.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"wdsmith3","CreatedById":109950,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T12:28:55Z","Content":"\nusing the drouge chutes will help. they can safely open at a higher speed( above sound barier) and helps slow you down higher up.

Let me explain it again.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAssuming no irreversible processes happen (like atmospheric braking) then spaceflight is *fully* reversible. There is no time arrow defined -- if time is reversed, we couldn\u0026#39;t tell (as we can for example for thermodynamic processes like gas escaping from container into space since reverse process is HIGHLY unlikely), since the dynamics would be exactly described by the same physics.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis means that considering going from different APs to same PE is *exactly* equivalent of going from PE to different APs. Of course this ignores atmosphere, but since you are going to the same predicted PE, it ignores atmosphere anyway. So let\u0026#39;s assume that Kerbin has no atmosphere for a moment, and just track how much of the trajectory is \u0022below 70km\u0022 or any other set altitude. Then my previous claims hold true. The higher velocity at given fixed PE, the higher the AP, but at the same time less curve and therefore trajectory always above the lower-velocity trajectory.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWe have 2 trajectories (both are after any burning you did at AP, so both are ballistic trajectories from that point): A) from AP 12Mm to PE 37km, B) from AP 1.5Mm to Pe 37km\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is exactly equivalent to trajectories: C) from PE 37km to AP 12Mm, D) from PE 37km to AP 1.5Mm. It should be obvious to anyone playing KSP that trajectories A and C have the same velocity at periapsis, and that velocity (Va=Vc) is higher than the periapsis velocity of trajectories B and D (Vb=Vd\u0026lt;Va=Vc) (can\u0026#39;t cheat conservation of energy without burning engines, which I assume you don\u0026#39;t do except at AP to adjust PE). If your velocity is higher, then the curvature of the trajectory (at a given altitude) MUST be smaller. This is because the gravitational force is proportional only to masses and the distance from the body that you are interacting with. And the mass of the object itself cancels out when calculating acceleration, so it only depends on mass of the planet and distance form the planet center -\u0026gt; altitude. Given higher velocity, the curvature must be smaller = larger curvature radius, as described by r = V^2/a (this is simple relation for circular motion, but if we consider local curvature then it works as well), since a = acceleration from gravity which is the same for both A/C and B/D trajectories.\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile it is obviously possible to draw an ellipse of higher eccentrity (and higher AP) with same PE, that is also narrower, such ellipse is not a physical trajectory and will not have Kerbin as one of focal points (which is always true for trajectories in point gravitational field, as calculated in KSP).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn the below picture, the low AP orbit (actually lowest possible, since it\u0026#39;s circular) is blue. The high AP orbit is NOT the red one that indeed would spend more time in atmosphere, but the green one, which is always above blue one, except at PE. Black points are supposed focal points of the ellipse. Note that the red one does NOT have focal point at the center of Kerbin (cyan circle), since PE is always *closest* point to the focal point which must be (according to physics) the body with gravity field (so by definition PE is closest to focal point). An even higher AP ellipse would be again wider around kerbin and always above green trajectory.\u003Cbr\u003E\n[IMG]http://i67.tinypic.com/24o9b0o.png[/IMG]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"panzer1b","CreatedById":95108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-18T16:18:24Z","Content":"\nSofar, and the only vessels ive tried with are SSTLs (single stage to laythe), i have noticed that aerocapture can be done fairly easily from most places (me personally) would actually go to/return from. At kerbin, you can do a aerocapture with a SSTO from duna, dres, and eve. I have not tried returning from jool yet, so i cant comment on how hard that is. Eve aerocapture IS DOABLE with heat shields (back in 1.0.4 it seems that even was just plain suicidal). Duna is a utter joke as my ships dont even get yellow (the most you will get from say kerbin is orange and you can actually land directly during that aerocapture if you want to). Laythe can be done as before (if you time it so laythe is going away from you as you enter its SOI, if its not, then forget touching atmo at 6km/s and surviving that), direct aerocaptures work, although you wont be able to establish an orbit on the first pass (as expected). Jool also can be done (as before) in a spaceplane, just be careful not to go too deep as it gets very hot very quick. I still say tylo gravity assist is the most reliable and safest option, but it seems like vessels that have everything made of 2000K minimum exterior can survive aerocapture at laythe and jool.
