For example, do you just want to do \u0022go there, land, grab science, return\u0022? Or do you want to do a more ambitious get-it-all-in-one-go, where you totally strip-mine the Duna system of all available science? (e.g. do multiple landings, hit all the biomes, go to Ike too and hit all of *its* biomes, and come back with the whole enchilada)\n\nFor a simple single-landing scenario, you don\u0027t really need to have multiple ships, or even a particularly big ship; it takes more dV to go to Duna and back than it does to the Mun, but not *insanely* more dV. It requires trickier navigation and attention to launch windows, but the design of the ship isn\u0027t hugely harder, and doesn\u0027t require higher tech than a Mun mission.\n\nIf you want to go the get-it-all approach, then you\u0027ll need a bigger mission (either because you need to send lots of fuel, or else you need to send lots of heavy ISRU mining equipment). You could do that with multiple ships, or one big ship. Personally, I prefer the one-big-ship approach (either launched in one piece, or multiple ships docked together) because it involves less fiddling around for me to do-- I only have to navigate once, and don\u0027t have to waste any fuel on arrival in getting the various ships together.\n\nThe fun part of Duna is that it\u0027s a fairly easy target as interplanetary missions go, which gives you a lot of latitude in designing your mission. There are lots of different ways to do it, so you can go for the mission that suits your play style. For harder targets that \u0022push the envelope\u0022 a lot more (like landing on Moho or Eve-- both difficult, but for different reasons), the options are somewhat more constrained.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T19:52:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 07:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Snark**"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T17:03:32Z","Content":"DeltaV wise, it would be more efficient for multiple trips because you wouldn\u0027t need docking ports, etc. Then again, you would need batteries and utilities on every ship, and life support if you did that.

The Duna lander used a 3 man pod, while the Ike lander had a 1 man pod. After the mission, the landers got back to the mothership in low Duna orbit and returned home.

Getting to and from Duna is just a pinch more dV than going to and from Minmus, so the only difference being you need a bigger lander due to more gravity at Duna. IOW, doing a flag-plant on Duna is hardly any different from putting one on Minmus so you don\u0027t need anything really huge (unless you worry about life support, crew elbow room during the trip, etc.) For anything more involved, however, IMHO it\u0027s always better to send a flotilla of small-medium ships than 1 huge monster.\n\nI wrote a tutorial on doing flotillas if you need some pointers. See the link in my sig."},{"CreatedByName":"ajburges","CreatedById":26570,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-12T21:03:34Z","Content":"It\u0027s a tradeoff.\n\nFlotillas allow for less complicated ships. Each one will be smaller, easier to controll, and less susceptible to wobbles. If they can dock, you also have more abort modes if you run low on fuel for crew and sample return.\n\nOn the downside you need to duplicate more parts and efficiency tends to be higher as you go bigger due to the mass tradeoff of nukes calling on 10t\u002B payloads for real dV/mass gain. You also need to manage multiple launches per window which can be an issue.\n\nIf your craft run missions that require separate orbits, you should definitely have them arrive separately for dV savings. Separating at course correction may not give you the needed difference in arrival time for efficient capture burns, so separate launches may make sense.\n\nAlso if you plan too leave a station/base behind, don\u0027t complicate its design by integrating it with the return craft.\n\nEdit: ninja\u0027d by Geschosskopf I second the advice to read his flotilla tutorial. It\u0027s the perfect read for your question.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-12T21:06:45Z\u0022 title=\u002206/12/2015 09:06  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by ajburges**"},{"CreatedByName":"Seeker89","CreatedById":78437,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-13T13:36:47Z","Content":"It would pretty much be an all in one, Mining base, lander, some scan sats and a way to get some home.
