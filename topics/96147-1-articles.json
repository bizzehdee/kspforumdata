It\u0027s because the SAS is stupid and doesn\u0027t start countering the movement until it\u0027s way too late. In fact, it keeps tugging and tugging until it\u0027s too late and then it starts tugging the other way. I could do a better job myself but boy is it boring. I\u0027d rather play a truck driving simulation. It\u0027s fine if all your ship is small but mine isn\u0027t.

Ships with less control authority often oscillate, it the player uses SAS in a naive way, because SAS starts slowing down too late and overshoots. The easiest fix is to turn manually and to use SAS only intermittently (F instead of T), until the ship has stabilized. (Similar problems may occur if the ship has too much control authority. In those situations, the solution is to build a better ship.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports are already rigid enough, considering that they\u0027re supposed to be temporary connections made using flat parts.

I\u0027ve heard a rumor that this is going to be implemented soon. That will hopefully help the ultra lightweight segment a lot.
