First I supposed it is a bug introduced with 1.0.5 which I started evaluating yesterday, but then I understood that the effect was there already before and it physically makes sense. However I wonder how tiny amounts of mass lead to this effect - precisely, there seems to the a limit of 0.190 mass units on Mun - which is only a bit more than the kerbal with its suit alone (0.094).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt would be a deal if the extra EVA-fuel tank would also provide some extra thrust to overcome this limitation.

It took three tries to get her down safely: first try, misjudged vertical acceleration and plowed into the ground. Second try, ran out of fuel and plowed into the ground (saw it coming, tried to rotate so she was head down, but just that was enough to exhaust the fuel and she just continued spinning... splat). Third try worked well: she grabbed the ladder on the base with just a puff remaining in her tanks :) (yes, precision EVA landing). Also, carrying the screwdriver and 2 connector end-points just 6km on Minmus proved to be rather iffy for her tanks, but it was all very fun.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Maestro22","CreatedById":147697,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T12:38:28Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027taniwha\u0027]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[*]You can use the winches in KAS to lift (or even drag) heavy stuff). \u003Cbr\u003E\n[/LIST]\u003Cbr\u003E\n[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYes, this is probably the main point which I missed until now.
