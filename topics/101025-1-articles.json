And I hope you have Tweakscale and already use the largest size IR parts available for you.\n\nHonestly though, I wouldn\u0027t suggest you making those massive things movable using the IR parts. They aren\u0027t designed handle something that big. They would need a custom-made part for them."},{"CreatedByName":"The DigitalAlchemist","CreatedById":133218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-08T20:01:49Z","Content":"Active struts doesnt appear to do what I\u0027ll need them to do.
