Mostly because in a lot of ways I think that while sure, they might have developed their society into one in which enacting violence is just not something that would occur to them, they clearly have engineering (they did just come here in an FTL ship to grab us to fight for them). Rather quickly they\u0027d figure out that whatever is going on, it\u0027s not an accident and so they can SEE violence in front of them. People willfully attacking other people. Sure, they have no experiencing doing this well, but in many ways combat tactics, ESPECIALLY spaceship tactics are just an engineering problem. Making weapons is obvious, they can control titanic energy forces already, so figuring out how to...lose control...of those forces in directed ways shouldn\u0027t be that hard for them to figure out. After that its a matter of running simulations on what might work, trying them for real, etc. Learning how to be good at violence/war at violence isn\u0027t particularly hard. With the exclusion of learning things like military discipline and developing such a culture in their forces, I\u0027d honestly posit that them starting to figure out war from a standing start probably ends up taking only a bit longer than us figuring starting with new tactics and such given suddenly having magic-grade hyper tech to work with as weapons (at least, as compared with our current things).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have mastered asymmetric warfare too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Stargate525","CreatedById":53585,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T01:16:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kaboom!\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kaboom!\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENow, we are by nature extremely war-mongering (I\u0027m looking at you USA), and hate even the slightest difference in cultures and peoples.
