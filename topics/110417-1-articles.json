I suspect IntakeAir is hardcoded to do this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe stock \u0022IntakeAir\u0022 might be OK to use, though I haven\u0027t tested to see if it\u0027s only viable in oxygen atmospheres (Laythe and Kerbin). I could swear there used to be a setting in the stock jet engines to tell them to require oxygen atmospheres specifically, but I don\u0027t see it now. So they may have IntakeAir hardcoded for that now. It may require some experimenting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could create a resource for nuclear power that the reactor puts out, and have the engine use that as a non-ISP propellant (massless resource, like ElectricCharge), and rely on the intake air for the reaction mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what the stock basic-jet has for propellant settings:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cpre class=\u0022ipsCode\u0022\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tPROPELLANT\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tname = LiquidFuel\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tresourceFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tratio = 1\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tDrawGauge = True\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\t\tPROPELLANT\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t{\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tname = IntakeAir\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tignoreForIsp = True\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t\tratio = 23\u003Cbr\u003E\t\t}\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/pre\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an experiment, it might be worth removing the \u0022ignoreForIsp\u0022 setting from the IntakeAir, and replace the LiquidFuel requirement with ElectricCharge (adding the \u0022ignoreForISP=True\u0022 value to this one), and see if it\u0027ll provide thrust in places like Duna and Eve.
