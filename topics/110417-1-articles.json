I suspect IntakeAir is hardcoded to do this. \n\nThe stock \u0022IntakeAir\u0022 might be OK to use, though I haven\u0027t tested to see if it\u0027s only viable in oxygen atmospheres (Laythe and Kerbin). I could swear there used to be a setting in the stock jet engines to tell them to require oxygen atmospheres specifically, but I don\u0027t see it now. So they may have IntakeAir hardcoded for that now. It may require some experimenting. \n\nYou could create a resource for nuclear power that the reactor puts out, and have the engine use that as a non-ISP propellant (massless resource, like ElectricCharge), and rely on the intake air for the reaction mass. \n\nHere\u0027s what the stock basic-jet has for propellant settings:\n\n    \t\tPROPELLANT\t\t{\t\t\tname = LiquidFuel\t\t\tresourceFlowMode = STAGE_PRIORITY_FLOW\t\t\tratio = 1\t\t\tDrawGauge = True\t\t}\t\tPROPELLANT\t\t{\t\t\tname = IntakeAir\t\t\tignoreForIsp = True\t\t\tratio = 23\t\t}\n\nAs an experiment, it might be worth removing the \u0022ignoreForIsp\u0022 setting from the IntakeAir, and replace the LiquidFuel requirement with ElectricCharge (adding the \u0022ignoreForISP=True\u0022 value to this one), and see if it\u0027ll provide thrust in places like Duna and Eve. If that works, then I\u0027d switch the energy source again, but to a custom \u0022NuclearPower\u0022 resource modeled from ElectricCharge, with something like this:\n\n    RESOURCE_DEFINITION{  name = NuclearPower  density = 0  unitCost = 0  hsp = 0  flowMode = ALL_VESSEL  transfer = PUMP  isTweakable = false}"},{"CreatedByName":"Starbuckminsterfullerton","CreatedById":117494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-06T22:52:46Z","Content":"You may be right Bones, but I remember there being a \u0022checkOxygen = true\u0022 or something like that in the definition that I can\u0027t find now, but there is a way to do this, I remember because I made a resource just like that, just give me time to find it. \n\nEdit: Found it! This is definitely possible!\n\nSo here\u0027s the deal, the resource definition just sets the physical parameters for a nameable fluid resource, like density and pumpability. The actual use/behavior of the resource comes from somewhere else. In this case, it\u0027s the intake itself that makes intake air behave like intake air. \n\n[Here is a thread that explains air intake function.](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/24988-New-issue-Custom-Air-intake-does-not-function-properly)\n\nSo in your case you want to do two things: define a new resource, and create a new intake. \n\nMake the resource the same as IntakeAir, just with a different name.\n\nPick one of the stock intakes, find the resourceintake module, and replace IntakeAir with yourResourceName, and then set checkForOxygen to false\n\nrename the resource storage module below it too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-06T23:14:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/06/2015 11:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 6, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Starbuckminsterfullerton**"}]}
