The game does not give me any info on why it is crashing. I have tried to use it on .25 and .24.2. No errors pop up, I have tried with the Auto installer and have tried it manually.

With 0.25 came a stock animation module for parts that firespitter previous provided. So if you really, really, really want to use the HF version of v409 with the previous versions of KSP then you\u0027ll have to change the stock animation module in the part CFG files back to the firespitter module. So in short: use the latest versions. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027m guessing your problem is memory related when it fails to start.
