My previous account had not survived the unexpected forum collision, but ironically, I hadn\u0027t posted anything in the time I had it anyways. Heh...heh heh... Ahem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, I do hope to keep some pace in the forum\u0027s traffic, I\u0027ve certainly seen a lot of traffic since I originally bought the game sometime before Christmas, and plenty of wonderful vessels to be jealous about, and many tutorials to bring me to more spectacular failures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m on the 94th stamp on my Success or bust card. So here\u0027s hoping it pays off huh? Since I bought the game I\u0027ve nosed my way about the forums to Scott Manley\u0027s resources, and my best event was landing a pair of small landers within flopping and walking distance of eachother. As well as taking a rather fruitful liking to spaceplanes over rockets. Doesn\u0027t make me any better at balancing and getting them anywhere, but I\u0027ve kept a steady diet of on board sausages and marshmallows thanks to the more recent addition of atmospheric affects.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven made a flying campsite... thing... once with the new command seats. If it wasn\u0027t for the control panels and winglets bapping bill in the face it\u0027d have been a pretty convincing piece for my wall of flames.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAh, but enough of my showing off at how to do the same stuff every not so newbie has done. Here\u0027s hoping I fit into this collection of interplanetary lunatics that make up KSP\u0027s community. ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xiphos","CreatedById":60680,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-09T13:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!

Now though, I\u0027m seeking some vanilla experience and ideas. With sprinkles like sub assembly, engineer, and DEADBEEF\u0027s building assistance mods specifically for knowledge and convenience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy best work was building a half successful lander, settler can combo, dropping in skycrane style with a single Kerbal can on the Mun. I forgot the name of that object, basically the only not \u0022cabin\u0022 crew module.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly, poor design literally killed half the lander on a little hiccup to disconnect from the habitat, and since that mission has been lost to my update timed save sweep. Due to all the mods and no progress I have yet to truly preserve any built .craft or save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027ve been trying to peace together some specific objective to keep myself sane, be it exploring Kerbin\u0027s wonders via space plane, or making a ghetto community of stranded Kerbals on the mun, or maybe shoot for Minmus. At least their KerbalCola will stay nice and chilled there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny ideas or input would be appreciated. ^^\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T04:08:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are a few mods that give you a \u0022sequence of missions\u0022, not unlike what we expect Career mode will someday be.
