So at the first corner you\u0027d go 75% power, then 50%, then 25%, then your turning in for final and you\u0027ll want to continue to drop the power as you prepare to actually land. You want to drop a portion of your altitude at each corner too, but that really depends on how high you were flying to start with.

Then most planes have flaps which help you takeoff/land. These are generally at the root of the wing, add these to your plane and deploy them down when landing, it will slow you and produce a small amount of extra lift.
