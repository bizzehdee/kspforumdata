Use Multiplayer only for short periods of time during flights.

This would allow you to do EVAs in Multiplayer mode while the game itself is not real Multiplayer... maybe just \u0022Multiviewer\u0022. ... or, maybe you can move the \u0022Master\u0022 role from one player to another.

You just claim they aren\u2019t multiplayer. The thing is that everyone has different ideas of what they would like, and most people recognize that while they might not like another system, it is still multiplayer. Being constantly de-synced from other players appeals to me about as little as constantly hopping between interactive and non-interactive modes, but I can recognize that they are still multiplayer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere\u2019s a few of the ways that KSP can be multiplayer. Don\u2019t mind that they are bad, because bad systems can in fact exist (and I don\u2019t want a repeat of the mod discussion), just look at all of the options:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Playing through the game individually and seeing things other players have built. This one is pretty common, as it is a part of the gameplay of the subspace bubble model, the MMO model, and a few others. This is akin to MMO style gameplay where, outside of parties, you get the multiplayer experience mostly through seeing how big the player base is.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Building trade networks and infrastructure together. This is also a part of many proposed systems (including turn-based btw), and is closer to the kind of multiplayer I personally want in KSP.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Doing \u201Cshort\u201D activities together. These can be hours long, but on a star system\u2019s time scale, are short. The turn-based system prioritizes this type of interaction, although lots of other systems allow and facilitate it to varying extents. This is also something I want, and why the solution I have never requires massive synchronizations.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Interacting on the same ship or colony together. I\u2019ll add here since you say this isn\u2019t the \u201CKSP gameplay loop\u201D that people are still playing through the game fully, they are just doing it together. Just because someone is in the driver\u2019s seat in an FPS doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t participating in the gameplay. There are plenty of games where multiplayer divides the responsibilities a single player would have between multiple people, and I personally think it could work well. It can also be integrated into other systems, although none have explicitly mentioned it.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n- Playing the game in turns and either watching other players or doing something between turns. I\u2019ll start by saying I don\u2019t like this idea. But for many people, that is what they are looking for, and I think I could see a way it could work. Between turns you can manage your colonies, build your ships, and check up on everything across the game, and when your transfer window is up, you can focus on flying because you have done the rest in the between time. The turn based system heavily prioritizes this, but other systems technically allow for it, except for mine, in which time is meaningless.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are definitely more ways to play multiplayer, and there are certainly good and bad ones, from a gameplay perspective. But that good and bad are mostly subjective, and saying that the ones you think are bad aren\u2019t multiplayer is just a way out of considering them as possibilities.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laxez","CreatedById":216956,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-14T12:44:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother alternative could be to make a time warp only on the path and not on the position of the planets, a sort of \u0022speed warp\u0022, but the planets remain in the same place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo anyone can travel fast without worrying about what would happen if I revert to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E after an hour of play.\u00A0Imagine if the other players had to go back an hour just because someone missed a Tylo landing or something else.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-14T12:55:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224185759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221665751159\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 minute ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI really dislike\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehow\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Eyou are disagreeing with the ideas that don\u2019t fit into your view of KSP multiplayer.

Singleplayer. This is self-explanatory. The game functions as KSP 1 normally does, plus all the amazing new features of KSP 2. Time warping works as normal, there is only one space program. Although it might not be easy to do, making the singleplayer mode able to transition to multiplayer, similar to the \u0022open to LAN\u0022 option in Minecraft, would be a great quality of life feature, so you could show your friends all the cool bases and ships you built in your singleplayer world. Along with this, you should be able to upload your game to the steam workshop or some built-in game sharing place.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Co-Op. Now here\u0027s where things get interesting.\u00A0 In Co-Op mode, you and some number of other players would be in charge of a space program. You would all have the same kind of control (colony management, controlling \u0026amp; building ships, doing stuff around the space center, etc.). However, to prevent griefing (I too wish it did not exist, but here we are), if you launch a ship, YOU OWN IT. That means that other players cannot dock with or board your ship without your permission. I\u0027m thinking a chat system where there is a \u0022board/dock\u0022 request when you want to do something with someone else\u0027s ship. This could also make for a cool interstellar-like sequence if there is some way to board a ship without permission. I have no idea how time warp will be solved, but you guys seem to have a pretty good idea of how it will be done so please elaborate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. Space Race. In this mode, each player (or group of players) plays as a different space program. There might also be a menu in the beginning where you choose your space program (either mirrors of real world programs or completely made up \u0022Kerbal lore\u0022) that has different strengths and weaknesses, such as starting funds, research speeds, and global views and press coverage of your home Kountry. There could either be a set goal such as \u0022make it to the M\u00FCn and back\u0022 or a game with a points system based on different achievements. As for the question of weapons, I think it\u0027s a bad idea to have usable weapons in the game, because it would force the ksp team to increase the age rating of the game. However, i can see there being some kind of \u0022scary boom stockpile\u0022 that you will never use but can be built up to force the other team to slow down research and funding due to fear.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThese are just some of my ideas, could everyone tell me what you think might be a better method?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"JoeSchmuckatelli","CreatedById":154477,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-14T14:48:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224185730\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221665744382\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022219348\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vl3d\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, Vl3d said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\na persistent world \u003Cu\u003Eteam-based and competitive big multiplayer\u003C/u\u003E game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EThat was \u003Cem\u003Enever \u003C/em\u003Epromised.\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cb\u003E...\u00A0 \u00A0...\u00A0 \u00A0...\u003C/b\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow - I will admit something.\u00A0 The Nate himself, a few weeks back, admitted that he and the team were \u0022racing rovers.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhile they could have been doing time trials... the idea of \u0027racing\u0027 usually involves two or more competitors and a track.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo - for me - this is the biggest evidence that MP is still a thing in KSP2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat kind of thing?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[shrug emoji]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"determinationmaster","CreatedById":209947,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-14T14:54:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224185813\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221665758895\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022154477\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JoeSchmuckatelli\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n4 minutes ago, JoeSchmuckatelli said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[shrug emoji]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00AF\\_(\u30C4)_/\u00AF\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pthigrivi","CreatedById":105624,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-14T14:54:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224185759\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221665751159\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022213541\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022t_v\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, t_v said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeing constantly de-synced from other players appeals to me about as little as constantly hopping between interactive and non-interactive modes, but I can recognize that they are still multiplayer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne note about this because I see folks express this perception a lot: separation in time and separation in space are the same thing.

I don\u0027t mean that in the Einstein, special relativity way, I mean this in a very practical sense. If Im working on a station in low Kerbin orbit and at the same time you\u0027re flying a lander on Minmus, those vessels are in every practical sense 8 days apart because thats how long it would take for one to travel to the other. Now, I may happen to have a base on Minmus where I could launch a vessel and go land where you landed on Minmus, but we\u0027re still separated not just by space, but also by time. In this way there isn\u0027t really much practical difference between being de-synched on the calendar and just working on different projects on different worlds. There\u0027s also no real reason I have to be focused on a station I own to watch you dock to it. If you\u0027re trying to dock a supply ship to a larger freighter a friend owns to trade resources you don\u0027t even \u003Cem\u003Ewant\u003C/em\u003E that player to be actively flying or changing course because its going to make the rendezvous a huge hassle. In fact there\u0027s really only a very small set of activities in which you would want to be synched at all--rover races and dogfighting. Now, rover races could be fun, I have no real interest in dogfighting but if folks want to thats fine. My guess is that neither is going to make up the vast majority of time, so synching is actually kind of a niche activity rather than something you need or even want to enforce across gameplay. All the rest of the time it doesn\u0027t really matter \u0022when\u0022 players are any more than it matters \u0022where\u0022 they are. And allowing that doesn\u0027t prevent synching for a\u00A0 Munar Rally race if you want to. We\u0027re not looking for a paradigm that\u0027s tailored to any one specific type of play, but one that allows for the greatest possible modes\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDefinitely agree on the point that\u2019s good systems allow for many types of interaction, which is why I semi consistently talked about which modes allowed or catered to which types of interaction, I just forgot to tie it into a cohesive conclusion. We can agree to disagree on the \u201Cniche\u201D quality of syncing, I\u2019m sure that you recognize as much as I do how many people (including me) have said that the main activity that they will do in multiplayer requires synchronizing. The point is that synchronization needs to not be annoying to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe second thing is that while temporal separation is similar to spatial separation, why have two forms of separation instead of one? Going back to the minmus base example, if the players were only separated by space, they would see each other doing their activities even if they couldn\u2019t reach each other, whereas if they were also separated by time, one player might not even see that the other is active in the area. Given that several systems only have multiplayer as visual interaction, and that even the subspace bubble solution goes to some lengths to give the appearance of other players doing things, even if it is just a recording, you probably also know that seeing other players doing their things is an important part of the experience. So, why would you choose to watch a recording that you can\u2019t interact with, when you could watch real-time actions that you can\u2019t interact with? Also remember that once you close the spatial gap, you then have to take the extra step of closing the time gap, which I would prefer not doing if it means all my craft in transit overshoot their destinations. I personally would be stuck always looking at recordings of players, even when we are driving around on the same square kilometer.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"shdwlrd","CreatedById":113880,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-10-14T17:00:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00224185817\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022187358\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221665759299\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022105624\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Pthigrivi\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, Pthigrivi said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo people want to be able to work together on a shared tech tree?
