I like the whole \u0022kid in the candy-store\u0022 approach, so I have n\u002B1 mods installed. Where n is about twice the number of mods a reasonable person would have. My \u0022GameData\u0022 folder, not counting the \u0022Squad\u0022 subfolder, is about 4 Gigabytes. Yes. Don\u0027t do that. Consequently, my parts list stretches pretty much all the way to Minmus and back.\u003Cbr\u003E\nTo find something specific, the search-box presents itself. I even use it with QuickSearch. However.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe very first letter I enter, KSP would try to instantly show me all the parts where that letter occurs. While it\u0027s doing that, I couldn\u0027t enter the next letter of my search term. Searching could take a minute. \u003Cem\u003ELiterally \u003C/em\u003Ea minute, and actually a minute, too. As it dug its way through my parts list, letter by letter, each time, KSP would be unresponsive until the results were ready to show. I dreaded using the search, just scrolling through some category was often quicker. Not always a working substitute for searching, though. Trying to start the search term with an unlikely letter-combination, yz or something, only lets me enter my search-term in full and in peace once it\u0027s done looking for the first letter.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EThis problem no-longer irks me. \u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/u\u003EI\u0027m sure I\u0027ve just missed some setting for not having the search run off with the first letter. If somebody could tell me where that is in the settings, please do tell me, I couldn\u0027t find it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut as I said, it\u0027s no longer so bad. The search still runs off with the first letter. But it\u0027s not getting stuck anymore. I can enter a whole search term, the search is quick and responsive and lovely. It went a little slow again, so I repeated what I suspected had been the fix and, yap, it worked.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cu\u003EJust start KSP clean\u003C/u\u003E, same install, but without mods. Then shut it down, and start once more with the mods.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nStep by step, for anyone unsure what I mean:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nPut the mods where the game won\u0027t see them.

Don\u0027t go make coffee or whatever you usually do when your heavily modded KSP install fires up. This time, it will be lightning fast.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWhen the main-menu has come up, just click \u0022Quit\u0022.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nGet rid of the new \u0022GameData\u0022 folder you created earlier. Rename or Delete. Just make sure that the \u0022Squad\u0022 subfolder is also still with the fruit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nRename the fruit back to \u0022GameData\u0022, so that it looks like before.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cem\u003ENow\u003C/em\u003E you go make some coffee, or do the laundry, while KSP starts up.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nenjoy fast and responsive search of the parts-list!\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do think I need at least one \u0022answer\u0022 to mark this as answered, no?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-12-22T15:16:15Z\u0022 title=\u002212/22/2016 03:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 22, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by DerGolgo\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emore typo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-22T17:30:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167906-dergolgo/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022167906\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/167906-dergolgo/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@DerGolgo\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHi there, you are nuts but cool!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:D\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"linuxgurugamer","CreatedById":129964,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T11:29:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHmmm. \u00A0I wonder if there is a cache file that needs to be cleaned occasionally\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DerGolgo","CreatedById":167906,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-01-05T21:24:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt is how I would interpret it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nSince I\u0027ve found this, once or twice a week, the search will still maybe \u0022stumble\u0022 a wee bit.
