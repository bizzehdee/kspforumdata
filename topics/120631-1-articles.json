This is testing the base aerodynamics for a front end of a multipart vehicle to carry up stations and transport asteroids and explore. I plane on potentially putting the fully assembled station(or valid parts) between the front and back end and flying it up directly as part of the craft. Assuming it works of course. I haven\u0027t tested it yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt currently can fly straight up and get an apoapsis of 100km before circularizing. Obviously I have yet to feed it fuel for that. I could add some oxydizer(which would be great in individual packets) or add nukes. I also want to eventually add ion and a science lab plus drill, ore tank, ore processing lab, and science equipment and scanners. Plus load the little cargo bay with exploration satelights and other items. This was originally meant to be a space only plane that needs it\u0027s rear counterpart to get into orbit with some aerodynamics in case I scimmed on an atmosphere for changing speeds etc. But I\u0027ve been testing it with these engines so I think I\u0027ll also keep the self orbiting capabilities if possible.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW, if it\u0027s not obvious, I use the Aerobreaks like feathers. It seems to work. I wonder how much if reflects a real bird in flight.

I will have to put them back on so it rotates better in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./download/6stc6my4u67xft9/AEIOU_NiRDm_Lifter_Alpha_Test.craft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./download/6stc6my4u67xft9/AEIOU_NiRDm_Lifter_Alpha_Test.craft\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-09-11%2000-19-04_zpso4k4j0kn.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-09-11%2000-19-04_zpso4k4j0kn.png%7Eoriginal\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1262.photobucket.com/albums/ii613/PicsMe101/KSP/Screenshot%20from%202015-09-11%2000-37-01_zpsszadxe68.png~original\u0022 alt=\u0022Screenshot%20from%202015-09-11%2000-37-01_zpsszadxe68.png%7Eoriginal\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-11T05:29:35Z\u0022 title=\u002209/11/2015 05:29  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Arugela\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"YargJay9991","CreatedById":143494,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T06:52:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat a lot of airbrakes...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks good, so good luck.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd may the Kraken have mercy on you! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHappy Flying\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYargJay9991\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
