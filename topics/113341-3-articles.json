I know that people would like to have levels affect the ability to withstand g but I didn\u0027t implemented it for now because it\u0027s not quite realstic: in reality an astronaut trains for years but in the game a Pilot gains a level just after one flight. Also one tends to lose his fitness condition while in space, not to gain. That\u0027s why the level system doesn\u0027t work well for it. But there\u0027s a mod named Keepfit that\u0027s scope is g training and I\u0027m taking attempts to communicate with it.

That\u0027s true for G-Effects also. Though, I try to play KSP in realistic and not a racing or heavy aerobatics manner so I haven\u0027t expected the mod to affect my gameplay much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn that sunny day (are there different ones on Kerbin?) I had a contract by which some agency wanted me to take a crew report from a point within 100 km of KSC and above 16000 meters. Since it was so close it wouldn\u0027t be wise to use rockets as an airplane should do well, and I already had a proven simple design for that. The only difficulty was that with FAR and AJE installed it could climb at a maximum of 11000-12000 meters high. So the plan was to get around the needed area under the target and engage a rocket engine specially installed on the aircraft for that mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter modifications were made I\u0027ve checked FAR\u0027s stability derivatives and took off to do some inflight testing. As the flight was going fine I found myself too lazy to go on with tests and decided to head straight to the mission area. When I climbed to 11000 and got close to the target having it at about 45 degrees high I fired the rocket engine and what the hell? Since it had been installed higher than CoM it started to push my plane\u0027s nose down. So I had to roll 180 degrees to have it pushing me up instead. After struggling hard through the instability due to a major loss of lift caused by a roll at the critical altitude I managed to pull it up. Had to act fast though before that rocket guy ate all of its fuel. Finally I had the target right in front of me and I was climbing towards it by a long arc path being flipped upside down. And then came something that was not planned at all - a redout. My sight was nearly totally red, just a little blue spot left of a sky. Now I was trying hard not to lose consciousness because I had to complete the mission and level my aircraft up after that climb for not to overstress it on the imminent rapid descend. Thanks to Analog Control mod, I could have a smooth control over that, holding the g load high enough to reach the target and low enough for not to go unconscious. But there was a moment when I nearly thought that I won\u0027t make it, but I did, thanks to Jeb\u0027s pilot training. After taking a crew report it took some effort to level up and get back to KSC safely. A good funds gain with a minimum spend but plenty of valium.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s how G-Effects mod took it\u0027s part in my gameplay unexpectedly even for myself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-04T12:28:51Z\u0022 title=\u002208/04/2015 12:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Ser\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nansuchao","CreatedById":135151,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T13:25:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes , the same for me Ser and that\u0027s a reason why I love your mod.
