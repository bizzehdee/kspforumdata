I don\u0027t remember anything about it, except that it was some sort of puzzle\u00A0(basically saw, but more videogame like). we completed the game, but as we\u00A0were released, I heard a sound emanate from a door nearby. me opened it, and it was a ZOMBIE! suddenly our surroundings turned into a maze of dark rooms filled with common household furniture in an american configuration. we somehow all made it out alive, only to discover a post apocalyptic world filled with zoombies!\u00A0We found the bad guy\u00A0all hobo with his winter clothing and and container of fire, despite the fact that it was spring. we talked to him for a while, then left. then the original zombie (let\u0027s call him OZ, despite the fact that he will only be seen this once) killed us. We were revived as zombies, and OZ was like \u0022WAZZSAAAP!\u0022, and we were like \u0022WASSZAAPP!\u0022, and we went our separate ways. after walking down a \u003Cstrong\u003Ecar\u003C/strong\u003Eless highway, we stopped with it, for that it was cut of by a cliff into the ocean, as if whatever it lead to sunk into the massive body of water. along the basin of the highway and in a bus were dried up, crusty zombies that looked like they were made of concrete. however, as we were about to leave, they started talking, begging us to give them our fluids and liquids. they climbed all over us, and did god knows what in order to get our fluids. We then were\u00A0revived as humans, apparently, and the crusty zoombies\u00A0said that were all moisturized now (despite the fact that their appearance didn\u0027t change a bit. the third person view even emphasized this by zooming in on the zombies as if it came straight out of a youtube video.), and left us alone. how our little zombie bodies could moisturize all of the probably thousands of zoombies nobody knows. We eventually found an intact, airtight building. it was a small building, with only one room\u00A0And\u00A0AIR CONDITIONING!, and\u00A0we did do the rest. During the night, some guy with a car pulled up near us. for some reason my parents told us children to shut it, so we did. we found out why, when my brother started talking LOUDLY, and the guy crashed into our shelter, killing us. We then woke up in heaven, which according to my subconscious, deforms your body into rubbery, yellow and generally unrecognizable forms, is VERY yellow, and is filled with bubbly children\u0027s songs. we didn\u0027t care tho, as my dog makes a joke I don\u0027t remember, we all laughed as the \u0027camera\u0027, aka the viewers view, pans up, and I wake up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI swear I don\u0027t do drugs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-03-22T13:16:24Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2020 01:16  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00224 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by Dirkidirk\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-12T03:42:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dreamt that in the finale of Star Wars 9, Rick and Morty travelled back in time and helped Rey and the iCarly crew save the galaxy from a\u00A0Death Star equipped with\u00A0a bunch of Thrawn\u0027s\u00A0gravity well things\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA vision from a timeline that is somehow worse than this one, perhaps?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"UnRealm","CreatedById":154284,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-12T09:58:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI dream about true love, to build cool family and travel a lot\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cubinator","CreatedById":150330,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-03-16T13:59:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother movie dream, sort of...Thomas the Train but it was \u003Ci\u003Ereally\u00A0\u003C/i\u003Edark. A group of kids were trapped in an underground complex beneath a train station, kept there by a calculated and sinister overseer. They were provided for, but they were essentially slaves on a tight leash. They made a grand attempt to escape, but failed and faced even worse scrutiny. Eventually they manage to communicate with Thomas, who was visiting the station, and tell him their dilemma. Thomas remarks that although it is near impossible for humans to leave the station, for trains it is very easy. The kids make their way to the train station secretly and board Thomas, who takes them away into the free world.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have seen almost nothing of the actual Thomas the Tank Engine media, so consider this my interpretation of that world, where children are indoctrinated in subterranean camps and Thomas runs a sort of \u0027underground railroad\u0027 on an actual\u00A0railroad.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n===============\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI also dreamt about The Dark Crystal, where I gave Rian a magic marble from Earth and got a seed from the Mystics which contained two gold USB sticks containing information about how to defeat the Skeksis.
