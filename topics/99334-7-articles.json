Was just providing a syntax example of how you can edit the curves, not suggesting you should use those particular numbers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERealism doesn\u0027t always equate to harder, and I tend to be more inclined towards progression and challenge than realism.

For example, with the above is it more realistic for engines to behave as they would at the specific atmospheric pressure of Eve, or is it more realistic for them to behave as one would expect in the analogue to Eve (Venus), in the consensus reality? Is it more realistic to have a delta V display because earth scientists would have one, or less realistic because we have to deal with far fewer problems than earth scientists would in other regards, so the increase in difficulty of not having one makes the overall experience more realistic by bringing it closer to the difficulty level of the real thing?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me anyways, it\u0027s not always clear what makes things more or less realistic as a result, especially when you\u0027re dealing with something in relation to a whole other whack of abstractions already within the game, so I just go for whatever makes things more interesting and fun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-12T21:36:00Z\u0022 title=\u002202/12/2015 09:36  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FlowerChild\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-12T21:35:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding Eve, don\u0027t assume the surface pressure will stay the same!

This should have been fixed in the latest version (1.0.15.0) but it appears that it may not have been so there will probably be another release very soon.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may have been fixed. I haven\u0027t tried using it since I installed 1.0.15.0.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: I just went back over the change notes, since it notified me that there was new version out when I launched the game (1.0.15.2) and I went to download it. They did supposedly fix it in 1.0.15.0. 1.0.15.2 apparently fixes a mistake in some of the resource mass calculations that was introduced in 1.0.15.0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Renegrade\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Renegrade\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust adding my voice here to the \u0022I use docking mode\u0022 chorus.
