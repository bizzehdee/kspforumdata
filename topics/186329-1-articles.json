When my Eve-ascent quadcopter gets above ca. 5500m on Kerbin or 17000m on Eve then it dramatically loses vertical speed and then starts dropping. My old version from before 1.7.3 that used elevons as the lifting surfaces showed a more gradual behavior: it didn\u0027t ascent as fast in the lower atmosphere and lost vertical speed much more slowly when it got higher. So that it could de-facto hover at its service ceiling. With the new helicopter blades my craft ascends much faster, but then rather abruptly goes from ascending at 20 m/s or so to falling within a couple of seconds.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso there is no autorotation, but rather the opposite effect: once it started dropping the rotors slow down quickly. To get them to rotate again I need a lot of torque, much more than to \u0022just\u0022 start ascending from a standing start. Which means that if I don\u0027t have rather overpowered motors (i.e. otherwise unnecessary weight) the craft is unrecoverable once it starts dropping.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else noticed this?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OHara","CreatedById":162784,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-14T08:28:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAuto-rotation seems to be working for me.\u00A0 It does require very slight negative pitch on the blades, and to use it for practical purposes you must not let the rotor slow down very much before you make that negative pitch.\u00A0 The blade is a windmill through the descent, then you go to positive pitch to convert the energy in the blades into a burst of downwash to slow the craft before touchdown.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP 1.7.3 cheats a bit with the forces on propeller/helicopter blades, including a strong reduction in the torque on the rotor due to drag of the blades.\u00A0 That cheat might be a bit much, I was hovering for several minutes\u00A0 with no power other than that being slowly bled from the\u00A0energy\u00A0\u00A0in the rotor\u002Bblades.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBlade-pitch is extremely important in the new KSP helicopters, because that pitch affects whether you have excess torque to increase rotor speed, and there is a lot of momentum in the typical\u00A0rotor\u002Bblades,\u00A0so its current speed limits what you can do for the next minute or so.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mystifeid","CreatedById":187479,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-07-14T09:37:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162784-ohara/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022162784\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/162784-ohara/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@OHara\u003C/a\u003E observed, blade pitch is important - are you adjusting the pitch as you ascend?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, might it not be better to try to get up as quickly as possible (big motors, max torque) and release while you still have a reasonable vertical speed?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis may not help you getting into orbit around Eve but...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI played with getting a single stage Terrier into orbit around Kerbin. The first attempts were hitting 9000m-10000m before stalling and then they didn\u0027t have enough fuel to reach orbit. I was launching with reduced torque, rpm and blade pitch (props not blades) because the craft became unstable if it accelerated/ascended too fast. Safety first, so 20m/s up was it with me trying to increase the aforementioned torque, rpm and pitch as I went up. It was tricky. I kept adding more fuel so as to make orbit with each attempt getting closer.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn the process I found that it was much easier and a heck of a lot faster to launch at maximum rpm and maximum torque, then just use blade pitch to smoothly accelerate to 140m/s up (much faster and bad things happened). I try to hold that speed for as long as possible by adjusting the prop pitch but because I am moving relatively fast, the cutoff point where the props start to become useless also comes much faster. This is the time to release and fire the rocket.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe first time I made orbit I released with 0m/s vertical speed - ie I maxed out the height first - and made it into orbit with about 50m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0 to spare.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow I am releasing with 100m/s vertical speed - although at a lower altitude - and am reaching orbit with more than 1000m/s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E left.

I\u0027m constantly monitoring blade pitch, engine RPM, and ascent speed.\u00A0 With the old (elevon-based) blades I needed to gradually lower the blade pitch the higher I got to get the best ascent speed.\u00A0 (Also because the torque wasn\u0027t enough to keep the engine at max RPM for most of the ascent.) With the new blades I can use a fairly high pitch and still get max RPM and a pretty high ascent rate, that increases with elevation -- until it starts decreasing and things go pear shaped. Lowering the pitch at that point (from ca. 16 deg to 5 deg or whatever) doesn\u0027t really help much if I don\u0027t have the spare engine power.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI guess my current strategy is at least related to your \u0022high speed\u0022 approach: I ascent at best speed (maxing out at around 20 m/s) until the ascent speed starts to drop, then I fire up the rockets and drop the rotors.
