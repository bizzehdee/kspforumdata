Ksp is a relatively fun game just for that fact that it takes up to much space on my harddisk . I know I am the only one experiencing this as I seen youtuber record 100 of episodes and they dun seem to be having any problems . Everytime I save my progress it takes away at least 1.2gb away . I bought the game via kerbal and it came in the winrar format . Do I need to extract it out or smething ? I hope a moderator or admin or any person who comes along this post .\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kasuha","CreatedById":81781,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T14:41:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have problems imagining how many ships you would need for your persistence to consume 1.2 GB. But it might help to go to Tracking Station and delete some debris or ships you don\u0027t need anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven if you don\u0027t delete anything, that saved state should not increase - the persistence file gets overwritten, previous persistence is replaced by a new one, previous quicksave is replaced by a new one. Only named quicksaves may be stacking up but then you can just open your KSP/saves/\u0026lt;your_save\u0026gt; directory and delete any quicksaves you no longer need. Or pack them using your winrar or 7zip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing taking space and acumulating might be screenshots. You may want to check size and contents of your KSP/screenshots directory and eventually remove any files you don\u0027t need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, try to open your KSP directory and check size of individual files and directories. If any of them is very large (particularly saves or screenshots) you may need to enter and clean them up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Taki117","CreatedById":89975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-06T14:42:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DoDylanong\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DoDylanong\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E Do I need to extract it out or something ?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh Jeez.

When you run the game from the rar file, winrar extracts everything into a temporary folder. If you\u0027re doing it multiple times, it could very well be making multiple directories.
