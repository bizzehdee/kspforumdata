Time to do some house keeping. I won\u0027t be presenting you with a list of my 67 mods and ask what I should remove, because that would be a pain for everyone involved unless it is easier to help me with that. So first, I want to ask about how mods use memory so I can trim them:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Col style=\u0022list-style-type:decimal;\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003EWhat are the most memory expensive parts of a mod? I know that textures for part mods is the number one cause, but what about cfg files? I have been trimming down mods by removing parts I barely uses, but that leaves quite a bunch of empty cfg files. I wonder if they use memory even when there are no parts for them.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHow do you determine how much memory a mod use?\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDoes plugins use enough memories to matter?
