Does it make a difference if the flights are in orbit or landed?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes it make a local difference if the flights are in another location (e.g. if LKO is full of junk, does it make any difference to a ship landed on Dres?)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes debris count for as much as controlled flights?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have about 100 flights-in-progress and little junk, and it seems not to be having too much of a performance hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t know how the on-rails simulations work, and clearly a modern computer \u003Cem\u003Ecan\u003C/em\u003E handle \u003Cem\u003Eloads\u003C/em\u003E of objects like this if it\u0027s optimised, I just don\u0027t know how well optimised KSP is at doing it if I continue to start flights... ...also kinda curious how many ongoing flights people have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Is there a selective automatic debris removal mod?
