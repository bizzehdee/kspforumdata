I have seen many eclipses and my ship still is showing a clear shadow. I think the only time a planet really blocks light is when you are on its surface and the Sun is on the other side of it. The camera on the dark side of the Mun also shows lens flare while the Kerbol sun is below the horizon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\\\u0027t know if that final level of detail would require more rendering power than is worth it. Not knowing fully how the rendering works, I do know that when I used to build Quake, Half-Life, and Jedi Knight levels years ago, you had to pre-render environments with the lighting in place, and the engine probably is saving tons of processing on the fly by eliminating all but direct shadows.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy .02\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-20T02:01:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDoing a standard raycast would, doubtless, require far more processing power than is useful, just to check for an eclipse. I think a fairly accurate mathematical algorithm could determine when Kerbol would be behind the Mun, and then just dim the light accordingly, perhaps also displaying a corona effect around the Mun. Of course, the algorithm need only be run when the Mun and Kerbol are close to overlapping each other in the sky, and only during the daytime...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tk5800thesecond","CreatedById":16577,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-20T11:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ebeautiful, its little things like this that keep me playing\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Picooz","CreatedById":22533,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-04-20T15:58:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeautiful!
