I want to put to you a proposal and see what you think. For this idea to work it will really need the support/approval of the mod developers, you guys are fundamental to making this work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe approach we want to try is a distributed, cloud based and out-sources all the nasty problems like backups, security, scaling, redundancy to a third party. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe third party is GitHub and it would provide a lot of gain and one significant catch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe catch is that mod developers would need to learn the source code management (SCM) system called \u0027git\u0027. If you don\u0027t know what git is I can explain further, but all you\u0027d need are the basics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea is that each mod developer will have a (FREE) github account and will host their own mods, each mod in a separate \u0022repository\u0022 (this is about as easy as sneezing). Every github repository(repo) gets its own wiki pages and bug/issue tracking system and each has a main page which shows a file browser for the repo and displays it\u0027s readme file (nicely formatted with markup). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe site which we would build would simply act to index these repositories and users requesting downloads would be redirected to the github download (transparently I hope). Our site would provide search, tags, comments all that kinda stuff and also enable users to submit bug reports directly to the mods issue tracking system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real gains however are in resilience, scaling and security. Github provide a corporation grade service and have automatic backups, redundancy etc to ensure their systems stay up and scale to huge numbers of users. This brings in a high level of resilience and takes all the responsibility for important aspects like security, bandwidth, growing storage requirements etc away from our site. It means that if our site goes down it will not effect mod developers in any way. It will not actually stop users from downloading/finding mods either as google will return the github pages. All the high load traffic goes onto GitHub rather than on our little site meaning it would be a very low maintenance/cost site to run (prob free).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are other gains to github; collaboration being a major one, but I could waffle on for pages, I\u0027ll spare you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are still some unknowns to work out but I think this idea is very possible. I\u0027ve tried to put this as briefly as possible without going into the details (I did, 2 pages in and I\u0027d bored myself). I can explain the idea more as needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main question which I\u0027d like to hear your feelings on is; how do you Mod Developers feel about being forced to use git as the way to publish your mods?

I used the term \u0022forced\u0022 to put it as strongly as possible that the \u0027ideal\u0027 way would be for everyone to be all using the same thing and that IMHO that common thing should be github. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI knew peps who\u0027d never heard of git would react with \u0022oh thats an odd name\u0022, everyone does the first time! I\u0027d also written like 2 pages to explain it and thought it would be way too much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt its core, this is not really about using git vs anything else, this is about using old fashioned \u0022server\u0022 thinking vs modern cloud computing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let me Rewind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing I\u0027m trying to tackle is the idea of centralising the mod repo all in one place. We all want one place to find/upload mods, but if that one place goes down then everything stops, developers can\u0027t upload, users can\u0027t download. It breaks both workflow and playtime - major fail!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPutting all the data in one place (ie this forum) is a \u0022single point of failure\u0022. It\u0027s also costly and implies a ton of admin work (but who cares/thinks about them right?). Almost however you do it, be that on this forum or on a dedicated web site you can\u0027t get away from putting all the data in one place, except with a cloud based service. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gain of github is it is a major distributed service. It sits on a massive layer of virtual machines spread across many servers, many countries. It has ridiculous levels of redundancy meaning that if any bit of it falls over its not a problem, the system just self corrects. It would take a major internet outage to stop it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe same is true for the Amazon Elastic Cloud (EC2) which could well be another option, but it will cost (although very little if we follow the distributed model).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHosting on github would mean that if this forum or any indexing site goes down nothing has to stop. Developers can still publish and users can still download.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve actually had this use case happen already. The forum was down(during the upgrade) but the mod I wanted was actually on github and I could still get the mod and carry on playing KSP regardless of forum issues. (can\u0027t remember the mod, but here\u0027s a space craft repo I found on github; \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/jasonpl/kerbal-spacecraft\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttps://github.com/jasonpl/kerbal-spacecraft\u003C/a\u003E - (with a nicer url than anything you get from this forum!))\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebtw dropbox is basically a simplified implementation of github. It has similar backend qualities (on a much smaller scale) and much much less front end power. githib is aimed at coding so comes with wiki pages and bug/issue tracking systems for each separate project. I know every dev has their own bug tracking system, I don\u0027t care if you use a pinata full of post-its, its about the community of users having a unified way of submitting bugs for all mods. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe could prob do this using dropbox but it would be very much more clunky. We\u0027ve already seen dropbox held mods hit bandwidth limitations. Github also has bandwidth limits but the expectation is that people will be downloading large projects from each other so they are higher. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy primary goal is to put the mod hosting into some form of cloud type architecture which brings a level of resilience and dependability that servers can only dream off. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis could be done using (in order of preference) GitHub, Amazon EC2 or dropbox. Either way puts the repo into a cloud type architecture and gets away from having a single-point-of-failure, brings resilience and takes the stain away from admins. However github is the clear leader as it would be COMPLETELY FREE and is designed around programming projects. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGit also is the leader in terms of production grade programming workflow. It makes deploying/publishing your code very easy. \u0027git push ksp master\u0027 done. It\u0027s authenticated using SSH keys so very secure. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo summarise;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think that the most effective, dependable way of providing mods to KSP users is to use a cloud type architecture. The best one available is githib but that implies learning/change for some. If git is just too much there are other options but they will be harder and less elegant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-edit/addendum-\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo answer the (so old man-y) \u0022nothing\u0027s free, everything costs\u0022 mindset;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGithub makes its money of the big guys, like Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook. They pay terrifying amounts to host private accounts. GitHub wants to promote open-source so it sucks on them and lets the open-source guys graze for free. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other big player in the \u0022give users free stuff\u0022 domain is Heroku - originally a Rails only host, it now hosts anything. You get one virtual machine for free (it\u0027s not even a VM its way cooler) and loads of free addons. That is MORE than enough to run a simple low to medium traffic site. You can pay to scale up or use additional addons but you only pay for what you use, metered to the second (like with EC2, which is what it sits on). Scaling is very granular, you only need to add what you specifically need, none of this \u0022package\u0022 nonsense. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEC2 is almost free. You pay for exactly what you use to the second, I get monthly bills of around $0.05 for hosting some backups, I laugh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-----\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to allow mod devs with the \u0022git or whatever its called\u0022 mindset (lol) to upload their zips (or whatever their called; archaic file structures) to the web site and have it create and manage repos automatically (cos the github API is just that easy). Why upload more than just the files that have changed is beyond me but ok.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-edit/addendum-\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-27T19:05:59Z\u0022 title=\u002208/27/2012 07:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 27, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by katateochi\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dani-Sang","CreatedById":4234,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-27T19:10:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve looked up github and read about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI honestly still don\u0027t see how this is beneficial to modders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot after your long post or going to github itself.
