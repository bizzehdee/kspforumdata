That is the single biggest flaw in KSP in my opinion ... that, with all of the effort one expends upon carefully planning orbits and engine burns, that arguably the most challenging and risky part of space flight (reentry) is not reflected at all in the game. Being able to plunge a spacecraft straight down into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere and not have it destroyed or even damaged by that sort of careless reentry breaks the game\u0027s immersion for me in a big way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) no mention of adding clouds to Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere, much less any other planets.

There have been several insightful discussions before about the challenges of doing so, and it seems that any change towards the better will have a rippling effect throughout the entire game. I\u0027m excited to see what changes they make across the board, but I\u0027m also worried that they may just tweak a few settings on the current aero to avoid those sweeping changes in the whole game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also a bit worried about the new refueling system. If they do something very simple, it may not be a very enjoyable mechanic.
