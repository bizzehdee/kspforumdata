If you stack only a few ARM tanks on top of 1 stage you can orbit and deorbited a crewed mk 1-2 pod. This is cartoon rocketry at it\u0027s best. Although then again many (Earth) first rocket stages do contain 4.5-4.7km/s of delta V. So although not that far fetched it destructs gameplay on tiny Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t understand why squad has it added to the game.

Just not the parts in the ARM package. But let\u0027s face it. Squad really isn\u0027t going to categorize asteroids and ARM part grouped on the internet. But IMHO it would be much better. I can Always download a user made docking system (claw/grabbing unit) to catch any asteroids. Assuming one will definetely program one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso the ARM package naturally forces KSP to load all those parts into computer RAM which KSP can run very low on running alongside with so many mods. Even although with just ARM such limit is not yet reached by a long shot. But if they keep continueing adding things every update just for a select public they must eventually leave such plugins to the modding community. Or either optimize their game first to her ultimate glory and then come with dozens of stock build in packages. Hopefully they do not continue this trend of future releases. Otherwise the devs are still awesome for creating one of the best games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh and btw you can just ignore the whole asteroid thing if you don\u0027t like it.
