I\u0027d underestimated the fuel requirements, and ended up entering the Jool system with only about 300 m/s of delta-V left. Fortunately, I had just learned what aerobraking was, and attempted it with vigour. I ended up aerobraking through Jool just enough to prevent escape, and used a second pass to lower my apoapsis further. I then made a very minor burn, about 100 m/s, and did a flyby about 5 km above Tylo\u0027s north pole. This changed my inclination to about 80 degrees, and sent my apoapsis to the edge of Jool\u0027s SoI. When there, I made another minor burn (this time about 20 m/s) and ended up on a Laythe intercept. I performed my third-ever aerobrake in Laythe\u0027s atmosphere, which captured me in a near-circular orbit on the first pass. I raised my orbit out of the atmosphere, and made the minor adjustment to fix my inclination to nearly 90. All told, I had a third of my probe\u0027s fuel left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was the first time I\u0027d used aerobraking or gravity assists, and I\u0027m quite proud of how it all turned out.
