Maybe he likes to show off a little. I think that Val might be the more businesslike side of test-piloting, and is just as capable but is down-to-Kerbin and professional about how she conducts flights. I think that Bob Kerman, as scientist, is not so much scared as excited about spaceflight, as he wants to study and make observations. Bob would be the most frightened out of the crew, as his engineering background suggests that he knows just how imprecise most kerbal rocket designs actually are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo what do you think these brave explorers behave like?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-20T19:19:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou might be interested in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.kerbalcomics.com/2012/02/01/episode-one-jebs-passion/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ekerbalcomics.com\u003C/a\u003E.
