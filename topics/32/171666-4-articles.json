Take Two and Squad shouldn\u0027t try to compete with mod makers for parts and content, but rather should focus on releasing major desired functionality expansions to the core game such as multiplayer, life support, expandable bases and airports, mining as a means for funding a commercial space program, new officially supported planets or systems, terrain manipulation and underground bases, or even AI. To be honest, I was really hoping the first expansion I would pay for is the long-awaited officially supported multiplayer. I still am, and will gladly buy it when available.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe DLC makes it harder for me as a content mod maker since I won\u0027t have the DLC to test my GAP contracts. I feel like as a contacts mod maker that I have to chuck down change for stuff that doesn\u0027t seem all that unique compared to what is already available freely to the community, just to test and support my contracts. Perhaps the new EULA is designed to provide a cease and desist to ensure profitability for DLC thus stifling part and content creation?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThus I think TT should focus on paid functionality expansions, not paid DLC. Continue supporting and catering to the modding community that makes KSP great. Give us functionality to work with. Heck, even an official in-game mod installer, hosted service, and config would go a long way. Anyone can make parts and content and test concepts and challenge norms. But it takes a great game developer to steer the game to what the people really want and turn those great ideas into permanent gold.
