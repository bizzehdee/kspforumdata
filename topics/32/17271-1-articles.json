I\u0027ve been tending towards gimballed engines and ASAS for hassle-free launchers, but the non-gimballed engines do have more smash. How accurate is the modeling of drag for winglets?

Usually, my gravity turn is almost exactly ballistic. (The nose is always pointed close to the direction of travel.) In this case, winglets are almost dead weight. But if the gravity turn needs to be more aggressive for some reason, winglets offer resistance to tumbling as well as a little bit of lift in the off-axis direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EASAS doing hundreds of little adjustments using winglets is not as troubling as it might seem.

You never see some pointing in one direction and others in another direction. So they can pitch and yaw, but not roll the vehicle or stop its roll. But I don\u0027t consider that much of a problem anyway. If it gets out of hand it can overwhelm your guidance system, it\u0027s true, but as long as your axis of thrust is pointing in the right direction, it doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re rolling around that axis. If you can\u0027t stop a roll when you\u0027re out of atmo and it\u0027s time to make course changes, then you\u0027re boned, but if that\u0027s the case then it\u0027s a vehicle layout problem rather than a steering issue.\n"}]}
