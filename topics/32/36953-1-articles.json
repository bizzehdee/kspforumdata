I think I can explain why the apoapsis and periapsis fluctuate so much and maybe help with those orbital inclination changes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn orbit too, to make inclination changes from an equatorial orbit you aim North and burn. What you\u0027re actually doing is burning perpendicular to the plane of your orbit, so you\u0027re aiming 90 degrees from your prograde marker which, in a equatorial orbit is pointing roughly east.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI may be wrong here but if I understand it right, I think that the reason for your orbital burns not working properly is that the perfect burn for changing inclination should not be in a single fixed direction (\u0022North\u0022) and the manoeuvre node doesn\u0027t allow for this, it just shows what will happen if you burn in your target direction for a certain burn duration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen you burn prograde or retrograde, you\u0027re working in two dimensions, burning in the plane of the orbit so the only change is in that plane - e.g. extending apoapsis. All of your burn is parallel to the plane of your orbit working towards changing apoapsis and there is no component perpendicular to the orbit, working to change your inclination. Once you start burning perpendicular to the plane of the orbit (the purple arrows on the manoeuvre nodes) to do inclination changes, there is, in theory, no component of your burn going towards changing apoapsis and it\u0027s all going into changing inclination. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, the component of your burn that\u0027s parallel to your orbital plane changes apoapsis and the component that\u0027s perpendicular changes inclination. If you were to burn in some random direction you\u0027d have your burn affect both to varying degrees.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem comes in that when you burn perpendicular to your orbit to change inclination you\u0027re instantly changing the plane of that orbit and thus the angle between the direction you\u0027re burning and the plane of your orbit has now changed, it\u0027s no longer perpendicular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine you\u0027re in an equatorial orbit. To increase the inclination you aim 90 degrees from your prograde marker, which is likely pointing east at 90 degrees if you\u0027ve launched normally, point north - aiming the navball at 0 degrees on the artificial horizon - and burn. Now imagine your orbit was already inclined at 30 degrees. To further increase the inclination there, you\u0027d burn perpendicular to that orbital plane so you\u0027d point your navball at 330 degrees on the artificial horizon, not at north which is perpendicular to the equator. It\u0027s 330 because: 90 (east) - 30 (current inclination) = 60 degrees, then we subtract 90 to get a perpendicular to our current orbit: 60 - 90 = 330.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn an extended burn as your inclination changes, the plane to which you have to burn perpendicular is constantly changing so your target direction shouldn\u0027t be fixed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat happens to the manoeuvre node when you use the the purple arrows is that you\u0027re adding a component to the burn perpendicular to the original orbit, you\u0027re effectively telling it to set up a manoeuvre to burn North for x seconds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe instant you start that perpendicular burn, no matter how accurate you are on the target marker, you\u0027re not burning perpendicular to your current orbit - you\u0027re burning perpendicular to your \u003Cem\u003Eoriginal\u003C/em\u003E one. Your current orbit changed the instant you started the burn. The further from an equatorial orbit you get, the further off perpendicular from your current, constantly changing, orbit your burn is. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, if not all of your burn is going towards changing inclination (because it\u0027s not perpendicular to your \u003Cem\u003Ecurrent\u003C/em\u003E orbit) then some component of it must be doing something else and it is; it\u0027s either burning prograde or retrograde which is why the apoapsis and periapsis change too (and why they go crazy when dragging the manoeuvre nodes around).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne solution is to do a series of small burns, changing inclination by a few degrees each time and then adding a new manoeuvre node so that each burn is roughly perpendicular to the orbit that resulted from the last one - this shouldn\u0027t affect the periapsis and apoapsis too much. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other solution is to get a feel for how the direction of burn changes as the inclination changes and do it manually!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming you\u0027re in a circular equatorial orbit, your direction of burn should track smoothly from North (0 degrees) to West (270 degrees) along the artificial horizon of the navball as you go through a 90 degree inclination change (assuming you can complete the burn while you\u0027re pretty much on the equator - it\u0027ll track off the artificial horizon as you move away from the equator). This second solution is a lot trickier though and would take some practice. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, if I could adjust my direction to precisely match my inclination (so when my inclination reaches 20 degrees my burn direction is 360-20 = 340 degrees; when it reaches 45 degrees my direction of burn is 315 and so on) then I could execute a perfect inclination change without affecting periapsis or apoapsis. In practise it\u0027s damned difficult! I just had a trial run and even with Flight Engineer telling me what my current inclination was I still ended up with a periapsis at 40Km having started from a circular 90Km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope that makes some sort of sense \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"spikeyhat09","CreatedById":39217,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-13T23:59:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Estep 1: launch going north, or the red line on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estep 2: achieve a relatively circular and stable orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Estep 3: set the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn as target, and adjust inclination at the descending/ascending nodes until it reads 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethis is possible because the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn has exactly 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination, and is therefore can be used to mark the exact equator.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kimberly","CreatedById":71980,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-14T00:31:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAll of the advice in this thread is good, but for mapping purposes, you don\u0027t want an exact polar orbit.
