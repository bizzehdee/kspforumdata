In times like these, it is tempting to start fresh, with a new save. But we think of the old one, the stations and bases, the kerbals with cool names, and we reach a dilemma.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo,the question is: Do you restart your saves?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI used to restart my saves whenever an update was coming close, but after 0.20, I vowed to keep a save going. Well, 0.21 broke saves. So far, I\u0027ve kept my 0.21 save intact, but a lot of frustration is making me consider starting fresh. The biggest project I have right now is a three module space station, and I\u0027ve got docking down pat now, so that isn\u0027t a huge concern.
