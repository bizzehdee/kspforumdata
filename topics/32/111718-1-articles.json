It turned out to be actually way more fun than normal difficulty, or at least it would be, if it weren\u0027t for the bugs.\n\nYesterday I did my first moon-landing, after fighting with the editor first, who would constantly switch between radial and mirror mounting, even milliseconds before placing, threw out Bob from the pilot seat and put in Val like every time I launch a rocket, just to learn that it wouldn\u0027t leave the launchpad despite enough TWR. After an hour someone on the forum was so kind to tell me that this is a launchpad bug, where the rocket gets stuck in the pad. Now my rocket is using all 30/30 parts and I don\u0027t have the money to upgrade the lab yet, so I was screwed. Eventually I managed to shake the rocket enough on the launchpad to get it to fly (highly unstable, but fly), and managed to make my Mun-landing and return.\n\nToday I tried to get to Minimus. Same issues with Editor, throw out Bob, shake on the launchpad to get up. SAS prograde fails to work properly, because I changed something about the rocket, and now it wobbles like they are partying hard in the command pod. SAS stabilize and manual flight: smooth like a feather. So I have to steer manually for now. Get the rocket to Orbit and towards Minimus... can\u0027t click on the flight-path anymore, because it shakes like the rocket did before, so manual warping till Minimus. Add the maneuver to enter orbit, warp to it... rocket doesn\u0027t stop and flies by. Good thing I have some extra dV, so I break manually and land the rocket, do the usual science stuff, put Bob on Eva, he fails to grab the ladder on exit for some reason, RCS doesn\u0027t turn on, because he somehow got knocked unconscious, he falls through the ground, everything vanishes (including all planets and KSC), and after a reload the lander is gone and all my Kerbals are dead. And of course no quick saves because of hard mode, so I guess I start from scratch again.\n\nThis game would be so much better if it weren\u0027t for all those annoying bugs."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T10:04:25Z","Content":"Yeah, they can be annoying, but I just chalk them up to kerbal engineering ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T10:20:58Z","Content":"First off, congrats on the 30-part mun lander.

It has failed me too many times at critical times like obtaining an orbit after an encounter. So it is either KAC or Mechjeb automaticzlly stoping warping for me.\n\nI have had the radial and mirror symetry change on me a couple of times. I think it is caused by mousing over other parts that are already placed just like it does with the number sysmetry. Not sure if that is the cause.\n\nDo not use the SAS to hold prograde during launch, turn off the gimbal on engines, or turn the gimbal range down. Turning off or reducing the gimbal range will help reduce over correcting. I also find that SAS can resist the gravity turn with some designs so I generally only use it before I start the turn or when I am above 30K and start making a more agressive turn towards the horizon.\n\nIt seems to me the path projection will shake if there is something causing the calculations to be a little more complicated. Like the Mun being close to or interferring with your path to minmus or leaving Kerbins SOI. It also shakes for me when I manage to have almost perfect circular orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"FancyMouse","CreatedById":142946,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T10:27:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I refuse to disable save/revert options specifically because of bugs.\n\nCan\u0027t agree more.

Once in orbit it was shaking all over the place, not the engines or control surfaces, but the camera shake. Then I noticed in the map that it said it was landed, even though it was in orbit. The engines/tanks, once detached were fine though. So far after that I haven\u0027t had it happen again so not sure what I did that caused it to happen. I thought maybe the game had gotten a glitch after running for a while so i closed it and reloaded but same thing. \n\nI am using mods though, so maybe its a combination of things at specific times that causes it.

Set up the rendezvous and adjusted it so my approach distance was ~500 meters. The rendezvous was about 60 days away so I returned to the space centre to run another mission in the meantime. \n\nI had a contract to go and recover something from Mun so I started that. All was going OK until I got close to the thing I was supposed to pick up, whereupon it just sank into the ground. So I reloaded a save while still in Mun orbit and tried again, and again. Each time as I got near it, it sank. So I gave up on that one and switched back to my asteroid mission. \n\nThe nicely setup rendezvous was now way off, instead of being within 500m it was now ~10,000km off. I had enough dV to adjust it back and carry on. Once I\u0027d caught the asteroid I started to mine it....clunk, the camera shifted violently, signifying that the asteroid had suddenly been drained of all it\u0027s resources in a second. hmph...reloaded tried again, this time mining worked ok and after a tedious burn I\u0027d shunted it to an escape trajectory out of the solar system. \n\nAt that point two things were getting quite close to happening, a crew pod was now 2 days away from returning back to Kerbin and another mission was about 20 days away from reaching Duna. So I switched to the crew pod. NAN!!!! black screen doom, had to restart the game (and then load up a save from a few minutes before switching as the NAN had deleted the craft). After trying several times to switch to the craft while it was on a solar orbit and failing I waited until the craft had crossed into Kerbin\u0027s SOI and then switched. That time it worked fine and I was able to bring that crew back home. \n\nThen onto the Duna mission, switch to craft...NAN!! AGAIN!! reloaded game with save from before switch and tried the trick of waiting till the craft was in Duna\u0027s SOI before switching to it. No such luck, this time whatever I did when I switched to it I got a NAN error. So that\u0027s Val and Bob dead and a craft that was supposed to complete 4 separate contracts lost (never mind the two days I\u0027d spend building it). \n\nSo four totally separate missions, each one plagued with bugs, 2 completely borked.

KSP looks pretty much the same even with all the graphics turned down (not sure about Windows DirectX, who has time for Microsoft or 32bit). Its the FPU and CPU that are being stressed (plus memory if you want to run mods).\n\nI think to compare KSP to Farcry say you would need to invest the same sort of money in your CPU and Memory that you would for a Graphics Card to play the aforementioned game. Maybe a eight Core i7 extreme and 16GB of DDR4 RAM, run that on Linux and watch it fly, you could get away with a $100 graphics card."}]}
