Loading buggys will be sent to bring kerbals to board the ship, and once full, the ship shall takeoff, hopefully with only few kerbal deaths. As the mission progresses, updates will be broadcast.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 1: A team of 24 kerbals has been chosen, and has made it to the launch pad to begin boarding, with only a few buggys breaking apart on the half kilometer trip.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 2: The amount of kerbals has been cut in half, causing much disapointment to the ones who did not get to join in the historic flight of the back-yard colonizing ship. The ship however, has also had some improvements, lowering its roof to help decrease the Kerbal anomaly called \\\u0027lag.\\\u0027\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 3: An odd looking hole was discovered as the first kerbonaught was climbing the ladder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 4: 2 of the proposed 12, of the proposed 24 crewmembers has made it aboard. The colonization ship is now ready for launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 5: A failure in the release of the locking clamps was found, and the ship replaced, but the two crew members aboard the ship are missing. More crew members are needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 6: 3 new crew members have boarded. Liftoff!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 7: The locking clamps were not in the same stage as the engines, and the rocket simply smashed into the ground. A new rocket has been prepared, and 2 more crew members have boarded. Kerbal scientists say this Rocket has a 30% ratio of success.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate 8: The ship has landed, but it looks like we lost our two kerbonaughts. One, we saw fly out the back door, and the other.. not so sure what happened to him.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat concludes! So far, Kerbal colonists aboard a colonization ship have a 0% chance of survival!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-29T22:42:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOoh, will be following this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
