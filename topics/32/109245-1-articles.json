Who here on the forums joined due to seeing KSP on a popular Youtube channel, and which channel? I didn\u0027t, though probably would have if I had discovered KSP that way. I think it\u0027s really been a blessing for squad, I\u0027d like to think they have a big impact and spread the word quite a lot.I would think the channels with the biggest impact would be ones that already have a good fan base from playing other-games, as they introduce a lot of people to it. Compared to channels that are more KSP exclusive, and as a result likely have a fan base that is mostly already comprised of KSP players. Though likely have a big impact in keeping those viewers active in playing the game/contributing to the community.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ekim98","CreatedById":82180,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T19:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMacey dean got me in.
