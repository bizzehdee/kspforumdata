If you\u0027re encountering the space cuthulu bug constantly, and it\u0027s making your planetary travels impossible, just pull up the cheat menu (Control\u002BShift\u002BAlt\u002BD), then select \u0022Unbreakable Joints\u0022 before you warp, and after de-warping, unselect it and put the menu away. You might want to press ALT-X a few times to clear the trim that opening the cheat menu applies, just in case.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"_Aramchek_","CreatedById":12588,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T18:10:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Space\u0022 Cthulhu sounds so cheesy/reduntant, Warp Cthulhu is better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also just go to the space center, then re-select your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Person012345","CreatedById":33728,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T18:40:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022_Aramchek_\u0022 data-cite=\u0022_Aramchek_\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u0022Space\u0022 Cthulhu sounds so cheesy/reduntant, Warp Cthulhu is better.\u003Cp\u003EYou can also just go to the space center, then re-select your ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat?

That was a probe en-route to eve when I de-warped and it ended up like that.
