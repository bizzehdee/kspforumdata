I already have calculated a massive Rocket that could get him into orbit. Now i wanna test that thing before its going to Eve.

Would be much simpler than editing Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better would be to just calculate your delta-V. Using plug-ins like Kerbal Engineer or mechjeb lets you do that automatically.
