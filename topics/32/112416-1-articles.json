I first encountered it with a little supersonic jet I built. One of my favorite things to do with it is blow past the Space Center at low altitudes and ridiculous speeds. On one of my passes, some of my ground installations exploded the instant I passed over them. I hadn\u0027t collided with it, and my plane wasn\u0027t at all damaged, it just blew up as I went over. I wrote it off as a bug caused by extreme speed, and chose to believe my it was my shockwave that did the damage. Some roleplay always invigorates a sandbox game ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)\n\nHowever, I encountered it again. I\u0027ve been testing my new spaceplane all day, and on one of my full-up tests, I ran into the bug again. I was coming in from the ocean, low and slow. On my final approach, I heard an explosion and momentarily lost control. Once I\u0027d landed, I noticed that the left-hand control surfaces were gone, and the launchpad was burning. I had left some debris on the pad from a previous test, so I thought it was just that. However, when I read the mission report, it said that the control surfaces had knocked the launchpad and been destroyed. I was nowhere near the pad when this happened. Has anybody else encountered this?"},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T01:32:03Z","Content":"Hehe, your sig pic is so apropos.\n\nI\u0027ve never blown anything up without touching it though, off to try and fly past the tower as fast as I can."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Dwarf","CreatedById":67709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T01:36:02Z","Content":"As far as I\u0027ve tested, the buildings don\u0027t blow up. I was talking about a mockup of a Duna base which I hadn\u0027t bothered to clean up. It was all but obliterated after I flew past it."},{"CreatedByName":"LittleBlueGaming","CreatedById":144665,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:25:45Z","Content":"Oh, I see. I just flew past the tower at about 900m/s, less than a wingspan of space, but no kablooey ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nHuh. Put a stupid little rover on the launchpad, flew over it about 100m at 900m/s, and it looked like it got hit by my shockwave, launched itself over mission control. I got out of physics range of it before it crashed, so it was sitting on the screen at the space center. Click fly, and it loaded about 20m above the ground, then crashed.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\nGot some pics finally. You can see my rover(science module and cupola) near the ground. I\u0027m also fairly certain that it launched off the launchpad before I got to it.\n\n![SFcIgbz.png](http://i.imgur.com/SFcIgbz.png)\n\n![qPtdOUY.png](http://i.imgur.com/qPtdOUY.png)\n\n![rUc7zmb.png](http://i.imgur.com/rUc7zmb.png)"},{"CreatedByName":"mdkendall","CreatedById":114550,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T02:50:05Z","Content":"I normally put flags at either end of the runway to use as navigation aids, and several times I have found one fallen over and I have had to replace it, and I\u0027m sure my last landing I didn\u0027t hit it.\n\nI also once put a flag on the roof of the tower on the island.

I\u0027m not going nuts, at least.\n\n This really is bizarre. I figured that it was just the engine having trouble calculating relative velocities when you pass through the loading range so quickly, but that doesn\u0027t explain how my wingtip clipped the launchpad from hundreds of meters away. I was only going about 60 m/s, and one of the tanks next to the pad exploded like I\u0027d hit it with an asteroid. And again, this was when I was landing at the runway, in no way near the launchpad."},{"CreatedByName":"*Aqua*","CreatedById":103926,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T03:27:37Z","Content":"It\u0027s probably the \u0022crashed into the KSC\u0022-bug which is around for many versions.

It used to be delta wing parts colliding with the launchpad if you passed its horizontal line as far as 20km away from KSC. Appears to happen after a circularization. It can happen anywhere, even in space. I think it\u0027s linked with the bug that makes launchpad rockets with launch clamps materialize in orbit on launch. With 70km long clamps. It\u0027s a weird bug, but this seems to be just another iteration of it. Good to have hyperedit for these shenanigans."},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T13:11:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s probably the \u0022crashed into the KSC\u0022-bug which is around for many versions.

I know to avoid using the claw, since it is particularly bug-ridden, but the rest is ok. They\u0027ve fixed a lot of easy to root out bugs between 1.0 and 0.9, but I think some of the old ones are either deeply buried in the origibal old code, or hard to track down. Either way, they are most likely to be fixed if KSP is rewritten from scratch, possibly that is what\u0027s happening right now, since it is supposedly being updated to a newer unity engine iteration. One can only hope."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Dwarf","CreatedById":67709,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T13:31:38Z","Content":"Yeah, I figure that\u0027s what it is. The shockwave bug only seems to happen sometimes, and only with particular craft. My Duna base mockup was destroyed by my supersonic pass, but the planes I had in front of the SPH were untouched. Similarly, maybe one in twenty landings have been disrupted by phantom collisions. It seems pretty much random, and all of it can be avoided by liberal use of quicksave ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T14:00:20Z","Content":"How about colliding with the launchpad no less than 50m off the ground (after accounting for the rockets height)?

Sporadic bugs especially are hard to track down, once you track the bug down fixing it is usually easy.
