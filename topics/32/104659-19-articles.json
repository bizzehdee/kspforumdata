As a software dev I am well aware of tedious and thorough testing-procedure a healthy company has, and from my interpretation of the devnotes I would say that Squad follows such a standard too.\n\nSo, whatever the feature is, it requires the minimum of testing, it won\u0027t affect many aspects of the game, and it\u0027ll be small enough to \u0022just add, no need to test\u0022, or close to.\n\nI\u0027m thinking along these lines:\n\n- Not a bugfix. If it was easy, it had been fixed long ago, and I\u0027m sure a well-known bug would be in the bugtracker and require QA to sign off on it.\n\n- Something that is very localized\n\n- If it\u0027s bugged, it is unlikely to break anything else\n\n- Quick to implement, as previously stated\n\nA feature that would be cool, and fits the above restrictions would be a launch countdown or something similar.
