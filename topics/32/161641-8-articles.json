I wonder how many of them actually donate money to the modders that ask for donations. I\u0027ve lost track of how much money I\u0027ve donated to modders, and I only use a handful of mods. It\u0027s a lot more than anything KSP can charge in a DLC.\u00A0 Modders work hard on these things in their spare time and I have no trouble donating money to compensate them.\u00A0 Modders don\u0027t have to do what the do.\u00A0 I really, REALLY don\u0027t understand what\u0027s wrong with paid DLC.\u00A0 It\u0027s been around since the beginning of PC games practically, only it was sold at stores on CDs as \u0027addons\u0027 and I only heard a few complaints.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis \u0022Everything should be free\u0022 thing is a BAD bushiness model. If you want KSP to go bye bye, then think that way.\u00A0 I don\u0027t come from a software background, but my family owns an amusement ride manufacturing company and a small amusement park (And as the eldest grandson of the founder,\u00A0 I wear many hats in it as in all small family owned companies).\u00A0 While it\u0027s good business to give free things away once and a while to build up good faith, or replace something for free if it\u0027s your fault it needs replacing, giving everything away for free is a recipe for disaster, and a very bad business model.\u00A0 And we wouldn\u0027t be celebrating our 70th year next year if we did what these \u0026lt;people\u0026gt; complaining about having to pay for DLC want- nothing but free stuff.\u00A0 If one of our carousels needs repainting, we repaint it.\u00A0 We\u0027ll ask for a reasonable price to do so though, knowing that if we ask for too much, they will find another company to paint it for them. If we gave them a \u0027free dlc upgrade\u0027 for free, we would go bankrupt very shortly.\u00A0 Our time is valuable, we can\u0027t afford to give away everything for free.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nVote with your wallet.\u00A0 Read reviews. If the DLC doesn\u0027t seem like something you want, or there are a lot of bad reviews, DON\u0027T BUY IT.\u00A0 Nobody is making you pay for microtransactions, you are doing it all on your own, and that makes it profitable.\u00A0 Hell, the top 100 money making apps are all free games with microtransactions.\u00A0 If our company did make software I\u0027d be jumping on that bandwagon too.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t want microtransactions (which I hate by the way and I won\u0027t play a game that has them) then stop paying for them.\u00A0 I guarantee you the company will adopt a different \u0027better\u0027 business model.\u00A0 Some of you make these guys out to be greedy monsters, when they just want to put food on their family\u0027s table and send their kids through college like the rest of you.\u00A0 As for paying for DLC, I really, really don\u0027t understand what the problem is (I\u0027ve said that twice now). At this point I think they deserve the money, I\u0027ve spent so many thousands of hours playing KSP.\u00A0 I\u0027ll buy it even if I don\u0027t use it.\u00A0 If you don\u0027t want it don\u0027t buy it.\u00A0 In my previous post I mentioned I played through GTV 5 once, loved it, got my money out of it and went on.\u00A0 Everyone is saying it\u0027s ruined. No it\u0027s not, I never played with mods.\u00A0 Heck somebody posted a thing on Steams Summer Sale for KSP \u0022Don\u0027t buy this game it\u0027s BROKEN, because they are going to blah blah blah, paranoid conspiracy rant\u0022.\u00A0 How is KSP broken NOW???\u00A0 Save it to another folder. that doesn\u0027t up date it.\u00A0 I don\u0027t know how many different old versions of KSP I still have, all the way back to January 1, 2014 when I bought it, and why I\u0027m vehemently against the \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

I did. But I trust this company. They aren\u0027t the large developers like ea or Ubisoft, and this game is not optimized for a micro transaction economy, nor does the nature of the game allow people who pay to receive these expansion packs to have an unfair advantage, since the game in itself is not a competitive game, unless you count challenges.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe expansions are simply adding an aspect of the game that doesn\u0027t exactly fit with the main game, like making history, it\u0027s adding an entire new campaign system that allows you to follow historic spaceflight missions, it\u0027s a more educational, and doesn\u0027t add much to the game as a whole. It\u0027s a fun little side piece, and optional part of the game, that yes you can get as a mod, but being developed by the games developers, can help it become a more enjoyable experience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd they aren\u0027t charging you for any future updates, they have stated that they will keep that promise. So any major updates, like a 1.4 onward, that adds new content the developers have intended for the entire game and community will be free for you.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nnow look I\u0027ve been with this game since 2011-12, and bought it when the .14 update came out, changing the game from a free to play demo, to a $10.00 work in progress. At this point, the game is now worth $24.99 on steam. The game has more than doubled in price since I first bought it back when I was a freshmen in high school. Even if they didn\u0027t want to make all the expansions free for the portion that got the game when I did, I\u0027d gladly pay extra for the expansions that interest me.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is where my argument comes into play. Expansions are optional. Nobody has to buy them, they are an optional part of the game that is available to those who want something that the developers don\u0027t feel would warant an entire update to implement. Like a making history update. Adding little parts to the game that are built for smaller parts of the community, and as a bonus make a little extra money. Hey aren\u0027t trying to Dead Space 3 us, they are putting genuine effort into this. And the fact that they are offering them free to anyone shows how much they care for their audience. But it must be a balanced. If they only focused on keeping the community happy, the game would still be free, it would never have made a cent for Squad, and I\u0027m certain would not be at the development stage it is if they didn\u0027t at one point say. We need to start making money from this. This is another point in the development where they have a large enough audience, they can branch out, and build these expansions designed around targeting smaller groups within it, while optimizing the game to continue to grow the audience.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
