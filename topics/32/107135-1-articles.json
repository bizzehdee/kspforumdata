What is too hard? \n\nThere are more than enough easy contracts so the money is not an issue. Are you referring to the science? That\u0027s easy, unlock science lab and thermometers and go biome hopping. Hell, you don\u0027t even need to fly - plant some wheels onto that mobile lab, put a scientists into it and visit all sections of the KSP, collecting data and resetting experiments every time (scientist can do that). Then you can visit grasslands and shores. There\u0027s some tundra bit just northwest of the KSP. By the mountains there\u0027s highlands and mountain biome. You can also add a vertical engine under CoM to hover just enough to collect report in flight over biome."},{"CreatedByName":"Matt77","CreatedById":69015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T11:31:59Z","Content":"I\u0027m finding it slow going but that\u0027s what i like.

If things still go blatantly wrong after careful design you can revert to start over without harm done, and it\u0027s not as if accepted contracts only have a duration of a few days to full fill them, most have a span of several years.

Yes. **Easy** career mode is too hard. There\u0027s too much to learn and too large a penalty for failure (unless they quickly learn to revert every single mistake).

No. It is not."},{"CreatedByName":"Heimdall5008","CreatedById":114990,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:02:33Z","Content":"I cannot really say that it is too hard for me. But I agree with 5thHorseman: for a new player it is definitely a real challenge. I found KSP hard in 0.21 when I started with the (now) science mode as career. Okay, after I got some experience it got a joke and was no different from sandbox. Since then every update made the career a little harder:\n\n- funds\n\n- removal of reaction wheels and SAS and the need for pilots\n\n- new aero model and massively reduction of science and reputation for contracts\n\nI must say, that I like most of the changes afterwards, but in the beginning it always gets a bit harder.\n\nBut I think everyone who starts with KSP should be aware that the game has a brutally steep learning curve. So I cannot say that it is to hard, you have just to invest time and brains to get the hang ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Torquemadus","CreatedById":97777,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-03T13:06:06Z","Content":"I play on custom difficulty because I\u0027ve found that Hard mode is too easy for my tastes.

After playing 2 short lived screw-ups i\u0027m happy with a 3rd attempt on Hard difficulty.\n\nRegardless of difficulty, there is a bit of a spike in difficulty just before reaching orbital missions since doing anything complicated up there requires a bunch of nodes and upgrades that are not easy to earn. Once Mun and Minmus are opened up science and funding should be plentifull for any type of mission.\n\nAnd if Normal is too difficult, why not pick Easy or adjust the difficulty sliders a bit to customise difficulty? I like Hard but i gave myself the option to revert because at least early on there is no way to test contraptions without putting Kerbals and too much risk. Having said that, i may disable it after all because i started to abuse it. :/ With difficulty settings for career mode this customisable i don\u0027t see why the poll is needed.
