There\u0027s definitely a serious memory leak somewhere, cause loading a save I\u0027m at 2 gigs and 2 hours later I rarely go below about 3 gigs. While 0.90 is pretty stable for me, I am afraid of bugs in 1.0. It\u0027s not because of \u003Cem\u003Ecurrent\u003C/em\u003E experiences with KSP, it\u0027s because I\u0027ve seen them have pretty bad bugs on releases with substantially fewer new features. They\u0027re trying to do so much, and I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be really awesome when it works right 85% of the time, but that 15% that they didn\u0027t encounter in the limited testing is what scares me, and is why I wish there was one more \u0022beta\u0022 release where they could have all those features and let us bug test, and then have 1.0 as the ultimate bug free release version.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
