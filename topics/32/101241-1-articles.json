This is relevant because, as far as Squad is concerned, a 1.0 release needs to be stable as a stock game, but stability for heavy mod users is relatively less important.\n\nThe responses will be highly subjective, of course, but I do feel it would give us an idea who are experiencing the most problems. No need to discuss technical details here such as memory leaks, and we don\u0027t need to talk about performance either, this is just an attempt to gather information. \n\nEdit: I also don\u0027t think we need to have another thread about how we may or may not think 1.0 will be unstable because of all the new features and there being no public beta.\n\nI have included a poll with this post, so please vote what most closely matches your KSP experience. You may choose more than one option if you have more than one install.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T19:30:43Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Deddly**\n  \nPoll added"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:03:28Z","Content":"I think most crashes in KSP are caused by going over the RAM limit. So this mostly affects those who run lots of mods and those with low amounts of RAM. Other crashes are caused by glitchy parts such as the claw and also ramming into planets at high speeds (Go watch Danny on Youtube). Apart from these it is quite stable. In 1.0 i don\u0027t think the RAM limit will be solved however in the future when 64 bit is re-released then i think people will have less problems."},{"CreatedByName":"Uncle Mort","CreatedById":57933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T19:05:13Z","Content":"0.90 is very unstable for me.

More than half of the stuff I run on my Win64 installation is 32bit. But upgrading from Win32 to Win64 and reinstalling everything, can be more trouble than its worth.\n\n Comment on KSP issues: I run 2 UI mods, Kerbal Alarm Clock and Kerbal Engineer. All stock parts. Even without the mods, I have seen the following issues in KSP .90 32-bit on Win8.1 x64\n\n 1. Reverting from the Launchpad or runway, back to the SPH or VAB, with a 200\u002B part craft in order to make one change, and going back out again, inevitably ends in a KSP crash *after 15-20 times*.\n\n 1a. If not reverting a bunch of times, I can happily explore the solar system for hours, like many other people.\n\n 2. During the above sequence, animation stutter will develop at some point, where everything stops for one frame every 5-10 seconds. This is generally agreed to be a Unity problem.\n\n 3. Maneuver node math glitches. The lines may jump around like crazy while plotting intercepts, the numbers madly trying to agree with each other. \n\n 4. Various Bugs with changing symmetry modes in the VAB / SPH editor. Claw did a lot of work in this area for his [\u0022stock bug fixes\u0022 patches](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285).\n\n 5. The random wing destruction bug... is infrequent, but terribly annoying when it occurs. It is noted in the KSP bug tracker, but there does not seem to be an easily repeatable method that will reproduce the problem. Players would reload their saved games, and sometimes it would happen again, sometimes not. Therefore, I pin my hopes for getting this infrequent problem fixed, on an accidental side-effect of the many other changes that are occurring in 1.0.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-04T20:31:05Z\u0022 title=\u002203/04/2015 08:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by basic.syntax**"},{"CreatedByName":"Deddly","CreatedById":62955,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-04T20:28:30Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E you\u0027re asking about stability and suggesting a version of KSP that even Squad label as \u0027unstable\u0027 and don\u0027t recommend!\n\nDon\u0027t worry, Pecan.
