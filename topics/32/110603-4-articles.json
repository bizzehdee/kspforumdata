High altitude, very fast aviation is very much a good thing to include in the game. Just look at NASA, they have a long and broad history in more extreme aspects of terrestrial aviation as well as space. Tweak the game too far in the way that you are advocating (and my sense is that you want it tweaked much too far in that direction), and rockets will likely have unreasonable (possibly even unrealistic) heat problems on ascent as well.\n\nSpace planes are here to stay and a popular feature of the game.

Squad hasn\u0027t sat down and decided that a planet of exactly this size would create the most fun. They have stuck with a very early decision made in a very different stage of development and have either refused or been unable to revisit the issue.\n\nAs others have already said, you\u0027re completely wrong about that, and the reasons you think were behind it. There are a great many things in the game which would be far worse with real scale: ascent to orbit, descent from orbit (just the time needed, nothing to do with heat), rovers, terrestrial flight to places elsewhere on Kerbin, etc; pretty much every single thing involving distance and real time control. It has absolutely nothing to do with texture size or quality, you could do real scale without any difference in texture size (but low-isn quality), or just a modest increase in texture size for ok-ish quality. The mods which are giving problems with texture memory have chosen to go with heavy texture load, but they didn\u0027t really have to in terms of gameplay, only an arbitrary decision by the author to make it look as pretty and detailed as possible. Scale and detail are two completely separate things.\n\nSquad could very easily have done real scale while still having all textures loaded all of the time, and without severe memory bloat. It\u0027s not like there is much surface detail to see anyway, to justify high res textures for planets. I strongly believe that they chose not to do real scale because it would be extremely crap for gameplay for the average person just wanting to have some fun. The current scale provides a game which can deliver satisfaction from as little as 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015310 minutes of play, or feel like you achieved quite a lot in an hour of play. It lets you complete a flying mission on the other side of Kerbin in less than an hour. Launches take long enough to be interesting, can be hand flown without much issue, but not so long that you\u0027re dreading the time they take. It\u0027s absolutely standard in game simulators which are on the (more fun, less serious) end of the spectrum to make exactly that type of choice, as you get a better game out of it, with a far wider audience.\n\nIt\u0027s all a bunch of compromises necessary to produce a \u0022light\u0022 and fun game. It has never been supposed to be an ultra-realistic simulator, just something which doesn\u0027t deviate too horribly from real physics in general, and adheres to normal orbital mechanics. KSP does not need ultra-real re-entry heat, it would be a vastly worse product with that. All we need is acknowledgement that re-entry heat exists combined with limited consequences from it as long as providing those consequences doesn\u0027t cause serious problems for average players. Today\u0027s heat system is perfectly acceptable as a whole, maybe it could use some minor tuning, but that\u0027s all; it should absolutely not try to get even close to real re-entry heat problems."},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T10:34:44Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E And here I expected them to abandon KSP and concentrate on mobile games. ![:rolleyes:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif)\n\nI hope not!
