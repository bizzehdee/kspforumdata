It is an artifact of very early days, days before time warp, and is now bounded by technical issues. Making Kerbin bigger would solve or at least facilitate solutions to all number of physics issues, from aero to ISP and reentry. But KSP faces texture limits. There is only so much that you can do when a planet is coloured by a single massive texture. Look to any number of the RSS/Kopernicus threads to see what I mean. KSP is already on the low end in terms of texture quality, and on the VERY low end in terms of terrain. They cannot push down much further without drawing the ire of reviewers. Given KSPs \u0022load everything 24/7\u0022 approach, going with more detailed planet textures would mean a larger ram footprint... not an option.\u003Cp\u003ESo, no. Squad hasn\u0027t sat down and decided that a planet of exactly this size would create the most fun.

There are a great many things in the game which would be far worse with real scale: ascent to orbit, descent from orbit (just the time needed, nothing to do with heat), rovers, terrestrial flight to places elsewhere on Kerbin, etc; pretty much every single thing involving distance and real time control. It has absolutely nothing to do with texture size or quality, you could do real scale without any difference in texture size (but low-isn quality), or just a modest increase in texture size for ok-ish quality. The mods which are giving problems with texture memory have chosen to go with heavy texture load, but they didn\u0027t really have to in terms of gameplay, only an arbitrary decision by the author to make it look as pretty and detailed as possible. Scale and detail are two completely separate things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESquad could very easily have done real scale while still having all textures loaded all of the time, and without severe memory bloat. It\u0027s not like there is much surface detail to see anyway, to justify high res textures for planets. I strongly believe that they chose not to do real scale because it would be extremely crap for gameplay for the average person just wanting to have some fun. The current scale provides a game which can deliver satisfaction from as little as 5\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u015310 minutes of play, or feel like you achieved quite a lot in an hour of play. It lets you complete a flying mission on the other side of Kerbin in less than an hour. Launches take long enough to be interesting, can be hand flown without much issue, but not so long that you\u0027re dreading the time they take. It\u0027s absolutely standard in game simulators which are on the (more fun, less serious) end of the spectrum to make exactly that type of choice, as you get a better game out of it, with a far wider audience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s all a bunch of compromises necessary to produce a \u0022light\u0022 and fun game. It has never been supposed to be an ultra-realistic simulator, just something which doesn\u0027t deviate too horribly from real physics in general, and adheres to normal orbital mechanics. KSP does not need ultra-real re-entry heat, it would be a vastly worse product with that. All we need is acknowledgement that re-entry heat exists combined with limited consequences from it as long as providing those consequences doesn\u0027t cause serious problems for average players. Today\u0027s heat system is perfectly acceptable as a whole, maybe it could use some minor tuning, but that\u0027s all; it should absolutely not try to get even close to real re-entry heat problems.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"carlorizzante","CreatedById":144682,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T10:34:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temeter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Temeter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnd here I expected them to abandon KSP and concentrate on mobile games. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_rolleyes.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:rolleyes:\u0022\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope not!
