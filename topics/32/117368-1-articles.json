In particular, I couldn\u0027t watch it at 1.5x speed so it took longer than normal. Because of this, I spaced out during a few of the less interesting parts and may have missed something. I don\u0027t think I did, but it\u0027s possible.*\n\nEvery 10 minutes I drop a time stamp, so if you can find a spot in the video more easily. \u0022Something in quotes means it was directly said,\u0022 though I frequently don\u0027t bother with that. [brackets are those rare times where the accent barrier keeps me from understanding something], and *italics are descriptions of what Max is doing in the game, with asides and commentary by me where I feel the desire*.\n\n0:00\n\n*He\u0027s in orbit of Minmus, taking his readings for the contracts.*\n\n*He burns straight down. Not in map mode. He switches to map mode and his orbit is frickin\u0027 elliptical.*\n\n*He gets his reading, then burns up. He stays in map mode this time so doesn\u0027t freak his orbit out again.*\n\nThey are almost done remodelling the office.\n\nAndrea is the new Community Manager. Starts Monday.\n\nU5 work is almost done. They should have the build within reach \u0022very very shortly.\u0022\n\nPossibly release U5 as a standalone release before 1.1. Depends on how much impact on the game U5 has on its own.\n\n*He gets the final contract reading, and misses a mountain looming upon him.*\n\n*\u0022The most successful mission on Squadcast of all time.\u0022 (I agree with this. It may be the only successful mission of all time)*\n\nU5 update is very promising. No promises about performance updates until they have it in the hands of the testers.\n\n*He sets up a maneuver node to eject STRAIGHT UP, directly towards Kerbin, and then says \u0022[i\u0027m] trying to figure out the most ... efficient way to leave this orbit.\u0022*\n\n*He has plenty of fuel so it doesn\u0027t really matter that much, but still* ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*He opts to just burn enough to leave Minmus, then burn again at his Kerbin Apoapsis.*\n\n10:00\n\n*He opts for a 30km periapsis. He has a heat shield but took off some ablator.*\n\n*He does his signature move of warping through Kerbin, but only does it once* ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n*Re-entry is pretty uneventful, with just the solar panels hitting 50% heat. Nothing explodes.*\n\nIt\u0027s GregroxMun\u0027s birthday. Happy Birthday!\n\n20:00\n\nIf the U5 update comes out before 1.1, it\u0027ll be 1.0.something\n\n*He starts planning a Duna trip. He has no fairings, which makes him sad.*\n\n*He also has no docking ports. He misses that the Jr is in a 90 cost node.*\n\n*He plans for a Sun Science trip to get science to get docking ports for his Duna mission.*\n\nQ: What is Squad\u0027s policy post 1.0 of updates breaking save files?\n\nA: Precisely what it was before. They\u0027ll do their best but if it must be done they will do it without reservation.\n\n*He launches at 50% thrust and roughly 1.1TWR. I rip out roughly 1.1% of my hair watching it.*\n\n30:00\n\n*He boosts up until his Ap leaves Kerbin\u0027s SOI, follows it up, and gets his Sun science.*\n\nMax is on Windows 10 now, streaming fine.\n\n*He utilizes all his extra fuel to make his re-entry not so harrowing. He enters Kerbin\u0027s atmo with an Ap of about 2,000km*\n\nQ: 64 bit?\n\nA: 64 is something they\u0027re very curious about, now that they have an editor and an engine that is more accepting. Now (in Unity 4) it\u0027s dreadful.\n\n40:00\n\n*He\u0027s being a LOT more careful with his periapsis now than he was coming back from Minmus. He\u0027s worried about the science.*\n\nNo 64 bit for Mac. That\u0027s Unity.\n\nQ: New wheels?\n\nA: They\u0027re fantastic. They work like real wheels do now.\n\nQ: Will Kerbalcon be happening this year?\n\nA: Way too early to tell. We like to do it, but don\u0027t know. They want to do a physical one. \u0022But we\u0027ll see.\u0022\n\nU5 allows for physics multi-threading. On processor, not GPU.\n\nPhysics can be offloaded to other cores.\n\n*His \u0022Sweet sweet science\u0022 starts getting hot. He burns the last of his fuel to slow down, but it doesn\u0027t help.*\n\nSquad HQ is way too small to host a convention. They\u0027d have to rent a place. And it\u0027s way too early to worry about that. 1.1 comes first.\n\n*The heat dissipates, the ship slows down, and nothing blows up. Another successful mission.*\n\n*He again misses the Jrs in the 90 tier. I am willing him to check that node.*\n\n*Why is nobody in chat telling him?*\n\n50:00\n\n*FINALLY someone tells him. He still can\u0027t find them. He thinks the person is saying he has them already.*\n\n*HE FINDS IT. I put my computer - which I had picked up and was about to throw out my window - back down.*\n\n*With 10 minutes left he starts building his Duna ship.*\n\n*The ship gets bigger. And bigger. And bigger.*\n\n*And I\u0027m pretty sure he\u0027s blocking the door with a solar panel.*\n\n*Oh, and it\u0027s over 100 tons, so he can\u0027t even launch it* ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-01T02:31:55Z\u0022 title=\u002208/01/2015 02:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 1, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**"},{"CreatedByName":"genbrien","CreatedById":131978,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-01T02:31:37Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E U5 allows for physics multi-threading.
