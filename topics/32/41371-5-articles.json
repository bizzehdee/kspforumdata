Much was politics. The use of solid fuel was to keep factories running, factories that were also used to produce fuel for icbms. The oversized wings were to provide airforce with a 1000\u002Bkm cross-range ability, to overfly russia and return in a single orbit, a mission that never happened. The military version of shuttle was never built. Even the cargo bay was pitched as being able to \u0022bring something back\u0022, the idea being that they might retrieve a peace of enemy hardware (see project Azorian which was in the same cost league as a shuttle). The use of tiles, as opposed to an ablative shield, was supposed to facilitate turnaround but actually increased labour costs. For the last half of the program shuttle spent much of its time in orbit checking itself for damage, not getting things done.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire spaceplane concept, fly it home and send it again, was a financial boondoggle. That is why NASA is returning to one-use capsules. So despite the apparent logical advantages of reusable craft, designing space hardware to be recycled and/or reused is just not financially prudent.

Jettisoned stages are not considered recovered, just what you are actually \u0022piloting\u0022. So if all you return is the capsule with parachutes on it, that is ALL you get refunded for. Especially since it is such a tiny part of the rocket, I think a 90% return is resonable incentive. I understand that realistically, if you could reuse it, even landing it in the water just off the shore is going to lead to costs way above 10% of the original manufacture and certification costs of the capsule.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever if the capsule is \u00221000 kerbal bucks\u0022 and the entire rocket is \u0022One million Kerbal Bucks\u0022 and you get only 10% of the value returned for getting the capsule back to the KSC...there is just about no incentive at all to do it. At least if you got 900 KB back, it would give you some incentive. Or better yet you produce a ship design where you can return the entire CSM and land it nearby and maybe you returned 25,000 KB of your million KB rocket. Or you produce a shuttle design where you are landing 800,000KB of your million KB shuttle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
