Gilly on the other hand is more of an docking opperation, main problem is that you might end up doing an night landing and the overgrown poatoid is rotating so fast. \n\nQuestion is if using mechjeb for landing indication is considered with autopilot? If you land on an planet with atmosphere and is not interested in \u002B-50 meter accuracy or have rcs for corrections you can do the landing burn with lots less fuel. \n\nFor Gilly landings its also very useful, not that mechjeb messes up most of the time if you try to use autopilot for landing."},{"CreatedByName":"g.koster","CreatedById":115794,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T13:58:52Z","Content":"Some of these questions are a bid tricky, what do you call gravity assist, is starting a gravity turn and out of atmosphere ad 45 degrees qualify?

To my opinion you have to rendezvous first before you can do coupling. Some people most have been in agreement with me.\n\nRendezvous is getting two vessels close together in very similar orbits. Docking is physically connecting them together. Rendezvous almost always comes before docking, but docking can be done without rendezvous. Edit: An example would be the Apollo Moon landings. Each mission had two docking events but only one rendezvous.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-27T14:21:45Z\u0022 title=\u002202/27/2015 02:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Red Iron Crown**"},{"CreatedByName":"Wabbit","CreatedById":110502,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:14:58Z","Content":"I have learned rendezvous, docking, Mun/Minmus transfer, orbital maneuvers and aircraft flying before I knew what Mechjeb was ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Silver_Swift","CreatedById":123500,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-27T14:29:14Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Everything except rendezvous.
