Was counting down the days since they first announced the expansion last year. There were times when I could hardly wait. The acquisition by Take-Two did not dampen my enthusiasm. If anything, I was even more excited. Not because our game was now in the big leagues, but because a big league developer wouldn\u0027t buy the game unless they planned additional content down the road. Whether that was in the form of more expansions and general DLC, or the Holy Grail itself, KSP2. It was all good news to me. Then came the whole thing with the new EULA. I thought nothing of it at first. Who reads that crap anyway? And unless you end up like Kyle on South Park, it has no effect on your life anyway, so who cares? February was a brutal month for me at work and at home, so I haven\u0027t played at all in about 6 weeks. I\u0027ve barely even been able to stalk the forum, and haven\u0027t posted at all. I discovered this forum about a year ago, made an account, and have never logged off. It\u0027s been open on my phone ever since. I take a quick look and post several times each day, whenever the opportunity arises. I once logged off by accident when checking my notifications and had to reset my password. It had been so long I couldn\u0027t remember what it was. A week ago I went for a usual check, and found myself locked out. Like everyone else, I had to agree to a new, retroactive agreement. I was not happy. I don\u0027t care what it said; just that it forced me into a corner. Either agree or be frozen out of the forum for good. I did what everyone does pretty much every day of their life and chose the lesser of 2 evils.\u00A0 It left me bitter, but time would cure that. This coincided with the release of 1.4, so I thought that would be a good pick-me-up. Does anything get you geared up more than starting up Steam and seeing that KSP is updating? Always geeks me up. You can guess what happened next. I had to agree to a new, backdated agreement to play a game I already owned. After almost 3,000 hours, I had been locked out.\u00A0I was now incensed. I simply copied it to my \u0022KSP drive\u0022 (a 256g ssd that has nothing but various copies of KSP) and booted up anyway, but it did not make me feel better. In fact, I decided I would not buy the expansion after all. The way the whole thing was handled I felt deserved the only response available to me that would actually have an effect; withholding money. Reading the EULA threads lately have been eye-opening, to say the least. Each revelation made me more angry. Then, what usually happens on this forum happened yet again; cooler heads prevailed. The comments from veteran players really helped me to see the whole thing for what it is; a bunch of legal crap that doesn\u0027t mean anything. I\u0027m not trying to make money, I\u0027m trying to have fun. So I decided to embrace one of our great American sayings (and a personal favorite of mine), \u0022it is what it is\u0022. I want this game to live on. To continue to see new and better content. I want the people who work on this game to be successful, so they keep working hard. I\u0027ll keep a disdainful eye on Take-Two for the way this whole thing was handled, but I don\u0027t blame the guy who owns the gas station on the corner for an oil spill in the gulf. I did my part, ponied up my 15 bucks, and got the expansion. From this point on, I\u0027m just gonna pretend the whole thing never happened. And thanks to all the players who helped to bring some reason into some discussions that got pretty heated.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, back to the game itself.

These are 3 different modules (with a Stayputnik thrown on top to show what they immediately reminded me of). They seat 1, 2, and 3 Kerbals respectively, yet they are the same size (though different weights). I don\u0027t normally get into the \u0022art\u0022 conversations on the forum, but these things look like they came from the same factory as the old 2.5m decoupler. Just an opinion, but I\u0027m definitely not a fan. Not sure I\u0027ll get much use out of them. Though, to be fair, I haven\u0027t actually tried them yet. Just saw them and cringed.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022CL6kFqf.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/CL6kFqf.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis though, is something else entirely. I\u0027m not sure if this is purposeful, and if so what the purpose actually is, but it just seems wrong. Look at those numbers. You\u0027re talking about an engine that weighs less than a Nerv, with more than 5x the thrust, and still has over 400 isp? For an extra 600 bucks? I don\u0027t get it. I put one in orbit, and it\u0027s abilities are unbelievable. I\u0027ve never used a modded engine, but I imagine this is what they\u0027re like. It just seems too easy.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022DOq9Ju3.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 height=\u0022576\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/DOq9Ju3.png\u0022 width=\u00221024\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI through this together with no thought whatsoever. Just wanted to see how the new parts and sizes looked together. It\u0027s pricey, but for a ship with no attempt at design, it was remarkable. I launched and was able to capture at Moho (though not return). The most striking thing to me is the number of parts. It stands at 61 because I always strut everything manually. If I were not so opposed to autostrut, it would have fewer than 30 parts. I know performance is a problem for most computers, but I\u0027m not sure I see this as a positive. Upon reflection, I\u0027m not too happy with the new LEM either. It\u0027s certainly useful, and just 1 part, but I don\u0027t like the \u0022cookie cutter\u0022 aspect of it. One of best things about this game is the radical differences in design, from one player to the next.\u00A0 I would hate to anything dampen that aspect of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for the \u0022historical missions\u0022, I didn\u0027t finish the first one. I withhold judgment for now, and wait for other players to give their opinions before I decide if I wanna go through them all. The impression I got was they\u0027re \u0022tweener\u0022 missions. Probably too difficult for newer players who don\u0027t yet understand the game; and utterly without challenge or difficulty for an experienced player; meaning no real fun to be had. Could certainly be wrong, though. As I said, I bowed out quickly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mission builder I haven\u0027t tried yet. I think that could be the saving grace for the entire expansion; and certainly its biggest feature. I\u0027ll give it a whirl, but I\u0027m mostly waiting to see some missions some of our veteran players and modders come up with. I\u0027m eagerly anticipating some fun ahead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyway, those are my thoughts, if anyone\u0027s interested.
