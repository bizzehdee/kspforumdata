Now that massless batteries arent massless, its more challenging, but its the same basic idea, have enough batteries to allow you to do a full burn to wherever you need to go in one shot, and then have a few RTGs or solars to recharge you over the long term. Most of my ion craft (such as superlight fighters ect) utilize 1-3 tons of batteries to function, since you dont need a constant supply but just enough to do a burn, there is no reason to carry the super heavy generation equip when you still end up relying on batteries anyways.\n\nWhile i have found benefits of fuel cells over pure nukes, and that you do get way better dV, it is not worth it over a battery bank supplemented by some lightweight charging over a longer time (RTGs, even some micro solars will do).\n\nthe only place right now fuel cells make any sense is with resource converters (you can pull a net gain from them), or with earlier career and thats not because they are better then other options, its because you have no choice as RTGs are one of the last things you can unlock."},{"CreatedByName":"quantumpion","CreatedById":57602,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-06T19:10:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Solar panels don\u0027t change the Isp, they don\u0027t shed any mass.
