Even in the business world, the stage titles are flexible depending on a lot of things, like marketing dept deadlines (I\u0027m looking at you Oracle). I\u0027m almost certain that Squad will have faced pressures other than just getting the best product out of the door and I have a lot of sympathy for this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, there are other development lifecycle methods than the simple waterfall three tier model. There aren\u0027t any \u0027rules\u0027 for naming your release stages, it\u0027s just handy to use the labels so others know where things are at. However, they are often useful stages to go through for any kind of software development, if only as milestones to be shared with the interested community. Having these stages also helps to focus where the development effort is being applied. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, how does the release of KSP fit this model, because there\u0027s been a lot talk about Alpha v Beta v Production? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, we had a long Alpha stage, perhaps everything before 0.9. There was a lot of bugs that slowly got squished and a lot of missing or placeholder functionality. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen we had the short stage of 0.9 which was declared as Beta. Bit of an oddity this. There was additional functionality but not all of it, with some very major changes (aero etc) still to come but not too many bugs. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally we got 1.0. This has all the major functionality originally in scope with some bugs and major tweaking needed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe therefore got a typically top-light development. A very long Alpha, then a truncated and seemingly rushed Beta and Production. It got the product out of the door in a useable state and as Jeb might say, \u0022Any landing you walk away from is a good one\u0022. So all well and good. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I was to suggest how in an ideal world things might have been improved, I would have extended Beta with at least one more release, 0.95. I\u0027d have put all final functionality in that and then tweaked and bug-fixed it. Then released 1.0 a few weeks after that when the issues with the final functionality were ironed out. Because, as it is, the customers are testing and bug-finding the final release, which unfortunately is not uncommon in the business world either (I\u0027m looking really hard at you now Oracle).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T11:00:33Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 11:00  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"gogozerg","CreatedById":127301,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T10:55:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Foxster\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Foxster\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m almost certain that Squad will have faced pressures other than just getting the best product out of the door and I have a lot of sympathy for this. \u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s what I think too, and there are things we don\u0027t know.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, 1.0 is the real beta.
