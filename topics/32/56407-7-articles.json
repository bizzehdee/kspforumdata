Firstly, pretty much everyone has some story of a forgotten parachute, or antenna, or landing gear, or batteries, or solar panels, any of which can render a mission a complete failure. That doesn\u0027t make them bad, unfun features. Secondly, if you\u0027re afraid that people won\u0027t even know that drills and such exist, that\u0027s a reason to improve the ingame documentation, not to throw out the plans for the feature. By tomorrow we\u0027ll have an R\u0026amp;D center here we can review science reports and whatever else von Kerman wishes to tell us. We\u0027ll have more capable part tooltips and tweakables to let us know more about the parts we\u0027re using and how they work.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust the other day I was working on a ship, and moved some stuff around, and forgot to re-add the parachutes.

I take that to mean they are not spending any time right now thinking about it or developing it; in lieu of other items on the To Do list.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust conjecture, but if they decide it would benefit the contracts system, it could show up as a part of that in some way. Otherwise, I wouldn\u0027t count on hearing anything about mining until after the next round of changes (.24). It may not get revisited at all, which would be a shame by many people\u0027s opinion, but is a possibility since there are so many other things they need and want to work on also.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-22T22:36:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022DominusNovus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022DominusNovus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EBut nothing new about mining, one way or the other, which is what I was asking about.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESorry, Dominus.
