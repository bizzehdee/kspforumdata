A barbie weighs 7.25 oz. So, about $4,500 if you can convince Elon Musk to put it on his rocket. If he can land the booster then he claims he can cut costs by 100 so that theoretically brings the cost down to $45. The claim for the future is $10/lb which works out to $4.50 for the barbie.\n\nOf course, barbie is pretty thin and Jeb is sort of chunky but he looks shorter than barbie so maybe it\u0027s a wash?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T13:15:43Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 01:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Kelvin Kerbin**"},{"CreatedByName":"RainDreamer","CreatedById":129077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T13:21:19Z","Content":"We are going to need a kickstarter for this.\n\nAlthough, I think it would be better to have a scientific purpose behind it to justify such a price.

Try to convince the cubesat people to place him in the cubesat.\n\nYou can also just try to spread awareness to more young people about this game, and hopefully there will be someone inspired enough by it to put it in their science experiments. There has been a group of high school students that had their cubesat launched to space: [https://www.tjhsst.edu/students/activities/tj3sat/](https://www.tjhsst.edu/students/activities/tj3sat/).

But that\u0027s actually only about a third of the way to space... and not even *close* to orbit (which is being in space and travelling at about 17,000 mph horizontally).\n\nI think I\u0027ve got a pretty good claim on the highest altitude a model Kerbal has ever gotten above ground level, at 2,872 feet AGL. This model rocket carried [this model of Jeb](http://i.imgur.com/YNsbKxM.jpg) in the nosecone as a counterweight for the GoPro.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLj6hcMroNI?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nThis could easily be beaten by a good-quality weather balloon or by hitching a ride on a professional rocket, though. It\u0027s probably already been beaten, but I haven\u0027t seen any evidence of it yet... \n\nThe easiest way to get a Kerbal into space is to persuade an existing astronaut to take the guy up there. There are a certain number of lightweight \u0027personal belongings\u0027 that astronauts are allowed, and if we petitioned an astronaut to take up Jeb with the rest of his stuff, he or she might just do it. It would be quite inexpensive but it might require a little persuasion... are y\u0027all up for writing some letters? ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n-Upsilon"},{"CreatedByName":"Rath","CreatedById":138223,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T23:25:27Z","Content":"I go to a school with someone who has 16 high end sports cars so if I can get them to play..."},{"CreatedByName":"sgt_flyer","CreatedById":57690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T23:42:06Z","Content":"Well, if there\u0027s ever a small jebediah plushie, it might make it\u0027s way as the soyuz zero-G doll ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\n(They had an angry bird once as a zero-g doll ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif))"},{"CreatedByName":"liweih","CreatedById":62796,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T23:57:17Z","Content":"Maybe we just need to 3D print Jeb and kindly ask someone heading to ISS to bring it with him."},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T00:08:28Z","Content":"ISS has a 3D printer - they could print one off and you\u0027ve got Jeb in orbit for nothing more than the cost of the printing materials.\n\nIf you really want him to be in orbit *by himself* you\u0027d \u0022just\u0022 have to convince them to flush him out the airlock.\n\nI suspect that might be a bit difficult, though.\n\nEDIT: Alternatively, you could try to reproduce The Register\u0027s [LOHAN mission](http://www.theregister.co.uk/science/lohan/).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-16T00:11:41Z\u0022 title=\u002204/16/2015 12:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by AlexinTokyo**"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-16T13:10:52Z","Content":"Polystyrene bead bag type Jeb would be nice and light, though might want to let the pressure off gradually or it could expand and blow the seams.\n\nI have often wondered how close you could get to orbit with a rocket tied to a balloon and then fired off at 30\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 when in the stratosphere.
