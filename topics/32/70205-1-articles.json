However, you can plop down the $20 required for one month, get all the tools, all the sourcecode and documentation of the entire engine, and then immediately unsubscribe and never pay another cent while you continue developing your game on Unreal 4. This is fully intended, because \u003Cem\u003Ethe Unreal Engine is not monetized via a subscription\u003C/em\u003E. It is monetized via a 5% revenue share from games built on it. That means if you never release a game, then the $20 buy-in is all you pay for the engine, but if you do then you\u0027re obliged to honor the licensing agreement.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe subscription fee is for a fully optional community features access. While subscribed, you get access to professional tech support and tutorials, a developer community driven content database in which you can find and share royalty-free code and game assets, community forums/networks and of course direct access to every latest engine update. If you do not need this, then nobody forces you; but if you think \u0022that\u0027s awesome\u0022, then it\u0027s yours for $20 a month.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow contrast this model to the previous Unreal Engine licensing model where you were asked to pay six figures up-front, without knowing if you\u0027ll ever actually get to release anything. This, by the way, is likely one of the major reasons that KSP is in fact running on Unity - because back when Squad started doing it, Unity was the only prebuilt engine toolkit without a prohibitive barrier of entry. It\u0027s only now, after Unity\u0027s low barrier of entry has drawn in a veritable tsunami of indie developers, that the big triple-A players like Epic and Crytek are themselves dropping these barriers in favor of post-launch royalties models. This is a very good thing for the games industry as a whole, but unfortunately it comes a few years too late for KSP to be relevant. I mean, maybe if Felipe had had the choice he would have chosen a different engine toolkit than Unity... or maybe not.

I\u0027d hazard a guess that Unity will need to at the least offer Multi-Threading and GPU offloading considering other engines will be including some extremely advanced physics solutions down the line such as the soft body physics in the ongoing works for CryEngine 3.
