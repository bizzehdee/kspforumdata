OMG i hate Rotomax decouplers, an additional HOME3 habitat and 1Man return pod punched in orbit to add to my HOME3 habitat already on the Mun. Contract said wheels i thought bonus i can land it wheel it into position and dock the two together and blow the wheels off as they are mounted on radial decouplers. So i Retograde onto landing vector and suicide burn most of the dV needed for landed and decoupled the transfer stage from the bottom of the habitat module and a soft 500m landing from existing base - Sweet. Power up the wheel motors and.......... FAIL that Rotomax decoupler that dumped the transfer stage was the wrong way round its attached to the base Habitat module so my wheels are spinning uselessly in the air, i\u0027m going no where.\n\nThe silver lining at least this time i managed to open the solar panels so i didn\u0027t run out of electric on the way to the mun and blow past the orbit interception burn like attempt 1 - i\u0027m now 2 for 2 in failed attempts on this one contract and minus 400k odd.\n\nHate you Rotomax.\n\nEdit Bolded the Q, in amongst the spam and failure."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T12:58:34Z","Content":"Usually, once you have visited Mun and Minmus, it\u0027s either a Duna/Ike mission (with possible return) or you head to Eve/Gilly (oneway ticket only, sorry. The return ticket is reserved only for a few).\n\nBoth are relatively easy to reach once you understand interplanetary transfers - you can practice first by trying to go to Mun after visiting Minmus as that is a very similar transfer.\n\nedit: welcome to the forums! ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"yorshee","CreatedById":135011,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T12:59:46Z","Content":"It pretty much depends on whatever planet is soonest going to be aligned for an optimal transfer window.

Your decision. I would say Eve, because it\u0027s close by, easy to get to, and it has a big SOI. You can aerobrake, and you can learn about interplanetary transfers in the mean time.\n\nWhy Eve over Duna? Because of Duna\u0027s small SOI, small atmosphere, and Ike. It\u0027s small SOI makes it hard to \u0022hit\u0022, so to speak. It\u0027s atmosphere almost completely rules out aerocapture (not breaking). And Ike almost constantly gets in the way. But Eve is almost the complete opposite. It\u0027s easier to \u0022hit\u0022 in space, you can most certainly aerocapture, and Gilly is hard to get to because of its tiny SOI.\n\nUnless you mean landings, in which case, go for Duna.

Just slightly dip inside the atmesphere to get the science. At the same time, you\u0027ll be aerobraking for an orbital insertion so that you can send a kerballed expedition to Gilly. The requirements for visiting Eve aren\u0027t that different from Duna, so if you\u0027re OK with having multiple expeditions at once, go for it. Just make sure you\u0027re not aerobraking too deep into Eve, as that will surely make it a one-way trip."},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-06T18:27:39Z","Content":"Have a look at \u0027Exploring The System\u0027 in my signature - the PDF download version, appendix 2: Summary Of Mission deltaV, list the requirements to fly to and orbit each body, that plus landing or landing only (for when you\u0027re using a station/lander configuration).\n\nNote that the problems with Eve are the huge gravity (\u002B12,000m/s dV required to re-orbit) and the rarity of transfer-windows.

If it were an airless rock, your cost to orbit would be ~3,637.2 from 0m launch to 100km\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B2 orbit, using perfect instant transfers (it\u0027s not too hard to approach that sort of theoretical number in practice on airless rocks).\n\nAlso EVA packs are useful on rocks a lot bigger than Gilly; I used to train my kerbals by landing a ship on Minmus with them aboard... now I just EVA them down to the surface and back (when I don\u0027t have ISRU, that is. With something like Kethane or Karbonite, it\u0027s more convenient to land the whole ship and refuel). Heck, if you stationed a command pod on Dres, you could EVA them down, refuel at the pod unlimitedly, and return to orbit.. (EVA packs have upwards of 624m/s delta-v, depending on how much is wasted on turning)"}]}
