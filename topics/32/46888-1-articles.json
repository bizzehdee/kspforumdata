Personally, I think the anomalies actually probably exist in a sort of \u0022super-canonical\u0022 frame of the KSP universe where they don\u0027t have any serious bearing on actual in-game activities. After all, I don\u0027t think Squad is seriously suggesting that there is a race of elusive beings \u0022out there\u0022 planting curiously logoed monoliths and leaving cryptic messages all over the Kerbol system.
