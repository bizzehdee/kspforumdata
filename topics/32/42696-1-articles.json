Recently I had developed a series of lifters called the \u0022Titan\u0022 which has enough TWR and DeltaV to get 58 tons to LKO, however upon testing it I discovered that it could get the 58 tons up there with fuel to spare. Keeping this in mind I modified the design to add a set of landing legs and tested if that extra fuel was enough to perform a powered landing back on Kerbin, and sure enough it was!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever that lifter was 3 stages, 2 sets of 2 boosters, and a central stack. With that design only the central stack could come and land back at KSC, so that has inspired me to invest some time in developing and testing an SSTO lifter system that can get to orbit, drop off it\u0027s payload, and then land back at KSC fully intact. It will also have a docking port instead of decoupler so that it can be re-fueled and have a new payload set on top of it. (Sort of like a modular cargo system)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll be starting work on this tonight, and hopefully in the end I will come up with a completely reusable launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: On a side note having a reusable launch vehicle would be invaluable, especially with the whole \u0022budget\u0022 thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-16T03:44:28Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2013 03:44  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by CoriW\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T04:41:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot really \u0022missions\u0022 but more like random \u0022goals\u0022. For instance, tonight I am working on a single-launch-Apollo-style-to-Dres vehicle, and it is proving to be a bear of a problem to solve. The transfer stage, CSM, and DM are all built and ready, using proven techniques that I know work. Stacking them correctly and getting them to orbit is the issue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELast night I sent my Moho rover and Eeloo satellite on their way.

Seriously, we have no idea what recovery and funding will look like, and we\u0027re only starting to see how a tech tree will function. It\u0027s still a long way off and I\u0027m not going to try anticipating how it will actually play since the surprise of it is part of the discovery and joy of gaming.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"stupid_chris","CreatedById":62017,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T04:45:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45882-VERY-image-heavy-Jool-system-probing-mission%21-Part-2-refueling-the-probe-mission%21\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI have been\u003C/a\u003E.
