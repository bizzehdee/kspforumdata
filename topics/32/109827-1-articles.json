Before that, trying to find an intercept was either a whole lot of math or a whole lot of guesswork. I\u0027d get my ap or pe out to the right area, but if I got no intercept there was no indication for whether I was getting there too early or too late, so no way of knowing what kind of adjustment was needed.

A lot of my craft, especially in career, are built with very little margin for error as far as available dV goes, so I use them for getting the most optimal transfer or rendezvous I can. And as RIC said they are very useful for \u0022what if\u0022 analysis.\n\nIf I\u0027m just doing a simple transfer to Mun then I won\u0027t bother, but where I really like the use of multi nodes is if I\u0027m doing something like going to Mun and wanting to rendezvous with something on arrival. But unless you are very precise in following multiple nodes they can be more of a pain than they\u0027re worth, if you do one of them even a little bit off then you need to re-plot all the subsequent ones anyway, but they can be good for testing if what you want to do is possible and to give you a rough course projection to follow.\n\nI get a certain sick satisfaction out of being able to rendezvous without nodes but doing that is usually either more time consuming or more dV consuming so most of the time I will use nodes to rendezvous."},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:49:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Im curious to know, as I am looking more into flying IVA, how do you do this? How do you go on an interplanetary mission all from the pit, without using the map?\n\nI did an all IVA mission to the Mun once. I ran it first normally and took notes on speed, altitude, heading and burn times. Then when I ran it in IVA I basically just reproduced the same steps, and looked out the window of my mk1 pod to see when to make the Mun burn. When landing, I gave a quick look out the window to make sure my landing spot wasn\u0027t terrible, then set it down on navball and radar altimeter.\n\nInterplanetary though, with no map view and no mods to give extra information? That would be really damn hard. You could use something like [http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) to tell you exactly how much delta-V to use in your transfer burn, and then calculate how much fuel you need to use to achieve that. But if you don\u0027t burn at just the right time, you\u0027ll be off by enough to miss the intercept, but you\u0027ll have no way of knowing until you simply don\u0027t arrive."},{"CreatedByName":"problemecium","CreatedById":101649,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T19:59:51Z","Content":"Occasionally I stack maneuver nodes, but I find that the UI for them gets rather twitchy and the nodes themselves give unreliable predictions when more than maybe two are stacked, so I only stack them when I\u0027m uncertain how much dV I have left and want a rough estimate of how much I\u0027ll be needing.\n\nFor actual maneuvers, I only use one at a time and I don\u0027t fuss over executing it exactly as marked - since they\u0027re often so sensitive about timing, I find I can get better results if I just follow the general idea of the node (e.g. for an escape burn, aim below prograde for the first half and above for the second, etc.) and delete it when it\u0027s close to done so I can carefully watch what my orbit is doing."},{"CreatedByName":"Hotaru","CreatedById":135669,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T20:04:26Z","Content":"I pretty much always use maneuver nodes.
