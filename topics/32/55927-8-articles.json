I\u0027ll just add my 2 cents also. I certainly understand keeping the maximum total value of a tank relative to its volume and mass an unbreakable constant, otherwise it\u0027d allow for something approaching \u0022infinite fuel\u0022. I also understand the fact that a rocket fuel tank in reality contains two (or more) tanks; for the separate storage of fuel and oxidizer. Given that, its understandable that both separate values (for O2 and fuel) can be adjusted from the max each to zero each.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand that it would be cool if we could balance (a la \u0022stretchy\u0022 internal tanks) the O2 and fuel mix so that either the O2 could exceed its normal max if the fuel were adjusted down, or vice versa with the fuel/ O2. Or the extreme would simply be either both tanks filled with all fuel or all O2. This is simply a desire for the greatest flexibility for any particular (rocket) fuel tank.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThus I am pleased by the current implementation of tweak-able fuel tanks; yet I\u0027d not be disappointed if such ability were extended to \u0022balancing\u0022 the fuel/ oxidizer combination such that the tank remains filled to its capacity.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks to Squad, my fueled adapters and nose cones are now tweak-able. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E (Shameless plug: see my sig line.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
