To me it seems that most of the people who install Mechjeb and don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing if the first place never learn how to play the game manually. They never gain skill or practice when a program is flying for you, so I would recommend practice and watch more videos. I learned that you can burn towards the Mun when it rises over the horizon to get an intercept easy, and have mastered the maneuver node system through videos and testing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NeoMorph","CreatedById":58200,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-08T08:19:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ThatBum\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ThatBum\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ELol, when I first saw this I thought you meant attitude as in the direction a ship is pointing, rather than behavior.

It works okay if you\u0027re just docking a command pod by itself, but for anything more complex than that it tends to waste RCS fuel, constantly overcorrect itself (especially if your RCS isn\u0027t perfectly balanced and translation causes some rotation), occasionally try to shift axes way too fast and smash into things, creep toward the port way too slow, drift off the axis then panic and unnecessarily kill and restart forward inertia, etc etc.\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d love to use it for resupplying my station, as repeatedly docking at 3 frames per second gets very tedious, but I end up having to babysit it the whole time and often do the final approach myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHonestly, the docking camera mod makes docking much easier than MJ does.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs someone who now has only docked successfully 2 times out of hundreds of launches...i agree 100% docking cam has been much more helpful to dock.
