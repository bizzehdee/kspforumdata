Especially one that involves as many variables as space flight. And it can be very frustrating when you make no progress for what seems like forever when you first start out with such an intimidating task. But it\u0027s not impossible! Here\u0027s some helpful advice:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. When you build your rocket, keep in mind that any weight you don\u0027t need is just going to slow you down on the way to space. Set up any side tanks so you can drop them as they run out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Hook up fuel lines leading from any droppable side tanks to the central tank of your spacecraft. That way, you can drop the side tanks faster and lose more weight from your rocket faster too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Don\u0027t forget to add an ASAS module to your ship! It takes the tedious task of keeping your ship level over for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When launching, turn on ASAS (press T) and go full-throttle to start with. If you\u0027re not going up very fast doing that (or at all), you need bigger or more engines to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Slow down so your speed is roughly 90 to 100m/s and climbing very slowly around 1,000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6. Keep an eye on your speed: it should be around 140 to 160m/s at 6,000m and around 220 to 240m/s at 10,000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E7. At 10,000m increase the thrust to near-full and start slowly tilting your rocket towards the \u002290\u0022 mark on the navball (the small orb on the bottom of the screen). This should cause your rocket to tilt 45 degrees towards the horizon. Don\u0027t forget to re-enable ASAS once you\u0027re at the 90 mark!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E8. Bring up the map and call up the navball there too. You now want to track two things: your time to apoapsis (move the mouse over the AP marker to check this) and your rocket\u0027s position. Your goal here is to make sure that you keep pointing towards the yellow circle (prograde) and that your time to apoapsis stays between 55 seconds and 1 minute 15 seconds. This means a lot of disabling ASAS, adjusting position, and re-enabling ASAS, as well as gradually reducing thrust so you\u0027re not pushing ahead too far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E9. Once AP is 60,000m or so, gradually start easing back on your time to apoapsis. The idea is to get it down to around 0 to 15 seconds at 70,000 to 75,000. Shut off the engines if apoapsis reaches or exceeds 75,000.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E10. Once you reach apoapsis, turn back on the engines and thrust towards the yellow circle (it should be right on the horizon) hard and fast. Watch your map while you do this. When AP switches to PE, you\u0027re safely in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Hopefully something in there helps you out. Don\u0027t give up!
