It might be running in sandbox mode for now...or maybe career mode will be sandbox mode with R\u0026amp;D for now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEither way, it seems to me like missions aren\u0027t going to be like...like they\u0027re supposed to be dynamic to what you do. So basically if you fly a lot of missions to mun, maybe the game will just reward you for things you\u0027re doing there and give you other goals perhaps to encourage what you\u0027re doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know harvester said in a stream once that he didn\u0027t really want missions to be like super structured. Like having mission one be \u0022build a rocket\u0022 then mission two being \u0022get to orbit\u0022 and so on. Instead, it\u0027s supposed to be somewhat...or entirely based on what you like to do, I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut I imagine that the missions are quite a ways off if it\u0027s going to be all dynamic-like. Which I\u0027m totally okay with, I\u0027m more interested in new science bits and tech trees than missions and currency.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
