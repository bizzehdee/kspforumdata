(Based on a video of TB that I got me thinking) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI jumped into the game on 0.15 if I remember correctly, and on my first maybe 6 months of playing and updating, I used to get very exited about every update, and I played it every day, at least 2 hours, and on weekends a lot more\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut now, after all this time, (more than 1 year) I play KSP once every month \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I still enjoy it, and I still believe this is a great game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 But I just cant play it like I used to, because I played it a lot back on the days\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I thought career mode will have a positive effect on me, and will make me want to play more.. but It did not \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing that has kept me away from KSP, is its performance\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 at 0.15 I thought\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 well this is Alpha, they will fix this stupid-game-braking lag\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but after a year I realized .. Maybe they CANT fix this lag. And I won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t detail why is it that they can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t fix the lag. But its around and a known fact that Unity sucks for KSP. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDon\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get me wrong, they have improved performance a lot since 0.15, but I will never be able to build my crazy 5k part mother ship and play with it..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo now, I keep an eye on updates, and considered myself a fan of KSP, its just that now Im down to earth, and instead of hoping for It to be the game that I want it to be\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I just watch as the developers take it on its path.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe 3 years from we will have KSP 1.0 with multilayer\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and maybe they Even change the engine, and make it possible to build crazy big crafts, or on the other hand, having a part cap, so you could always have a constant FPS\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 (having that type of FPS drops on a \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Cfinished game\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 will be just BAD) .. even then .. will I come back to play a 5 year old game? Probably not..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo basically, getting early access to a game its not always a good thing\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 We can support the devs, we can suggest things and have the hope that they may be implemented\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but if you ask me \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 I would rather have a fully develop and functional KSP to play like a mad man until I totally exhaust my KSP enjoyment , instead of exhausting it with so many frustrations because of the alpha state on the way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow the game is on STEAM early access, more people play it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 and will exhaust it before its 1.0, so when 1.0 with multiplayer comes, a big chunk of the community will already be gone. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t regret helping KSP on its early days, If we had not support them, they will not be here , and maybe there would not be KSP at all\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 but I do feel a bit of sorrow knowing that the game keeps getting better.. but I just don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t enjoy it anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Giggleplex777","CreatedById":29829,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-04T00:19:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E5 years isn\u0027t that long.

The great thing about KSP is there is so much fun you can have just within Kerbin\u0027s SOI. I\u0027ve barely scratched the surface of what I can do in this game. I\u0027ve only made one major mission to Duna and on partial failure mission to Laythe in an old save file leaving Jeb stranded on the moon after I discovered that even the 2nd lander I sent didn\u0027t have enough oomph to get back into orbit.

However, mods like Kethane and RemoteTech2 add a level to the game that it otherwise not there.
