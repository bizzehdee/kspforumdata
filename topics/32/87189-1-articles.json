I realise that fast forwarding a few years between missions each time might get a bit boring, but I\u0027d like to know if anyone else rp\u0027s this sort of delay between missions? I\u0027m thinking of having different types of delays to simulate design / build times such as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erocket design time: simulated time for designing a new launch vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erocket build time: simulated time for building a new launch vehicle\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epayload design time: as above except for payload\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epayload build time: as above except for payload\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I was using the same launch vehicle on consecutive missions I wouldn\u0027t need the design time the second time around and likewise for the paylod, BUT I\u0027d still need the build time for launch vehicle (not for the payload if it was recovered... refitting time maybe?) Also should design and build times for each component run concurrently?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m thinking that simulating timeframes as above would make catching launch windows that much more important. Anyone else simulate this sort of thing and if so what timeframes do you use?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPH\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Grape","CreatedById":101113,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T15:57:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECheck this mod out:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-0-24-2-Kerbal-Construction-Time-Release-v1-0-2-%289-3-14%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92377-0-24-2-Kerbal-Construction-Time-Release-v1-0-2-%289-3-14%29\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metl","CreatedById":82406,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T16:04:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a mod for that, but it isn\u0027t updated to the latest version of KSP yet.
