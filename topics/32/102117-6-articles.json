On several occasions I\u0027ve had to *leave the game* to google how some of the GUI worked. That\u0027s not the sign of a good GUI. For example, I didn\u0027t understand how some of the contract requirements worked, and couldn\u0027t figure out why I wasn\u0027t completing missions. Some terminology is foreign and never explained, like suborbital vs height requirements in the contracts. Again, I had to google it to find an explanation.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Science. What the heck is it? Where do I get it? Science painfully trickled in until - after googling (again) - I discovered you could do other things to gain science, like right clicking the command pod and selecting \u0027Crew Report\u0027. Who knew? Not me!\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Tooltips. If I hover over a button with my mouse, like SAS, I\u0027d \\*love\\* if a tooltip could appear that would show you a little explanation of what it does, and maybe its hotkey. SAS? What the heck is SAS? Oh, it\u0027s stability assist, and I can turn it on and off with \u0027T\u0027. It\u0027d be really helpful if that was in the game, instead of having to search google for these things.\n\u003E \n\u003E \\* Automatic hints could go a long way to help teach players. For example, the first time the player attaches a jet engine, why not have a little popup to tell them that Jet engines will require the addition of \u0027air intake\u0027 parts to function?\n\u003E \n\u003E KSP has a really big learning curve, and that\u0027s ok - but players need to be given tools and help to scale that mountain.

I mean, look at all the content that a game like GTA V has continually added to their game post-release in a non-paid DLC fashion.

GTA DLC is story based, not feature based. *EDIT: GTA did add multiplayer post release, though it was meant for release.*  I\u0027d wager, the amount of actual feature updates post 1.0 is quite low. Exceptions I can think of being XCOM and Civilization 5.

Gone are the days of cartridges with the code burned into them, and floppy discs with the game-critical v1.1 patch riding on them. Since patches, new content and bug-fixes are all of an equal friction for deployment, and a deadline is present, you have to make sure all the \u0022required\u0022 features as present.

Impotant.** *All* craft are affected by the current placeholder system, to the point where intuitive designs suffer. A reviewer, who has no gameplay experience and possibly no science or engineering background, is confident that a pointy rocket with a nosecone and fins is the way to go, and s/he needs to be right.\n\n**2) BUG FIXING. Impotant.** The big ones, and what you can\u0027t push off to U5. The docking ports failing, Kerbals getting rigor mortis, bad memory stuff.\n\n**3) BALANCING AND TECH TREE. Impotant.** It doesn\u0027t have to be mirror-polish, but it does have to make sense, and every part needs to have its dis/advantage. Aero will strongly affect this.\n\n**4) TURORIALS. Impotant.** Engineer\u0027s Report may display your craft\u0027s dV, but Joe Schmoe on the street is *not* getting to orbit without some basic theory about orbital mechanics and staging.\n\n**5) ENGINEER\u0027S REPORT. Less Impotant.** We advanced players complain about this, but as long as you at least have a pod, a tank, an engine, a chute, a decoupler, and a basic grasp of staging, you can at least play the game. dV can come later. Hard to evaluate this, as we have yet to see how you plan on implementing it.\n\n**6) RE-ENTRY HEATING. Less Impotant.** Depends on how closely it is tied to the greater aerodynamics feature. Everybody knows that spaceships burn up if they come in too fast, but that\u0027s pretty much the extent of the layman\u0027s knowledge. I say we can get away with handwaving \u0022our materials are really good; you don\u0027t need to worry about it right now\u0022 like we\u0027re doing now.\n\n**7) WARP-TO. Not Impotant.** Would be nice to have, but nothing more.\n\n**8) LIFE SUPPORT. Not Impotant.** Will add all kinds of interesting game mechanic limitations, but from a gameplay perspective it\u0027s just another resource/payload we HAVE to carry. I\u0027m not even sure it\u0027s an already-planned 1.0 feature; if it\u0027s not, ignore.\n\n**9) ISRU. Not. Impotant.** opens up gameplay opportinities, but the gameplay difference between \u0022send extra fuel to X, re-fuel Y\u0022 \u0022send a miner to X, collect fuel, re-fuel Y,\u0022 and \u0022send extra fuel along with Y\u0022 is not actually that big. Just a matter of mission complexity, and more/less/different payload to carry.\n\n**10) \\*\\*\\*FEMALE KERBALS\\*\\*\\*. Very, VERY Impotant.** There, I said it. This has ZERO gameplay impact. But it DOES have a PR and marketing one. You\u0027ve already committed to having this, and the public that doesn\u0027t even *play* the game is going to hold you to it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T15:56:09Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 03:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by pincushionman**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T15:55:57Z","Content":"I have three priorities for 1.0:\n\n1.

I don\u0027t mean any disrespect to SQUAD, and I\u0027m really fine with the fact that new updates aren\u0027t quite as stable initially, and may require patches and hotfixes.\n\nHowever, when 1.0 comes out, everyone will expect it to be stable.

While SQUAD thought they squashed it, it just appeared in a different form.\n- Kerbals falling off External Command Seats and being considered debris has been a thing ever since command seats were *introduced*, back in 0.20.\n- There have been significant problems with docking ports not docking or undocking that have persisted for several versions.\n- The Claw has introduced a number of game-breaking bugs that have yet to be fixed.\n- You often can\u0027t set up maneuver nodes whilst on hyperbolic paths, which has persisted since maneuver nodes were introduced.\n- Craft occasionally \u0022collide with buildings\u0022 several kilometers away from the KSC; this has been a rare but known issue for several versions, and it hasn\u0027t yet been fixed.\n- Occasionally, the VAB/SPH won\u0027t allow you to click on the buttons in the top right, so you can\u0027t launch or really do anything else.\n- Kerbals climbing ladders still generates a phantom force, as it has since ladders were introduced.\n- Many people have trouble even loading the game, for various reasons caused by bugs.\n\n**...and there are many,** ***many*** **more significant issues with the game as it is now, that haven\u0027t ever been addressed.**\n\nSo, what should be done about this?\n\n**I would say that if KSP 1.0** ***absolutely needs*****:**\n\n- Immense amounts of bug-squashing. As mentioned above.\n- Retexturing parts. The parts in KSP are of a variety of different quality levels, and they often don\u0027t \u0022work\u0022 together aesthetically. This should definitely be fixed before 1.0, and it adds no bugs.\n- Rebalancing parts. Some parts are ridiculously overpowered, while others quite underpowered. This does need to be fixed, and it shouldn\u0027t add any bugs either.\n- Renaming parts. The descriptions of the new wing bits, for example, are placeholders. This should probably be fixed before 1.0.\n- An aerodynamics overhaul. As worried as I am about this introducing new bugs, it most certainly needs to be done before the game can be considered finished.\n- A water overhaul. Water in KSP is currently really ugly and more dangerous to land on than terra firma. Changing the water might introduce new bugs, but it wouldn\u0027t be that difficult to handle (I think).\n- A sound overhaul. The sound in KSP isn\u0027t all that great, and it could easily be made better, from rocket noises to music to that really nasty bird-chirping noise while you\u0027re viewing the space center.\n- A visual overhaul. KSP isn\u0027t a bad-looking game, but it would look even better with improved rocket flames, clouds, different ground textures for different biomes, and the like. Just as long as it\u0027s not too hard on your CPU.\n- Keep the female Kerbals! It\u0027s good to make people of both genders feel empowered and welcome.\n- Update tutorials. It\u0027s not that difficult to do, and the current tutorials seem limited and often have grammatical errors.\n- Maybe other stuff. I wouldn\u0027t do it if I were you though. No ISRU, *please*. It\u0027s really not needed, it\u0027s buggy, and it distracts y\u0027all from more important stuff.\n\nYou can add other stuff, but I personally wouldn\u0027t. There\u0027s no real reason to, in my opinion. It\u0027s better to have a strong foundation going into 1.0 than it is to build a bunch of fancy stuff onto a weak base. \n\nAnd that\u0027s my two cents.\n\n**By the way, thank you for seeking our opinions on this matter! I really appreciate that you\u0027re trying to make a connection with us and seeing what we want.**\n\n-Upsilon\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-17T16:11:33Z\u0022 title=\u002203/17/2015 04:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by UpsilonAerospace**"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T16:10:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I don\u0027t want 1.0 to be buggy. \n\u003E Like, it\u0027s possibly the most important thing that SQUAD has to improve, IMO.\n\u003E \n\u003E Every time an update to KSP comes out, in general, it\u0027s buggy.
