Like.. we had USA flag on moon or whatever... I can imagine that Kerbin as a planet can be a one huge state, confederation or something like that, so there wouldnt be 200\u002B different states, only regions with regional goverment, just basicaly system you have in US or in west EU, which can work obviously well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat would such flag looks like then? Stars and stripes representating regions/states , green or different? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat do you think?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: Because one does not simply use KSP default flag, since its dull to put such a flag anywhere. Imagine that first flag on moon would be flag of NASA with \u0022US space program\u0022 title.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"irichey25","CreatedById":66851,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-26T07:29:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, Kerbin as of right now doesn\u0027t really have any states or regions.
