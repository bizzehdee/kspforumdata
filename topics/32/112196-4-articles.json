But proper representation of space flight should win over making anything doable. Things like ion engine landers should be notable because they work in spite of how hard it would be.\n\u003E \n\u003E That said, I wouldn\u0027t mind them being given an atmospheric thrust of 0.2, or 0.5. They\u0027d still be almost useless in atmosphere, but people did manage to make things which could fly with ion engines before the 23.5 thrust boost.\n\nThough I support KSP willingness to expose players to various real tech concepts with a \u0022game first, realism close second\u0022 approach, I actually like the new atmo thrust curves for different engines, and ions especially. It\u0027s a nod to reality that they are useless in atmosphere now, while preserving their usefulness in game terms for space probes. KSP players still learn, proportionally speaking, that Ion drives are low thrust and high ISP. I\u0027d support taking their thrust down to nearly realistic levels, if Squad were to face the programming challenge of thrust on rails in timewarp. But I\u0027d have (additional) mental troubles with going all the way to reality, in the Stock game. 10 years of timewarp for one burn would start pushing my \u0022Are we there yet?\u0022 gameplay button.\nThanks Nova, for sharing your original design intent.

As you add more and more and more and more engines, you only can ever achieve the thrust to weight ratio of a single, unladen engine. Which, if your engine has peanuts for TWR already (like an ion engine) means you can never get very high acceleration from a low-thrust engine, no matter how many you put on. The thing is, KSP\u0027s ion engine has a very very high TWR, which means, in the context of the game, you CAN stack them to get fairly high acceleration."},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T18:18:11Z","Content":"It\u0027s the charge, you can only ionize xenon so much.

It doesn\u0027t apply to something like KSP, which sticks to present-day or near-future technology--technology that is decidedly un-magical to someone who understands the engineering behind it. \n\nIn my mind there\u0027s three levels of science-fictional technology. One is technology is *known to be possible*, the next is technology *not definitively proven to be impossible*, and the last is technology that is *impossible as we currently understand it*. Some (be honest, most) science fiction uses all three, some uses only the first two, but KSP as it stands now uses only the first: technology that has either already been used (most of it), or is within one technological generation of being used (Rapiers, NTRs, etc.). As soon as we start allowing \u0022indistinguishable from magic\u0022 sci-fi handwaving, we might as well add in warp drives, anti-gravity, and teleportation to go along with our high-thrust ion engines.\n\nOne thing I like about KSP is using things for other than their intended purpose. If an ion lander is possible within the rules of the stock game, we *should* build it even if that\u0027s not what the ion engines were meant to do. But I won\u0027t shed any tears to see it get \u0022broken\u0022 in the name of realism, because in real life, using an ion engine to land on anything bigger than a very, very small asteroid is--if not *impossible*--at least not *known to be possible.* \n\nAs far as the actual engine goes--would reducing its unladen TWR help? Reduce its thrust a bit, and/or make it a little heavier. Maybe increase its Isp a little to make up for it. Not a dramatic change, but just enough to make a TWR \u003E 1 impossible anywhere except perhaps Gilly, Bop, or Pol."},{"CreatedByName":"Falconer","CreatedById":119245,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-08T23:41:47Z","Content":"Gotta agree with most... while cute the ion landers don\u0027t really fit in the game well.

Yes they only work in atmospheres... but they work in non-oxidized atmospheres as well as oxidized ones. So far the atmopheric parts really only involve Kerbin and Leythe...

Who\u0027s to say what is impossible in the Kerbal-verse?\n\nFor multiple reasons, it\u0027s a simulation. For instance many of KSP\u0027s \u0022game\u0022 shortcomings have been replaced with more realistic physics. Take the ISP inversion. For years engines maintained constant thrust, with fuel flow changing with atmo pressure. Many called that a compromise for \u0022game\u0022 over simulation to make launches more consistent in different atmospheres. In reality it seems that whomever wrote the original code simply did not understand ISP. So now with 1.0 it has been \u0022fixed\u0022 and replaced with more realistic physics. If KSP was only a \u0022game\u0022 there would be no reason to fix such errors, or at least not replace them with more realistic physics. Therefore KSP is something more than a game.\n\n\u0022It\u0027s only a game\u0022 is the battle cry for those who once said \u0022It\u0027s still alpha\u0022. Virtually any argument can be dismissed with \u0022It\u0027s a game\u0022 because it places the whims of the devs above any and all other opinions. It means that the devs can do no wrong because KSP has no basis in the real world whatsoever. Such arguments boarder on fanboyism. I have some respect for the Devs, not total adoration, but enough to deffer to them on how to define KSP. And they have for years stated repeatedly and consistently that KSP is no mere game, that \u0022simulation\u0022 really is its defining trait.\n\n[![XT5YGF2.png](http://i.imgur.com/XT5YGF2.png)](http://imgur.com/XT5YGF2)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-09T08:21:21Z\u0022 title=\u002206/09/2015 08:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Sandworm**"},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-09T08:41:57Z","Content":"Foxster is right that the game has many hand-waves and concessions to gameplay.
