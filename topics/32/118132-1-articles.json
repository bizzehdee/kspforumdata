After failing twice to recover Jeb from his crashed Munar lander, I moved house and got out of orbit with KSP. Started playing a few classics in the interim: SimCity 4, Cosmonautica, and then got completed addicted to Mount and Blade: Warband. After defeating Calradia, and the excitement with New Horizons in real life, my head is back in the stars.

I\u0027m sure you can guess I like sandbox games, and this is kind of the ultimate sandbox.
