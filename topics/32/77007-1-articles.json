After sending a craft in orbit and have reduced its holding in one piece, the two students studying science are conquered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022It\u0027s more educational than paper,\u0022 laughs while Adrien capsule parachute deploys. Both teens come to try to Kerbal Space Program. This simulator rocket is still in development but has already received honors from NASA. The U.S. space agency has participated in the creation of a mission pack for the game Squad A study by the Mexican game publisher shows that about 7% of players are hard for people from near and far to the aerospace sector.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth students also see it as a way to vary the experiments in progress. \u0022The coup shooting a ball falling and analyze its speed by comparing its position frame by frame, it does every year,\u0022 says Adrian. \u0022And then, in general, physics is that calculations, at least there is concrete,\u0022 adds Nicolas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe realism of this game is very thorough. \u0022We have never compromised, we only simplified some rules,\u0022 says Felipe Falanghe, the creator of the game For example, in Kerbal Space Program, spaceships are subject to only one gravitational force to times. Felipe Falanghe is passionate about space exploration. \u0022When I was younger, I attached little green characters, Kerbals in fireworks and that\u0027s how it all began. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerson in the development team has made \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9Kerbal astrophysics studies. \u0022We had to learn everything ourselves,\u0022 says the designer. It\u0027s a bit what is required by the game\u0027s fans. They are obliged to know the basics mechanical orbitals in order to achieve the goal they have set. \u0022When we started to complicate the game, it was a real challenge, remembers Felipe Falanghe. And soon people began to learn about themselves in order to continue playing. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe physical model that Felipe Falanghe created for Kerbal inspired some teachers, including Santeri Koivisto. The Finn is a former teacher who left his job to set up his business: Teacher Gaming. The purpose of this company is to adapt existing video games to make them educational.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHis first adaptation involved Minecraft, a construction game \u0022sandbox\u0022 which he developed the cooperative mode to suit the classroom. With Kerbal Space Program, he tackles a project larger. For now, Kerbal EDU is still developing and is very close to the \u0022classic\u0022 version of Kerbal, but some features are very promising. A flight recorder has already been implemented. It allows to extract the variations of a large number of physical parameters for operation in progress.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother feature allows to compare directly the results of a specific equation and the data collected by the flight recorder. \u0022Ultimately, there will be an option to play in a more realistic solar system,\u0022 says Santeri Koivisto. It is true that if the physical size of the game is very close to reality, the universe is not. Kerbin, the equivalent of the Earth has two moons, and Minmus Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESales figures remain secret but at least 40,000 people play EVERY day Kerbal Space Program. Felipe Falanghe, thanks to its quirky universe that the game is so successful. At Squad, nothing is sacrificed to the playfulness. \u0022Whenever we introduce a new part or a new feature, we think of a fun feature before thinking about realism,\u0022 says Felipe Falanghe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Traditional educational games are not fun\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf Santeri Koivisto of Teacher Gaming wants a little more realism, it considers that the fun part of Kerbal based on the tone adopted by the creator. \u0022We work with professionals in the gaming industry because traditional educational games are not fun. These are not really games, they are not made \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9by gamers, \u0022says former Finnish teacher.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn France, when it comes to educational game, we immediately think of the Adibou series. Pierre-Yves Martin is a designer of educational games but in the form of game, is also a former professor of science, and to him, this license is a typical example of bad game \u0022This is a game that works as a question / answer, like a holiday scrapbook. The problem is that it returns to practice knowledge that we have already, \u0022he says before recognizing a good point. \u0022Adibou worked well because he spoke directly to parents. It did not look like a game and did not suffer from the negative image attached to them. \u0022For this former professor of physics and chemistry, a good educational game ludo advance masked. \u0022If we said from the beginning that we will learn what is no longer a game Or, the school is a game\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen he discovers Kerbal Space Program, he is pleasantly surprised. \u0022There are all aspects of a game, it\u0027s fun, it\u0027s a simulation done well, he analysis. The educational aspects are also present, there is much information available. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESanteri Koivisto adapted Kerbal Space Program thinking this game as an experimental environment, a tool to check some physical laws. \u0022Ideally, the teacher would begin by explaining the second law of Newton and ask his students to check through features Kerbal Space Program. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInduction deduction against\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis teaching approach raises a pedagogical debate between the proponents of induction and deduction of those. The idea of \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9Santeri Koivisto is more in line with the first. In fact, the inductive method starts with physical neglect some parameters to focus on one. In deduction, we take a simpler system to control all the variables.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn deductive teaching, \u0022the French\u0022 Kerbal Space Program is too complex for high school students and caters more to students preparing or engineering school. \u0022People who have decided to make science and who have chosen to be there, says Pierre-Yves Martin. A game like this is more for good students, who will try those who are going to want to succeed. \u0022He dares estimate ladle:\u0022 30% of people will not see it as a game, 30% will be paralyzed by the mass of information to be taken into account and 40% will have fun. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen the preferred method is induction, as in Finland, the required level drops. This is why Santeri Koivisto was able to test the educational mode Kerbal Space Program with students aged 9 years. They focus only on a given and do not need to control all the mechanical orbitals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPierre-Yves Martin also sees an application Kerbal a view of emergent science to primary students. \u0022In a workshop awakening, do not fix educational goal, he thinks. Ideally, we must let students play for an hour and tailor the course following their feelings. \u0022In this case, the instruction that follows can all relate to the issue of balance weight / power required for a rocket schoolyard as the means for moving around a modeled three-dimensional object.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn illustration of the game Kerbal Space Program An illustration of the game Kerbal Space Program | Screenshot / LeMonde.fr\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInductive or deductive method, Nicolas and Adrian, both high school students do not think about too. What they see is the challenge. \u0022When you play a game like this, you want to be the first to make his rocket into orbit, says Nicolas. Be competitive, it stimulates. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPierre-Yves Martin summed up their feelings in relation to the learning mode would Kerbal: \u0022The important thing in an edutainment game is that the purpose is fun, the way should not be. Reasoning that has developed is even still stronger. We remember all his life. \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-08T21:17:16Z\u0022 title=\u002207/08/2014 09:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 8, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by gosnold\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eclarify translation\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-08T19:11:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHa ha!
