I think this is more important now more than ever. This is a thread to give a virtual hug/high-five or whatever to the devs/CM\u0027s. Lets just show some appreciation for the developers and managers of this game we have fallen in love with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy example: Devs and CM\u0027s you guys are the best. I have been part of a few other early alpha build games and NONE of them have shown the receptiveness, kindness and overall compassion to their fan base like you have. To the CM\u0027s, despite the hate you guys most likely have received, and i\u0027m in no position to understand what that\u0027s like, you have kept this forum the neatest, cleanest and family friendly forum i have ever come to be involved in. This game has brought me hours upon hours of entertainment and the forums have been the greatest community environment I\u0027ve ever seen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBest regards and heartfelt appreciations\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Flyer10254\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T23:44:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s best that people just \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/7284-Thanks-KSP-team-%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eadd to this thread \u003C/a\u003Einstead of making loads of new ones to be honest.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flyer10254","CreatedById":47839,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T00:28:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh, will do, thanks. please close.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OdinYggd","CreatedById":26917,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T00:54:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EClosed by request.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
