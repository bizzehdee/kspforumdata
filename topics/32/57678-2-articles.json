If I had started with the amount of parts that are thrown in front of people in sandbox, I would\u0027ve been lost and probably not given this game a second look. Career mode not only fixes this issue by letting players discover parts a few at a time, but it also adds a gameplay element, most of which we haven\u0027t seen yet. I\u0027m referring to the contracts, reputation and money that have been planned for 0.24. You say this sort of thing (and I assume game modes like multiplayer) are \u0022non-essential\u0022, which may be true for someone with your personal preferences but it\u0027s definitely not true for the game as a whole. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany people like multiplayer and have requested it for a long time. Apparently, the devs liked multiplayer as well and they made the decision to go for it. The announcement for that came at the same time they announced that resources had been \u0022idefinitely shelved\u0022 which may make it appear that one replaced the other but if you read between the lines that simply isn\u0027t true: they tried resources, they put a lot of work into it, and they found that it wasn\u0027t fun to do and that it didn\u0027t fit in well with the rest of the game. Given the original timeframes to implement resources I\u0027d say we\u0027re looking at about 6-9 months ago when they realised this. Multiplayer however was only recently proven possible, and I know for a fact that things went fast from there on out. The two are not simultanious developments and are not linked to eachother. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou quote the devs saying that new celestial bodies are \u0022not needed\u0022, but I\u0027d like a source on that quote. To the best of my knowledge there will still be new celestial bodies but only after they\u0027ve finished most of the work on career mode. You also confuse what \u0022is needed\u0022 with what \u0022we want\u0022, which are two very different things. A developer can\u0027t always focus on what people want because then gameplay mechanics would never mature and players would be left with an astonishing amount of content that really doesn\u0027t work too well. You also seem to suggest that you know what \u0022we want\u0022 and the developers don\u0027t, which is quite a bold statement. Squad isn\u0027t not adding a planet because they can\u0027t, but because they choose not to.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the polls on the forums, anyone with a basic understanding in statistics will tell you that the results on those polls are highly skewed: people who want to see things change are far more likely to read the threads and to vote on the polls. The forum community is made up of only a small part of KSP\u0027s players, and is likely very different in composition from the whole population. I understand why people make those polls, and that some people are disappointed with the harsh reality that it\u0027s not them designing KSP but the developers, but they\u0027re in no way representative of what the average KSP player thinks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConcluding, I think your last sentences show the real intent of this post: \u0022I love KSP but I hate where it is going since hearing of the devs\u0027 plans at kerbalkon\u0022. You\u0027re trying to voice your discontent. Which is of course your right, but do consider that your opinion will differ from a lot of people, and that misrepresenting facts won\u0027t help with the credibility of your complaint.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for minecraft vs KSP, I agree with the people who pointed out that where Minecraft started catering to the wishes of the community, KSP doesn\u0027t.

A developer I know made a valid point a long time ago, the community may think it knows what it wants, but if they got it they would be unhappy with the results. Basically he was getting at was stating is that no matter what a developer does there will always be a percentage of people who will find a reason to complain.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond just stop playing for awhile. Sometimes the best way to look at a game you feel is going the wrong way, or you might not be enjoying anymore is to take a break from it for awhile. Let a couple of patches go by before you start back up again. Who knows you might actually enjoy the content once you have not been playing it as much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThird install a mod that gives you what you want already. This sounds odd to say but some games actually have things built after a mod has become popular, it is usually a MMO thing but I am starting to hear of it more and more in single player games as well. With a game that gives players to customize their experience to what they want to have is actually one of the best features I feel this games offers. It is at just the right difficulty for new players to learn at without much to worry about, yet can be modded to make the game more challenging as they feel the need.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo me I feel more optimization of the current game is needed, this will get more players who might not have gaming platform computers. While more bodies would be a great thing to add down the road, right now it is a good balance to fine tune what is here before adding in more. It is better to have a strong base to add small changes to later as it makes it easier than having a hug base with flaws that all have to be fixed at once when something goes bad. From what I have seen so far, before buying the game myself, this appears to be the path that SQUAD has taken, and as the community grows it will become harder for them to listen to them as they will be getting a few good ideas and some zany ones as well (Like my want for intergalactic travel I know it will never be but it would be fun to me). After watching the chat from Kerbalkon I have to say they have more patience by far than I would for the way this community has been acting, lots of demands and very little thanks from the vast majority. Not to mention with the holidays going on right now you are not going to be getting much from them as they have families that I am sure they would like to send time with just as much as anyone else.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETake this how you want, I am just offering up what I have seen so far and when I get tired of playing I will stop and wait a few patches to see what has changed.
