There was also an Ike exploration offer, so I accepted both. I didn\u0027t really know if I could do both missions in one go, because I wasn\u0027t sure if my probe lander had enough fuel for the job. However, when I arrived in the Vicinity of Duna, I noticed that right after my aerobraking maneuver, my orbit was just enough to get me into encounter with Ike. It was such that I didn\u0027t have to expend a lot of propellant to do all the maneuvers, so I managed to land on Ike, notch up a contract completion, then land on Duna and notch that one up too. I call these \u0027golden moments\u0027 in KSP, very rewarding feeling. I guess there would be certain launch windows that could really predict such moments accurately, but the very reason why you get all glowey is because it happened without really planning for it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T15:51:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell done! It helps a bit that Ike encounters are a dime a dozen given how big and close to Duna the bloody moon is, but it\u0027s always a thrill when you knock off multiple contracts on one mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rolanvorxariat","CreatedById":117146,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-24T17:06:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat first time I used a gravity assist, to get to Duna via the mun.
