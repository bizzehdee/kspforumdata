I have landed on every planet but Dres. I started playing in version 0.16. First planet I flew to was Duna. Then did a flyby of Jool as a joyride test. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWent to Eeloo and landed there, as it was the farthest-out planet. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen Moho, as it was the innermost and hardest to successfully land at due to the Delta-V required to get there and have fuel left to return to Kerbin (and some sensible choices of what part of the Moho orbit to use, my first try was worst-case ,with Moho at its periapsis instead of apoapsis as I learned later). I focused my mission on exploring the very deep hole at the north pole of Moho, and sending a probe to check on rumors of a possible deep hole at the South Pole too (nope, none). IIRC I was the first to report how deep the \u0022MoHole\u0022 was (about 4.8 km), from flying a probe to the bottom and then later Jeb to the bottom.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMany would go to Eve early as it is easy to get to..... but incredibly difficult to RETURN from a landing to get back into orbit. So I was not interested in an Eve flyby, went to Duna first. I waited to get better at the game before tackling Eve. I put a lot of time into working up landers to be able to return to orbit from Eve, some from a high altitude and some from sea level. Gilly was a \u0022bonus\u0022, but not nearly as interesting as landing and coming back from Eve. But I made the side trip to Glly interesting too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI flew a simple \u0022Land, walk around, get back\u0022 mission to Laythe, using an aerobrake from Jool.

But have not done all of the moons of Jool. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProbably should do a Dres mission soon to at least cover all the planets. And maybe then a ship with landers that can do the the rest of the Jool moons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFWIW - here\u0027s links to some of my missions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEELOO\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/0PKto\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.

Moho. They\u0027re not very interesting, no more interesting than say the Mun and a lot more difficult to get to or leave. The Jool system offers a wide variety all by itself, using all the delta-v you would use on visiting those solo bodies you can have a grand tour, concluded with a trip to the beach on Laythe! From an engineering/piloting standpoint it just isn\u0027t worth the time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe integration of fineprint has made visiting bodies a lot more interesting, but with the prohibitive amounts of delta-v you need to get there, I think these bodies need something more intrinsically valuable, other than being a different color or terrain roughness.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROXunreal","CreatedById":133129,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T23:31:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDres could use a ring system, if for nothing else then just to stand out a bit more.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-03T23:58:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big problem is that they\u0027re all moonless, eccentric, tilted worlds.
