That does work, but all its doing really is directing you to the KSP Store to download the entire game, not just a patch file. So the file patcher.exe is the one to NOT use, yet. When that works, I bet it will probably just download patch files that auto-install, rather than download the entire game to get included update files. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as saves go, the only I see anyone losing saves is if they delete or lose it while moving to new folder.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dizzle","CreatedById":31588,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-01T20:45:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used the .exe, it worked fine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frederf","CreatedById":3844,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-03T23:00:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome people are getting the genuine (rsync?) updater to work like Dizzle.
