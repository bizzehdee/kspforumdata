Took me a good couple hours to do the first manual docking, but that was because I put the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Mechjeb (mod)\u0022\u003EMJ\u003C/abbr\u003E part on the wrong side of the decoupler, and the craft was crazy unbalanced. After that, I decided to get good at docking, and have discovered a couple really handy tricks:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Always switch over to the other craft ( [ / ] ) and select \u0022control from here\u0022 on the target docking port, target the docking port of the primary ship, and then switch back and dock. This will keep the target vessel oriented correctly, and makes docking immensely easier. Of course, this only works with smaller vessels, such as a service module for an Apollo style mission.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\n2) Use \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E only for translation. Add an extra reaction wheel to the craft, and let the computer handle the rotation. Even in stock KSP, the computer can help a ton by keeping the relevant docking ports lined up and facing each other. Then you just have to translate into the correct approach and cruise in.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) When building a station or a modular ship, start with the heaviest piece first, not just the center piece. Having the vessel you\u0027re docking to weigh more than what you\u0027re controlling makes the process go much smoother.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHopefully some of those tips will help you continue to master this element of the game!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HoloYolo","CreatedById":138353,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-04T17:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt took me about 50-75 hours myself, I forget how long.

Nothing more frustrating than seeing that your ship needs to go left, applying left \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, and having the ship on screen move right instead.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor rendezvousing, place a maneuver node. Add enough delta v to the node to produce an intersect between your orbit and the target orbit, then drag the maneuver node forwards or backwards until your target position at intersect is fairly close (less than 10k for Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, certainly). You may need to increase or decrease the burn time on your maneuver node as you move it if one or both of the orbits involved is not circular. Depending on how close in size the orbits are, you may need to right-click on your maneuver node and move the node forwards by a few orbits (the right-hand button).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you\u0027ve made that burn, warp to about 1/8th of an orbit before the intersect point. Switch to target mode on your navball. Face anti-target. You should see the retrograde vector indicator somewhere in the vicinity of the anti-target indicator. Draw an imaginary line going from the anti-target indicator to the retrograde indicator, and point your spacecraft at a spot on the line past the retrograde indicator. Apply gentle thrust so that the retrograde indicator moves towards alignment with the anti-target indicator. While doing this, observe the target distance at intersect. It should be going down as you apply thrust. When it stops, cut thrust and wait for a while until the retrograde indicator moves out of alignment again, which it will naturally do as you move around the orbit. Repeat until you reach the desired target distance at intersect. It\u0027s entirely possible to have that distance be 0.0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(You can do this using \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E, as well, but I like using the main engines. It drops the relative speed at intersect some on the way to rendezvous, which simplifies that step a bit.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFrom there, wait until you\u0027ve almost reach the intersect point, then apply thrust pointed at the retrograde marker until your relative velocity is 0. Again, you can make fine adjustments by pointing your ship so that the retrograde marker is between your thrust vector and the anti-target marker. I usually manage to drop in to rendezvous at less than 100m using this method.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs you do this a few times, around different celestial bodies and at different orbital heights, you can start to get a feel for what kind of corrections will need to be made when.
