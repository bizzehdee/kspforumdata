After a few seconds of observation the kraken started to accelerate in random directions at velocities of several thousand km/s, surprisingly the kraken stayed relatively \u0022still\u0022 because it was accelerating even more violently than a warp egg and the accelerations mostly cancelled each other out. It was at this point that I re-entered normal view to find that the kraken had now grown to more than 30km across with some of the affected pieces moving... however fast you have to go to circuit around a, now, 100km diameter loop several times a second. Then the parts became invisible (but still there) and the core (where the camera focused) started to appear to teleport several km at a time in random directions. I watched the debris markers (It was now marked as multiple debris despite them all still being connected) until they went out of range. By the time I closed KSP I estimate that the thing had expanded to fill Kerbins entire SOI.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing does not directly affect objects within its influence but the prospect of being hit by a structural pylon with 999 impact tolerance going at several \u003Csup\u003Ethousand...\u003C/sup\u003E c is not a nice one\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EView from the camera midway through the test\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www./convkey/2a1a/mqe6334rp2o3e5cfg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022mqe6334rp2o3e5cfg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMap view of Kerbin SOI midway through the test\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www./convkey/979d/c1v6agaiah618oefg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022c1v6agaiah618oefg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull solar system view midway through the test\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www./convkey/c67d/d9wp3wrn6ez2bbbfg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022d9wp3wrn6ez2bbbfg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T19:11:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGot a video of the kraken bomb going off?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Chiboko","CreatedById":77125,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-08T20:35:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETest 2 concluded when the \u0022craft\u0022 splashed down hard on Kerbin... at an altitude of 35km... at 6000km/s... while being further from Kerbin than the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETest 3 the \u0022craft\u0022 went straight through Kerbin several times, the trackable core achieved a top speed of 1million km/s (Think about it. the outer most debris can be hundreds of KM from the center, if the center achieved that speed at the center of the spin imagine how fast the outermost pieces where moving), in map view it lost its debris marker and the trajectory starting point became desynchronized with the objects actual position.
