I found that you pretty much have to biome-hop before you can even get started. You need a surface reading from most if not all biomes in order to find the worthwhile spots.

I love me a good sandbox, but sometimes, I just don\u0027t know what to do with all that sand - either I\u0027m sadly bereft of ideas, or I simply have too many. Contracts help in both cases: They are something to base a mission or two on when between major projects, and they also force you to plan better (get more things done in a given mission). Currently, though (even modded) the contracts can get quite tedious and often ridiculous (take ore from Eve to Gilly!) Not that I expect the changes to make them amazing, but any improvement is good.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T14:54:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERegarding contracts: the frequency of part tests should drop the further a player ventures into space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T15:14:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerbMav\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KerbMav\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERegarding contracts: the frequency of part tests should drop the further a player ventures into space.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree. As it is now, the moment you unlock ISRU, you have to delete thousands of contracts to get something that isn\u0027t ISRU. Worse, you can\u0027t choose not to unlock ISRU because it is grouped with important parts in the tech tree. ISRU contracts need to be cut in half or more and the GRAVMAX needs to be removed from that tech tree node. If you reduce the number of part tests, that just decreases the likelihood of getting a non-ISRU contract.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-27T15:18:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/27/2015 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerbMav","CreatedById":70338,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-27T15:21:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAh ok then ... havent been playing in months, so I am not in the loop. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-29T13:54:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAny 2.5 meter liquid fuel only tanks?
