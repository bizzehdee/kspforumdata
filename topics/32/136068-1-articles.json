Universal laws are, well, universal, so matter in the Kerbal universe seems to always have very high density compared to our universe. There are no relativistic effects in KSP such as a universal speed limit c or warping around massive objects. Moho\u0027s orbit does not precess, etc etc etc. Such as the laws of the Kerbal universe, as set forth when @HarvesteR created the heavens and Kerbin. The Modders are free to change those laws as they see fit, and Danny2462 will always, always try and be able to break them. To summarize, Kerbin, Kerbol, Minmus, and all the rest are perfectly normal in their universe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KamenRiderzero1","CreatedById":158519,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-05T02:18:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt\u0027s quite possible for the Kerbol system to exist in a fictional world along side other systems that are like our own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntake, for example, the planet in the Star Trek: Voyager episode \u0022Blink of an Eye\u0022.
