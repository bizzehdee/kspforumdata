I was on Minmus with Bob, Bill and Jeb, I was climbing down to the Minmus surface and jumped off the ladder to the right and Jeb crumpled to the ground. I pressed \u0027W\u0027 to right him and the screen just went black, and there was a series of 9\u0027s where the altitude meter should have been. I went back to the Space Centre, looked in the tracking building and there was Jebediah and the Lander and the rest of the crew, all in escape trajectory of Kerbol. I ended the mission but it seems that the crew is gone. Has any one got some idea of what might have happened?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphox","CreatedById":32691,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-24T18:57:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESounds like you have been visited by the space kraken.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat sounds like a pretty nasty bug though.
