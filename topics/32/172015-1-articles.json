I wouldn\u0027t discount the possibility of a Polish-language port, though: while French and Portuguese have large audiences outside France/Portugal, the potential Italian-speaking audience doesn\u0027t seem all that much larger than the Polish-speaking one. Militating against that is that, AFAIK, Polish isn\u0027t a Romance-family language, and it may be more difficult to translate to a non-Romance language.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs the Polish language very similar to Russian?
