I will choose what to do based on the following criteria:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.It must be easy to intermediate difficulty (no returning from the surface of Eve, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2.It must not require docking, because I really suck at docking\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.It must be achievable within three hours (no building a base on Eeloo, etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, anything goes!
