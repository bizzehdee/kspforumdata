If it had been \u0022Mine ore on Duna, deliver the ore to Ike\u0022 then it would have been so much easier. But an \u0022Explore Eve\u0022 contract isn\u0027t that much harder than an \u0022Explore Duna\u0022 contract, so you can\u0027t do it like science where each planet just has a multiplier."},{"CreatedByName":"Pulstar","CreatedById":57193,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T05:01:08Z","Content":"Doesn\u0027t a flyby just mean get into its SoI?
