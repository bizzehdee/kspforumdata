To fill the role, I chose an SSTO designed to reach a 100 x 100 km orbit with a comfortable fuel margin. Surprisingly, the Command Seats themselves didn\u0027t have as much of an effect on flight characteristics as I expected them to and the craft needed no major modifications to accommodate them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I loaded up some passengers for the first flight to my station and could barely reach orbit at all. I had to use RCS thrust to bridge the last 60 m/s or so just for a 100 x 71 km orbit. This leads me to wonder: just how much drag do the Kerbals add to the craft? It must be something rather significant, as simply adding the drag from six normal parts would not result in such a drastic decline in performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone have the exact numbers, or at least a close approximation?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Deadweasel","CreatedById":23123,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-10T05:53:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\u0027t know that it\u0027s actual drag, so much as weight.
