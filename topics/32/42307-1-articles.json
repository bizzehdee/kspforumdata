However as for the maneuverability RCS is only needed as a booster (as you would see with big ships). In atmo obviously you have control surfaces to change all of these, in vacuum however you use reaction wheels to apply torque to your craft which turns it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BeefTenderloin","CreatedById":25612,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T11:26:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe reason spacecraft lacking RCS can still turn is due to the capsule containing reaction wheels.

When in space hit the C button until is cycles through the different camera views until it says Chase View, then move your view to the back of your ship and your WASD for turning and IJKL for translation (moving without turning - if your ship is balanced correctly) and HN (for moving back and forward)... they all are aligned for your view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh yeah one further thing...

You \u0022push\u0022 the nose down, and \u0022pull\u0022 the nose up--it\u0027s a little confusing when you think of it from outside the vehicle, but if you think of yourself as being inside the vehicle, it makes a lot more sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen in doubt, don\u0027t trust your eyes, trust your navball, basically. On the navball, W *always* adds pitch-down and S *always* adds pitch-up, no matter how else you\u0027re tumbling. That said, if I *am* tumbling, I tend to try and damp out roll first, then yaw, and then finally pitch, to minimize the potential confusion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you might try playing the game using a joystick instead of the keyboard, if that continues to confuse you; it seems much more intuitive when you\u0027re using a stick, since the nose will rotate the direction that the tip of the stick does. There are a lot of relatively-inexpensive three-axis joysticks out there now, where your third axis is twisting the stick; you can choose in the options menu which axis will do what--some would prefer to have left-right control yaw and twist control roll, others would prefer the opposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf all else fails, you can also reassign W and S to the opposite functions in the Options menu, too, but I consider that a last resort if you just can\u0027t get used to it... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Torham234","CreatedById":58574,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-13T16:19:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Lar-E\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Lar-E\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAlso, does anyone else get dyslexic about W/S pitch control?
