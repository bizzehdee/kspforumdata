I have a station in orbit, using the stock station body, and thought it would be nice to add a fuel tank to re-fuel craft in orbit. Don\u0027t know why as I have only been to Mun and Minmus so far, but heck, why not. Originally I just stuck a jumbo tank on the nose of the capsule at the top of the launch vehicle, but even with struts this thing shakes like a strawberry jelly having a fit during launch. I was wondering if there is a more accepted way of attaching spare fuel tanks to a launch vehicle and in what configuration are they added to an orbiting station?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brofessional","CreatedById":2080,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-19T11:56:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFor adding parts to a station it\u0027s best to build a tug with a docking port on top, then stick the station part above that with docking ports on each end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat way you can dock the end of the fuel tank to the station, then undock the tug and deorbit it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking ports are more wobbly than decouplers, but detaching the tug via decoupler will nudge the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recommend the quantum struts mod for building your station.

Here I\u0027ve used XL girders coming from the orange tank under the lower ring. They brace to the lower stage and to the boosters that have already been released. They also brace to the station rim which is too far out to reach the orange tank with a strut. They\u0027re attached with 4 way symmetry and have diagonal struts between them to stiffen the whole structure. This puts the strut attachment far enough out to reach across multiple rocket segments instead of needing a ring of struts at each joint. Once the final stage separates all the bracing and struts go with it. This is an older picture. In later rockets I put the girders on the lower stage as well to stiffen the joint between the upper and lower stages and clear up some wobble at the lower end of the boosters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like the idea of the I-Beam cage though.
