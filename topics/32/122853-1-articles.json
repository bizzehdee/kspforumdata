An engine with more similar ASL and vacuum Isps is an engine optimized for sea level.\u003Cp\u003ERegarding Eve, the aerospike is still king (along with the Mammoth). The Isp curves aren\u0027t linear and have more points than just 1atm and 0atm, you might be surprised at how the engines perform at Eve pressures. The Reliant tapers to 0.001s of Isp by 7atm, the Swivel to 0.001s of Isp at 6atm, so each of them are near zero thrust at Eve\u0027s 5atm; meanwhile the Aerospike is chugging along at 230s at 5atm (and still at 170s by 10atm, if you care to Jool dive).\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm.

The third one is the proper aerospike in-game as it should be, and the fourth one doesn\u0027t even have the engine module. My bad, I guess.
