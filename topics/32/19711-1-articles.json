In the video I show a rough way one might go about getting to the other planets. I might a some point explain my method in more detail if you guys have any interest. But the fuel cost is still a bit high in this method. And I would rather not resort to using MechJeb. As your not even really playing the game anymore your just watching an AI do everything for you. I will keep trying to refine my method and report back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zapy97","CreatedById":45133,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T16:49:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enice right now i am using the tardis mod as a pratice to get to eve\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BeigeSponge","CreatedById":39997,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T16:54:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReally good, subbed\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"OperationDx","CreatedById":33950,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-22T21:51:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022zapy97\u0022 data-cite=\u0022zapy97\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Enice right now i am using the tardis mod as a pratice to get to eve\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I added a bunch more fuel to the tanks to try and get the hang of things.
