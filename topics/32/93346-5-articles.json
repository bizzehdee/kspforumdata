If I have a contract to survey a location on Keratin at low altitude or landed, or test a part in flight, what I want to do for those contracts is to build a plane to do it. It was even in the launch video from Squad: building a plane to do a survey contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConsider what I can do with rockets in the early game: I can put Jeb on the Mun or Minmus and bring him home once I have: 1.25 m fuel tanks, LV-T45 and LV909 engines, TR-18A stack decoupler, TT-38K radial decoupler and RT10 SRBs, and basic Landing Struts. All of these are available within level 3 of the tech tree, and can be unlocked with 58 science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I want to build a really basic jet that can take of from the KSC, land at the island runway, and then return, I need a basic jet engine and liquid fuel tank, some kind of air intake, a Mk1 cockpit, some wings and control surfaces and the landing gear bay. To get these parts means unlocking two different tier 5 science nodes (Aerodynamics for the jet engine and Landing for the gear bay), needing a minimum of 308 science points.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, I see these \u0022visual survey of Kerbin\u0022 contracts, and want to build a plane to fly those missions. By the time I can actually set about building that plane, I am into the category of putting satellites in a specific orbit around the Mun and planting a flag on the Mun type contracts, and the visual survey of Kerbin contracts just feel pointless.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the game is set up to be a \u0022build rockets and go to space\u0022 game, but as it is evolving into a \u0022space program tycoon\u0022 type game, you come to realise that the first \u0022A\u0022 in NASA (aerospace) is actually an important part of running a space program.

I actually restarted on easy then customized the settings to make it harder. The problem is simple in my mind: the payouts are too low for the monumental tasks required- tasks that aren\u0027t even involving going to the Mun or any other planet, but simply: upgrade a building. The buildings themselves don\u0027t seem to be worth the upgrades either, I wouldn\u0027t mind the massive payouts if I was really making some serious gains.

I agree with others that have stated that .90 really encourages their use- but I would also say it\u0027s hard to build one right out of the gate. I\u0027m not suggesting we should be supplied with everything, but for instance: if I don\u0027t have landing gear, I\u0027m not building a plane. So it doesn\u0027t matter that I have the cockpit, or even some control surfaces if I don\u0027t get landing gear until mid-way through the tech tree. I would take it a step further and even suggest offering low tech rover tires would also be a great addition for those pesky contacts that require to investigate multiple areas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all: Either the structures need better rewards, or need their costs cut.
