It added many little features, such as crew transfersfor the station-goer, pressing Z to throttle up for the guy who needs their engines powerful, and new explosions as well as destructible buildings for the morbid kaboom-watchers among you, and coupled it with game-changing features such as difficulty when you just need a bit of a twist, the beautifully overhauled Mk2 parts that made spaceplanes much more practical and gorgeous (nohomo)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand the Administration Building when you feel like yelling and raging at the companies for forcing you to test a Launch Clamp on Eve (not really). \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:sticktongue:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat about you guys?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T15:50:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E0.17, because it added a whole system of planets and moons to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T15:52:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t really have a favorite update, really.

I for example love making rovers/cars where i build the interiors and use the seats and then drive them in first person using the chase cam for proper first person view.

I was against Kerbal experience from the get go, and didn\u0027t like that probe piloting capabilities didn\u0027t scale with technology instead of with part. But playing a Science game where Jeb starts as a 5-star pilot made things really fun. Plus my x64 session didn\u0027t crash once since it\u0027s beginning. So gotta give credit where it is due, 0.90 is pretty sturdy and still very much fun. Was kinda bummed there was no Astronomer\u0027s pack or stuff like that for 0.90 tho... most places I check it only says : 0.24/0.25... And Firespitter is acting-up and buggy now, so no electric propellers anymore (see why I want them so much).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooking forward to 1.0, controversy and all...
