It added many little features, such as crew transfersfor the station-goer, pressing Z to throttle up for the guy who needs their engines powerful, and new explosions as well as destructible buildings for the morbid kaboom-watchers among you, and coupled it with game-changing features such as difficulty when you just need a bit of a twist, the beautifully overhauled Mk2 parts that made spaceplanes much more practical and gorgeous (nohomo)\n\nand the Administration Building when you feel like yelling and raging at the companies for forcing you to test a Launch Clamp on Eve (not really). ![:sticktongue:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue2.gif)\n\nWhat about you guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T15:50:05Z","Content":"0.17, because it added a whole system of planets and moons to explore."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-18T15:52:15Z","Content":"I don\u0027t really have a favorite update, really.

Every update since then has been dissapointing for me. \n\nJust that one single basic part just added so many possibilities like space stations, ground colonies and transfer of resources from one vessel to another one.\n\nWe really need a update with a part or a feature that does to the game what docking ports did with .18.\n\nI know there is even one hidden feature since .21 or so that could add alot to the game which is being able to turn a part into a rotor or a free moving ball bearing.. This feature can only be enabled by hacking the config files and sadly causes crash with timewarp. Was supposed to be added ages ago, but nothing ever happened so i guess they dropped it. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI also have wished for ages that they would add things like transparent panels that can be used as windows, so I can be more creative and actually create my own capsules and so on from scratch instead of having to rely on same predesigned ones.\n\nFor me these days the creative parts of the game is really what makes me come back, but sadly I feel like i have done most i can with the current vanilla versions.\n\nI am not very excited about 1.0 either and fear it is going to be game breaking for me. I for example love making rovers/cars where i build the interiors and use the seats and then drive them in first person using the chase cam for proper first person view. With the new update this is no longer possible since they are changing how the chase camera work. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-22T02:40:11Z\u0022 title=\u002203/22/2015 02:40  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by boxman**"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T03:03:52Z","Content":"Of all of the KSP updates, the one that resonated the most with me was 0.18.

Plus everything was fresh and new to explore. Took me forever to figure inter-planetary transfer, but each accomplishment was extremely satisfying.\n\n0.24.2 added much stability and playing options... also fixed odd craft disassemblies while lifting-off, and also negated some weird wobble. Plus it had x64 that was as stable if not more stable than 0.90.\n\n0.25 didn\u0027t leave an impression, and I kept adding mods, and finally discovered why ppl where complaining about wanting x64 so much. I also stopped playing here for a long time.\n\nI booted up 0.90 for the first time yesterday... why the long wait ? Well... I was against Kerbal experience from the get go, and didn\u0027t like that probe piloting capabilities didn\u0027t scale with technology instead of with part. But playing a Science game where Jeb starts as a 5-star pilot made things really fun. Plus my x64 session didn\u0027t crash once since it\u0027s beginning. So gotta give credit where it is due, 0.90 is pretty sturdy and still very much fun. Was kinda bummed there was no Astronomer\u0027s pack or stuff like that for 0.90 tho... most places I check it only says : 0.24/0.25... And Firespitter is acting-up and buggy now, so no electric propellers anymore (see why I want them so much).\n\nLooking forward to 1.0, controversy and all... But my next favorite update will have electric props and 64 bits support (if ever)."},{"CreatedByName":"Miro Beero","CreatedById":67935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T13:47:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E .21, It all went downhill after that.\n\nAgree.\n\nNot because of the new features added, but with a lot of mods breaking after .24 like interstellar and never returning.\n\nWould be cool to do what Scott Manley could do if the versions allowed."},{"CreatedByName":"Flixxbeatz","CreatedById":29991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:01:47Z","Content":"0.11\n\nThe update that changed the way kerbal space program was played."},{"CreatedByName":"Uncle Mort","CreatedById":57933,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:25:14Z","Content":"The NASA/asteroid capture one (can\u0027t remember the version)"},{"CreatedByName":"IndigoCypher00","CreatedById":75029,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-22T14:34:39Z","Content":".21, because it was the first update after I bought the game on Steam and I remember being completely awestruck by the new space center building models."},{"CreatedByName":"Mad Rocket Scientist","CreatedById":139256,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-23T00:50:17Z","Content":".25\n\nNew plane parts?
