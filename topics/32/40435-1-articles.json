But now, it is almost at the border of its poor Unity engine. This needs a change. You cannot keep a pine tree in a pot forever, it needs to expand its roots. So does KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo let\u0027s make ourselves heard and convince the developers to change the game engine! This might cost us the time required for a new update, but we will get a fresh new engine, a faster one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo choose now!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr. Scruffy","CreatedById":38540,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T08:40:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENo, i am not gonna vote for having them start all over at this point. Not only because i wouldnt want to wait that long (presuming the project would even survive the incured lag in the developement process), but also because i feel sympathy for the devs and wouldnt want to put them through the frustration.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: I bought the game on this engine ; cant expect them to port it to another. Not for the money i gave, anyways. I can only guess that the effort would be so much as to warrant a whole new funding process.
