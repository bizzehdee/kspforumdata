We discussed a bit before on the Kerbin/Duna cycler concept, but we can practice in Kerbin orbit. A M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn cycler would have a period of 141.175 kiloseconds (MechJeb gives orbital period data in kiloseconds) exactly - minor deviations add up. A M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn/Minmus cycler would be even better practice. Unfortunately, without docking, I don\u0027t know how useful they\u0027d be. Still, good practice and something to try in the next version - put a space station in a cycling orbit, or even better, multiple stations in multiple orbits to different planets, and then try to rendezvous. Maybe combine with the Kethane mod parts, so you have a base for each planet, and re-use the landers, but transfer Kerbals using the cyclers?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) Jool exploration - I plan to have a backwards firing SRB on an exploration vessel. That way, I can settle into Joolian orbit with my Kerbals, activate the SRB, and detach before it deorbits the vessel. Hit [ to switch to the detached SRB, and it should have enough juice to deorbit and fall into the atmosphere of Jool. That way I can look around without risking my crew. I might well do this the first few times on Eve, as well - perhaps detaching and landing a CrewTank instead, as a future landing target. (Further thought: drop more fuel, and simulate transferring it over into the lander\u0027s tanks via savestate editing. That may have potential...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) Alternative mission architecture: the existence of mini-moons around Jool and Eve makes for attractive targets for really large transfer vehicles. Rather than the two-ship approach, the better long-term plan may be:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (a) Land (or put into low orbit) at Gilly/Bop a Kerbin transfer vehicle with loads of room for Kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E (\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Put a transfer vehicle which shuttles between Eve/Jool\u0027s other moons and Gilly/Bop with enough room for 1 pilot plus a planetary crew.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u00A9 Land actual exploration crews to Eve or the other Joolian moons, then fly them back to low orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think over the long run, this would be the most effective way to do large-scale exploration of Eve or the Joolian moons.

Nuclear essentially (simply put) does the same thing - except it doesn\u0027t require a chemical reaction - using the heat from the nuclear fusion or fission to heat a gas and expel it through an engine - thereby creating thrust. Alternately you can electrostatically accelerate a stream of electrons or ionized particles to significant fractions of the speed of light. The later would be known as an ion engine and is used on some modern day space probes. The former is more theoretical, but holds the potential of being the only source of thrust that would only consume the mass that it turned into energy - making it the most efficient (mass-wise) possible way to provide thrust. Old CRTs use similar streams of electrons to create images - however since they are essentially closed systems (and too low in power) they do not create any thrust at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy the way you guys, this is actually the fourth \u0022[uNOFFICIAL/FANMADE] 0.17 Discussion Thread.\u0022 The actual third one began and was shut down in its infancy at the end of August...\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/18928-Unofficial-Fanmade-17-Development-3?highlight=%5BUNOFFICIAL%2FFANMADE%5D\u002B0.17\u002BDiscussion\u002BThread\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/18928-Unofficial-Fanmade-17-Development-3?highlight=%5BUNOFFICIAL%2FFANMADE%5D\u002B0.17\u002BDiscussion\u002BThread\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust saying.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Captain Oxen","CreatedById":47800,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T22:56:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKSP email did not come can you help!!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"swiftgates24","CreatedById":22280,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-14T23:13:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Captain Oxen\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Captain Oxen\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKSP email did not come can you help!!!\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the re-activation?
