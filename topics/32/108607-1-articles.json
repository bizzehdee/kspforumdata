More intakes allowed one to have more thrust at altitude without flaming out. In 1.0\u002B, jets have both velocity and altitude curves (and the velocity curves are different than before). The RAPIER gets a 9% thrust modifier from altitude at 20km (though the velocity curve can make this number higher) and it decreases exponentially above that height (3.3% at 25km and 1.2% at 30km). Thrust also decays linearly to zero from Mach 5.5 to 6.\n\nIn pre-release, the turbojet had good thrust up to 1800m/s or so and at any altitude (provided enough intakes, and it didn\u0027t stop thrusting until 2200m/s). With the 1.0 changes, RAPIERS (the highest/fastest jets) simply provide very little thrust above 20km, and even then only up to just over Mach 5.5 (anyone know how fast that is at 20km on Kerbin?). This also means that less air is required. Engines will fall off to diminutive thrust well before flameout, usually. If you have multiple engines and they flameout together, that means that they are simply going too high/fast to thrust any longer. If they flameout asymmetrically, that can be solved with more intakes. I have never flamed out with 2 intakes per engine, and usually 1 does well enough. Intake spam is no longer necessary to extract the full performance from engines."},{"CreatedByName":"Quiana","CreatedById":107476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:41:16Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In pre-release, jet engines had velocity curves.

Just check your intake placement order to ensure each engine is fed correctly and you won\u0027t have issues with flameouts in anything but a symmetrical/staged pattern. If anything, the drag from additional intakes will significantly hurt you compared to actually gunning for a little under the max height to air ratio."}]}
