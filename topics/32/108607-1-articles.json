More intakes allowed one to have more thrust at altitude without flaming out. In 1.0\u002B, jets have both velocity and altitude curves (and the velocity curves are different than before). The RAPIER gets a 9% thrust modifier from altitude at 20km (though the velocity curve can make this number higher) and it decreases exponentially above that height (3.3% at 25km and 1.2% at 30km).

Just check your intake placement order to ensure each engine is fed correctly and you won\u0027t have issues with flameouts in anything but a symmetrical/staged pattern. If anything, the drag from additional intakes will significantly hurt you compared to actually gunning for a little under the max height to air ratio.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
