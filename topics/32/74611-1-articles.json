The problem I\u0027m seeing with it is what happens when you compare it with a mainsail. it has both better Isp and thrust than the mainsail, and is the same part size. It\u0027s also smaller than a mainsail stuck on a big orange tank. And since the mainsail is pretty much only used in conjunction with the big orange tank, you can just switch all mainsails on a launch stage for liquid boosters and literally make it better in every way possible. I really don\u0027t know how to fix this, maybe a thing where you can only attach the liquid fuel booster laterally onto one of the new tanks?
