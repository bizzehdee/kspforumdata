Often times little testing was done before release and so releases were often buggy and underwhelming. At some point people started complaining loudly and vehemently against buggy releases and so we hour a Q/A Team of volunteers (they go through the preliminary steps of a release) then an Expermentals release (where a special team gets access to \u0022KSP Experimentals\u0022 and the bug tracker) the job then is to try and break KSP as best as possible and then fix it up (balance is also tested at this time). Afterwards there is a code freeze and \u0022Release Candidates\u0022 are released. After the final candidate, Squad decidrs on a date and it gets released.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically the reasoning for this is to reduce the noise-to-signal ratio; a small group of competent testers can more easily find and fix bugs than a horde of less competent testers. Furthermore, this means we all get a better product in the end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-10-06T15:18:45Z\u0022 title=\u002210/06/2014 03:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by AmpsterMan\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FleetAdmiralJ","CreatedById":73364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-06T15:14:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kelvin Kerbin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kelvin Kerbin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs the title says, when Squad announced that the 0.25 update is \u0022in experimentals\u0022 does that mean it is in the final stage of testing?
