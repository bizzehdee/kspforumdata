If you use the MK2 body it has 10 spaces on it. And these are the geometric proofs/representations of the beginning sqaure root values. The are eqaulateral triangles for sqaure root of 3. A 90 degree using radius for sqaure root of 2 and then others going to sqaure root of 5 and others. I haven\u0027t gone over it, but I\u0027m assuming the size of the engines probably does this also with circles. I think Sqaure root of 2 at a 1 diameter circle ends up with Sqrt(0.1875).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe difference between A and B parts is an overlap. I wonder if this is internal to the game or the difference between a midline and a particular arc. IE. 0.06698729810778067662x0.25x0.07147459621556135324 (one representation of the proportions of the sqaure root of 2.) the hypotenuse in that case is 1/20th the sqaure root of 2.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you notice the rectangle above the wings is likely exactly the distance between the tips of the 10base 10 height triangle and the 20 base 10 height triangle. I\u0027m assuming this is another special triangle. I\u0027m guessing every part of the visuals on the parts and on the ground are similar. The sqaure/diamonds are a shape based on sqaure root of 2 btw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFYI the aircraft is at the default starting height and looking straight down. That means the proportions are not user based but inherent to the game. That also means the triangle between is base 15 with a height of 5. And the angles are:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n10*10 = 100 *2 = 200\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nsqrt(200) = 14.14213562373095048802(IE 10x the sqaure root of 2.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n10*10 = 100 \u002B5*2=5 = 125\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nsqrt(125) = 11.180339887498948482(IE 5x the sqaure root of 5.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nBase 15.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cs\u003EBigS delta wing is 13x16 with hypotenuse 5x the sqaure root of 17...\u003C/s\u003E 13x15 or 14 unless the black area adds up to another 1.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;text-indent:0px;\u0022\u003E\nDoes knowing these numbers simplify figuring out how it will work with the basic aerodynamics implemented in KSP? I\u0027m not familiar with what exactly that system is.

And sadly I don\u0027t know geometry well enough yet to construct a wing to be that dimensions easily. I\u0027m curious if any of those marks would be for that purpose though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: NVM, there is an equilateral triangle that can be used to make a frame from for that purpose.
