Now what to do with said Kethane. I have had the though about making an orbiter to send my vast sums of the stuff to and then fuel some of my larger ships, which all well and good, but then another thought hit me. My mun base is on its equator and I happen to have a hill side facing its prograde...... so my thought was this. I always see people wanting to make rails for some reason or another. I think I would like to make a lunar cannon type of device where you send a rocket fueled by kethane down a track up the hill side and into orbit. I remember playing Final Fantasy 8 a long time ago and they had a similar device to send people to thier moon station. I really have no idea what I would do with them after that but I also have the construction mod that can go along with kethane so it would be interesting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s15.photobucket.com/user/fcdrifter13/media/FFVIII_Lunar_Gate_WM_zpsc91c4bb9.png.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a372/fcdrifter13/FFVIII_Lunar_Gate_WM_zpsc91c4bb9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FFVIII_Lunar_Gate_WM_zpsc91c4bb9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s15.photobucket.com/user/fcdrifter13/media/FFVIIILunarGate_zpscc30bfb9.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a372/fcdrifter13/FFVIIILunarGate_zpscc30bfb9.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022FFVIIILunarGate_zpscc30bfb9.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmicScientist","CreatedById":78000,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T02:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell that is an interesting idea and it would be best if you could do it just using electricity rather than rocket fuel to get most of their orbit done with an initial speed-up but to give you an idea that might work for a little time, make a vehicle which carries to fuel, has airplane wheels on it (so you don\u0027t have to worry about a top speed) and rover wheels so you can drive it around to get the right position when the airplane gear is pulled up.
