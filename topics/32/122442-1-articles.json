Since things like life support aren\u0027t in the stock game, most stock players don\u0027t bother with habitation modules, etc (unless they are role playing) and just leave their crews in the lander. In that case, I\u0027d say the most popular setup for an interplanetary mission is to launch a \u0022tug\u0022 into LKO followed by a lander. Dock them together and send them on their way to the destination. Use the \u0022tug\u0022 to get you there and back, and the lander for landing at the destination and for reentry on Kerbin. When you get back to Kerbin, leave the \u0022tug\u0022 in orbit for the next mission. That\u0027s pretty much what I do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re playing a career game, you may want to bring along science labs, instruments, etc, depending on what contracts you have to fulfill. Also, if you\u0027re using mods that add in life support requirements or make other changes to gameplay, you may need to add more stuff to your \u0022tug\u0022, but otherwise, it\u0027s usually just a probe core, docking port, fuel tanks, and engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA good rule of thumb is to leave behind everything you don\u0027t need and build to suit the mission, especially in career where funds can be an issue.
