I was wondering about a utility or mod that keeps track of where your Kerbals are. I currently have 4 stations, 2 around Kerbin and 1 around Mun and Minmus, as well as a base on the moon, all of which have to be kept staffed. At the moment it\u0027s simple enough to put a station in orbit somewhere and then pretty much forget about the crew. Thought it would be nice if we had something that first of all kept track of where everybody was, but also incorporated a reminder that poor old Jebediah has been at Mun base for the last two months and it\u0027s about time that someone went up there to relieve him from duties so that he could enjoy a bit of time Kerbin side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am aware of the crew manifest mod, but not sure it does what I am suggesting. Obviously the tour of duty would need to be user configurable, as it would be no use getting a reminder that Bob needs relieving after 2 weeks if he\u0027s on a 4 month mission to Jool, but something like this would give a purpose to some of the missions we fly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBe interested to hear what others think.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tek_604","CreatedById":59699,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T13:33:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe you could use Kerbal Alarm Clock for reminding yourself about crew rotations?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Apollo1391","CreatedById":73845,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T13:44:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethere is also the crew manifest mod that helps keeping track of crew\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tw1","CreatedById":59717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T14:03:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECrew manifest doesn\u0027t do that, last time I checked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems like something we\u0027ll need someday, if stock life support is added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027d be a lot simpler than searching the persistence file when you want to find out where a certain kerbal has got to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SleepyWacKo","CreatedById":72826,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T14:47:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edoesn\u0027t the built in space tracking system keep track all all your missions and kerbals along with listing the \u002BMet time?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Scarecrow88","CreatedById":66043,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T15:06:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETracking station only keeps track of Kerbals if they are EV. Haven\u0027t used the crew manifest mod, but I don\u0027t think it does what I am suggesting. Kerbal alarm clock is a possibility, but the alarm is associated with a vehicle rather than it\u0027s pilot, though that\u0027s only a relatively minor problem. The biggest problem there is if your Kerbal trans-ships and you forget to add an alarm to the new vessel, especially if the original vessel \u0027ends flight\u0027.
