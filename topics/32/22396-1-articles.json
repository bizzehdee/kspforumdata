Lift is proportional to velocity rather than velocity squared, angled control surfaces can create thrust, no stall mechanic whatsoever, and drag includes mass by accident. Really, the only thing anywhere near realistic is the stability of airplane designs, since the basics are there. As olex said, it doesn\u0027t seem to be a priority for now, but there is an \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/showthread.php/20451\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Eaerodynamics fix plugin\u003C/a\u003E (by myself--full disclosure \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E) that fixes a great deal of the problems.
