The doors are hinged, they do not vanish into other pieces. And many folks have had no issue with service bays, only folks that cram them so full of stuff they start to intersect with eachother and the other colliders (like when Das Valdez stuffed an ore drill inside of one)."},{"CreatedByName":"basic.syntax","CreatedById":109920,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T17:13:32Z","Content":"RoverDude, on service bays: I\u0027ve been advising folks to keep stuff away from the inside sides.\n\n Placement there seems to interfere with door collision geometry. \n\nAm I off base?

As almost their entire diameter is door and they swing wiiiide open, this is rather limiting.\n\nToday I\u0027ve heard that this wouldn\u0027t be merely cosmetic, that opening doors will squish and destroy other parts.
