notwithstanding:\u00A0 I do sympathize with the sentiment of such posts (assuming that they\u0027re sincere and not just trolling), even if I think they\u0027re not really helpful in actually resolving anyone\u0027s problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is a \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Egreat\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E game.\u00A0 If it weren\u0027t, we wouldn\u0027t have all these otherwise intelligent people, many of whom are supposedly responsible adults, sinking so many thousands of hours into, let\u0027s face it, a toy.\u00A0 (An educational one, yes, but a toy.)\u00A0 Certainly it has gotten under \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emy\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E skin in a way that no other game ever has, and I\u0027ve been a computer-game nerd for a third of a century now.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd when a person cares \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eso much\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E about a particular activity... and they sink a lot of their personal time into it... that time is \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eimportant\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E to them.\u00A0 They really value it, and justifiably so:\u00A0 our time is the most precious resource we have, we\u0027re only given just so much of it, there\u0027s never enough, and when it\u0027s gone, it\u0027s gone.\u00A0 Furthermore, a big part of the joy of KSP is the joy of \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecreating\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E something-- and when we create something, we\u0027re proud of it, and protective of it, and value it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo:\u00A0 suddenly, some totally unforeseen, out-of-one\u0027s-personal-control factor comes whizzing out of the blue and demolishes one\u0027s hard-won creation-- like the fellow in \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/140991-i-quit/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ethis thread\u003C/a\u003E-- yes, that\u0027s rage-inducing.\u00A0 I can sympathize with that.\u00A0 And I can also understand that a major component of that rage is a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness: \u0022hey, the game just did this to me, and there\u0027s nothing I can do about it!\u0022\u00A0 Perhaps accompanied with an emotional surge of \u0022...and nobody cares!\u0022\u00A0 So I can also understand why someone in a position like that may feel the overwhelming urge to \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ehave a voice\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E and make such a post.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOf course, that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s a good idea to do so.\u00A0 I\u0027d never make such a post myself.\u00A0 But then, I\u0027m a crusty old codger with a fair amount of perspective, and also I\u0027m fortunate enough to be in a happy place IRL these days so that I can take little disasters like KSP problems with equanimity.\u00A0 If KSP did something like that to \u003Cu\u003E\u003Cem\u003Eme\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E, it wouldn\u0027t make me go nonlinear.\u00A0 Sure, I\u0027d be pretty unhappy about it, and you better believe I\u0027d be all over the bug tracker like white on rice \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022

among friends... but I wouldn\u0027t pop my cork in a public forum.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut that\u0027s just me, as I am now.\u00A0 Would I have had that much judgment when I was 25?\u00A0 Or 15?\u00A0 Or if I wasn\u0027t in such a happy place now, so that small disasters could loom large?\u00A0 I like to say that I\u0027d be better than that... but honesty compels me to admit that I honestly don\u0027t know.\u00A0 When I see such a post, I may shake my head, but I don\u0027t judge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd yeah, sometimes the posts (or the responses to them) go far enough over the line that one of us moderators has to step in and tidy things up.\u00A0 But we\u0027re not judgmental about it, and there\u0027s no animus involved.\u00A0 It\u0027s just a matter of
