(too lazy/not enough time to do a redesign, so these parts keep getting used on my SSTOs that I use heavily).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadial engines: I rarely use them, due to their inferior Isp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used the 24-77 for some VTOL applications/retrorockets, but the LV 1-Rs are too weak for that.

For lighter payloads, the poodle is also adequate for this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo those that say the poodle, I also disagree.

Thus they convert any SSTO rocket into a fully reusable 2 stage rocket with more on orbit performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHydraulic Detachment Manifold - I always use the TT-70: for the larger parts, I find the added clearance is a neccessity. I\u0027ve never used this part aside from part test contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStack seperators in general - disagree with those that listed these, I use them to seperate payloads when I bring up multiple in a single trip, and don\u0027t want a decoupler stuck on either end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELinear RCS ports: I don\u0027t use them much, but I do occasionally use them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFL-A5 Adapter/Rockomax Brand Adapter 02 - the flat adaptors are pointless no? why not just stick a 1.25 m part directly on a 2.5m node, does this flat adaptor really serve any purpose? Oh its an 80degree angle instead of a 90 degree one? whoopeee\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlthough I\u0027ve seen them used for RP purposes as radiation shields (ie, mount them directly in front of a LV-N)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOctagonal Strut - no, not the cubic one, this one... what is this for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERockomax HubMax Multi-Point Connector - very very rarely use... the thing is too heavy. I\u0027d prefer to use a structural fusalage with 4x radial attachment nodes place on it. The only advantage of this rockomax part is reduced part count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.5 tons vs 0.24 tons.... yea, the structural pylon\u002B radial attachment points wins often.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts even worse if I want it as a docking node. As docking nodes are already radially attached, I can just put them directly on the structural pylon: 1.5 tons vs 0.1 tons....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyea... no thanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk2 lander can/mk 1-2 pod- I use it.. sometimes... when I don\u0027t care too much about the mass, or for aesthetics. Particualrly for the cans on airless bodies, the aerodynamics don\u0027t matter, its better to use 2x 1 kerbal pods/cans. They need to make these lighter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPart count vs Mass is *NOT* a good gameplay mechanic.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt may seem to make sense early in career when VAB upgrades limit part count... but later/in sandbox, its choosing between extra mass, or running the game slower...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamic nose cone: rarely used now that they have advanced nose cones... something used during career until the better part is unlocked. I suppose its lower mass makes it potentially attractive if there is some middle ground between drag and mass that you are looking for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d like to see it able to store fuel. Sperical shapes are good for storing large volumes for little mass after all...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAV-8/tailfin/standard canard... too redundant... particularly the standard canard and the tailfin. Their stats are sligtly different, but their sizes are very similar, and their functions nearly identical... so .. yea... I pretty much coose one or the other at random.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMk-25 chute- I pretty much only choose it for aesthetics, as its chute model, with the long lanyard, looks better than the small radial drogues (radial drogues were something we needed though, they were one of the few mods I used to add)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel cells- disagree with others. fuel takes mass, yes, but so do solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor an ion craft past dres, you\u0027re better off using fuel cells (but this is a bit silly/unrealistic)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith ISRU, I don\u0027t care about the fuel use so much. Fuel cell powered stuff is great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEven better with mods: I have a solar powered duna plane, but it pretty much has to only fly around near mid day, stop and recharge from time to time, has a high part count (though I like the big OX stats from asteroid day - reduced part count is good).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA newer variant that I initially made for Eve uses fuel cells (eve, despite being close to the sun, has a really thick atmosphere that blocks a lot of power unless you are able to fly up really high).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGreat duration, with the electric useage I have the parts set at for the moment, I\u0027m thinking its still beating the wheesely for fuel efficiency on Laythe (though it is slower).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be cool if it had a mode that didn\u0027t use oxidizer, but used IntakeAir.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFuel cell powered electric atmospheric propulsion, combined with a surface fuel depot/surface ISRU, is great.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game just needs to add stock electric atmospheric propulsion to fully realize the potential of these.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERadiators: I use them mostly for looks/RP, but I think I\u0027ll have use for them for Moho expeditions and sundivers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInline docking ports: I see the use for them, I never used them. I don\u0027t have problems docking, but I always dock with nose/tail mounted docking ports (ie, essentially inline, but that gets confusing with this part name), haven\u0027t tried docking with what are essentially radial docking ports (placed inline, but they atachment is basically radial).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use minimal RCS during docking, I imagine I\u0027d use a lot more docking like this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt could be fun and make me pay more attention to RCS systems...

It\u0027s a noticeably higher TWR than the Swivel, and a bit more absolute thrust than the aerospike.

I also find it useful to put it near the front of the craft as a \u0022spacer\u0022 since it is relatively light, it puts the heavier cockpit a bit forward and shifts the center of mass toward the front. That in turn gives me a better range for placing the wings, without having to fiddle too much with fuel distribution near the front.
