I see form the \u0022watching mechjeb 100 times doing it\u0022 comments, that watching a computer do it without explaining itself at any point, \u003Cem\u003Emight\u003C/em\u003E be a tad more difficult. The real tricky thing about docking IMO is the final alignment and translation, that is a motor skill that you \u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E to develop (or have mechjeb do it for you). The rendezvous and orbit matching until you park within 2kms at less than 10m/s relative velocity? That is something to read about beforehand, because that takes thinking, not muscle memory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRegarding the original question: by playing with your orbital period (raising, lowering your orbit), you make your orbit intersect the target\u0027s with such a period that you will encounter it at that spot (I.E: you get a close encounter indicator of under ~5-10kms). Then, when you get close, it\u0027s all a matter of changing the velocity indicator in the navball to \u0022target\u0022 mode, and \u0022push\u0022 your relative velocity vector so it points to the target (target prograde to velocity prograde, target retrograde to velocity retrograde). Then just slow down as you come in, as late as you dare. And that is rendezvousing in a nutshell! I think that is the part you were having issues with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOnce you are parked next to the target... well, practice flying your ship like it was a kerbal, I do it with the camera in \u0022locked\u0022 mode, so up is always up, and both hands on the keyboard, WASD with the left for attitude and left on IJKL for translation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRune.

Ellipticals are doable, just an added challenge the farther from circular they are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMom your first attempts, be sure to start from a situation where the orbits don\u0027t cross. If they are crossing, it\u0027s still doable but can take longer and be harder depending upon how in phase they are.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSelect the other craft as your target. You\u0027ll see intersection points when your orbits get close enough. So from a \u00A0two circular non-crossing orbits use the maneuver node to\u00A0plan a burn that will take you to just to touching the targets orbit and the intersection markers will appear. Click on the circle of the maneuver node and move it around your orbit until you find a spot with the minimum distance at intersection. You may need to orbit a few times to get this distance to less than 10 km.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo the burn and when you get close, the nag ball should automatically switch to target when you\u0027re closer than 25 km. Clicking on it will toggle between surface, orbit, and target.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nClick so you\u0027re on target, and the retrograde marker now registers relative to the target, not orbit. Prepare to burn retrograde. Get the target vessel in sight and when the distance between ships is no longer going down burn retrograde until you have close to zero speed between targets. You don\u0027t need to be exact. Under 2 m/s here is fine. Find the\u00A0\u00A0purple circle on the navball which indicates the direction of the target and burn towards the target. You\u0027ll repeat this burn in the opposite direction when you get close so the amount of burn is relative to how much fuel you want to spend and how much time you spend closing the distance.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen you get close, burn retrograde on the navball and this time get as close to zero as you can get. Switch to the target craft and rotate the craft to have your docking port facing the incoming ship. Switch back to your craft. Make sure you are pointed at the docking port, and burn slowly towards it. With careful piloting on a small craft with ample SAS you don\u0027t need RCS.

Then, when you get close, it\u0027s all a matter of changing the velocity indicator in the navball to \u0022target\u0022 mode, and \u0022push\u0022 your relative velocity vector so it points to the target (target prograde to velocity prograde, target retrograde to velocity retrograde).

The idea behind rendezvous and docking can be derived from first principle, that\u0027s why Buzz Aldrin was able to write a thesis on the subject and became known as \u0022Dr Rendezvous\u0022. Specific details relevant to each vehicle (and I mean, there\u0027s really only two things that are different: location of docking port and RCS placement) can be \u003Cstrong\u003Etrivially\u003C/strong\u003E compensated for which is the whole reason why a machine like mechjeb can handle it.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nMechjeb doesn\u0027t teach you from first principle, rather it rigidly follows algorithms and encapsulates the knowledge away from you. To really get a feel for rendezvous and docking you need to either do it the old fashion way from reading books or watching instructional videos, or do it yourself and get a intuitive feel for it. Looking at mechjeb only teaches you how to mimic mechjeb\u0027s algorithm which is much worse than a human pilot.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tourist","CreatedById":143403,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-20T01:17:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78020-alamovampire/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002278020\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/78020-alamovampire/\u0022\u003E@AlamoVampire\u003C/a\u003EUnsurprisingly I disagree on a number of points. Firstly, once in orbit, whether it be 75kms or 350kms the specific design of your craft doesn\u0027t really matter that much (except for perhaps dodgy placement of RCS ports and compensating for the lower receptiveness of high mass craft.) Also rendezvous and docking is not that hard, there is not that much nuance to it.... the only maneuvers you need to know are plane alignment, setting up a close approach, matching velocity/closing the distance, docking.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe tools people need to do that is understanding the map screen and the navball. The problem is, Mechjeb does not explain these tools. It doesn\u0027t explain why it is burning anti-normal or normal at a specific point in the process, it does not explain why\u00A0lowing or raising your\u00A0PE or AP will help you\u00A0catch up with another craft. These I believe are vital to understanding rendezvous and docking, but MJ only demonstrates by doing, it doesn\u0027t explain why.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever I can see the benefit of mechjeb demonstrating the final docking part.... without mod tools like the docking alignment indicator this can be tricky, but I think most people will understand what its trying to do.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlthough as I noted, everybody learns differently, I may just be describing my own learning process. \u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-01-20T01:18:27Z\u0022 title=\u002201/20/2016 01:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Tourist\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
