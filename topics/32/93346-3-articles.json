Those sliders can only alter how fast you accumulate the 3 types of \u0022currency\u0022.

THAT is what cause the Hard mode to be grindy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe game balance problem comes not from how fast you get the 3 types of \u0022currency\u0022, but from the fact that one of them, Funds, is about five times more important than the other two, Science and Rep, such that there is exactly one and only one right strategy in the admin building - increase funds and decrease science and reputation. The other options are presented to you but are wrong to pick because you\u0027ll hit the funding problem long before you\u0027ll encounter any problems from the limitations of the other two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you get science faster than funding, there\u0027s no point, because you can\u0027t spend the science as fast as you get it without an upgrade to the R\u0026amp;D building that you cannot afford for quite a while yet.

Instead of balancing the 3 things, you really just deal with one of them and one of them only - the funding. And that means doing the *same* thing over and over and over, instead of doing new and interesting things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not impossible to fix it - it just needs some tweaking, and perhaps much more interesting contracts given out at low tech levels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the Funding grind wasn\u0027t DULL it wouldn\u0027t be a problem. But it becomes dull only because you\u0027re limited to only about 2-3 kinds of mission for a long time, so you\u0027ll end up doing the same mission again and again to get the funds up to unlock the more interesting stuff. It would be better if there was more variety to the low-tech starting part of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd that would require balancing the parts tree a bit better. Don\u0027t wait for tier 4 to let you make planes. Instead unlock bad plane parts early and better ones later. Don\u0027t wait for teir 4 to let you have wheels. Give you the tiny wheels early and better ones later so you can start doing some rover missions early on around Kerbin. Increase the *variety* of gameplay at low tech levels and the initial grind for Funds won\u0027t feel annoying anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd for the hard of thinking : A complaint about the grind and a complaint about the difficulty are NOT the same complaint. Any post that makes the argument that people shouldn\u0027t complain about the difficulty if they set the slider to \u0022Hard\u0022 is sort of ignoring the fact that most of the complaints about Hard mode have actually been more about the grind than the difficulty. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently, setting the slider to Hard has TWO effects:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1 - it makes it harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2 - it adds a lot of dull grinding up front in the early game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe challenge is how could SQUAD tweak it so that you get #1 without #2. I\u0027ve offered 2 suggestions up above:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA - Make building upgrades require some use of the other 2 types of currency as well, not just exclusively funds alone. That way you\u0027re not just accumulating science points and banking them doing nothing with them for a long time like you have to do now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB - Add a lot more variety to the early-game missions so that grinding for funds isn\u0027t as annoying anymore. What makes it annoying the the repetitive nature of them. \u0022Survey this set of spots\u0022 are all pretty much the same mission, and \u0022put a satellite in this particular strange orbit\u0022 are all pretty much the same mission, and \u0022test part Foo at altitude Bar and speed Baz\u0022 are all pretty much the same mission. Give you earlier planes and rovers and then you can have early missions like \u0022Land a rover here on Kerbin and drive it 2 km away from where it landed to test the rover system\u0022, or \u0022Try to fly as flat and level as possible so you keep your altitude within a 200 meter window for a distance of 5km over this location\u0022, and so on.

Combined with the \u0022Explore \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022 contracts, you can get a reasonable amount of all 3 currencies even without EVA, which can be upgraded into with the funds from the Mun. That, plus a few \u0022Science data from around \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0022 contracts (with solar panels, to leave transmitting probes in orbit forever) will give enough to upgrade either the VAB or the tracking station (I took the tracking, because despite playing before maneuver nodes, I was never any good at interplanetary transfers, and a land-and-return Mun rocket is a one-way Duna or Eve rocket with a decent enough launch window and/or aerobraking. After that, it\u0027s business as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s harder than it was, but \u0022Hard\u0022 was never hard anyway. I managed all of the above without making a single mistake, but that\u0027s because I\u0027m reasonably good at the game - I wouldn\u0027t expect someone new to the game to be able to build a 30 part Mun rocket capable of landing and returning, but at the same time I wouldn\u0027t expect that same player to start on hard in the first place.

That\u0027s the real big one. After that it\u0027s not so bad. But before that, you accumulate science above and beyond your ability to spend it, even when you\u0027re not trying particularly hard to gain science points. This is because the Funds you need to upgrade that R\u0026amp;D center come slower than the science comes and you can\u0027t help but accumulate science a lot faster than your funds will allow you to spend it. By the time you get the R\u0026amp;D center from level 1 to level 2, you\u0027ll be able to unlock about 5-6 tech nodes instantly, at the very least, from all the banked science points. They are balanced in Normal Mode, but Hard Mode made one a heck of a lot harder than it made the other, putting them way off balance compared to *each other*.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the suggestion to fix it by picking fund-heavy strategies in the admin building, the design of the game was *supposed* to be that you use those to push things off balance from the default if your play style is different, but currently you have to use them to repair the unbalanced default gameplay back TO being balanced again, thereby taking all the fun out of that building too since you can now only use it to do one thing and one thing only - push back against the unbalance of funds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit like driving a car with steering that pulls to the right so badly and is so out of whack that you have to turn the steering wheel almost all the way to the left just to go straight. Sure you *can* drive straight that way, but it will severely hamper your ability to steer to the left when you need to, because you\u0027re spending most of your leftward steering power just to go straight. Having to use all of the admin building\u0027s power to try to re-establish the off balance of the Hard mode settings back to the center again is crippling its use for its intended purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s frustrating because with a little bit of tweaking 0.90 would be great. The *system* is good, but the data its populated with is a bit off-centered, so to speak. And it\u0027s the off-center balance of Hard Mode, much more so than the general average overall difficulty of Hard Mode, that makes Hard mode feel like a grind during the early game. I hope when SQUAD addresses the balance like they say they intend to, they pay attention to the multitude of complaints about this, and not to the people who engage in the strawman fallacy of mischaracterizing the complaints as merely \u0022oooh it\u0027s too hard\u0022 and that\u0027s it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, once you get past the necessary grinding funds to get the R\u0026amp;D center up to level 2, the rest of the game opens up better from then on.
