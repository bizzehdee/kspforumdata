What I am trying to figure out, is I plan and execute a transfer to a high or lower orbit, whether or not it is to another sphere of influence is irrelevant. I want to know, is there a way to calculate how much speed you will lose going to that higher orbit (before circularization) and how long it will take for that change in velocity to occur.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sporkafife","CreatedById":38208,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-04T14:57:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, this is all possible through the power of maths! Although I don\u0027t know the maths involved and would probably fail horrifically if I tried to work it out, it is possible. I know Scott Manley did an IVA only Mun mission using a bunch of tables that showed him orbital velocities at different altitudes. Then it is possible to see the period of your transfer orbit, and half of that will be about how long it takes to get to apoapsis\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, a spreadsheet type deal that shows you altitude against velocity, as well as a function that works out the delta-v required for a Hohmann transfer isn\u0027t actually that difficult if you know the basics of the maths behind orbits and how to do maths on a spreadsheet. Great, now I wanna make a spreadsheet \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
