In all of them, however, the lander is as short and wide as possible. Not only does this provide better stability when landing on steep slopes, but it also facilitates giving it balanced RCS thrusters if the mission involves docking the lander to anything. And docking is more likely needed at other planets.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen building short, wide landers, it\u0026#39;s never necessary to go all \u0022starfish\u0022 with the tanks arranged like wheel spokes. First, they don\u0026#39;t like being attached that way (they much prefer to be parallel with the central stack). Second, if you don\u0026#39;t think several parallel tanks are wide enough, you can always put the landing legs out on outriggers made of structural I-beams or box girders to widen their stance. This doens\u0026#39;t seem to create enough extra aerodynamic drag to worry about.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo really, the 1st step is to determine what, if anything, you intend to return to the surface of Kerbin. Given that you can EVA, grab all the data from experiments, and stuff them in the capsule, there\u0026#39;s no real need to return anything except the capsule unless you just want to recover more parts for their scrap value. This is especially useful if you send a scientist because he can reload the Goo and Materials experiments for use in multiple biomes per trip. And as long as you\u0026#39;ve got the OKTO probe core unlocked, you don\u0026#39;t need a pilot to use SAS, so 1 scientist \u002B 1 OKTO is the most cost-effective science-grabbing crew available.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnyway, desing and buld whatever will end up on Kerbin\u0026#39;s surface at the end of the mission. Capsule, parachute(s), heat shield, plus anything else you think is too expensive to abandon. Then design the whole rest of the mission and the necessary rockets around that. Just remember, the more mass you bring back, the more chutes it will need, so the heavier it is, which means it needs more rocket to get anywhere, which makes the whole thing more expensive, and outweighs the savings on a few small parts attached to the capsule at the end.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNote that it\u0026#39;s quite possible to put radial decouplers between the central, recoverable stack and the radial fuel/engine/leg modules. That way, the last job of the lander engines is the de-orbit burn, after which you dump them and just land the central core. This works great for short trips to Mun and Minmus.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHowever, there\u0026#39;s no sense at all in bringing a whole lander all the way home from another planet. Even if you do intend to make further use of it (which is rare), why burn the fuel to move it back and forth? Much better to leave it where it\u0026#39;s useful, at the planet it was designed for. This leads to the overall mission concept of the mothership. In this scheme, you have 2 separate components that dock together: a lander specific to the target planet and a crew transport. The general idea is, the crew transport takes the crew there and back. At some point in the trip, the lander docks with the crew transport to pick up crew, lands on the planet, and returns to the transport with the crew and data. The data and crew go back into the transport, the lander is left behind, and the transport returns to Kerbin.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo there you have 3 general options for a landing-and-return mission to another planet:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. Scaled-Up Mun Rocket\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo docking. You have just 1 vehicle, a rocket with a lander on top. However, having a multi-stage lander is desirable, so you don\u0026#39;t have to lift the legs and such from the surface again, you just fly home in the lander\u0026#39;s upper stage(s). Simple mission but you have a much bigger, heavier lander than the other options, which means a bigger, more expensive rocket. Still, quite workable.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. The Mothership\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere you dock the lander to the crew transport in LKO and send them out as 1 unit. Lander only has to get down, back up, and rendezvou, so is pretty small and light. However, the crew transport is bigger and more expensive than necessary because it has to get both itself and the lander out there (although only itself home).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n3. The Flotilla\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere you have a lander as in #2 but a crew transport only big enough to move itself. They go out separately and rendezvous at the destination prior to landing. Somewhat cheaper than the mothership concept, plus a lot easier to maneuver and you have fewer parts in the same place most of the time. And if you can handle sending multiple ships to the same place at once, which isn\u0026#39;t difficult at all (see link in my sig for a flotilla tutorial), you can send a dozen or more. Full constellation of satellites, a whole ISRU set-up, permanent colonists, you name it.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T23:53:32Z","Content":"\n[quote]\u003Cbr\u003E\n2.

For example an Eve lander by necessity needs high TWR and engines that can work under high atmospheric pressure. Sure you could use such engines to make an interplanetary trip but they are not optimized for it. If instead you send the Eve lander to Eve with a nuclear thermal rocket powered mothership then you no longer need to refuel the lander before landing on Eve or need to build an integrated interplanetary stage to the lander.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso another important factor: once you designate your interplanetary mothership as \u0022deep space only\u0022 this opens up the option of reuseability. Just like how the mothership remains in orbit while the landers land in the outward part of the trip, upon returning to Kerbin you can elect to park the Mothership in low Kerbin orbit. The crew and the data can return to KSC via SSTO space shuttles and the Mothership refueled by your orbital infrastructure and be prepared for the next trip.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, for target worlds were SSTO landers are possible (so basically all of them except Eve and Tylo), once the landing is complete you simply leave the lander back in orbit and have the crew move to the mothership on the return leg of the trip. This means on the next trip to that world you already have a lander waiting in orbit and all the mothership have to do is bring fuel to refuel the lander for another landing.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere are some images of my interplanetary trips using this mothership-lander architecture:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nDuna \u002B Ike double landing\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i50.tinypic.com/2hzh4oz.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nLanding on all four moons of Jool (Pol didn\u0026#39;t exist back when I did this mission)\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://i42.tinypic.com/m8zhn9.jpg[/img]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEve \u002B Gilly double landing, including an Eve rover for driving to the ocean\u003Cbr\u003E\n[img]http://108.imagebam.com/download/pDGNiG6An__Fltu2YmOYJw/25596/255950333/screenshot1124.jpg[/img]\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxL_1023","CreatedById":152317,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-24T00:11:13Z","Content":"\nI usually just put an ISRU and mining drill \u002B ore tank on any lander intended for another planet.

It looks nice!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n@Pondweed, the fascinating thing about your question is that engineers and scientists at NASA struggled with a similar concept when designing the mission mode for the Apollo moon landings. I highly recommend reading the section entitled \u0022Apollo Mission mode selection\u0022 on this wikipedia page: [url]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_orbit_rendezvous[/url]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe mission mode you propose isn\u0026#39;t quite \u0022direct ascent\u0022 because your lander wouldn\u0026#39;t return to the [I]surface [/I]of Kerbin per se, but you have already identified some of the main drawbacks of your mission mode -- the lander has to carry fuel for the return trip to Kerbin. It has to haul this fuel to the surface of your destination celestial body and back to orbit. This not only makes the lander heavier and and rather ungainly (as you have mentioned), but it also expends a great deal more [I]total[/I] fuel for the entire mission than if you designed the lander to only return to orbit around the destination celestial body, not Kerbin, and used a \u0022mothership\u0022 or Command Module to do the returning.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFurthermore, in my experience playing KSP so far, I estimate that one can use a single lander design that is sufficient (but not optimal) for about 60% of the moons and planets in KSP. Each of the other 40% of the bodies in KSP require their own, individualized, dedicated landers with special planning and often at least 2 stages. So your lander probably isn\u0026#39;t reusable for a little less than half the stuff anyway. While we\u0026#39;re on the subject of reusability and efficiency, you\u0026#39;re going to gain more by leaving your lander in orbit around a given celestial body for future visitors than by expending fuel shipping that lander back and forth between planetary systems.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAll that said, it is an interesting design challenge to keep your mission mode idea. I\u0026#39;d love to see what you come up with! Not everything in this game is about \u0022conform to this rule because it is the most efficient.

I\u0026#39;ve done it both ways enough times to know :).\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe ONLY small, negligible benefit to doing it mothership-style is only having to manage 1 ship. Everything else is in favor of flotillas.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhether you do a mothership or a flotilla, the lander is equally optimized for its job so that\u0026#39;s a wash. But with the mothership, the crew transport is compromised by having to be big enough to move not only itself but also the lander out to the destination. This increased size of the crew transport means a bigger lifter, and the cost of rockets increases faster than the masses of their payloads, so you always spend more doing a mothership than a flotilla. And it gets even worse if there are multiple destinations (say a planet and its moon). The Jool 5 Challenge is completely the wrong way to do things because you have to lug the entire mass around instead of sending small, specialized units to each moon.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd the case for flotillas beomces even stronger if you\u0026#39;re doing more than just a 1-shot landing. What if you want to land in every biome on both Duna and Ike? You\u0026#39;ll certainly need to refuel the lander multiple times for that. Which means you\u0026#39;ll need to map both bodies. Are you going to make the mothership go from polar to equatorial orbits at both places? That was be insane. No, you\u0026#39;ll send probes for that. Plus something to get ore, turn it into fuel, and deliver it to your other ships. Thus, you\u0026#39;ll be sending 4-5 ships just to suppor the main mission, so there\u0026#39;s no reason not to split the main mission up into its component parts as well.

And if these are nuke stages which you then drop that\u0026#39;s a lot of nuke engines that you are throwing away. Putting all those engines onto a mothership means they can be reused on later trips and there won\u0026#39;t be any hot reactors flowing around Kerbol.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I did my Jool 4 mission the mission architecture was:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1.
