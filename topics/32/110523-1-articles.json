Even struts count, and decouplers etc. You run out of \u0022space\u0022 really quick. I know the idea is to limit people in early career but they are already limited by money and amount of modules available, and the weight that the launch pad allows. It makes sense that you need to upgrade the VAB if you want to build large vessels. But why cant the smallest VAB support vessels with say 30 or more parts?

Apparently this is a debatable concept even inside Squad, but, I think adding an easily overcome early-game 30-part count restriction to mass/dimensions, is as legitimate of a game concept to include, as other arbitrary things folks come up with in the spacecraft challenge thread. It\u0027s a puzzle challenge. Again, the key part for me is the first tier restriction is easily overcome. \n\nI think it\u0027s less easily overcome than it could be, perhaps due to the missing upgrade Tier, which may have increased the planned first upgrade cost. Tier 0 was planned from the beginning but yanked close to release after forum outcry over design and polish. The intended cost and limit numbers may have been compressed. 3-tier 30/255/unlimited could become something like 4-tier 30/125/255/unlimited. I don\u0027t think they would increase \u002230\u0022, because the most the first batch of contracts intend for us to do, is achieve orbit \u0026 perhaps fly by the moons.
