I really want to do something like this because 1) I need someone to play with without the time expensive multiplayer files that I dont understand, because I\u0027m not exactly the smartest person ever, and 2) because collaboration seems like a fun thing to do. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am a heavy mod user so don\u0027t read further if that bothers you. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are links to all the mods I will most likely be using...

My game (anyones) can crash using this one, along with this many mods already) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you would like to add more mods I might be able to handle a couple more with the loss of planet factory.... I am willing to change all but kethane and Interstellar pack. Mechjeb is preferable to regular jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules: 1) There can only be two players. Playing time is limited to who has the current save file. This is because you must save to that dominant save file when you have it. However, if you do not do this you cannot save to that save file you will save to another one. You cannot merge save files as far as I know. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) ALL SHIPS MUST BE LABELED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL. Example, My username is Mild Micah, So my label for a space station could be MM-ISS. If your name was MildMike, And your label would also be MM, you could put MMI, Or MMX, Or any other label that separates your vessel from mine and vise verse. Next, the labeling will be either -P , -N, or -O. -P would be private. If i wanted MM-ISS to be private I would label it MM-ISS-P. And so on for MMX\u0027s vessels. These labels mean that ONLY THAT SPECIFIC PLAYER CAN MODIFY THE VESSEL IN ANY WAY. However, if the opposite player wants to see the vessel, they must rendezvous with the vessel. However they cannot dock with any -P labeled ships. If you want a device or vessel to be neutral it will be -N. -N means that EITHER PLAYER can CONTROL, FLY, LAND, or in ANY OTHER WAY Operate the vessel. They may add to it or take away from it if it is a station or terminate it\u0027s flight. Anyone may dock with the vessel. And no exterior rules can be written in the save files description. -O is optional. -O only allows for the rules written by the individual creater of said vessel. These vessels may only be destroyed by the creator. However, if you make a station labeled MM-ISS-O, any player can dock with the station and take any of its resources. Unless the individual says otherwise. Cheating here is always a problem, so I would rather a loyal person play and follow these rules. If a -O vessel is put into orbit it is viable that any player can fly it, as long as it doesn\u0027t destroy the vessel. They could change its inclination or its apo, or peri and so on. If they wanted to they could send it to Duna or the MUN, so on. Think of it as a prop. Anyone can use it and do with it as they wish. It can be a space tug or a low profile satellite or a cheap station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 3) no vessel labeled -N can be destroyed because it is property of both players. It\u0027s flight cannot be terminated. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 3A) No vessels flight can be terminated by an apposing player. Only the original author of that vessel can terminate it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 4) player time will be limited. I will discuss this per person. If you want 2 days it will be two days to hold the save. We can share the save via Email. Basically rule 1. But we will set it our selves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 5) travel isn\u0027t limited. Anyone can fly or launch anywhere. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 6) cheats are not allowed. No infinite fuel of any types and no gravity cheats either. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 7) Rule seven kind of breaks most of the rules. Any vessel labeled -W is meant for wartime purposes. Vessels labeled -W can only be destroyed by missiles (not any laser guided stuff). So this is pretty creative. If you want we could use the rophamere. however it\u0027s spelled. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ... But that isnt required. I would rather not use it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERule 8) Any debris created per file save played by that person must be deleted. If a missile destroys someone else\u0027s vessel, the person who owns the destroyed vessel must terminate that debris. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Erule 9) BE CREATIVE. DO ALL THAT YOU CAN TO EXPAND YOUR POWER AND YOUR CONTROL. BUILD MASSIVE STATIONS THAT HOLD TONS OF KERBALS OR THAT REPROCESS LOTS OF FUEL OR TURN KETHANE INTO FUEL. Do anything you like that abides by the rules. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may post to this but any unrelated posts aren\u0027t appreciated. Please reply if you wish to get my email and chat more about things. Thanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
