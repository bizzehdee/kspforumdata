I recently setup a site dedicated to tracking devs for a multitude of games, and one of those games is KSP! It supports aggregated dev news from any source assuming I know to add it. Right now the KSP dashboard is following the main Twitter page, the KSPTV Twitter page, KSP Dev MaxMaps Twitter page, KSP Steam news, KSP Tumblr blog, and the news blog on the main site. I\u0027m working on following the devs in the main forum. Am I missing any sources? Are there devs posting anywhere I don\u0027t know about? Any feedback would be great. Thanks!\n\n[http://www.devtrackers.com/kerbal-space-program](http://www.devtrackers.com/kerbal-space-program)\n\nEdit: I\u0027m realizing the foundation I\u0027ve made just isn\u0027t going to cut it. It doesn\u0027t have enough flexibility, and as a result the dev trackers aren\u0027t nearly as organized as I\u0027d like. I need to rebuild about half of it. I have it tentatively planned out, but it will be time consuming. In the mean time I\u0027ll do what I can to make the current site adequate for the people interested, and failover to a new website here in the coming month. Thank you!\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-27T00:30:01Z\u0022 title=\u002203/27/2015 12:30  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by devtrackers**\n  \nClarification"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-26T17:39:31Z","Content":"Some of the people you\u0027ve linked in your sources aren\u0027t devs afaik.
