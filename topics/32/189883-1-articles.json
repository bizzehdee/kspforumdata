vessels, since we lack any solid method to have hangar doors in stock.\u00A0 I used to use combination of cargo bays, antennas, airbrakes, control surfaces, ect, but all those methods required massive part count and looked really bad if you were trying to go for a clean appearance with the doors.\u00A0 The best way imo were \u003Cs\u003Ecargo\u003C/s\u003E err bomb bays like 2 MK2s arranged so that when extended fully their doors meshed and closed a larger opening, but even that method didnt look very pretty and required massive space to implement in a way that wasnt visually

just big enough for a starfighter or 2 (2 if they are small ones), and the improved version uses the actuators for sliding doors that fit almost perfectly with the rest of the ship in asthetic dept (ended up using MH panels since they just fit the looks better, but i could have always used normal wing panels if i didnt want to touch MH parts for some reason).\u00A0 Thusfar, doors are the only truly common use i have for robotic parts, since its relativelhy bug free to make em, and solong as you give the actuators enough force to hold doors open in gravity, it functions flawlessly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other somewhat common use is the propellers, they are a bit buggy, but its finally a way to make a practical \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E transport that doesnt require constant IRSU.\u00A0 Powering props on \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Environmental Visual Enhancement (mod)\u0022\u003EEVE\u003C/abbr\u003E is still a major hurdle (we dont have any big RTGs and larger solar panels tend to break off), but at least we have a method of propelling flying vessels there without mods or cheats.\u00A0 Also useful on kerbin but less so since there are jet engines (they still use fuel, but are so damn efficient that you might as well just pack alot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and call it a day).\u00A0 Nice on duna as well, but more difficult to use and rockets are still not too bad due to the ultra-low drag and ability to use nukes at ground level (near max \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Specific Impulse (rocketry) or Internet Service Provider\u0022\u003EISP\u003C/abbr\u003E even though there is

autostrut locked feature you cant really make the wheels jump around like you could in the old days and make springs by putting wheels on the end of 5\u002B cubic struts thatd flex.\u00A0 With robit parts you can actually force disable the autostrut by putting a robotic part somewhere in the loop, and set it to allow like no degrees of travel.\u00A0 Its a hacky solution, and it will NOT work for every vehicle (sometimes the wheels start to wobble like mad especially if its heavy), but its finally opened the door for actual custom suspensions and while i only have 1 vehicle that ive successfully made using it, it is a neat feature i like to mess with.\u00A0 the screenshots aint that great, but it shows the gist of what i use, those small servos have a girder and the wheel is attached to the girder, allowing the wheel to move up/down far more then the crappy default suspension would have allowed it.\u00A0 The vehicle is a bit of a prototype, but sofar the hull itself (without any armor on it) can survive a drop on duna with 1 single parachute cause the suspension resists pressure so well...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFinally, i use legs for making mechs, albeit thusfar ive been unable to make a actual functional robit that walks on 2 legs, and can engage in combat, ive managed the 2 legged walk, but the weapons were so damn inaccurate they were useless.\u00A0 That and while this was what i was most excited with regards to robit parts, the combination of bugs and i guess my inability to make a 2 legged thing work reliably has limited my enjoyment thusfar of that 1 aspect of the DLC.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nStill, i think the DLC was worth it.\u00A0 Its alot less screwy then IR was (havent tried any recent iterations of it, but the last time i did use it it had way more limitations and was just buggy much moreso then stock robitics is), and it opens up some neat options in the game imo.\u00A0 The ground stuff not a huge deal, but i still think the planet scatters look neat, and the sci stuff adds to immersion (even if i only play sandbox, looks really cool stuck out in front of a orbitally dropped housing unit/outpost.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"djr5899","CreatedById":182804,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-11-20T19:08:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMe personally, I\u0027d love to use the robotic
