Is 146 hours rubbish and slow trying just to get to the Mun and orbiting or is it dedication lol. Today I have finally orbited Mun with my Rocket after 146 Hours its orbiting 61km and 60KM above mun. I have finally also figured out how to do Asparagus staging for the fule. I just cant believe it took me 146 hours to learn. lol. How long did it take you?. I no there still lots to learn but this is a big brake threw for me. I don\u0027t no why but listening to Two Steps from Hell and Audio Machine at the same time must have helped as this is the only thing different I have done since playing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xetalim","CreatedById":64539,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T19:41:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took me at least 100 hours to get in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rowsdower","CreatedById":91811,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-25T20:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESome take more, some take less.

(think it was 17 or there abouts).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter about 20 launches I managed an orbit that could be charitably called eliptical (As I recall it was 73 km by 560 km). Lack of knowledge of gravity turns and a tendency (still active tendency) of underpowred 1st stages seemed to really hamper me. It was another 50 or so launches before I was able to hit an orbital target height regularly. Then docking ports arrived and I had to start all over. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI downloaded 10 mods (KW, Nova, HOME and other bobcat stuff, random odds and ends I now forget, and mech jeb) and proceeded to suck for a long time again. 20 more launches to get a feel for all the new parts, 10 more to figure out Mech Jeb enough to be lazy. So another 30 launches total for docking parts with mods into space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll was well, only a big tweak since then was the ASAS redo, which only had a 10 launch learning curve.
