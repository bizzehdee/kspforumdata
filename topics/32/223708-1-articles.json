It still seems to set the bar for processing and GPU power. Would like to get a gaming laptop where I can run HIGH \u00A0part count vehicles. And no issues with frame rates. any recommendations? Software wise, I\u0027m very tech savvy, but as far as hardware goes, I\u0027m a little out of touch.\u003Cbr\u003E\nThanks.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geek.Verve","CreatedById":232601,"CreatedDateTime":"2024-02-23T15:17:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPeople often hate on them for their lower value to cost prospects, but every Alienware laptop I\u0027ve ever used was great. I think their reliability only got better, when they were bought by Dell several years ago. Razer makes awesome looking/feeling models, too, but they\u0027ve had a spotty track record for reliability.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf price is a significant factor, the HP gaming laptops are pretty good. They tend to do well on the quality of the components for the price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always felt the \u0022gamer\u0022 brand laptops such as Asus, MSI, etc. were a bit of a roll of the dice, as many of them are just rebranded versions of OEM models. Look through the available options at XoticPC.com and you\u0027ll like spot a few Clevos that look just like those name brand models. Asus typically does a better job of dressing theirs up to look different with perhaps a few additional features, though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I were in the market and had the budget, I\u0027d go with Alienware.
