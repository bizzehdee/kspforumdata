However getting all my parts to 1 catch the station, and 2 then dock correctly is proving to be harder then expected. Would building for lack of a better word a space tugboat make things easier? Basically build a craft that\u0027s nothing but RCS tanks and that has thrusters all over the f ing place.

Scott Manley designed something just like that for Reusable Space Program, in fact. Basically all you need is: docking ports on either end, core, battery, solar panels, monopropellant, and 2 sets of 4 any-direction RCS thrusters.
