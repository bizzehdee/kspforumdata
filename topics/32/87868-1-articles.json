So take a look at my installed mods if you want to add different/new ideas... Here\u0027s what I\u0027ve come up with so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMunar Regolith-Mining Base:\u003C/strong\u003E This idea revolves around constructing a Munar surface base to mine regolith for LqdOxygen and Aluminum (KSP-Interstellar allows me to set up ISRU refineries for this purpose- but they have rather large electrical power requirements to operate at full capacity). In its simplest form, this would have me deploy a base with a pair of built-in Gigantor solar panels, and use those to power the ISRU refinery (in the newest versions of KSP-I, surplus ElectricCharge gets converted to MegaJoules- and solar panels can directly run MPD\u0027s and refineries...) A more complicated, but cost-effective plan, would see me leave the heavy solar panels behind, and power the refinery with Microwave Beamed Power from the KSC (produced from either nuclear or solar sources), and begin deploying a series of orbital power-relays (repeater stations) in orbit as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EOrbital Mass-Relays/ Momentum-Exchangers:\u003C/strong\u003E One of the more complicated ideas, this relies on me exploiting Conservation of Momentum to my space program\u0027s advantage. Basically, I would set up a space station with two sets of Mass Drivers facing in opposite directions (in 2x symmetry with a central \u0022loading area\u0022 in the middle). Then, whenever I had two payloads needing to travel in opposite directions- for instance a crew capsule ready to return home \u003Cstrong\u003Eor a piece of debris I want to de-orbit\u003C/strong\u003E, and a fuel tanker I\u0027m looking to boost into a higher orbit- I would fire off both mass drivers in rapid succession.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternatively, I would build just one longer coil of Mass Drivers, and turn the whole station around using RCS or reaction wheels. Would be tricky to get right (I need to impart equal momentum to both payloads- which probably means tweaking the power levels between launches), and likely require installation of ExtraPlanetary Launchpads to construct the whole thing in orbit (Mass Drivers- as little more than simple coils of aluminum wire- are one of the few things we could realistically build in orbit in the near future...) The payoffs would be relatively slight either way, although I could construct two such stations- one in Kerbin orbit (crew return capsules go retrograde, almost anything else the other way), and one in orbit of the Mun (landers and fuel ferries go retrograde to surface bases and unexplored biomes, vessels finished making refueling stops the other way...) Microwave Beamed Power would also help this to work efficiently, as the Mass Drivers require a lot of power to function...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis idea also birthed a discussion thread on the Science Labs sub-forum:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98615-Using-orbital-debris-as-reaction-mass-profiting-from-orbital-mass-drivers\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/98615-Using-orbital-debris-as-reaction-mass-profiting-from-orbital-mass-drivers\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMun/Minmus Ground-Based Mass-Drivers:\u003C/strong\u003E Like the mass drivers I\u0027ve been using to assist my launches on Kerbin, except hauled to one of its moons (or built there from hauled materials using ExtraPlanetary Launchpads), and deployed mostly horizontally due to the lack of an atmosphere (when launching on atmosphere-less moons, you want to tip over and build horizontal velocity as soon as possible) The tricky part about this is properly supporting the Mass Drivers with KAS ground pylons, so the recoil doesn\u0027t send them flying in the opposite direction, and deploying the Mass Drivers into a horizontal position in the first place (a sufficiently tall stack, when tipped, could explode...) I also have my concerns about launching horizontally- namely, how do I line up my rockets properly? This might require specially-designed craft or ground-based cranes/winches (and possibly Infernal Robotics- which I\u0027ve still never tackled the challenge of learning) in order to load the craft into the Mass Driver- which would *greatly* limit its utility. Still, it can\u0027t be denied that free Delta-V (especially on a moon where there is no atmosphere to sap it away) is always nice...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMicrowave Beamed Power Network:\u003C/strong\u003E Eventually, I\u0027m going to be relying on Microwave Beamed Power to the point that I use it for Heavy Launch Vehicles (like I\u0027ve done in past saves- just check out \u0022Kerbin and Beyond: a Maturing Space Program\u0022). But in the meantime, I\u0027ve yet to unlock the required tech node (Specialized Electrics). The science from my first Munar landings could change that- but it\u0027s going to represent a significant investment of my valuable Science points, slowing down my progress in other areas as a result. Still, it opens up or saves costs on a lot of exciting possibilities. From large interplanetary \u0022motherships\u0022 which carry a KSP-Interstellar refinery onboard, and use beamed power to split stored water into LiquidH2 and LqdOxygen (thus allowing storage of LH2/LOX in deep space at much higher density and without any of the associated boil-off issues) right before they or parasitic ships perform orbital maneuvers or landings, to using beamed power to power both orbital and surface-based offworld Mass Drivers and ISRU refineries, the possibilities are endless. It could also come in rather handy for small ion-powered probes in the short run (even providing the power of a couple Gigantors, with only the small mass of a Microwave Receiver, is well worth it for an ion-powered Jool probe...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerosene Fuel Depots:\u003C/strong\u003E When it comes to specific impulse for chemical rockets, LH2/LOX propulsion is king. But it has serious boil-off issues, and the only good way to handle those (without an active-cooling system option to mitigate boil-off: which NathanKell, the creator of RealFuels, has vaguely hinted at might eventually be coming with a \u0022RealHeat\u0022 mod- but I don\u0027t foresee getting to use anytime in the immediate future...) is by storing in as LqdWater and electrolyzing it- which requires large amounts of electrical power. A simpler option is to store Kerosene long-term in orbit of the Mun (which doesn\u0027t have boil-off issues) and complement it with LqdOxygen launched using reusable Aluminum-Hybrid rocket launches (the Mun might not have much water outside of the poles, but Aluminum-Oxide regolith is one thing it has in abundance). The Kerosene still has to be launched from Kerbin in tankers, of course (although it *is* possible to manufacture it on carbon-rich planets/moons in real-life using the Reverse Water Gas Shift and Fischer-Tropsch reactions, something I have long been bugging FractalUK to implement as a reaction for Duna and Laythe...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis way, I only have to launch only a portion of the fuel mass as if I continue to rely on hypergolics for deep-space operations, and get to benefit from Kero/LOX\u0027s moderately improved ISP vs. hypergolics. If I choose this plan, I might also install the engine parts (and some other odds-and-ends, such as KW\u0027s 3.75 meter docking port) from KW Rocketry, since few of the NovaPunch2 engines currently can utilize Kerosene (although this is something I should take up with NathanKell- I don\u0027t see any good reason for this restriction...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EAtmosphere-Skimming Propulsive Fluid Accumulators:\u003C/strong\u003E This one is a long-shot. I\u0027ve tried developing these designs before (in \u0022Kerbin and Beyond: a Maturing Space Program\u0022), but was hindered by stock KSP\u0027s fuel-burn ratios (10 tons of LiquidFuel are burned for every ton of Oxidizer), and my inability to utilize the majority of the atmosphere that was generating drag for my harvesting-ship (Nitrogen, despite having a number of potential uses in real life: from ISRU processing into N2O4 to use in \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.wired.com/2009/02/plasmathruster/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ENitrogen-electric engines\u003C/a\u003E, has absolutely no use in KSP-Interstellar). However, this time I have FAR installed, which should allow for a more realistic drag model (and relatively less drag skimming the upper atmosphere as a result), RealFuels- which should allow me to burn fuel mixtures that are more realistic and thus more Oxygen by mass (Kero/LOX is over 70-80% Oxygen by mass in its stoichiometic ratio, and LH2/LOX is 88.9% Oxygen by mass- so I have relatively more demand for my harvested LqdOxygen) as well as having realistically higher ISP than stock LFO, and the option of simply installing Karbonite and circumventing the madness of 65 x 65 km harvesting \u0022orbits\u0022 by skimming LqdOxygen from *above* the Karman Line (what I assume the edge of the atmosphere represents in stock, and where real Propulsive Fluid Accumulator designs would actually operate), thus drastically cutting down on my fuel-expenses for station-keeping in the first place...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also bugging FractalUK to add a Nitrogen resource (which I could easily convert to the RealFuels version with a MM patch) and fuel-mode for the KSP-Interstellar plasma thruster, and possibly allow players to skim atmospheres from above the Karman line (like can be done in real life- there are still occasional atmospheric particles above this altitude), either/both of which would make this proposition MUCH more realistic/profitable- if still somewhat tedious... (no time-warp above 4x below the Karman line, or 10x just above it)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPermanent Science Outposts:\u003C/strong\u003E KSP-Interstellar adds Science Labs, which can produce Science points at a very gradual rate if supplied with enough electricity. FractalUK (the mod author) is also working on integrating them into the stock science system- although I don\u0027t know how much progress he\u0027s made with that yet (they may already be integrated in the version I\u0027m running- I haven\u0027t checked yet...)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis provides an actual incentive for building permanent stations/outposts: whether on the surface of the Mun or in orbit of Kerbin. The further out from Kerbin I go, the more lucrative the research is- but also the more expensive it\u0027s going to be to resupply them if/when I install TAC Life Support, since they require a crew of 2 Kerbals to operate (unless the ECLSS Greenhouse mod ever gets updated for 0.25- which would allow me to equip these stations/outposts with biological regenerative life-support systems and virtually eliminate the need for regular supply missions- at the expense of a very high mass I would have to get to orbit- as greenhouses are rather heavy...) Without TACLS, or with an adequate number of greenhouses, I could even make a profit off the research- by converting the science points into funding through Strategies...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll of these are ambitious infrastructure projects, although some are much more difficult than others.
