It interacts with active radiators based on its own rules. It does not interact with any other parts besides active radiators. The only part it can interact with is the part that carries the core itself. In other words, if the core is hotter than the part that carries it, it can create a heat flux that increases the part\u0027s internal temperature. How high this heat flux is is governed by the core\u0027s own rules, not the \u0022normal\u0022 heat conduction mechanics between parts or between internals and skin. Generally, this \u0022core leakage\u0022 is very small, and there exists no scenario where a core in a drill or ISRU will stabilize its temperature based on leakage alone.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf an active radiator is present (and within range, for the fixed panels), and if the core is also at or above its target temperature (if the core is not at its target yet, it will continue to heat up regardless of radiator presence until it hits the target), the core will lower its own heat output by the radiator\u0027s \u0022core transfer\u0022 value. If enough radiators are present that their combined \u0022core transfer\u0022 number exceeds the core\u0027s internal heat production, it is canceled out entirely, and the core is stabilized (stays at its target temperature indefinitely).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you read the above carefully, you will notice that at no point, there is any statement about the ability of a radiator to provide cooling. That is because for core heat, there is practically no such thing. There is only the \u0022core transfer\u0022 value, which is an extra stat on the radiator, independent of its cooling capabilities, which will interact with the core directly and bypasses all heat simulation. Now, if you test this ingame and look closely, you might notice that a radiator engaged in \u0022cooling\u0022 a core actually gains a small internal flux value, as if it was indeed removing heat from something... but that flux is very small. Like 1/100th of the (already small) core transfer or something, I forget the precise value. The point is, it\u0027s so small as to be completely meaningless - it\u0027s probably there for debug purposes only, or perhaps to allow something like the radiator failing to provide core transfer in the presence of extremely high ambient heat (like being close to the Sun).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo make things more complicated, though: a radiator engaged in providing its full core transfer to one or more core(s) is regarded as being under full load, despite it handling no (appreciable) amounts of heat at all. But, should there be a part on the ship that requires actual cooling, the radiator will try to deal with that as well, splitting its capacity. This means that less than the full core transfer value is available to the drills and/or ISRU, meaning that they will start overheating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"moogoob","CreatedById":118251,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-12T12:41:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the LV-N tests!
