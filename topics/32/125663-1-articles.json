KSP is great game, the idea behind it is also great, the work you did is awsome!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI am playing KSP since 0.22 and I am really enjoying it. With some exceptions.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nEvery new version you release brings a lot of new stuff, fixes a lot of bugs, but also driving me mad. Why you can\u0026#39;t just follow some standard software releasing schemas? Why every new version, now I mean MINOR version releases, behaves completely differently so my ships I have built does not work anymore? Also, I have to re-download all plugins (mods) I have installed as you probably completely change API (or at least something in it) and plugins for older versions does not work. This is usually problem as releasing of mods is delayed. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlso, the patcher does not work for ages (maybe since 0.24, I don\u0026#39;t remember exactly) so it means I have to re-download completely whole game as I am not Steam user and patching is not done automatically. If I don\u0026#39;t check there was something bad in the build (as in 1.05 1024) I have to go to forums and check everything on my own as there is no any notification in the game itself (as i am not using launcher since patcher does not work I am not looking to announcements - you can say my bad, but guys, please make it work for us who supported you before official release with hope you will get more money without any intention of Steam).I have to work, take care of my family, friends and when I finally find some time to play I have to sink into forum and look for everything while I just to have some fun and just play.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nPlease take a think about releases. I know you are trying to bring us the best you can, but it is really annoying to be waiting and looking for new release and in the end just to play old version full of bugs just because I have a lot of stuff in the campaign already and simply, both versions are not compatible together (at least my stuff is not compatible, because you decide to change drag stuff, update engine, whatever). It is really pity it works in this way and if it will not change somehow, I have to stop to play it, because I have just limited time and I don\u0026#39;t want to start new campaign with every new version you release or at least rework all my stuff.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFrom my perspective it would be much better to fix bugs we are experiencing since 0.22 (i.e. firing kerbal to opposite side of space when I am just trying to leave or board the module) or make better user interface in the map - I would appreciate to know how much fuel I have even when I am switched in the space map. Also it would be great see how AP/PE/ASC/DESC is changing when I am planning maneuver - without additional necessary mooving of the cursor above these points. Also I would appreciate adding of some HUDs to normal game window - it is really hard to make an orbit without knowing basic things as AP, PE (its easy now when I played tenths of hours already, I can somehow estimate it, but when I want to establish exact orbit I have to switch to map and back to check fuel, orbital points...) - I know I can use mods, but guys, every rocket in the world has this indicators inside of the ship... What is really bad is complete loose of control over the ship when I am switching to space map... Until I open nav, I don\u0026#39;t know what is going on and I can\u0026#39;t control the ship. The staging is sometimes also not ideal, please take a look on it. And if you include possibility to modify custom action in the space I will be the most happy guy in the world. From real perspective, this can be done much easier from inside of the ship than changing of staging.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis type of changes could be included in some minor version as it usually will not affect any already working and tuned ship or most of available mods. If you add or change anything affecting ships and flight properties, if you add new parts or do a big changes affecting mods this should be released in some major release, but still, you should consider supporting of older versions, especially in bugfixing. Believe or not, it takes hours to fine tune the ship to go smoothly to its destination/back and work properly for the whole time. I don\u0026#39;t want to do this again and again with every new release. It is not funny anymore.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI hope you catched my idea and you will change approach to new releases a little bit as this is really bad at this time. I could excuse it till 1.0, but now it is really driving me mad.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBesides that I am still Squad and KSP fan :)\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nFranta\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-16T23:11:10Z","Content":"\nThere is no \u0022standard software releasing schema.\u0022 Most of the bugs you mention aren\u0026#39;t actually SQUAD\u0026#39;s fault.

This simply can\u0026#39;t be because they changed engine to newer version. I am not sure you are right when you say it does not make sense to fix bugs while they are updating - not just engine, but whole game. That bug with kerbal flying over whole space while he is trying to grab ladder is here since early versions of KSP. As the behaviour is still the same it leads me to think that the physical engine didn\u0026#39;t change so much, but the game (or parameters) which is actually using it changed a lot multiple times.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI din\u0026#39;t say I can\u0026#39;t control ship. I said I lose control of it. At least for a while until I click the arrow (what takes some time and during atmospheric flight it can cause crash or other unexpected behavior of the craft - happened to me many times the ship started rotating just because I lost control over it for 1 second.

I.E. outposts... As there is no real possibility to join everything anywhere (i.e. on duna or much worse on eve), you have to bring it there completed as much as possible - far away from reality. Also, almost every rocket is far away from reality, except simple ones. And if I can reach orbit within one version and I can\u0026#39;t in other as physical model changed (and ideal paths as well) it is really pain indias. Reentry is the same case. What if I have a ship at Moho and I need to return home with it? It was designed 10 releases ago when no shields were available and now it is impossible to get back. From my perspective, what you said, is not possible or you have just simple rockets or you update them in a time what is not for a while as usually staging is ....ed up, after disassembling the rocket what leads to necessary finetuning which could take even 10 hours within really complex ships. Since 1.0.5 does not matter how good the ship is build. Everytime something blows up on it during reentry. At least RCS thrusters! Also, reentry under 40% angle with my Shuttle is not anymore and I am loosing control of it bellow 40k. Was not problem before.

So yea. Welcome to the world of modern day software development. You are flipping out because KSP behaves differently between versions... Well some people\u0026#39;s whole job consists of making sure Windows \u0026#39;security updates\u0026#39; don\u0026#39;t crash the entire Intranet of the company they work for.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sort of stability you are looking for has never really existed outside nuclear facilities and the like. The stability of the \u0026#39;good old days\u0026#39; was mostly due to lack of active continued development, and not better planning. Duke Nukem 3d was released, and that was it.

So yea. Welcome to the world of modern day software development. You are flipping out because KSP behaves differently between versions... Well some people\u0026#39;s whole job consists of making sure Windows \u0026#39;security updates\u0026#39; don\u0026#39;t crash the entire Intranet of the company they work for.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThe sort of stability you are looking for has never really existed outside nuclear facilities and the like. The stability of the \u0026#39;good old days\u0026#39; was mostly due to lack of active continued development, and not better planning. Duke Nukem 3d was released, and that was it.

I rather don\u0026#39;t want to see products you release. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNormally, even if there is a new version under development, fixes for older versions are released. I rememember plenty of updates (fixes) for plenty of released games. And all new stuff was usually in a paid addon / next version of the game. This is how it usually works. You get game and some updates (usually bug fixes) for single price, addons and extensions in some expansion pack (other paid package), completely new features in new versions. Its like a windows, you get plenty of security and functional fixes during the product lifecycle, even if new version is under development.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nYou are right, I don\u0026#39;t want ballances. I want bug fixes! I don\u0026#39;t need new stuf. I am fine with old one. But it must be working properly.

And I don\u0026#39;t know what Quake has to do with it. Quake was from iD while DN3D was from 3D realms. I didn\u0026#39;t play Quake or Q3A so I can\u0026#39;t say if there were any updates/patches, but I would bet for it.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T09:19:14Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 09:19  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by fisfis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"selfish_meme","CreatedById":125899,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T09:22:31Z","Content":"\nYou should always stay on same version until you finish whatever it is you want to achieve, your looking for the best of both worlds and are sure to be disappointed.
