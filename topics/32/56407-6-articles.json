Since you can mine just as easily from one biome or another, the only thing you need to do is figure out which biome has the best breakdown of resources you\u0027re looking for (which can be done by sending exploratory missions to gather surface samples).

I think there should be some level of infrastructure that is needed for mining, resourcing, resource conversion, etc. for the explicit purpose of preventing this. As you pointed out there\u0027s a middle ground, for complexity as well as infrastructure. \u003Cp\u003EThat middle ground should exclude that low-end probe refueling (they should need to carry their own fuel), and the high-end \u0022only massive creations can do resourcing\u0022.

They talk about reducing launch mass requirements in terms of kilograms, so I assume we\u0027re not talking something enormous that requires infrastructure. As far as trivializing fuel use, any resource system that allows refueling will do that; it should be balanced through other means. One possible way to do that is to give the converter or drill part a \u0022durability\u0022 that can be replenished/replaced/fixed by an EVA.

Currently you never have to worry about overheating unless you\u0027re launching a ship with mainsails attached directly to orange tanks, or flying 2 inches away from the Sun. That way, heat load can be removed (somehow) through EVA, or by constructing heat radiators to remove excess heat. Now, heat radiators don\u0027t need to be their own part necessarily. AFAIK KSP already has a basic conduction model, so adding some large, flat surfaces might do. Of course, there is probably still a market for a stock heat radiator part.

Multiplayer should be added as a DLC or something down the line in my opinion, or not at all really(I don\u0027t see a good meaningful point to it other than to mess around a few hours with strangers if you don\u0027t have friends that play).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-18T01:14:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/18/2013 01:14  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by MaGicBush\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tuareg","CreatedById":84241,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-29T11:38:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI just think they have no idea what to do with this game and they think multiplayer is the solution for end-game activities what is fail... maybe the problem is with me, but i\u0027ve mastered the go to anywhere in a week and the game became boring... i have no aims to go to anywhere anymore. i have my interplanetary superspaceship, i can attach landers, rovers, science to it and it orbit the kerbin useless \u0027cos i have no intention to go anywhere. give me reasons, give the players reasons or the game is dead... give us communication chain to use probes and satellites, give us life in the space and on planets to make us interested in going to anywhere.

Afterall, multiplayer was one of the main selling points for me when I bought Minecraft. Maps in Minecraft are ridiculously big (about as wide as the diameter of Jupiter if I remember correctly), but my friends are usually relatively close to me. Thats because we choose to be near each other. I\u0027m sure the same would apply to KSP, despite the size of the solar system. In the very least, we could at least directly see what each other are working on and have an easy way to chat with each other (hopefully there\u0027s voice support, and a view that shows their screen). You just have to make some kind of effort to interact; we do it all the time when docking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe issue with time wrap doesn\u0027t really seem like a problem. Friends can use time warp as freely as they want, and then you catch up to the future when you\u0027re ready. The only issue would be when in situations where a friend docks to an object in the future, and you dock to the same object in the past on the same port. Squad could make a \u0022Paradox Block\u0022 to prevent you from time warping or interacting with the object in these situations. Or, they could have the past take priority, and his ship is destroyed when you sync in the future, which would be funny with friends but annoying as anything with strangers. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will be interesting to see what kinds of new parts and mechanics they add specifically tailored to multiplayer, especially in career mode. For those who complain that they will have no one to play with, play with each other; find others from the forums. Who better to play with than with some of the most passionate about this game. I do have IRL friends who play this, so I\u0027m pretty excited to play with them. With the addition of multiplayer, the most pointless and random things become fun. Whats the point of seeing who can do the most backflips in a rover on Minmus, or who can fly around Kerbin the fastest, or EVA into Gilly\u0027s orbit from opposite sides of the moon for the most epic high-five ever? None, but it would sure as heck be fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am pretty upset about the further delays of resources though. I actually really liked the earlier concepts for resource mining. Currently, science gives you a reason to go to new places, but not stick around. One of the major arguments for resources is that it would give purpose to bases, and the counter argument is there are better ways to do that. My response is why not have both; mining and processing resources should be one of the several reasons to set up long term bases, and it would allow them to remain independent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EComparing this to Minecraft again, there are a dozen or so ways to obtain food in that game. Once I built my fully automatic melon tower, there was no real reason to develop other ways of obtaining food. But I did it anyways, because why not; it\u0027s a sandbox game, and the more options I have and things there are to do, the better. The same concept should apply to KSP. Mining resources could be one of many ways to get science, currency, contracts, or more fuel. You could always fly a fuel tanker out to where more fuel is needed (but I kinda hate doing that). Would being able to refuel onsite be over powered? The atomic engine is the best way to get to other planets, but does that make it op? I just think the rewards should be proportional to how complicated it is to obtain them, which hopefully isn\u0027t easy and small. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe with with resources and multiplayer, maybe they could add harmless dirt or lethal processed metal projectiles you could shoot at targets, each other, ect. (I know, no weapons, but it would fun. This would actually be better suited for a mod. I\u0027m sorry I suggested it.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs someone who joined after .22 was released, I really appreciated how career mode and the tech tree were set up. It gave me a way to to learn the parts and mechanics with out overwhelmingly giving me every part at once. So I\u0027m not opposed to catering to new players, but thats not a reason for lazy development or to dumb down the game. The career mode provides a pretty good learning curve. If I were the dev\u0027s, I wouldn\u0027t worry too much about making it easy for new players, it\u0027s pretty good now and eventually, they\u0027ll master the ropes. This isn\u0027t the completed game, eventually they will have to add more complex features if they hope to retain played interest. It would be nice for updates more aimed at veteran players mixed in with the ones for noobs though, and I wouldn\u0027t consider myself a veteran by any means. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a space simulator, but its also an open sandbox GAME. I love the realism thats put into this game. But realism should not be put in the way of fun gameplay, and they seem to be doing that pretty well. As somebody earlier said, if the game were too realistic, we wouldn\u0027t be able to send manned missions outside Kerbin\u0027s gravity. I\u0027d like to think this game shows us where we could be in 50 to 100 years. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo those who say this game should be nothing more than launching rockets, simply ignore any additional \u0022unnecessary features\u0022 they add and play how you want to. Keep suggesting things that would make the game fun to you, because at the core, KSP is essentially about trial and error and launching rockets.
