All these people saying they weren\u0027t viable anymore, and I set out to prove them wrong...\n\nNow I\u0027m broke and have very little funds left.\n\nSSTOs are too.... \n\nConvenient!\n\nIt used to take ages to get them too orbit, but once you pass mach 1, the thrust curve send your craft into overdrive, and I get my payloads to orbit much quicker now.\n\nSo I had 1 SSTO coming back from minmus (7 day journey - was a crew transfer plus tanker to top up the fuel depot I sent earlier by conventional rocket), another 3 on the way to minmus (one delivering a lander, 1 delivering an ISRU setup, 1 delivering a surface base for a contract), 2 on the way to Mun (ISRU \u002B tanker after I got the LF:O ratio wrong on the first one, and the fuel depot was emptied from multiple lander refuels earlier in the game), 1 on the way back from Mun (rescue contract for a kerbal around the Mun). One I just launched to deploy a station in LKO (contract to do so \u002B I figure its time to get a fuel depot in LKO).\n\nI wanted to launch another... but no funds.\n\nIn addition to havng recently upgraded the R\u0026D facility (to get ISRU), SSTOs are too convenient as the real-life launch time is much faster now, and I can control my trajectory on reentry much better for runway landings...\n\nBut each SSTO is expensive... I start to ignore the cost... because... 100% recovery (minus fuel\u002B payload)... only to realize I have about 1 million funds tied up in SSTOs at various mission stages.\n\nPreviously, I didn\u0027t take my SSTOs to the mun or minmus... or beyond LKO at all (exception, 1 way trips to laythe) but all these post 1.0 whiners have made me set out to prove SSTOs can do all sorts of things...\n\nOnly now am I remebering that I should be be creating an STS-esque system like I did in previous version.\n\n[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Transportation_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Transportation_System)\n\nI just launched my first orbital tug... one orbital tug is much cheaper than a SSTO, so if I have to tie up an asset for several days, its better if its an orbital tug, and not an SSTO. Its also more mass efficient.\n\nI can also deorbit my SSTOs after 1 orbit... instead of trying to time the departure from Mun or even worse Minmus, so that I can do a direct reentry and glide to KSC... or instead doing time consuming aerobraking passes until I can reenter and land at KSC.\n\nAnyone else feel my pain?\n\nHas anyone else re-created the STS vision that was neve realized in KSP?"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-17T22:05:50Z","Content":"I love nuclear tugs.

Several tries to build a fuel tanker spaceplane \\*without rapier engines\\* failed so far.\n\nMy plane, which worked all right inn beta 0.9, has 57 tons, four ram jets with ram intake and two inline intakes (my best available aeroplane tech so far) and two LV -T30 \u0022Reliant\u0022 engines (LF TWR is 0.84). Total LFO is 990 for usage, 1440 LFO as payload. It can carry 6 Kerbals.\n\nAs of 1.0, I manage to get to a maximum of about 800m/s at 22km (Mach\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B4ing up from 12km onwards and loosing again speed \u003E18km). I then fire the LV-T30s, but while my best try indeed got me into suborbital @~1400m/s, it had only a dV of 200m/s left, so no orbit for me tonight. Most planes broke apart when I tried to go faster from \u003C18km.\n\nAny try to take up more speed than 800 m/s at around 17km (at higher level it just drops off, even when nosing down) just destroys my plane by the friction and heat. Should I use more air intakes in order to get more out of my engines \u003E17km? Or did I just hit the limits of my current tech built? \n\nSo, do I still have to learn or is a spaceplane only viable now when I have unlocked the Rapiers?\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-18T09:31:07Z\u0022 title=\u002205/18/2015 09:31  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Falkenherz**"},{"CreatedByName":"cybersol","CreatedById":81136,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-18T08:57:57Z","Content":"My guess it that you\u0027ll need way more LFO to get about 1.8-2.0k dV from your rocket stage.

At least 1120 m/s? I pitch 45\\* to 10km at 66-75% throttle, at 10km lower to 15\\* @ 100% throttle, then hold there until I hit peak speed. Once I start seeing my speed peak and slow down, I switch to rockets and hold just a little up from prograde until orbit. I aim for the top of the prograde circle, where the line sticks out.

There is no financial reason and in early career you can build a rocket that costs around 30K capable of going anywhere in the system that carries all the sensors for science. It can do pretty much any contract leading to massive profit.\n\nSure spaceplanes look cool but it is simpler and quicker and cheaper to use a well built rocket, maybe with a jet first stage. It feels right to me that a space program based purely around SSTO planes would run out of money.\n\nIn my mind, people who only use spaceplanes are like hipsters who insist on using technology that has been shown to be out of date in the modern world. There are many options that make more sense but they like to do things a particular way for style reasons.\n\nThere isn\u0027t anything wrong with that but limits should be put on just how much they are catered for relative to actual spaceflight and putting time into developing that gamewise.
