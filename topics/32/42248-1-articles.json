I will give a simple explanation and wait to see if people are interested.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt works like this. You will be given missions with a certain deadline and will be given points for every mission, the amount of points depends on three things, how good your design looks, how well you executed your mission and how smart you\u0027ve spent your budget. The player with most points at the end of the tournament wins.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will update the rules and requirements and be more specific as soon as people show interest.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERequirements:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Latest version of Kerbal Space Program\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Probably some mods (this will be decided later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-A youtube account to upload your missions to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERules:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-No autopiloting. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You have to list all parts used and the cost of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You can\u0027t upload your design and mission execution on youtube until everyone is finished, this is to prevent stealing designs and ideas.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-There is no way I can control that everyone follows the rules, I just assume you are playing fair.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
