For a NERVA it would actually be good to run at full thrust all day long. In a fission reactor you have to cool the fuel elements all the time to prevent meltdown. In a normal power plant thats done by water. In a NERVA this heat is actually used as the propulsion, the liquid hydrogen flows over the fuel elements of the reactor, heating up and providing propulsion, cooling the reactor in the process. You actually have to run a cooling system while a NERVA is shut down to prevent overheat and meltdown, through constantly letting the fuel cool the reactor. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf on full throttle the reactor would be fine as the heat gets carried away into space. while shut down it uses its own heat to power its cooling system letting the fuel cool the engine, so technically a NERVA would overheat as soon as it rans out of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd all the fuel that was connected to the circle of a NERVA is contamined and radiates. So don\u0027t let your Kerbals touch or even drink any of the fuel that was in a craft which had an LV-N attached \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal\u0027s drink rocket fuel? well that would explain a lot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"PanWieldingMann","CreatedById":80364,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-05T20:41:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell that\u0027s very kerbal of them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESeeing the changes to the mk2, mk3, and some aero parts, I\u0027m wonder if there might be a megathread at release day discussing reincarnating pre.25 designs into .25.
