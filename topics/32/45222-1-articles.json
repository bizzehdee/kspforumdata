Docking is alright, especially with docking cams, but it\u0027s getting inside that last km or so (depending on the size/capabilities of the ship) that can drive me nuts. What I do still have is a docking table which gives the distance to target for when you should burn to match orbits for varying heights (for Kerbin only, I need to find the equation so I can apply it to other bodies) to get close and efficient transfers. Using the table, if the orbits are solid and I don\u0027t goof the transfer or circularization burns, I can usually land inside a kilometre.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Jedi Master","CreatedById":57348,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T20:21:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EInterplanetary landings.

Had to send out a refuelling rig twice as the original craft set off with a woefully inadequate amount on board. First one went to Moho, but used up most of the fuel it was carrying just to get there, which meant another had to go. That one had to rendezvous with the guys on a highly elliptical Kerbol orbit - Periapsis near Moho and Apo near Kerbin. Most tutorials on rendezvousing talk about getting an encounter at less than 5km; I was happy to get one on that orbit below 5000km!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext difficult task I have been putting off is a manned lander to Eve.
