Since it already takes about 4300m/s to achieve Kerbin orbit (with an efficient launcher) I think you\u0027ll need at least 5-6km/s of delta-v to lift off from Eve and attain orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo leave Kerbin\u0027s orbit you\u0027ll need about another 1000m/s and head for Eve (assuming it orbits somewhere around 6-7Mm from Sol). Being conservative, lets say you assign another 500m/s for mid-course corrections and terminal maneuvering. Because of the thick atmosphere we\u0027ll say we don\u0027t need to reserve any delta-v for braking into orbit/landing (though I\u0027d sure want some spare just in case the parachutes I pack won\u0027t slow me enough).
