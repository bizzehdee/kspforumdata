On one hand, it\u0027s a great game, but once you\u0027ve landed on all the planets once and found a couple of anomalies, there\u0027s not much to do. Sure, I\u0027ve built space stations, I\u0027ve played Career Mode, and I\u0027ve even built a sustainable Mun Colony with a reusable SSTO shuttle run between stations. Fun, yes, but after a while, you become bored with the usual \u0022build ship, make it to orbit, refuel, slingshot past Mun for interplanetary travel, arrive at planet, retro-burn to land, plant flag, leave rover, head home\u0022 strategy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have FAR installed, not because I wanted realistic aerodynamics, but because I wanted to do things the stock aero wouldn\u0027t let me do. I\u0027ve built lifting-body aircraft, I\u0027ve lobbed rockets to Laythe and Eve, I\u0027ve even returned a Kerbal from Eve to Eve Orbit (rescue mission is on the way!) and yet after a while, I got bored again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what have I done? Kerbal Space Program has several worlds with atmosphere. Firespitter gives some nice propellers. Kerbal Stock Extension (Courtesy of LackLusterLabs) has a 0.625m cockpit. Kerbal Space Program with FAR suddenly turns into Kerbal Flight Simulator, and I\u0027ve set challenges for myself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDesigning a helicopter to fly under the three bridges at KSC is a good start. Flying to the North Pole is always worth a laugh, and trying to hit the Island Runway with a glider (jettison propeller before trying, so you\u0027re no longer a plane) takes a bit of work, but has as much rewarding feeling as landing on the Mun. Once the rush fades from doing some of those things, try some from IVA view. The feeling of your first IVA landing is intense. The feeling of an IVA landing on the runway is, well, I have no words for the feeling. Flying through the bridges when you have to mind your wingspan from in the plane, or buzzing the tower in a high-speed jet takes on a whole new feeling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re feeling really brave, try landing on the Mun in IVA. It\u0027ll shake things up a bit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerBlam","CreatedById":134309,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-07T02:10:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry, I was only joking around really.

I haven\u0027t found myself interacting with the online community too much except to try out a challenge every now and then. There hasn\u0027t been too much of a need to really. The game runs with out crashing often so no real need for any tech support, or bug reports. I find myself playing other games until I get the itch to send another craft up. I know I\u0027ll log some hours in when the minable resources makes its\u0027 way in. One of my favorite parts is actually building and testing the ships and find myself running out of ideas using only fuel tanks, engines, or wheels. I really think there needs to be a few other additions like hinges, pistons, and rotors. Just those few parts could make such a difference in how much can be built. I know there is that infernal robotics mod but I get tired of losing all my ships when the mod gets messed up for whatever reason.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll in all it is inevitable for games that release in their alpha stages or in some sort of pre-release to lose interest by the time they release. This often causes games ot never leave the alpha stages. This game is good enough to become a cult hit and develop a loyal following. I really do not think it is going to \u0022die out\u0022 anytime soon. This is one of those games that you end up loading on your machine a decade from now just to see if it was as good as you remember.
