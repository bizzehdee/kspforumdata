Do they pave the space center runway with hundred-dollar bills, or are they nearing an foreclosure on their new satellite? While this is just a mere poll to discuss finance in KSP, I\u0027m interested in seeing the difficulty of the budget system, and whether it should be divided into Easy, Medium, and Hard for newbies and old salts to get their fill alike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, personally, while I do support lowering the contract rewards on the repetitive missions (Getting 65K for sending data from Kerbin orbit doesn\u0027t make sense when you\u0027ve colonized the Mun already). Perhaps have the first contract pay more, then the next one a little less, and so on? Otherwise, it\u0027s a good balance for RP and satellites/stations.
