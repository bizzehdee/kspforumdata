Well you would have an unpleasant surprise when the warp feature ended and you zip past where you wanted to be, because it takes you back to same time accel you were at when you used it. I think automatically ending at 1x time would be more logical, since, you would already be where you wanted to be, why have the feature to time warp past that point by accident?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
