Until 0.24 is done there are only some vague and general ideas floating around in Harvester\u0027s head on what to do next, which are likely to change depending on what is needed. For example 0.23 was supposed to be the contract system patch just before 0.22 was released but ended up being a science rebalancing, tweaking etc. patch after 0.22 feedback in both experimentals testing and after release.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever there is something we do know that is planned for the future and worked on now/soon besides multiplayer. Not sure if it will come as soon as in 0.25 but if I heard everything what maxmaps was saying correctly in the last KSP TV Squadcast, there\u0027s a new intern at Squad who is/will be doing new spaceplane parts and probably remaking the old ones. So that\u0027s one thing we\u0027ll probably see this year, hopefully.

We could speculate, but there are no guarantees. One thing I think is likely to happen in 0.25 is a contract system rebalancing plus some general changes and fleshing out of the contract/budget mechanics, possibly difficulty levels/settings if those don\u0027t make it into 0.24. I doubt the system won\u0027t need tweaking after the community focuses on breaking the hell out of it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-18T17:46:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003EBut can we get a hint from a mod as to what will come in .25? \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe don\u0027t know. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E We\u0027re not Squad employees.
