(I\u0027ve been here over a year now, wow) but due to the significantly higher expectations that the community has taken over our development, we felt 64 bit was still rather unstable and not really ready to be brought kicking and screaming into the public eye. Work continued on and off, with the release of 23.5 marking another \u0027yeah its not really showable yet\u0027. Yet here you came! Enterprising and quite the explorer like most of our players seem to be, and you figured out how to access the work that had been done on the 64 bit client without having to wait for us to make it public.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis thread has been monitored constantly and quietly since you showed it to the world, and the response was far beyond our expectations.

Granted, it is very much at an experimental state and bugs in 32 bit will be prioritized, but consider this an eye opening experience and a thank you for helping us in seeing that sometimes we can show you guys the sausage production facilities and not have it end up with everyone hating hotdogs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you.
