No crew to push the thing around (I like that solution though, didn\u0027t think about that) and the point where I figured out this thing is dead was right as it entered the Mun\u0027s influence and want to schedule an orbit burn. I wasn\u0027t able to do that burn before I was far passed the Mun so my bus would have been stuck in a big orbit around Kerbin. I did find a workaround though. Overnight I left the ship flying and in the morning I hit F9 to reload the moment I entered the Mun\u0027s influence and for some reason it loaded it with the Sun at a different angle and my batteries fully charged!\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
