The current version removed the \u0027chutes from the top of the tanks, and added two more BACC boosters with radial decouplers, keeping the total part count at 30. I\u0027ll be saving up to upgrade my VAB next, I think. 30 parts is rather limiting right now. Fortunately, I upgraded my launchpad and mission control, and am running a Fundraiser at 25%, so it shouldn\u0027t be too difficult to make money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe big reason for the strange shape was the BACC orbital test, though the LV-T45 orbital test was also a consideration. I built up enough science for the FL-T800 tank because otherwise there was no way to fit enough fuel on to even get suborbital with all this weighty payload. It\u0027s funny how not even three tons of payload seems to be rather a lot in early career mode. Jeb (now a level 1 pilot) flew the ship to a 670/70 orbit (leaving 4 LF in the main tanks), ran the tests at the appropriate heights, detached the satellite at periapse and burned the remaining fuel retrograde at apoapse. It\u0027ll be a multi-pass return, but he is deorbited. Hopefully, the capsule will survive the reentry, though I doubt the rest will. Only two radial parachutes, both on the capsule, see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe satellite itself has a \u0027chute to balance the required Goo canister, three solar panels that might not actually provide all-around coverage, the required antenna, a reaction wheel, a Z200 and an LV-909 for propulsion. No SAS units yet, and also no tracking station upgrade, so this flight to the target orbit might be a little awkward.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-21T00:18:03Z\u0022 title=\u002212/21/2014 12:18  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 21, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Concentric\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RobotsAndSpaceships","CreatedById":122975,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T00:45:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/h77BzOP.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022h77BzOP.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESent a probe to the Joolian system, so far it\u0027s intercepted Vall, Laythe, and Tylo, with the possibility of a Pol encounter.
