The heading of the \u0022downhill\u0022 direction varies from 111\u00B0 at the west end of the runway to 247\u00B0 at the other end. Thinking about it, this must be because all of the \u0022flat\u0022 concrete at KSC is parallel and, due to the curvature of the planet, it is only truly horizontal at one point somewhere among the buildings. The has the result that gravity doesn\u0027t quite act vertically downwards anywhere on the runway, it always pulls slightly to the right and either forward or backward depending on which end you are at (basically always slightly towards the buildings). This explains why planes and rovers parked at the end of the runway will slowly start rolling along the runway when the brakes are turned off. The same thing happens on the launch pad for exactly the same reason. KER shows 0\u00B0 slope on the launch pad but it only shows 1 decimal place and there is definitely still a slope. If you go to the far point of the concrete ring road around the launch pad then the slope is just enough to show as 0.1\u00B0.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-20T15:03:39Z\u0022 title=\u002204/20/2016 03:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 20, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFixed album and degree symbols\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Russoft","CreatedById":111646,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-06-25T22:16:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe runway is perfectly flat.

First off, that sequence of pictures is not demonstrating drift on the runway, it is simply demonstrating the slope via the KER window. Second, like I said in #7, I\u0027m not even claiming that this is definitely responsible for drift, let alone is the only thing that affects it. If it were only the slope that affected it then it wouldn\u0027t make any difference what course you set (within reason), it would always drift down the slope to the right. You would need to go further south than 111\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 at the start of the runway to make the slope go to the left and then you will leave the runway pretty quickly (you would be pointing at the buildings).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe angle and direction of the slope is not constant along the runway so there could be other effects involved. At the start your plane is pitched down and banked to the right very slightly. As you go along the runway you pitch up gradually due to the slope changing but the roll to the right stays much more constant. The \u0022aerodynamic\u0022 forces (if you can call the stock behaviour that while keeping a straight face, or you use FAR) will be changing as you move along the runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also other definite inaccuracies in the physical modelling because simply releasing the wheel brakes on that stationary rover can noticeably change the direction it is pointing in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, despite what I said about the symmetrical transforms being simple, this doesn\u0027t mean they are implemented well. It is quite possible that there is some design quirk of your vessel that is overwhelming the sideways force caused by the banked runway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess my main reason for posting this thread was to prompt people to discuss it and maybe perform more detailed experiments with very carefully assembled test craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne possible thing for Squad to do would be to modify the KSC model so that the origin point of it is on the center line of the runway rather than somewhere among the buildings (and then move the whole model on the planet to compensate). This would remove the sideways part of the slope on the runway but wouldn\u0027t affect the \u0022dip\u0022 along the length. To fix the dip as well would require significantly more work, either designing the model with the runway in sections pre-wrapped to the curvature (though this would cause issues for RSS etc) or by programmatically modifying the polygons for the runway surface after the model is placed on the planet, e.g. the runway model would be made with lots of small strips but still be perfectly flat and when it is placed on the planet the strips would be moved to follow the curvature. The trouble is, without further detailed experiments, it is not known whether this would be any improvement or if the \u0022joins\u0022 in the runway would cause other issues (e.g. a big plane driving over the little bumps might rip the wheels off).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: RoboRay, yes, joint flexing under load (which is changing all the time due to thrust, lift and drag changing) must play quite a large part too and the slope would imply more asymmetrical flexing...\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-06-26T14:22:26Z\u0022 title=\u002206/26/2014 02:22  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJune 26, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Padishar\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
