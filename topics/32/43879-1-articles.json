Interplanetary missions would soak up lots of dangerous cosmic rays (one of the reasons why a manned Mars mission might be a one/no way trip) and Laythe has been confirmed by word of god to be dangerously radioactive due to it\u0027s proximity with Jool. Even spending time on a space-station could increase the chances of developing cataracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI doubt all KSP capsules are lead lined, so I would assume Kerbals have some kind of adaptation, be it physiological, anatomical or behavioural, that prevents their veteran pilots from dying young. Either that or Jebediah keeps a special fix-all, badass ointment in his locker.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion then would be that Kerbals are completely \u0027immune\u0027 to cancer, like Naked Mole Rats (look them up, they\u0027re amazing animals). Any cancerous cells they develop are simply stopped from growing by hormones before they can become problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis however, is just one of the dangers posed by radiation, so I was wondering if you guys had any other ideas!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T23:21:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing green, I bet they\u0027re like the Hulk, so they probably have a really high radiation tolerance. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vaebn","CreatedById":76969,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-25T23:52:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnically speaking, radiation doesn\u0027t sound like something -that- hard to deal with, so a different evolution path could perhaps be more resistant to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I am saying its not that hard, is because it goes like this. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlready cells have some limited self and DNA repairing abilities, however a main problem with that process is that it seems to only take into account the information inside its own cell. DNA for example will use \u0022the other strand\u0022 to repair itself, but when both strands happen to get damaged its screwed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYet, radiation only damages a couple of cells which means that usually, you\u0027d have a lot more cells that are radiation un-damaged, than radiation damaged. All of them containing a perfect copy of their original DNA (incidentally the concept of a \u0022DNA\u0022 for a product of a different evolution process is probably bs, but nod along) What an organism could have, is a way for a cell to \u0022statistically sample\u0022 the cells nearby, for their own copy of DNA!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, if in 1000, or 10000 cells said copy is one way, and in 1, with both strands damaged, another, then a process ought to be able to figure out, that, that\u0027s how it ought to repair it even if the cells itself doesn\u0027t know it. Or kill it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would make an organism significantly more radiation resistant. So resistant that part of the reason it doesn\u0027t exist, might be that being able to get DNA \u0022easily\u0022 damaged, kinda helps evolution, whilst such a thing would basically stop evolving. (such a process could even fix damage from free radicals and such)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can perfectly imagine such a system working for a different biology though. For example, perhaps some random \u0022damage\u0022 could be introduced only during reproduction, in which case an organism could both evolve, and have radiation resistance. Such a system could develop in a system where \u0022radiation resistance\u0022 is a much more important factor, than on earth (where things -don\u0027t- usually die from cancer before reproduction, so it\u0027s hardly an advantage).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Keep in mind that ultra-high doses that kill many cells at once would still kill you.
