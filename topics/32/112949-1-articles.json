The draw your fairings makes me love it (the delta 6925 metallic fairings were finally possible!) but the confetti makes it bad when I try to make \u0022interstage fairings\u0022, because it doesn\u0027t allow me to see trajectories in map view if even a tiny bit is slamming onto the side of a vessel. The textures are pretty meh, but I can live with it. Some fairings on subassemblies disappear, or if I re attach them. I must say though, it allows me to draw new shapes for rocket stages, and allows many diameters of parts (visually).

I\u0027d also love to have the flag on the fairing, but hey, it\u0027s not that important.\n\n4)last but not least : the placement in the VAB ! the fairings do not fit with the adapters ! if i have a 1.25m payload atop a 1.25-\u003E2.5m adapter and underneth that a fairing base, the fairing will clip through the adapter and cannot be placed !!! You have to make some kind of lip, make the fairing wider than the base (much wider than the payload) in order to build it. The only way is not to use an adapter.\n\nAnd then there\u0027s the fact that the text saying wether it can be placed shifts from light green to light brown, difficult to see, and sometimes when you click while it says that you can\u0027t place a cross-section, the text will never turn to green again... Very very annoying.\n\nAlso i wish that it was possible to make rounded fairings, so far they are always pointy-ish.\n\nVery last thing, why are the fairing bases so heavy and so large/thick ? Having to use a 1 ton part for a very small interstage is disturbing\n\nEDIT : forgot to mention the interstage fairings that cannot be closed around adapters (you\u0027d think that\u0027s were an interstage is closed....) and that provide no structural joints like the engine fairings do, along with the \u0022cannot activate engine while stowed\u0022 nonsense.\n\nEDIT 2 : Don\u0027t get me wrong, the fact that we have fairings is awesome already, this is just a list of stuff that could objectively be improved, i\u0027m not whining as if it was terrible (although some aspects are...).
