If so you can embed said image in your signature in a similar manner to embedding images in posts. It is expected that users will abide by the honor system and only claim badges that they have rightfully owned but technically there is nothing stopping you from embedding any badge you wish into your signature.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Overland","CreatedById":119812,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-12-14T06:15:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI recomend the elcano challenge...circumnavigation of kerbin by ground..
