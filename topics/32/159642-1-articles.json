Yeah the one on Duna. I know that this has probably been solved but i have been thinking about an explanation to the image which comes up when the signal the pyramid emits is decoded. As someone said before it shows an group of unknown characters looking at a pyramid. Everyone talks about that in the picture looks like the pyramid is sending something to a celestial body but an arrow points at the pyramid so the pyramid might have\u00A0caught a coded message (like the disc on the Voyagers) telling about a civilisation and started emitting it. This also means that NovaSilisko might have something to do with this. As his plan was to include the signal, The Magic Boulder and maybe the saucers at Kerbin and M\u00FCn to the thing about a long dead civilisation until he left the dev team. Then he left behind a lot of secrets. Quote about this to tell your thoughts!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd also the pyramid might be a hidden relay of the old civilisation\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
