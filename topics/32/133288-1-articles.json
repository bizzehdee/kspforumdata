I had previously neglected them, but no more... they open up possibilities I had previously not considered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI made a craft that can handle a variety of 1.25m and 2.5 rovers and payloads... just non-functional mass to deliver from point a to point B\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy plan was to move things around laythe.... mobile habs/research bases/fuel depots/ISRU equipment... one craft to move all these things as just different rover payloads.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe craft I plan use to move all of these modules carries only LF, has no nukes... its only got 6 panthers and 2 wheesleys (panthers for TWR and efficient cruiser, wheesleys for backing up/turning on the ground)... not a spaceplane... can\u0027t get to orbit on laythe, I doubt it can even get out of the atmosphere on its own.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI could make an ISRU rover payload able to function while still attached to the SSTO... so that its more like an ISRU \u0022module\u0022 that give capabilities to the craft, instead of just serving as just a payload that does nothing for the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fuel truck rovers could also be loaded in to give the plane more range, obviously.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen I thought... what else can I put in the cargobay that could add to or change the capabilities to my craft?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA rover with vertical lift jets/rockets to improve the STOL capabilities of the craft seemed obvious enough... but that\u0027s sort of a gray area, its not a binary success condition (I never tried for full VTOL capabilty, and I don\u0027t think the docking connections are stong enough for vertical descent via parachutes on the payload)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen my next question was: can I turn it into a SSTO(laythe) with another payload? A binary outcome... success or failure...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIndeed I could:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/WBME2\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/WBME2\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(sorry, there was a problem with the upload, it froze and I closed the window and the pics of the craft atrually making orbit weren\u0027t uploaded, this mainly just shows the loading and unloading procedure)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen on top of that... once in space, I can drop the rapiers, and drop in a LV-N cluster to go many many places.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure it would be much more efficient to just have a crew compartment detach from the plane to the various other modules... no need to bring the whole plane with all its deadweight atmospheric equipment... and I\u0027m not sure why I\u0027d ever want my latest Laythe SSTO to ever leave laythe and go somewhere else... but... at least now I\u0027ve designed some modules for it to give me that option... so I\u0027m sending it to laythe with a rapier module on board.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe wings are fuel tanks... so I don\u0027t even want to drop them for use in space... if only there were a practical way I could make the panthers detachable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHas anyone else designed multiple \u0022modules\u0022 for a single craft to change its capabilites?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m not talking about docking things in space, that stay in space... thats easy enough... but I found doing it for stuff on the surface to be much harder\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T20:47:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeat idea! I like the concept of a slot into which different modules could be plugged so the same ship can serve several different purposes. In the past I\u0027ve just used external docking ports (on orbital atomic tugs, mostly) but your use of the cargo ramp allows that idea to be extended to atmospheric flight as well, which is cool.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jetski","CreatedById":119969,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-02T22:05:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI did a fair amount of this over in the Ultimate Challenge section - not for flying much, although I had a Laythe spaceplane module and a Duna Heat shield/parachute module I would plug into it. \u00A0THe idea was to have a single command module and plug it into a variety of lander bodies and flyers for various missions. \u00A0I like the idea\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-03T20:17:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, I kept the main fuselage (changing the rear landing gear for the medium size, changing the advanced nose cone for a shielded docking port), and changed the wings and engines (and associated tanks since the main\u00A0fusalage carries no fuel, aside from 100 monoprop in the cockpit if I want), and made it into an SSTO on kerbin... so the rapier module is not so useful for that variant(its redundant)... I might just send both variants to laythe, given the SSTO variant needs more space for takeoff, and has no in flight electric generation, can\u0027t reverse under its own power (I may try to make a \u0022tow truck rover\u0022... although the fuel truck and ISRU rovers have claws and could pull, I doubt they\u0027d be strong enough).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the panther variant, I made updated \u0022strap on\u0022 SSTOs for 1.05, and SSTO\u0027d it with external rapier pods (that decouple with pylons that leave nothing on the parent craft, and are fully functional spaceplanes that I can recover). Inside the cargobay was a space only(as opposed to the other modules designed to be changed out on the surface)\u00A0LV-N module that could get it to laythe (about 2,300 dV in orbit). It would double as an orbital pusher-tug once at laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe -panther \u002B rapier variant could use the same LV-N module to get to Laythe... but now I\u0027ve got an different quandary.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNeither one is well suited for towing by an orbital tug (the nose mounted shielded docking port on the second isn\u0027t such a great option because its not inline with the CoM.... though I have some tugs that could overcome this if I carefully set the thrust limiters on some of the LV-Ns out on booms). So I basically have to use their cargobay for the LV-N module to get them to Laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEven if I do tow them with thrust-adjusted-engines-on-booms-tugs, then they deliver two modules to the surface of laythe.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMy ideas for an air-transportable laythe base calls for at least 9 modules on the surface... how do I deliver the other 7?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nModule function...........2.5m size...........1.25m size\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002BCrew capacity..............\u002B........................\u002B\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002BFuel capacity................\u002B........................\u002B\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002BISRU ability...................\u002B.........................\u002B\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002Bscience abilities...........\u002B(with lab)..........\u002B(without lab)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B SSTO capability..........\u002B\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u002B STOL capability.........?
