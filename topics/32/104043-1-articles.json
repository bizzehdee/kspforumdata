Pylon for planes, detachment manifold for large radial stages (2.5 and above) that are to be ejected in space (most of my launch stages)... the higher decoupling force makes it safer (it\u0027s also more structurally rigid). TT-38k for small stages and combination lander/return vessels (used for ditching side tanks). TT70 for 2.5m crew launchers with 1.25m side tanks (or where more clearance is needed). But honestly I use \\*no\\* radial de-couplers just as often (if not more often). I just add a tank under the stage above it, then attach side-mounted tanks directly to the central tank and add fuel lines. This is much more rigid (while not as efficient from a staging perspective) and offers the advantage that the resulting ditched stage is in one piece, and can thus be easily recovered.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-13T15:38:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/13/2015 03:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 13, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by impyre**"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T15:51:10Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E TT-38K almost always, TT-70 when I need a bit more space between stacks.
