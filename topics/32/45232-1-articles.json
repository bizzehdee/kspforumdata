I debated for a while about if it should be in tutorials or not, but I decided here since it is not strictly KSP related. I do realize there is already an official FAQ on this but, \u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003Ein my eyes\u003C/span\u003E, it doesn\u0027t go into detail about how to exactly upload the images. If this thread is frowned upon by the higher powers that be, go ahead and delete it, send it to Eeloo, launch it into Kerbol, or whatever is deemed necessary, I can only learn from the results. So please forgive any mistakes.

This is a step by step tutorial to help those persons, or anyone that needs help. I will be using a picture of my B-2 Spirit as an example throughout this guide. This guide was created with Steam in mind, but if you know where your images are saved with a non-Steam version of KSP, you can follow Part Two to get the same results. This can also be used for the majority of Steam games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EPart One:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003E Steam, and its labyrinth of files\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo start out, you will need a picture of KSP. Once the the screenshot has been taken, you will need to find the file. There are a few methods of getting to it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod one:\u003C/span\u003E When exiting the game, there should be a screenshot uploader window that opens. On this screen, select the picture, and look in the bottom left for \u0022SHOW ON DISK\u0022, this will take you directly to the file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod two:\u003C/span\u003E It is possible to open the above mentioned window manually, to do this go to your profile on Steam, on the right hand side click on \u0027Screenshots\u0027, then \u0022Upload screenshots\u0022, and follow Method one from there. For me, I click belwrath at the top of the window, then Screenshots on the right, then Upload Screenshots above the images.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod three:\u003C/span\u003E This is just another way I found. Its actually quite a pain, but I\u0027ll include it anyways. Open your main steam folder which is in your main Program Files folder, then userdata, your steam ID number (Should be the only one, unless there are multiple accounts that use the client), 760 (No idea what this represents, shouldn\u0027t vary though), remote, then 220200 (Steam app ID, you can access other game screenshots from here), and then find the image you want.

I use Imgur, so that\u0027s what we\u0027ll be using here. Go to Imgur(dot)com, and create an account, or sign in if you have one. Once you have done that there are multiple ways to upload the image. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod One:\u003C/span\u003EYou can drag and drop the image from the folder found in Part one directly onto the Imgur page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod Two:\u003C/span\u003EYou can copy the image from its folder, and press \u0022ctrl\u002Bv\u0022 while the Imgur page is open.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022text-decoration:underline;\u0022\u003EMethod Three:\u003C/span\u003EYou can click \u0022computer\u0022 on the Imgur page.
