Another recent point of hate is Squad\u0027s recent vacation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am going to be explaining each of their recent actions and decisions and explaining why they did them so that people can stop hating on them and start giving them the credit they deserve! I will be honest and be realistic about my comments, I will find the best explanation to everything but where I can\u0027t I\u0027ll call out the irrationality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe largest complaint is the amount of bugs in 1.1\u002B. With the engine upgrade, the game become unstable. To be fair, the update was in development for\u00A0half\u00A0a year\u00A0(from November to April) and the entire time people demanded it to be released far earlier than it was ready. So it\u0027s a case of impatient greed, we demanded it for months on end and we finally got it, we received a very buggy release, which to be again fair, is to be expected. They essentially had to rebuild the game and then basically bug test it heavily and with a forum upgrade they haven\u0027t ever worked with before, it\u0027s no shock it\u0027s in it\u0027s current state. 1.1 is a testament to why the community should not rush the game developers to rush releases because when they do, we receive broken releases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best fix for these issues is to simply post your crash/bug reports and move on. Do not complain, simply explain your issue and move on. A lot of the issue stems from player frustration, but players need to know entering KSP, it is a changing evolving creature that is always a work in progress much like Minecraft. Every update brings more content which brings more bugs. Some players simply choose to stay in previous versions, which is ok but it creates community issues. Players staying in older versions request mod support for a version that no longer is available. So you either have to play with whatever mods you have or play stock at which point it would be better to simply play with the stock version of 1.1.2 as it\u0027s supported and whatever issues you encounter, Squad will be very interesting in hearing your problems! But again, do not complain!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cu\u003EDon\u0027t Complain, \u003Cem\u003EExplain!\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother complaint is that the game is in it\u0027s release state and therefore shouldn\u0027t be this broken, but as I said before, it\u0027s a changing creature. So again, every update brings new bugs and they should be embraced as each one you find and report is another found and can be resolved. This update especially should be given additional bug tolerance as it\u0027s a complete engine upgrade unlike anything they\u0027ve ever encountered before. Like Minecraft, every release adds more bugs and the game will continue to be updated past 1.0 which brings new bugs and issues. So be an explorer, when you find a bug, report it!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe last major complaint is that Squad went on vacation after giving us this \u0022broken\u0022 version. If you look back at what they did the last half of a year, they have worked they\u0027re butts off and even gave into the community\u0027s incessant demand for the release and they received mixed reviews (specifically a lot of hate). So everyone should understand that they bent over backwards trying to rebuild the game they had spent years on before in only months. They essentially had the impossible challenge, and they overcame it. As to 1.1.2 and it\u0027s instability and how they could\u0027ve left us with these bugs, the fact is they needed the break (likely more for their personal lives and health than recreational) and they needed to give the game time to locate and find these\u00A0bugs. When you get mad at the game and close it after something rage inducing happens, your throwing away the only way to solve the problem. They went on vacation to accumulate bug reports so they could release an effective bug fix patch rather than 50 small ones over several days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLastly, members need to give Squad a break. A lot of this recent hate towards Squad is occasionally tied in with \u0022moderation action\u0022 (I\u0027m not going to discuss specific decisions by Squad as that would violate the rules but I will discuss general events). I simply want to explain the moderators and administrators for this forum are outstanding in comparison to others. I have personally spoken with many of them outside of the forums and they\u0027re excellent people.

I have no doubt Squad will be taking a look at their code to help, but they still have to operate within the framework the game is built upon.\u00A0 Also, some modders out there are more cognizant of how their mods will interact with garbage collection than others.\u00A0 That\u0027s not a shot at Squad, Unity, Mono or Modders.\u00A0 It is what it is.\u00A0 So either ***** and moan about it or try to help solve it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat\u0027s just one issue.\u00A0 Find one you care about.\u00A0 Find others who care about it.\u00A0 Try to fix it or at least help provide Squad with the data they need to fix it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027d also like to point out that I very much doubt that when Squad first started developing this game they thought they\u0027d be maxing out high end cpus, that their program would need to handle 8GB\u002B of active memory usage, that they game would grow into what it has.\u00A0 Yes, I\u0027m sure they\u0027re appreciative but at the same time probably wonder what kind of a monster they \u003Cs\u003Ecreated \u003C/s\u003Ekreated. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPS.

Frustration.\u00A0 Similar emotions, perhaps, but ultimately very different.\u00A0 Long-timers like me might be frustrated at some persistent patterns of behavior that Squad has refused to change despite being detrimental to the ongoing KSP project.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHere are the behaviors as I see it/heard others describe them:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1) Closed testing of Release Candidate builds.\u00A0 In a lot of respects, the run up to 1.1 was the ONLY time Squad did it half-way right...they released a public Beta branch on steam to collect information on bugs and hiccups from the general KSP community to get fixes in.\u00A0 For most of the game\u0027s life, release candidate-type builds were only made available to a select few Twitch and Youtube personalities, who were mostly under non-disclosure agreements.\u00A0 There are some pure testers in the \u0022Experimental\u0022 group but whatever playable experiments they are doing, too, remained under wraps. Their job (Experimental testers, particularly the media personalities) seems to be not to test the game, but to create media showing a more or less bug free experience, to promote the game and the new features coming out in that update. Many times I recall certain personalities explicitly mentioning that they\u0027d encountered bugs, but refused to elaborate saying that they\u0027ve told Squad of the bug and expect it to be squished by the time we ordinary folks get the build.\u00A0 Who knows how much follow through there was on that.\u00A0 It\u0027s very frustrating to watch promotional content instead of gameplay content.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2) Despite testing, critical bugs affecting basic game play slip through into almost every build...and lay unaddressed for months.\u00A0 A prime example would be the bugs with the temperature gauges from 1.0.x.\u00A0 The new heating concept was one of the major (and completely untested in terms of the larger KSP community) features in the 1.0 update.\u00A0 The very thing that would let you know you are overheating CAUSES THE GAME TO CRASH.\u00A0 A single play-test launch of a re-entering rocket seems like it would have caught the issue...seeing as many players encountered the bug literally on their first post-update launch.\u00A0 I remember a very frustrating Twitch stream I was doing on launch day playing the same launch over and over and over until a helpful chat member told me that I needed to turn the gauges off because they caused a critical memory leak.\u00A0 This bug existed FOR MONTHS and essentially removed a critical part of the game from the experience for that whole time.\u00A0 Very frustrating.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3) Engine Denial.\u00A0 KSP\u0027s vision was always too grand for a 32-bit game.\u00A0 There existed an opportunity for a good long while to use Unity 4\u0027s 64-bit engine and/or Unity 5\u0027s engine almost a year before 1.1 even started work.\u00A0 Squad appeared to hem and haw at the idea of upgrading the thing, despite the smoother experience this would have created for users--and I\u0027m not including the users who would mod the game--I\u0027ve always considered people who mod the game to exist outside of valid complaints in regards to KSP stability.\u00A0 But still, extending Early Access to implement a new engine was a realistic expectation, but they reflectively chose not to do it, for reasons that still elude me.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n4) Recent KSP build create that unique \u0022I wish I had something I already have\u0022 feeling.\u00A0 At least for me.\u00A0 When I first came here I had a game, that while less feature complete, was much more polished.\u00A0 Sure there were bugs in all versions of KSP, but right around when they introduced the Science-only career mode, the game was pretty good.\u00A0 It was well polished...the bugs were present, but didn\u0027t get in the way of every trivial or routine task.\u00A0 They weren\u0027t something you had to deal with until you stumbled across them by accident.\u00A0 And you could always revert your save and deal with it that way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the story is different.\u00A0 Bugs are present in EVERYTHING.\u00A0 First it was re-entry heating and the heat gauges mucking things up...something you have to deal with EVERY time.\u00A0 Now taking off and landing a plane or just driving a rover around, the new wheel system is terrible (and what\u0027s more is that there were previous incarnations during the beta-phase of 1.1 where wheels seemed objectively better to me...).\u00A0 I find myself pining for previous versions of the game, just before version .90 where bugs were less in your face.\u00A0 It\u0027s very frustrating to see the game experience decline so dramatically from what we can remember.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo yeah...I don\u0027t hate Squad.\u00A0 But I\u0027m frustrated with them.\u00A0 I haven\u0027t played KSP for a long time in a long time.\u00A0 Just little sessions every now and then...I encounter some well-documented bug on the forum and stop playing days or even weeks in the hopes the game updates.\u00A0 But I know from experience it will be months.\u00A0 That the community at large won\u0027t play test the update and that ultimately I\u0027ll be drawn back to the game by a heavily edited Scott Manley video, only to experience disappointment that some glaring technical issues were created or remain unfixed.\u00A0 How else would you recommend that I (and others with a similar viewpoint) feel towards the developers?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T13:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote

Complaining your car doesn\u0027t drive well doesn\u0027t do anything for the mechanic, but telling him your tires are flat is a problem he can fix.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst, the car metaphor. In this case, the car is a solid black box, and when it dies in the middle of your ride, the only thing it says is \u00220xc0000005\u0022. When asked for a debug, less black-boxish version of a car, developer answered with \u0022no can do\u0022. Now, you mention this \u0022us\u0022 (or \u0022we\u0022, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s the same one) organization again. Are they going to fix this specific problem? I thought not. Second, complaining is the best some people can do - you can\u0027t expect everyone to be a car mechanic. Saying \u0022we don\u0027t like your feedback, therefore we don\u0027t want it, report and move on\u0022 is kinda bad business practice.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-05-24T13:52:13Z\u0022 title=\u002205/24/2016 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EMay 24, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by J.Random\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-24T13:52:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222598672\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022140395\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221464091083\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002280345\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022severedsolo\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n3 hours ago, severedsolo said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve seen long standing members of this community recently post threads asking questions like \u0022are we going to get a fix for xyz\u0022 - without in anyway contributing to the solution, or helping the devs actually track down the problem in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCriticism is fine if you have a way around it/ can help. - For example - landing gears suck, Squad were told they sucked throughout pre-release, they acknowleged they sucked, they released while they still sucked.
