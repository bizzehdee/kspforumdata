It has way more to do with how young a surface is. Surfaces that are heavily cratered are going to be generally, way older than surfaces that are nice and smooth (assuming no atmosphere). So take a planet like Mercury, for example, which doesn\u0027t ahve a lot of surface activity going on. Nothing to weather the craters and really little geological activity. It\u0027s covered in craters. Compare that with Io which has tons of volcanism constantly reshaping the surface. Both have probably been hit by billions of asteroids, but one has a lot of stuff going on geologically while the other doesn\u0027t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn general, old surfaces are much more prevalent in the solar system than new ones.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn KSP, only the Mun looks like an old surface, while all of the other planets/moons look like they have surfaces that were laid down just yesterday.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only do craters make it the worlds look more interesting and realistic, they\u0027re also way more fun to explore.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Karriz","CreatedById":58036,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T21:04:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs the delta-V only visible when there\u0027s an engineer in the craft, or is it not in the game at all?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"check","CreatedById":71875,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-25T21:07:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs there a way to see delta V?
