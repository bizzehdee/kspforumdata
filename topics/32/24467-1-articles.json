Also I noticed that you can view vessel info in the VAB with MechJeb, though I haven\u0027t really taken a good look at it, and was wondering if that vessel info is pretty much a replacement for the vessel info Engineer Redux gives?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is pretty much an attempt by me to reduce the number of plugins I have while still keeping much of the functionality.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ThatBum","CreatedById":57405,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T05:43:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been told that Protractor and Kerbal Engineer still give some information that MechJeb 2 does not.

Protractor is much better, as it shows the difference between your current phase angle and orbit position, to the phase angle and orbit position you need to transfer. As far as I remember, Mechjeb only shows you the angles themselves. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKAC makes Protractor partially redundant I found, as you don\u0027t need it as much for keeping track of launch windows. The Engineer Redux gives a lot more useful info than mechjeb\u0027s in VAB display, and is easier to make appear. Mechjeb\u0027s vessel info window, used in flight presents the data somewhat differently though, so I often put a ship on the launchpad to check it with that. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMechjeb and Redux both have inflight stats, and overlap there a bit. The main distinction between mechjeb and redux are mechjeb\u0027s autopilot features, some of which can be used as guidance for manual flight. The landing system helps judge the result of aerobrake maneuvers, for example. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings are probably slightly different in mechjeb 2, which I don\u0027t have yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"doggie015","CreatedById":51752,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T08:39:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find that while mechjeb is good for some things it\u0027s more than a little derpy when it comes to transfer burns so I generally use the maneuver nodes and tell mechjeb to hold me at the right orientation (Which it DOES do quite well even if it is a bit expensive!) while I handle the throttle\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"drakesdoom","CreatedById":57297,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-28T11:02:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECall me crazy but I have found that I prefer remote tech flight computer for holding too a node angle. It aligns on the node and then holds that angle without making angle corrections during the burn i.e. it does not track the node point as remaining delta v expenditure approaches 0 and calculation get fuzzy. I find that this uses less mono-propellant and gives more accurate burns.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
