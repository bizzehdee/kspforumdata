This is exactly what Mechjeb is actually simulating. Not a single launch, that I\u0026#39;m aware of, even before Apollo, correct me if I\u0026#39;m wrong, had a pilot launching from the pad with his hand on the stick....\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo for me, Mechjeb isn\u0026#39;t cheating. It\u0026#39;s actually providing a tool that should have already been there. The ability for ground control and mission planning to do the math ahead of you, load the algorithms into the ship\u0026#39;s computer, and allow that all you need to do is execute the programs in the right order, to fly the ship. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nRemember - NASA\u0026#39;s challenge was never \u0022have the rocket make orbit because the pilot was steady on the stick.\u0022 It was - \u0022Have it make orbit because it was loaded properly and designed well.\u0022 It was never, \u0022Get to the moon because the pilot can steer a straight line.\u0022 It was \u0022get to the moon because the ship was built to be capable of that, and the astronauts were able to stay on schedule with the program.\u0022 \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I load manuever editor, or ascent profile....that\u0026#39;s me punching the math into the onboard computer that I\u0026#39;d surely have, and having that program be run by the computer while I oversee it\u0026#39;s completion. Sometimes there are hiccups. The program doesn\u0026#39;t execute precisely enough, and I have to work out a correction, or the atmosphere affects the program\u0026#39;s algorithm, and you have to manually reset the node (IE - manually punch in a new correction). Mechjeb still doesn\u0026#39;t land on the moon for me, I must descend myself. Mechjeb doesn\u0026#39;t stage. Mechjeb doesn\u0026#39;t EVA for science. And it doesn\u0026#39;t plan the whole trip for me. *I* plan the trip, by building it in the maneuver nodes. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nSo no, Mechjeb is not \u0026#39;cheating,\u0026#39; quite contrary, it is a very elemental tool that simulates more conditions we cannot actually replicate in a game. Heck, if anything, we should be able to go into the Tracking Center and literally \u0022Build\u0022 a mission or trip. Using algorithms like \u0022Trajectories\u0022 mod, we should be able to plan an entire set of Manuever nodes that will give us a rounded estimate of DV necessary, as well as giving us a launch window. Never has NASA sent a probe to Mars who\u0026#39;s course wasn\u0026#39;t laid out in full, down to the M/S entry into the atmosphere, years in advance. In Kerbal - we must guess, once we make orbit, THEN we plan our intercept. Once we burn the first time, THEN we configure a fine tune adjustment. All these steps are completed in the real world, here on earth, well before the ship ever leaves. Each ship is purpose built to exactly the weight and thrust needed to reach the target orbit or planet. \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNo one ever intercepted an asteroid at NASA by shooting a probe into orbit and going, \u0022Ok, now where\u0026#39;s that asteroid at?\u0022\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-22T19:15:20Z\u0022 title=\u002211/22/2015 07:15  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 22, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Bosun\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Virtualgenius","CreatedById":67644,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T19:16:38Z","Content":"\n\u002B1 to Bosun\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dunbaratu","CreatedById":63481,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-22T21:46:30Z","Content":"\n[quote name=\u0027Bosun\u0027]I\u0026#39;ll just mention, in case anyone didn\u0026#39;t in the last....29 pages....All spacecraft launched after Apollo began had ascent profiles and programs loaded into them for the pilots to \u0026#39;Execute\u0026#39; at the right times.

Someday I might if I get tired of launching things, but I\u0026#39;m new enough to the game that, even though I feel like I have a handle on what I\u0026#39;m doing, I like the challenge.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhen I have a dozen space stations and shuttles and tankers running around and bases and infrastructure logistics, I might change my mind at some point.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI clicked non mechjeb because I respect and relate to those who don\u0026#39;t use it because they want it that way. (Knocked points for looking down on mechjeb users though. We\u0026#39;re not superior, we\u0026#39;re just just more interested in these particular aspects of the game than others.)\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mythic_fci","CreatedById":58577,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-23T11:37:27Z","Content":"\nI prefer non-MechJeb so as to keep my hand-flying skills fresh. However, I respect MechJeb as a learning tool. Hell, I used it to get my skill level to where it is now, starting off with full autopilot, then progressing to MechJeb making the nodes and me executing them by hand, then to me doing everything. It felt really gratifying to finally be able to dock with a station or head to the Mun on my own ;) Nowadays I still have MJ installed, but I usually use KER for Delta-V info and KAC to time my burns. I\u0026#39;ll occasionally break out MechJeb for interplanetary spacecraft so I don\u0026#39;t need to plot and/or sit through a 10-minute burn to Jool or Eeloo.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-23T11:39:47Z\u0022 title=\u002211/23/2015 11:39  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 23, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by FCISuperGuy\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
