I know that there have been mods of these in the past and that they all broke in 0.17. I want to create colonies across the solar systems, with ships that i can take off from other planets and travel to other planets, without resorting to using the debug unlimited fuel. i have tried to create my own star gate mod, it didn\u0027t end well. i even created exit holes in KSP space, to try to quickly jump from place to place, that ended worse. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eso i am just wondering if it is still possible, or did the ability die with the giant space kraken RIP?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso who else would be intrested in such a mod, i know it is kindof cheating, but there would be ways to make it less cheaty, like having the gate or whatever be a rediculous weight. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethanks for reading.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T06:54:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d think it\u0027s still possible...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Khrissetti","CreatedById":29557,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T15:07:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt would be cool to be able to set up something similar to the Commonwealth Wormhole Trains in the Peter F Hamilton Commonwealth series, whereby one can board a train in LA and jump through a series of wormholes to take you to the other side of the galaxy, that way you could live on Earth and commute to Proxima centauri.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nibb31","CreatedById":7272,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-02T15:17:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI guess those things are possible, but they pretty much negate the point of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou have 1.000.000x time warp.
