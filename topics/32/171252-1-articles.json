I am attempting to build a large rover I can land on Eve to support crewed missions there, but I\u0027m getting no response out of my rover wheels once I land test rovers. I have a lighter rover that functions fine.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/UPv2qEH\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EProblem Rover\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca href=\u0022https://imgur.com/7roIOWA\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EOlder design that works fine.\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEssentially, I\u0027m building a large rover which originally had 2 pair of RoveMax XL3s. Rover drove fine on Kerbin, so I hyperedited it onto the surface of Eve and have no indication that the wheels are even registering my keystrokes. Here\u0027s the problems I\u0027ve noticed:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nNo directional keys seem to have any effect, though I can apply and remove the brakes with effect on downhill rolling.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWith wheel menu open, \u0027Motor\u0027 readout always reads 0 regardless of directional keystrokes, whereas on Kerbin this is not the case.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nVernor \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E engines didn\u0027t seem to activate, having no visible plume during attempted use.

Works fine.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTried hacking gravity on Kerbin to see if wheels just aren\u0027t strong enough. I can break the wheels but cannot replicate the problem on Kerbin.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTried hacking gravity on Eve to no effect, even when floating away the wheels didn\u0027t appear to turn.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTried increasing to 6 pair of XL3 wheels to no effect on Kerbin or Eve.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTried replacing with 6 pair of TR-2L wheels just to see if I could see the wheel turn animation (since the XL3s don\u0027t ever do that), and they visually turn on Kerbin but won\u0027t move on Eve.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTried hyperediting back to Kerbin in case hyperediting was breaking the wheels, but rover worked fine as soon as I returned to Kerbin.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nEnsured wheels were powered and brakes off during every attempt.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nAnyone have any ideas?
