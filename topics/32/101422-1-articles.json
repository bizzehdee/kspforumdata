Are you happy with an ugly pancake lifter, so long as it gets the job done as efficiently as possible, or do you sacrifice delta-V, part counts and usability for a sleek, visually appealing vehicle?\n\nPersonally, I prefer to build a craft that *looks* great, no matter how inefficient it is, by using lots of unnecessary parts to create shapes that differ from the shape of typical stock parts, but I keep mods to the bare minimum."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T03:35:13Z","Content":"I prefer form, although I feel that my stuff ends up being more functional-looking."},{"CreatedByName":"Rosco P.

The only time when consider the looks is when I can choose where to place a part. Say I can place it at 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00BA to make it look better but I was going to place the part anyways. But if for some reason I can\u0027t place it at 90, then I really don\u0027t care. Also solar panels I usually place in pairs.\n\nThe rest of the time, whatever works, works, ugly or not, if it takes me to where I want to go, and allows me to do what I want to do, it\u0027s fine by me."},{"CreatedByName":"helaeon","CreatedById":101767,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T03:59:39Z","Content":"Form follows function.

That overall design might not be the most efficient possible - for example I\u0027ll typically use a separate orbiter and lander, even if a direct ascent would be lower mass. I also like to \u0022show my stuff\u0022, at least when it comes to spacecraft - things like batteries belong in plain view for me, not concealed in cargo bays and definitely not clipped inside other parts.\n\nI will make some concessions to looks though. I don\u0027t want something that just looks daft unless that\u0027s my actual goal. I\u0027ll add parts to sort out aesthetic issues even if they add a bit of mass, or use a heavier component because it fits better. I\u0027m not going to slap stuff like batteries on willy-nilly, they go somewhere sensible. And for planes, and occasionally spacecraft, I will be more likely to hide things out of sight."},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-07T04:25:07Z","Content":"I build for aesthetics, while trying to meet a minimum level of function.
