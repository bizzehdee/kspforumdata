I first tried Debian 7.7.0 but ran into several problems. After trying to get the video fixed, it broke Steam and just became a big headache. There were other things I wasn\u0027t thrilled with about the install, so today I tossed Ubuntu 14.10 on instead and I\u0027m very pleased to report that it worked \u0022out of the box\u0022. The Ubuntu Software Centre had a \u0022Steam-launcher\u0022 ready to install. On first-run it did have to install some additional libraries, but before I knew it KSP was running without a hitch!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sporkafife","CreatedById":38208,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-20T20:37:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been running KSP on Ububtu for a while!

Trying to get it back to working the way it should is a giant headache: I know the Bumblebee package is supposed to do that, but I was utterly unsuccessful in getting that to work the way it should.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m quite sure you could get KSP to run on other Linux installations, but I can also confirm that it is relatively easy to install Ubuntu and run KSP.
