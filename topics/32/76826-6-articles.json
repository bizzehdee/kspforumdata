It wasn\u0027t that long ago that game developers didn\u0027t have feedback with their userbase at all until after a product was released, with only a very limited amount of feedback after release in the form of letters sent in. The only way they could really \u0022fix\u0022 a game that was unpopular was to release a new game entirely. Game design back then was largely a combination of gambling and intuition for developers when trying to make something innovative. The fact that any game can be made the way Kerbal Space Program is being made, with each new release being guided by user input and the development cycle being revealed in any meaningful capacity to those users between updates, is still amazing to me.
