I feel Squad is doing the right thing with their policies of asking the fan base what they\u0027d like to see in future development and actually trying to implement it. Even though we sometimes demand more of them than what\u0027s feasible. They are still doing a fantastic job. We fans tend to push a little hard and harsh sometimes but it\u0027s only because we care.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow I would like to point Squad to what\u0027s going on in a similar game that just got release. I\u0027m also a fan of the X3 series from Egosoft. I\u0027ve pretty much played the X3 series up one side and down the other. Modded them this way and that. Great games.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecently Egosoft release their new game X-Rebirth, and it was/is a disaster. Mainly because of Egosoft trying to dump their long PC fan base for the console markets. I would urge Squad take a couple of hours and review the goings on as to what kind of damage control Egosoft is now going through because of a series of \u0022bad moves\u0022 on management\u0027s part at Egosoft. It could be a very good thing to know when making direction decisions at Squad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEgosoft had a very strong (I dare say stronger than what Squad has) base of adamant fans. It is just amazing at how just a few bad moves, all the while hiding behind NDAs and very controlled press releases have turned Egosoft into a -- well, I\u0027d best not try to put it into words here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, take a look into it, and please Squad, don\u0027t try to do what they did.

Also, quality and usability were always big issues, with every single major release. X2 and X3 were horribly flawed at the beginning. So it\u0027s not like they suddenly decided to jump to consoles, and failed horribly. They were not particularly successful on the PC market, either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, lessons to be learned from this are: don\u0027t forget your most loyal fans, but don\u0027t ignore new customers, either. Never release a game with bad quality - not only regarding bugs, but also UI design and gameplay.

Yes, SQUAD is at-heart a marketing company, but they are not in that kind of networking business. Besides, they already have an extremely successful marketing tool in their hands with KSP, these forums and the countless videos being produced by successful and prominent YouTube channel owners.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree 100% with your sentiment, all around. However, given the backlash they can readily observe from other companies pulling d**k moves with their fans (I\u0027m looking at YOU, EA), I\u0027m pretty confident they\u0027ll consciously keep themselves well away from committing those huge mis-steps. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"1D-1()T","CreatedById":75340,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-19T20:35:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u002242undead2\u0022 data-cite=\u002242undead2\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThis isn\u0027t about KSP coming to consoles.
