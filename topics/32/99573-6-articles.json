I can definitely empathize, since I\u0027ve been around since .18. It can be frustrating to to see longstanding bugs overlooked or ignored, and it does often seem like they are simply taking popular mods and trying to add them into the game. That said, it must be very difficult to add truly original content to the game that hasn\u0027t been a mod first. With a lot of mods, people took planned features and made them happen before Squad could. Of course, with that, you get into a question of whether they planned it originally, or just cribbed the idea from a modder. The main thing is that both Squad and modders are aiming to give players what they want. Since the modding community is so excellent and responsive, Squad has to try to come up with things that people don\u0027t know they want. That\u0027s a tall order, and it can lead to things that don\u0027t go over well. I feel like they are in somewhat of a double bind, because giving people what they want may seem lazy, since it\u0027s likely been done by mods before, but going for something truly original can totally flop. Personally, I would prefer that they stick with the first strategy. The game becomes more complete that way, and hopefully more fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think the Minecraft comparison is distinguishable because Minecraft is so open. Minecraft is an open world game based around mining and building. KSP is a simplified spaceflight simulation game. I would argue that people have more preconceived ideas about what should be in a space simulation game than something like Minecraft. The things people want in KSP make sense within the context of this type of game, so they are the most likely things to be added by modders and the developers. The things in Minecraft? Who knows what makes sense in that type of game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s easy to criticize Squad, and I think there are a lot of criticisms that have merit. That said, I still think this is a fantastic game, and I worry that negativity about what should be in the game may overshadow what\u0027s already good about it. As a long-time player and forumer, I\u0027ve been guilty of it myself in the past. But for the future of this community, I don\u0027t want to scare off people who otherwise would have fallen in love with the game like I did. In any event, I\u0027m not trying to rebut your arguments.

They MUST get it right (and by right I mean at least reasonably easy to use and without any huge bugs) the first time. Their failures to do that are actually proof that they must; they get LAMBASTED whenever anything is wrong - and other than the bitterness in the posts I tend to agree with them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause Squad has to move slower (and they\u0027re doing more than any modder does), it takes them MONTHS to get a single update out, and in those months modders take everything new that\u0027s come out in the previous update and expand on it in every single conceivable way so there ends up being NOTHING left to do except - in the next version - put some of those in the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes these mods put in something that Squad hasn\u0027t started on at all, like when Squad mostly just added FinePrint instead of thinking up their own contracts, or adding the B9 parts instead of reinventing them. Other times its things like their added icons on the navball that do the main portion of what Enhanced Navball did that was actually just finishing something they had started but left unfinished, or the upcoming changes to aerodynamics which sound like they are going for a far more fundamental change to the system than Ferram did. Not because FAR was bad or anything - but because with their access to the core code of the game they were simply able to when he was not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould you name some fresh, original content you\u0027d like to see in the game that a modder has not done?
