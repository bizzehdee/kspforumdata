There\u0027s been some backlash from the community, but nothing comparable to the time they said more advanced kerbals could actually effect your ships stats, and it\u0027s obvious Squad is moving ahead as planned. What is the rest of the communities opinion on this, and the topic of realism in the game as a whole? How do you feel about things like realistic fuels, or the new realistic aerodynamics? After all, this is a game that involves semi realistic (inb4 not n-body) orbital mechanics, and rocket design, it\u0027s already very realistic for what it is.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#333333;\u0022\u003ENOTE: This thread is not about KSPs development, it\u0027s about player preference about realism.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"zekes","CreatedById":23840,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-19T05:59:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like a full realistic game to practice engineering with, however I know KSP is not ever going to be that game.
