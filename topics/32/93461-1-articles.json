The Physics of orbital dynamics and rocket propulsion are much better than you\u0027ll find in almost any other game. Some things that are off can be explained away with a minimum of additional assumptions (the high densities of the planets and the fact that such a small sun can generate energy can be explained if we assume that a very high density state of matter can exist in the kerbal universe, and that some of that super-high-density matter is in the cores of the celestial bodies). The goofy aerodynamics is going to be improved soon.
