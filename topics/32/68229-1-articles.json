I\u0027ve been using it on a range of applications such as MMOs and other things, and I\u0027ve been thinking of trying it on KSP. Right now though, I\u0027m on my laptop, which is not the computer I use for playing KSP, that and the FXAA injector is not compatible with with PC because of some software conflicts I have yet to figure out. Otherwise, it works on pretty much everything in the desktop version.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESimilar to ENB in some ways (except this works with a GUI rather than just a config file like it does with most games), you can save configs and modify some of the effects. Of course, it\u0027s limited, it does not feature things like SSAO, Depth of Field (I would freaking love Depth of Field in KSP) or Motion Blur. As an outline of some of the effects it\u0027s capable of, it includes FXAA, Bloom, radial blur and I think some pseudo-HDR type stuff. I\u0027m not too sure what else. There\u0027s also colour adjustment (just RGB levels as you\u0027d expect, turn your KSP into a dark, contrasty film-noir if you want.) a couple of scaleable filters (scan lines and stuff, like you\u0027d see on old TVs or whatever), and that\u0027s all I can remember, but there\u0027s probably a lot more tools on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the main question is, has anyone tried KSP with it? I\u0027ve tried looking for threads, but I can\u0027t seem to find any. I\u0027m currently swamped with work right now, so as for me, I can\u0027t really show anyone any screenshots or try it out for myself yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the actual Injector download, I\u0027m not sure how Squad feels about linking it, so you\u0027ll have to Google it yourself, it shouldn\u0027t be hard to find. Anyway, I\u0027m going to do some work, but I will check the thread and answer questions if anyone has any. Better yet, feel free to try it yourself, so long as there\u0027s no rules or anything against it which I\u0027m not aware of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xaelath","CreatedById":106084,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T16:36:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used FXAA Injector on Skyrim, but I\u0027m not sure if it works on KSP. ^^\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drew Kerman","CreatedById":103177,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T19:37:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esome people (including me) already use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/69929-SweetFX-Baleur-%28Enhanced-color-contrast-anti-aliasing-and-bloom!%29\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003ESweetFX\u003C/a\u003E to great effect.
