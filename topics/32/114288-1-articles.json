Struts between the two tanks, and generally everywhere where I feel it\u0027s needed. Sometimes I needed solid boosters too for the initial lift. Now since 1.0.4 hit, solid boosters feels cheating. It happened to me that I added those for more initial thrust, but I found that I could use them as a first stage without even using the main engines (or maybe using them for gimbaling on 10-20% throttle).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyways, that setup is far from being cost or fuel efficient. I use it when I\u0027m done designing my payload and I just want it in space ASAP. It\u0027s ok in a normal career - tech tree is far from done, but I have enough cash to not care if my rocket costs 100K or 300k.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T07:20:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Korizan\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Korizan\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI could not get the thing to stop swaying no matter how much I reinforced it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to reinforcement you can also reduce the cause of the swaying: gimbal and/or reaction wheel force.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
