You don\\\u0027t wait for closest approach and then burn straight for Mars. That kind of trajectory is impossible without unrealistic engines (the kind that burn pixie dust and break thermodynamics into a million pieces), and even if you did have such engines it\\\u0027d be very inefficient. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstead you use a hohmann transfer orbit. This is an elliptical solar orbit that leaves Earth on one side of the Sun and meets Mars (or whatever your objective is) on the other. These orbits are very slow, since you have to travel all the way around the Sun, but they\\\u0027re generally the most practical trajectory to use. In real life an Earth-Mars hohmann transfer takes about nine months, although the trip time can be shortened by burning a bit more fuel, but using the same basic orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn practice a trip form Kerbin to the next planet out would probably take about 100 Earth-days real time, at absolute speeds in the ballpark of 10-15 km/s.

Nobody said interplanetary travel was going to be quick, that\\\u0027s in large part what makes it so difficult, but the answer for KSP is higher time acceleration (or better yet, the click-to-skip system that\\\u0027s been mentioned), not higher speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kosmo-not\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kosmo-not\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou don\\\u0027t need to achieve escape velocity of the sun to accomplish interplanetary travel.
