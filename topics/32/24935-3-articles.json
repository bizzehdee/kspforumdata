Any pilots that are training to become hot-shot space fighter jockeys are going to start their training in aircraft. The pilots will become used to banked turns, and engines burning to maintain speed. Once they transition to spacecraft, they would need to relearn the instinctive parts of flying all over, or they could use spacecraft designed to simulate it. The designers of the craft would use RCS to add roll when the pilot turns, even though it\u0027s not needed. The engines aren\u0027t really on, they just seem like they are to the pilot, because he knows that throttle is directly related to velocity. Raise the throttle up, and the engines burn to bring the ship up to speed and shut down, but the pilot doesn\u0027t need to worry about it. Lower the throttle, and the retrothrusters burn to slow the ship to the set speed, and turn off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Yes, it\u0027s silly, but it\u0027s as good an explanation as any other.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndOfTheEarth","CreatedById":24503,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T16:34:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDepends how you went about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was all about firing missiles from one ship to another, then it wouldn\u0027t make any sense, since to track another ship in space, the missile would have to be its own maneuverable spacecraft, and it could just be fired from the carrier vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it was all about directed energy weapons, then it would be a slightly different matter. History Channel used to have an excellent show titled \u0022Dogfights\u0022, and the last episode was an hour-long special called \u0022Dogfights of the Future\u0022. The last segment discussed how a potential battle between low-orbit spaceplanes might be performed, but the end result was exceptionally similar to docking; the person on offense is trying to keep directed at the enemy vehicle, while the target is working to prevent a \u0022docking\u0022 from happening by attempting to outmaneuver the turn radius of the aggressor\u0027s laser. However, most of these maneuvers would take place early, before either ship was in firing distance, in an attempt to throw off the other ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem that the History Channel people don\u0027t seem to think about is the possibility of a target ship flying backwards in LEO, and firing with its own weapon once both ships are within range of each other.

This battle is famous to this day, because warships designed to fire and hit targets at dozens of kilometers fough basically at a knife-fight range.
