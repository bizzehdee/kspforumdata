It took around 3 mun/minmus operations and about a dozen kerbin operations (orbital or otherwise) to unlock the tech tree to an acceptable minimum for interplanetary travel.\n\nBy this I mean;\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2attractive pods, \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2landing gear, \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2NERV, \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Mainsail, \n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A21\\*6 solar panels and large batteries.\n\n\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A2Decouplers \u0026 Docking nodes\n\nAfter these ~15 missions my save has been compromised from a rogue mod. On my next play-though (whenever i muster the patience to resume ksp), I will certainly be allocating myself 500k funds and 1500 science to eliminate the grind from the first act of the campaign mode.\n\nThe way I have increasingly come to view the campaign is a 3 part venture. Act 1- getting orbital, navigating Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Act 2- getting interplanetary, navigating Kerbol\u0027s SOI. Act 3- Establishing a functional and interconnected presence in the system. These ventures are not 100% linear and can occur simultaneously.\n\nIf you look at it like this, you will see that adjusting the funds or science in the career mode essentially determines the amount of activity you *must* undergo in the Kerbin SOI.\n\nUltimately, since you can virtually generate infinite science, even if you were to \u0022beat\u0022 the game, there would be no way to definitively tell that you even modified the base parameters (aside from your save being a \u0022custom\u0022, rather than normal campaign. Based on my personal stack of hours, \u0022beating\u0022 the game in any sense of the word is unlikely to begin with, so it\u0027s largely moot to feel bad, or feel like its cheating.\n\nThat mentality kept me struck grinding in kerbin\u0027s SOI for wayyy too many updates. My advice, adjust those sliders and go explore some far off reaches of space.\n\nTL:DR, if you\u0027re already comfortable in the kerbin SOI, there is nothing wrong with buffing your funds and science."},{"CreatedByName":"tranenturm","CreatedById":143304,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T15:29:25Z","Content":"I play in Normal.

However, as someone who usually likes to stick with the rules as they are given, I don\u0027t mind giving the KSC the budget that the US govt gives its military. So bumping up funds and fund rewards a bit helps kick things off. I don\u0027t just hand myself the victory, however. Reputation penalties get jacked up, as well. That does make me more careful as to what contracts I take on, because if I end up choosing one I can\u0027t finish for whatever reason, I can probably kiss a lot of lucrative contracts goodbye for a while. That also gets me to pay more attention to safety for my little green explorers. That does mean more flights for Jeb and Val for a while at the start until I unlock better drone modules and larger cockpits, as flying without SAS raises my blood pressure way too much.\n\nBut there really is no need to give yourself a boost in science. I have had some fun missions in Kerbin SOI and am just about to upgrade the R\u0026D to allow for the 500\u002B science selections, and haven\u0027t even landed on Minmus, yet.
