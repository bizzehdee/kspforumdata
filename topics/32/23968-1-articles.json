And by \u0022best\u0022 I mean lowest Delta V expended. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are the two main approaches I can think of:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA) Small retrograde burn from the Apoapse so your Periapse hits the moon/Mun/planet at your rough landing point (on the opposite side of the body you\u0027re trying to land on). Then warp and wait until you\u0027re several kilometres away from your landing point and retrograde burn all the way to the ground, killing both vertical and horizontal velocities in one burn, OR\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Burn retrograde as close as possible to being directly above your landing point, killing all your horizontal velocity and then doing a suicide burn to kill your vertical velocity once you have gotten closer to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can make some pictures if my question doesn\u0027t make sense but if it does, which would use less Delta V? My thoughts are that you\u0027d be using the same amount, no matter what approach you do, or it\u0027d be very similar...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ROFLCopter64bit","CreatedById":58314,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T03:26:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI alternate between them everytime I load from quicksave because I\u0027m horriffic at landing without cheating (AKA parachutes)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cesrate","CreatedById":57343,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T03:36:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAccording to Oberth Effect, the faster the ship moves in the gravity field while it burns, the higher the efficiency of the fuel will be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for me, I\u0027d like to do a full-manual landing without RCS, began to do the vertical descend when at several hundred meters above.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metaphor","CreatedById":57640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T03:39:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOption A is more delta-v efficient. It\u0027s always better to combine burns if possible. A 1000 m/s burn up and then 1000 m/s horizontally has the same effect as a 1414 m/s burn at a 45 degree angle, but the second one uses less delta-v. Plus in option B you\u0027re fighting the gravity of the planet. In the time between when you kill your horizontal velocity and when you land on the ground, the planet\u0027s gravity is accelerating you downward and adding to the delta-v required to come to a stop. For example, if the gravity is 10 m/s^2 and you spend 100 seconds falling to the ground, that\u0027s 1000 m/s extra delta-v that you need to use to land.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SalmonellaDingDong","CreatedById":57168,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T03:57:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI always do A.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jason Patterson","CreatedById":44388,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T04:21:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most efficient landing mirrors the most efficient launch. As a practical matter, you want to set it up so that you\u0027re coming in very shallow, with your periapsis barely above the ground. Wait until periapsis and burn horizontally as long as possible. This combines the benefits of Oberth with the fact that you\u0027re killing your velocity by burning sideways and avoiding gravity drag. As your velocity begins turning vertical, follow it until you\u0027re burning vertically and landing at the same time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting that to line up with actually landing at the spot you want to land at is more than just tricky, so what you can do, without losing any delta-v, is burning at your periapsis (which is at maybe 2-5km, depending on the body you\u0027re landing on) and circularizing your orbit. Then you\u0027re able to orbit until you\u0027re at whatever position you want and descend from there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EETA: Stopping and then falling onto your target is very wasteful of delta-v. It\u0027s equivalent to launching by shooting straight up, then burning straight sideways at your apoapsis. It works, but you burn an awful lot of gas doing it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T04:37:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Just follow the force of gravity, its easy\u0022 - Ford Prefect \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(sorry totally not helpful, it\u0027s getting/got late, I\u0027ll just go).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mr Cord","CreatedById":31492,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-25T04:48:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a lander sitting in orbit around the Mun so I thought I would give this a go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStarting from a 100k Orbit\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOption A.
