Suddenly while approaching the moon, the encounter kind of disappeared or rather changed in such a way that the periapsis was inside the moon. I corrected. It happended again. And again. About 5 oder 6 times till I was finally in the SOI. Has anyone of you encountered (ha ha) the same problem? Any idea why that is? Is there a way to anticipate this or prevent it?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problems start at about 15 to 16 min into the video.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cyOrpsLyQQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T13:04:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell my first thought would be some phantom forces going on. That ship is rather large and complicated. you can sometimes get a ship assembled in such a way that the physics starts tweeking out and you get minor, or sometimes major acceleration for no reason (kraken drives try to harness this) It could also be just the patched conics going weird too. Looked like a marginal encounter with tylo catching up to your ship. Good for a nice efficent insertion burn but it can mess with the conics as its not sure if your hiting or missing the SOI. A slight nudge either way and you either miss the SOI or end up comeing in from a different spot mucking up the final orbit and large ships wobbleing tend to make the orbits wobble a bit although normaly that straitens out in timewarp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said I\u0027ve never seen exactly what I saw in that video so cant be sure what caused it. The fact that it kept jumping the predicted orbit to the same general area, well away from where it should have been indicates something screwy going on and I\u0027m not sure what.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T13:16:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYes, though it\u0027s been a while and I was starting to hopefully suspect that they\u0027d fixed it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere seems to be some weird effect (Not sure if it\u0027s a force per se. It always seems to affect the the periapsis of your next encounter and it always seems to make it go down. I\u0027ve never observed it go up or normal, just inward).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe easiest way to fix it is to reload. IIRC f5/f9 doesn\u0027t work but going back to the space center and coming back to your ship does, but I\u0027d try F5/F9 first. As I said, it\u0027s been a while and I don\u0027t remember the fix off the top of my head.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"turkwinif","CreatedById":84592,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-09T19:19:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, I\u0027ve had phantom acceleration before. It\u0027s very annoying to see your orbit still changing when you\u0027ve stopped burning. Quicksaving and reloading usually fixes it. Sometimes I\u0027ll quickload from a quicksave and be accelerating to no end. I\u0027ve particularly noticed gradual periapsis/apoapsis changes when orbiting close to the sun, the closer you are the faster the changes, and I\u0027ve considered making a thread on it, but seeing as how getting into orbits around the sun that bring you very close are tedious to achieve in the first place, it\u0027s a minor problem. Plus, you\u0027re already whipping around the sun at very high speeds for KSP, so you\u0027d expect weird things to start happening.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
