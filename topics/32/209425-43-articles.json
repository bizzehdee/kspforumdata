If that\u0027s missing or corrupted the HDD will no longer be bootable. Not to worry though, this is something that a fresh OS install should fix. Now if there\u0027s already an OS on the drive and you\u0027re dead set on keeping that install, there are tools out there on the internet to fix or otherwise mess with the boot manager, but I\u0027ve always found it the easier solution to just re-install.\u003Cp\u003EIf this is showing even while you\u0027re trying to install the new OS, try going into the BIOS and messing with the boot priority settings, making sure that the HDD is dead last on the list, or even removing it completely (be sure to add it back when the windows installer is going to try and boot from it though) so that the pc has no choice but to boot from your installation media.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s what I\u0027m running into I\u0027ve tried that, I\u0027ve formatted the same two HDDs more times than I care to count.

Using the Nvidia CUDA features with Blender as opposed to CPU rendering (on an AMD quad-core - Phenom II BE) with my old AMD HD7970 reduced rendering times by roughly 20% (tested with a scene from the animation where the single frame took about 40 minutes to render on my old rig - the new single frame render took 32m 27s).
