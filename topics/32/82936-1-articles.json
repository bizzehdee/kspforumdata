Even though it says updated, it\u0027s not. Won\u0027t point fingers, but for now I can launch certain vehicles like the Saturn V.

What do you mean by \u0022crashola\u0022? I\u0027m assuming you mean that the game crashes on launch. As you said, it\u0027s probably a mod, as KSP isn\u0027t the most optimized but can run on most systems. Please check for mod updates before asking this sort of question, as many mods were broken between 0.23.5 and 0.24 (most are updated by now). Also, try playing stock for some time. I used to be a heavy mod junkie, but after 0.18 forced me to go stock for a while, I found it more interesting. Of course, a few mods like FAR/NEAR or perhaps SP\u002B won\u0027t hurt.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-26T17:52:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESorry to hear that you\u0027re having a bad time.
