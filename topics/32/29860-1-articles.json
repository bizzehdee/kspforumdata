Watching a few landing tutorials on YouTube helps quite a bit, if you\u0027re not the kind of person who grew up absorbing details of the space program. What made the difference for me was the Flight Engineer mod; it provides the more detailed information of MechJeb, but without any kind of autopilot to rely on. Just having separate readouts for horizontal and vertical velocity made landings much, much easier, since it allows you to kill all horizontal drift in the final stage of the descent without having to wait for the navball to shift to Surface mode.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut honestly, a Mun landing just should not be causing you severe problems. It\u0027s not a high-gravity world (removing your margin for error and requiring a lot of fuel to brake), it\u0027s not a ridiculously low-gravity moon like Gilly, there\u0027s no atmosphere to tumble you, the terrain isn\u0027t horribly uneven, and it\u0027s not spinning too fast to make precision landings difficult. It\u0027s a good place to learn the basics of manual landings, which\u0027ll make things far easier for you once you graduate to the more difficult bodies. (Try landing on Laythe with a non-aerodynamic brick some time.) I just landed a horribly ungainly mobile drilling rig on Mun (~110 tons), and THAT was a difficult descent due to the awkward mass distribution, but a simple capsule should not be causing you that many headaches.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Echostatic","CreatedById":59603,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:08:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Spatzimaus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EJust having separate readouts for horizontal and vertical velocity made landings much, much easier, since it allows you to kill all horizontal drift in the final stage of the descent without having to wait for the navball to shift to Surface mode.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust fyi, you can click on your speed readout above the navball to manually toggle between surface and orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xandski","CreatedById":56858,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:21:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMechJeb 2.0 works a lot better than 1.8 for landings but if you want to learn to do it manually watch this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/eVPMTQfOvYQ?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rage097","CreatedById":66193,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T23:37:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EY\u0027know...ya could just...not use MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-\u003Cem\u003Etotally not a purist\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
