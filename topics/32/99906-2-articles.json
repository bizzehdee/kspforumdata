Given that keyboards are binary, and binary motion control doesn\u0027t really work so well, we need a throttle. Particularly because it takes a while to rove somewhere; I\u0027m not normally firing rocket engines on a trip, but if I\u0027m roving the engine is always running (which is why I tend to control rovers via Mechjeb for actual trips: it lets me set it and do something else for a while while it roves, because I don\u0027t have time nor patience to spend 20 minutes or more holding \u0027W\u0027 while staring at perfectly monotonous scenery).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T22:15:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FlyingPete\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FlyingPete\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ERovers are pretty useless on places like Minmus though- there\u0027s just not enough traction on the wheels.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAu contraire mon frere!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/rn1nD86.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022rn1nD86.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"micr0wave","CreatedById":136352,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-17T22:17:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei really like my rover, can cruise pretty fast even on minmus, you can always flip back in case you should land on the roof, which also has some sort of suspension, and always brought all my kerbals back home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/6bALX\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
