After a long time of reflecting and more news from squad, I have acquired a more positive outlook on the situation. This does not mean I and everyone else were completely out of hand with our original response. I am here to share my new feelings on the current situation and offer constructive criticism.**\n\n*Let\u0027s first look at the bad* (or more correctly what people think the move to PS4 will do to the game) *and analyze why there has been so much negative feedback so far.* \n\n- By moving to PS4 players think squad will neglect to further develop the PC version of the game.\n- Version 1.0 of the game was released in a very rough and rushed condition. Many are still upset and really want to see another update. (The larger landing gears do not even come with a rolling animation, steering etc.)\n- Players really want to see further optimization of the game including a move to Unity 5 and a release of a stable x64 bit version.\n- Many claim that the port to PS4 is a simple money grab by squad and are doing it just for the sake of doing it.\n- A variety of bugs and glitches still exist in the game and in version 1.0 crashes even more than previous releases.\n- Opening the game to the console community might bring in a large number of younger and immature forum members.\n- ***The studio tasked with porting the game to PS4 is fairly inexperienced and unknown, working primarily on cheap mobile games***.\n\n*This sounds like a lot and there certainly is more to be said... But most of these claims are not entirely founded in reality. In fact, opening the game to PS4 could bring in quite a few benefits.*\n\n- Squad has recently shared that the PS4 port is only increasing the pace of development on the PC version.\n- Squad shared in the most recent development notes that their current project is moving the PC version to Unity 5.\n- Unity 5 will finally bring a feature players have been looking for ages: Multi-core support. The part count limit for vessels will be staggering.\n- The move to Unity 5 itself will probably bring in a whole new wave of bugs and glitches to the game. So it makes logical sense that they are waiting to fix these things until a future date.\n- The entire wheels and landing gear system will be totally re-done. Modular wheels will now be a thing in stock KSP. So again... why fix the pre-existing problems with stuff that will inevitably be replaced anyways?\n- ***It has been confirmed the PC version and PS4 version will be separate. If the studio squad hired fails miserably it wont mean anything to us.***\n- Even if this move to PS4 is \u0022*a money grab*\u0022 why is that a bad thing? Unfortunately I must admit the console market is huge... Why is more money for the developers a bad thing? More money can mean more resources later for developing the PC version.\n- As far as having immature forum members joining the community... I hardly believe that is too much of a possibility. I doubt that type of audience would ever want to join the forums in the first place.\n\nSo in conclusion... Although there is such a huge flame in the community right now I do not entirely believe that is warranted. I realized if we really want to see continued the development I don\u0027t think the best way to do that is express hatred for these recent decisions. Instead we should try to highlight what positives there are from the situation. \n\nSome have pointed out that some of squad\u0027s recent development notes have indicated they are caring less for the existing community. But they are developers after all... not PR spokesmen. I don\u0027t think it would be unreasonable to hire some people specifically to cater more towards the community as that interaction has been very limited recently. But for the most part we should just let them do what they are good at. I am not overwhelmingly happy for the recent news either but although there could be negatives surrounding the situation there are definitely positives too.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T19:58:55Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 07:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Jon144**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tankman101","CreatedById":144359,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:01:16Z","Content":"PS4 pro and con list.\n\nAKA\n\nWild speculation and issue parroting megathread.\n\nSeriously, if you are going to make a pro-con list, at least list actual issues and not theoretical ones."},{"CreatedByName":"Wiseman","CreatedById":116239,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T19:06:56Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E *But most of these claims are not entirely founded in reality.*\n\nThen why repeat them again?

All of the issues raised by everyone at the moment is purely theoretical. The thing people are forgetting is that there is a great opportunity here.

I do not believe in the theoretical complaints and the empty predictions that KSP PS4 will go wrong. My apologies, I need to explain a lot better what I\u0027m getting at.\n\nI *hate* console gaming. I just don\u0027t like the competition between companies, the price of games, and the console community as a whole. I started gaming with the PC, and I don\u0027t want to play on anything else. That is why I \u0022don\u0027t care\u0022 how the PS4 port goes; no matter what, I won\u0027t be playing it anytime soon. As such, I have no opinion over the whole matter except that I hope this does turn out for the best. I won\u0027t deny the fact that there is not enough information for a just decision.\n\nSorry if I don\u0027t get my facts straight, I\u0027ve been a bit out of the KSP community lately and I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if some stuff went under my radar. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Bomaye","CreatedById":131526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T22:50:12Z","Content":"Is this an experimental thread of some kind???\n\nIf not it would qualify for top 100 Darwin Award (Karwin Award?) ;-)"},{"CreatedByName":"SelectHalfling0","CreatedById":105051,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T23:44:48Z","Content":"I really could care less about the ps4 release.
