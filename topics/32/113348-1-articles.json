Although there is such a huge flame in the community right now I do not entirely believe that is warranted. I realized if we really want to see continued the development I don\u0027t think the best way to do that is express hatred for these recent decisions. Instead we should try to highlight what positives there are from the situation. \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#000000;\u0022\u003ESome have pointed out that some of squad\u0027s recent development notes have indicated they are caring less for the existing community. But they are developers after all... not PR spokesmen. I don\u0027t think it would be unreasonable to hire some people specifically to cater more towards the community as that interaction has been very limited recently. But for the most part we should just let them do what they are good at.
