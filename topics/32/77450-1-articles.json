These are benchmarks for obits I\u0027ve found I frequently use. I just wanted a tool to help me ball-park target velocities and dV costs when making orbit after landing, or slowing down during captures.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe file\u0027s \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.dropbox.com/s/rconz1mfz2d3zpy/OrbitalVelocities_v1_1.xlsx\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.
