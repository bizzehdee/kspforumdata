Since I think the game is really well made and addicting, I was wondering why the developers didn\u0027t address what seems to be a major concern for a lot of users.\n\nIt becomes natural after playing at the hard level in carreer mode, but also for a matter of simulating reality, to try to recover the initial stages of the rocket, commonly defined debries. In theory after the last update the engine is supposed to be able to take care of whatever is detaching from your rocket in a range of 20km\u003E, at the same time multiple mods addressed the issue.\n\nMy question is then, why the developers didn\u0027t take it seriously and didn\u0027t address the problem? Even a simple solution like the one present in the mods would have been enough... and if it is possible to track the debries (when they have a parachute) down to the launch pad, why then they have to disappear without recovering some of their value?\n\nThe second major concern is about how the launch of multiple \u0022space ships\u0022 is managed. Here I may miss something, but I\u0027m having troubles tracking and managing 2 or more vehicles when they are detaching from the same rocket (manned pods).\n\nGoing back in the forum there are multiple users rising such concerns, even years ago.

I think that is partly why debris still disappears after a certain range, so the game can just focus on processing the craft in focus. I would like better stage recovery, but I\u0027d rather have the game run better.\n\nRegarding the managing of multi craft launched from the same craft (I presume once in orbit). If they are right by each other then yes, seeing which is which in map mode can be tricky, but if they are that close (and within 2.2km) then you can use the square brackets [ ] to switch (something I do so much I\u0027ve bound those keys to two extra buttons on my mouse). \n\nI do think orbital (map mode) view could do with some improvements. \n\n- As it is the current craft has it\u0027s orbit in blue while all other orbits are white (with the exception of a target\u0027s orbit which is green). I\u0027d like it if the icon for the focus craft was also blue and similarly if the icon for a target craft was green (or at least had a coloured outline). I also think we need more icon styles for different craft types and the ability to add our own custom icons.\n\n- I think when zoomed right out (viewing the whole solar system) the individual craft around a planet should be somewhat masked so it is easier to select just the planet and not accidentally switch to a craft in orbit of it. That has been a bit improved and you do get the \u0022focus view\u0022 option come up, but not always. In addition to the focus view there should be an expanding list that lists all the craft in orbit and for each one gives you the option to switch to or set as target. That way you can easily select a target craft that\u0027s in orbit of a different planet from the one you are focused on without needing to first switch to the target\u0027s planet and then switch back to which ever one you are currently on."},{"CreatedByName":"csiler2","CreatedById":62800,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T15:43:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E in 2015 may be ... in 2500 may be not ... just get used to it or reproduce the same mistakes again and again ; ) because nahhh traffic density quickly rising in 50 years !!! it never happen before it\u0027s just a urban legend ; )\n\u003E \n\u003E [http://s3.e-monsite.com/2011/02/28/03/resize_550_550//evolution-trafic-aerien.jpg](http://s3.e-monsite.com/2011/02/28/03/resize_550_550//evolution-trafic-aerien.jpg)\n\nTrue, but by then I would think we would be using something like an advanced version of Spaceship One or realized versions of the many canceled SSTOs rather than chemical rockets, which are coming close to reaching their maximum potential (part of the reason Space X abandoned a recoverable upper-stage). Since we can create SSTOs with space-planes in the hanger, I don\u0027t see why this is an issue.\n\nBesides, stage reuse is way more expensive and annoying than engineers care to admit. The Space Shuttle was supposed to launch once a week according to spec, but launched maybe every six months at the height of launch frequency and cost way more per refurbishment period. The Redstone rockets in Project Mercury were designed to be recoverable, but this was never implemented because the cost of refurbishing engines damaged by salt-water corrosion was more expensive than just building a new rocket.\n\nThe only reason Space X may make this work is because they are sacrificing significant payload fractions to land their first stages under power on dry land rather than letting them splash down into the ocean."},{"CreatedByName":"Kuu Lightwing","CreatedById":142724,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T15:52:06Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E in 2015 may be ... in 2500 may be not ... just get used to it or reproduce the same mistakes again and again ; ) because nahhh traffic density quickly rising in 0 years !!! it never happen before it\u0027s just a urban legend not to car\u0027 a boot ... ; )\n\nUmm, I don\u0027t think we are using 2500-level tech in the game.
