If you\u0027re not quite perfectly lined up on the node or don\u0027t execute it quite right, it WILL Move, as the game recalculates the thrust vector and amount needed to achieve the maneuver dynamically.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sapphire","CreatedById":67918,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T04:07:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhoa, looks like some posts disappeared, including mine when I was replying to Jarin... \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo repeat what I said, I built a quick interplanetary ship to test it, set in a course to Duna, and I\u0027m still getting drift on my burns.
