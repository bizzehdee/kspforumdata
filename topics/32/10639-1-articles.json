My idea: improved crashing animation. basically, when parts collide, the can break into pieces, so like half a landing leg, or pieces of the fuel tank shell. also, i noticed that the landing legs explode, that shouldn\\\u0027t happen. And more, if a fuel tank is empty, it doesn\\\u0027t explode on impact with the ground, but gets crushed, or deformed by the impact, to make it more realistic. last but not least, i think you should be able to start an investigation following a crash, to see what went wrong, like what NASA did after Apollo 1, Apollo 13, Challenger, and STS-107. those are my ideas, i\\\u0027d appreciate feedback\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T16:18:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think that you can alreadya see what goes wrong, if you need more/less struts, winglets, SAS, engines, fuel tanks, parachutes, RCS thrusters... that\\\u0027s all visible at a normal failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also don\\\u0027t think that purely graphical improvements will be added soon, especially if they make it just more complicated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOh, and welcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sciencepanda","CreatedById":15485,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T16:30:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ethat\\\u0027s not exactly what i meant, perhaps i should explain. Not only what goes wrong as far as parts hitting other parts, but like what happened to my rocket last week. i was launching, had an ASAS on board, and it was turned on, but out of nowhere, about 15 seconds MET, the rocket started yawing out of control, and adding RCS, or gambling engines didn\\\u0027t help. i would like to be able to find out why things like that happen. you can\\\u0027t improve your rocket if you don\\\u0027t know the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kreuzung","CreatedById":21035,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T16:39:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it is generally bad design if you can\\\u0027t fix it.

With a bit of luck the animations will improve; unfortunately the diagnostics are harder to code - how does the game tell you your rocket was tail-heavy, for instance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to your specific issue: that sounds like a tail-heavy rocket. As the top tanks of a rocket drain, the centre-of-mass of the rocket shifts towards the back \u003Cstrong\u003Ebut\u003C/strong\u003E the centre-of-drag doesn\\\u0027t. So if the rocket points even slightly away from the direction it is heading, atmospheric drag acts to push it further off course . Imagine an arrow fired backwards: the weight at the back want to go at the front, and the drag at the front wants to go at the back. No amount of SAS or ASAS will help with this sort of problem!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suspect you were launching a very tall, thin rocket with lots of boosters at the bottom? If you make the design shorter and fatter then that helps - put fewer boosters at the bottom, and use radial LF stacks feeding fuel to the core stack so weight is lost more from the sides and less from the top.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemove \u003Cem\u003Eany\u003C/em\u003E stabilisers that aren\\\u0027t right at the bottom, as fins and stabilisers at the top or half-way-up only add drag in the wrong place!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust in case, next time you see this failure, hit F3. This will pause the game and bring up the Flight Events screen, so you can see if any components have failed or broken off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RC1062","CreatedById":10709,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-15T17:06:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022softweir\u0022 data-cite=\u0022softweir\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately the diagnostics are harder to code - how does the game tell you your rocket was tail-heavy, for instance?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich brings me to your specific issue: that sounds like a tail-heavy rocket.

An empty fuel tank is basically just a big metal can, and when it hits something, the metal will bent, tare, and dent; there\\\u0027s no combustion, because there\\\u0027s no fuel. same thing with the lander legs, they\\\u0027re just long metal struts that move, there\\\u0027s not fuel or explosives in them.
