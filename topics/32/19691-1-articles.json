The idea is that you have a gas superheated in what is essentially an open ended nuclear reactor. The gas expands based on the heat exchange from the nuclear reaction and then you thrust based on that expansion. The benefit being you\u0027re not simply burning a fuel to make it heat and expand, you\u0027re both heating a gas as well as generating power from the nuclear reactor....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally, the secondary benefit isn\u0027t really needed in KSP, but... they are more efficient overall.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn idea was to launch a nuclear powered \u0022space bus\u0022 in a high Earth orbit and leave it in orbit any time we would need to reach the moon.
