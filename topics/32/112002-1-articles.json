Maybe others have seen it already (haven\u0027t been on the forums in a few weeks) but just in the off chance that you guys haven\u0027t, here\u0027s a thread about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I fly my spaceplanes to orbit, I usually follow a flight path that has been posted many times here in the past: fly up to about 12km, level out and possibly shallow dive to break sound barrier, go up to 20k and about 1000m/s when you will likely run out of air. Activate rocket engines, pull up hard and boost into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\u0027s that \u0022pull up hard and boost into orbit\u0022 bit that I noticed something strange about. Usually I just angle up to 45-60\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 and try to get the heck out of the atmosphere as soon as possible. Seems sensible, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell.... not exactly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein my latest spaceplane, I didn\u0027t pack enough oxidizer so I the RAPIERS ran out before I even got apoaps above 70km. I had 2 NERVA\u0027s active (was trying to go for a long range spaceplane), but they weren\u0027t giving nearly enough thrust to push me out of the atmosphere or give me enough lateral velocity to get orbital speed before I\u0027d reach the apoaps. But I figured, hey, let\u0027s just burn em till they run dry. At least I\u0027ll see if they overheat or not. Sure enough, the NERVA\u0027s never were able to push me to space, and I soon began falling back into the atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand then at about 30 km, I stopped falling.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems that, given a decent amount of speed (I was around 1600m/s at the time), at around 30 km altitude, spaceplanes will \u0022float\u0022 on the atmosphere. This gave the NERVA\u0027s more than enough time to increase my velocity past orbital velocity and hey, presto, apoapsis at 120km, and almost all of it was done on NERVA power, meaning it was super efficient.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo yeah, I\u0027m not sure if other people know or do this already, but the next couple of days I\u0027m going to be experimenting with a flight path where my spaceplane levels out again at 30-33km in its boost phase, and goes to orbital velocity there on nothing but NERVA power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ejust thought I\u0027d share.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECirocco\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-04T22:19:35Z\u0022 title=\u002206/04/2015 10:19  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Cirocco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-04T22:33:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cirocco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cirocco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EActivate rocket engines, pull up hard and boost into orbit.\u003Cp\u003ENow, it\u0027s that \u0022pull up hard and boost into orbit\u0022 bit that I noticed something strange about.

However, I also feel that it is time to get out of dodge (32km) as quickly as possible. I have usually finished air breathing at around 10* upwards pitch to gain as much speed as possible at the edge of the air. When the rockets fire, I find a 20* pitch to usually be a good compromise between losing too much speed and getting out of dodge. After 32km, I follow prograde until I reach my apoapsis.

Once you get into that situation a low-TWR stage can continue to raise Ap, you just need enough to overcome the small amount of drag. I\u0027ve used a similar ascent before (see album below, not a spaceplane but the same idea applies) and found it better to point just a bit above prograde rather than pitching up significantly; the thrust component perpendicular to prograde is energy lost (effectively just changing the eccentricity of the orbit).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/5LY1C\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled.
