Some of them are decades old yet they carry with them some sort of distinction, like when someone says Zelda and it always rings a bell. We\u0027ve seen games like Counter-Strike, DoTA and many more games that have gained significant following for many years - something that has led to new versions/remakes (e.g. CS: Source, CS: GO, DoTA 2). I\u0027m not comparing genres here. KSP is way too different from CS and DoTA. I just want to know your opinion on whether KSP has the \u0027material\u0027 to stay alive for many more years to come. What are the chances that future generations will like the game (and possibly improve it, maybe even remake it! *no offense Squad*) and won\u0027t just let it fade into obscurity?
