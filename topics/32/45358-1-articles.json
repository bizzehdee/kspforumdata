I had an Minmus base with lots of parts connected with KAS cables for sharing resources. connecting an new part and an huge 3.5 meter fuel tank on landing legs rotated in slow motion and tried to land on its head. it lost an landing leg but was still useful for fuel storage laying on its side but it kind of made me nervous.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-09T11:49:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think, vehicles that get focussed are... well, instanciated again in the world, and physics is switched on shortly after. I guess this is the same phenomena like if you launch your space craft from the launch pod: as soon as you hit start, it hovers in mid air, and it takes a second or two until physics kicks in.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess this is done to avoid collision issues, so it\u0027s neither bug nor feature, but rather a workaround.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think you should report that. It is probably well-known, but the developers should know that more and more people are running into this problem, so maybe they consider other solutions.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
