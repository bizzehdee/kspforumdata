At least, after he got into space ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nEvery 10 minutes I drop a time stamp, so if you can find a spot in the video more easily. Something in \u0022quotes\u0022 means it was directly said, though I frequently don\u0027t bother with that. [brackets] are those rare times where the accent barrier keeps me from understanding something, and *italics are descriptions of what Max is doing in the game, with asides and commentary by me where I feel the desire*.\n\n0:00\n\nUpcoming relay system that Ted talked about (no info, just mentioning it)\n\nMax was sick last week.\n\n*He\u0027s planning on a polar Minmus orbit in order to complete some survey contracts.*\n\n*He\u0027s planning on bringing only a scientist, no pilot. \u0022I think we can handle it\u0022*\n\nGoing in a different direction and depth from RemoteTech.\n\n\u0022A bunch of mods have great ideas but we don\u0027t fully agree with the entire design.\u0022\n\nBigger picture: Why are you doing it?\n\nBack a little, they are updating to U5. So far proven to be not a small amount of work.\n\nA lot of work, to get the game to be the same as it is now, but on U5.\n\nBut they also have the help of collaborators. Roverdude, Arsonide, who are helping add more stuff to the game.\n\nThey are super skilled, and squad has things they want for a long time but don\u0027t have the time to do them.\n\nSo, why not have the collaborators do the extra stuff while they work on U5?\n\n*His rocket flips as it becomes bottom heavy. He aborts the launch.*\n\nBeen talking internally about antennae for a long time.\n\n10:00\n\nQ: If this is \u0022step 1\u0022 does that mean that there are more steps? Specifically in 1.1?\n\nA: \u0022Possibly. Maybe.\u0022\n\nAlso have the advantage of U5 that will allow for more thigns than they could do before.\n\nMore things regarding to efficiency.\n\nThey have some numbers, however he will not share them because they want to get the U5 update into as many testers as they usually do, to get better numbers.\n\nOptimistic, but they want hard numbers.\n\n*He launches the same rocket.*\n\nQ: Will system requirements stay the same?\n\nA: \u0022Absolutely.\u0022 If it ran before U5, it\u0027ll run after U5.\n\n*The rocket flips. He decides to hire a pilot.*\n\nQ: Multiplayer?\n\nA: \u0022Actually, we\u0027re working [on?] Multiplayer now.\u0022 Harvester has \u0022partially transitioned to help with the multiplayer development.\u0022\n\nJesus has got the guts working. \n\n*He can\u0027t hire a pilot, as he has 5 Kerbonauts already. He terminates 2 flights to kill 2 of the Kerbals.*\n\n*Then he notices (as he\u0027s about to terminate the 3rd flight) that he actually successfully got the ship into orbit 2 weeks ago.*\n\nExpect more development blogs from Ted.\n\nQ: Any plans for pre-flight planning?\n\nA: \u0022We have had that idea rolling around in our heads forever. Being able to make something called a Launch Node.\u0022\n\n\u0022Very very very complex.\u0022\n\n20:00\n\n(Re: Launch Node) Maybe after U5 (which could help), but \u0022right now it\u0027s looking really iffy.\u0022\n\n*He gets an encounter with Minmus.*\n\nQ: Will the new \u0022AntennaRange Thing\u0022 going to be toggleable?\n\nA: Once it\u0027s in playtesting, they will know what parameters to tweak in it. It depends on the playtesters.\n\n*He tweaks his encounter until it\u0027s equatorial and close, using a maneuver node. Then he explains that after he gets into Minmus\u0027 SOI he\u0027ll twist it Polar.*\n\n*I know. I\u0027m just describing what he\u0027s doing, not saying it\u0027s what you should do.*\n\nQ: Do Lagrange Points exist?\n\nA: \u0022They most certainly do not.\u0022 While super cool as a concept, it will be hard on the processor. Which KSP already is. It will also make maintaining an orbit \u0022really, really hard.\u0022\n\n*He gets to Minmus SOI, sets up a node and executes it to encounter the pole. It\u0027s not \\*that\\* expensive, 161m/s, but still* ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nMax would love one day to be in a nursing home and watching the first man on Mars mention that he got into space because of Kerbal Space Program.\n\nQ: Gamer\u0027s Edition?\n\nA: \u0022At this point it doesn\u0027t look like the Gamer\u0027s Edition is going to happen.\u0022 Not enough fan interest. But they\u0027re okay with it.\n\nQ: PS4, and Flying Tiger?\n\nA: He\u0027s excited to try the PS4 port, and is happy to be working with Flying Tiger. He wants to play KSP with the PS4 controller. He likes doing business deals, talking to businessmen. Many don\u0027t but Max enjoys it.\n\n30:00\n\n*He reviews the contract. One of them is \u0022below 5400.\u0022 The rest are Above.*\n\nQ: Is the UI going to change?\n\nA: \u0022That is our goal\u0022 (to stay the same). \u0022Roughly the same.\u0022\n\n*He burns down to get under a waypoint that the contract says to be above.*\n\n*He lucks out and is still above it when he does the crew report.*\n\n*He also gets a 2nd contract completed at the same time.*\n\n*Kasper(Vid?) points out that he didn\u0027t need to burn down, as the contracts were \u0022Above.\u0022*\n\n*He gets the 3rd one, and is left with the final, \u0022Below\u0022 survey.*\n\n40:00\n\nHints that Squad has more games in the plans, in addition to KSP.\n\n*He goes for the final survey point. He\u0027s too high by almost 2km as he goes in...*\n\n*...and he leaves the survey point at about 200m too high.*\n\nQ: More planets?\n\nA: Currently no plans, but if performance gains from U5 occur it is something they\u0027ll look into. \u0022We need better asset management before we can think of new planets.\u0022\n\nQ: Are the creators of KSP making the PS4 version.\n\nA: We are helping but the heavy work is being done by Flying Tiger.\n\nHe likes Flying Tiger because of their experience with Unity and because they\u0027re independent, like Squad.\n\n*He tries again to hit his survey point. He gets the survey done at 4700m. He\u0027s in orbit on the night side of Minmus.*\n\n*He burns up and successfully avoids crashing into Minmus.*\n\nDiscussing why he sent a Kerbal instead of a probe for this dangerous mission (other than, I presume, because the contract was for Crew Reports):\n\n\u0022Since we do not have currently - and who knows about the future - since we currently do not have a life support system.\u0022\n\n*He finds a contract for temp scans at Minmus, and has a thermometer on the ship. So he extends the mission.*\n\nQ: Roverdude\u0027s Life support mod?\n\nA: Very sneaky question. Currently no life support plans. But who knows about the future.\n\n50:00\n\nQ: Are you a dev?\n\nA: No I\u0027m a producer. This is Harvester\u0027s thing. \u0022100% his baby.\u0022\n\n*The ship goes way low to hit the contract, skims the surface, and is still 700m too high when he leaves the zone.*\n\n*He nails an \u0022Above\u0022 reading.*\n\n*Right before the end he nails one of the below ones. He gets an orbit, and ends the stream.*\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-25T02:35:13Z\u0022 title=\u002207/25/2015 02:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by 5thHorseman**"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T02:38:48Z","Content":"Thanks for the transcript.\n\nAlso, nothing about 64bit in 1.1 even though that got asked a few times?"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T02:39:34Z","Content":"Good summary, I wonder what is in the works at Squad for a potential next game..."},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T03:03:18Z","Content":"The \u0027Launch Node\u0027 sounds *v*\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9*ery* interesting. \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9I\u0027ve wanted more detailed means to plan my missions (rather than tabbing out and checking a delta-v map) for a long time now."},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-25T03:20:59Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Thanks for the transcript.\n\u003E Also, nothing about 64bit in 1.1 even though that got asked a few times?\n\nI\u0027m trying to remember.
