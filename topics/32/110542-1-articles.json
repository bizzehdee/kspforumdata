Way back when I started playing in .15 or .17 or whenever I started, the panels operated identically, but were only different cosmetically, AND the descriptions were different, stating the shielded ones were retractable and the unshielded ones were not. I never used the shielded ones because the unshielded ones had less mass (I think) and they actually retracted, so there was no use in the other ones. But now they are working AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED, which makes complete sense. Now there is a place for each type.
