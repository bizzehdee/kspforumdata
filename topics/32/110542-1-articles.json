Way back when I started playing in .15 or .17 or whenever I started, the panels operated identically, but were only different cosmetically, AND the descriptions were different, stating the shielded ones were retractable and the unshielded ones were not. I never used the shielded ones because the unshielded ones had less mass (I think) and they actually retracted, so there was no use in the other ones. But now they are working AS ORIGINALLY INTENDED, which makes complete sense. Now there is a place for each type. If you\u0027re not going to be in an atmosphere after deploying them (spaceplanes or aerobraking), then the unshielded are the way to go, but if you need them to retract........\n\nAnd as to the IRL versions, what spacecraft have we built that had large wing style solar panels that needed to be retracted automatically? I can\u0027t think of any. KSP is showing us the future in this aspect.
