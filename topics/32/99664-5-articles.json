Everybody using FAR likes it. And even those new people who know how real planes look and how you have to fly them have no problem playing with FAR.\u003Cp\u003EMost people saying FAR is bad are probably people who 1. have never flown a simulated plane before and are new to all the controls and behaviours that are involved AND 2. Probably started with stock Aero and got used to it, by now they know how stock behaves, what is possible and what not and how planes have to be flown in stock. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA lot here comes from the fear of having to go through the learning curve again, they have mastered one curve already (for stock) and don\u0027t want to lose all their Atmo capabilities and have to relearn all the things they want to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis right here. If a FAR-like (or at least a NEAR-like) aerodynamics model had been introduced much earlier, people would not be protesting against a more realistic model as they are now. KSP would have been just as popular as it is now. It\u0027s the sociological problem that people are generally resistant to change is what truly is driving this debate, not the differences in difficulty of the two aerodynamic models in question. The switch to FAR from stock is a perceived difficulty because it is different to what the person is used to, and that person uses this perceived difficulty as an excuse rather than acknowledging their resistance to the change. I don\u0027t fault these people because everyone does it throughout their entire lives. I\u0027ve been playing with FAR for over a year now, and the other day I tried the game with stock aerodynamics and I struggled; I recognized that this was the perceived difficulty I had mentioned since I struggled just the same when I made the switch from stock to FAR a while back (at the time I initially blamed it on FAR being more difficult). But I also do acknowledge that there are a few people that legitimately find FAR to be more difficult than the current stock model, but the same can be said about the reverse of that statement. I guess my point is that you cannot debate the difficulty of the two models unless you have played both of them extensively. If you are still in the learning curve for FAR, of course it is going to be more difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the new aerodynamics model that Squad is working on, I guess we\u0027ll just have to wait and see what they ultimately come up with.

Part of that is my low level flying skills, but also the fact that the huge wing surface gave a gliding slope somewhere upwards of 20:1; any attempts to \u0022flare up\u0022 to bleed speed would have the craft immediately gain altitude, so landing was very frustrating.

I understand the OP\u0027s, and other\u0027s, frustrations with FAR. But really, just give it time and eventually you will reach the point of no turning back.
