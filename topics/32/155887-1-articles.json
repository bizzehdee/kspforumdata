Or I have managed to avoid this loop entirely. But I figured I\u0027d share anyway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you make a named quicksave on the launchpad before your first hit of the spacebar, when you \u0022revert to launch\u0022 it reverts to that quicksave, not to the default launch state. This does not work with a normal quicksave, only a named one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy is this important? It\u0027s not, really. It saves you having to alt-f9 to load that quicksave but it is really nice and convenient.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo thanks to whomever added that, whenever it was added.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Streetwind","CreatedById":98962,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-02T07:45:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCurious!
