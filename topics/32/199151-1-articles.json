However, I ran into a few bugs/issues that were frustrating:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0You have to park really close to do the ship-to-ship construction (which is fine (but difficult without docking ports)).\u00A0 When I parked my Engineer on the ladder of either craft, it seemed like he added random impulses to the craft making it impossible to steer them next together and stay stationary. (was his jetpack helping with RCA to stabilize or something?\u2014if so, can it not?)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0Therefore, I had to float freely to do the construction, this made it challenging to place the pieces where I wanted (which is fine and expected) but I miss-clicked with a solar panel and it got placed randomly in space next to the craft and gave the craft a huge impulse in a random direction.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, you know, thanks!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-12-28T17:39:58Z\u0022 title=\u002212/28/2020 05:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 28, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by larsonco\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Emissing a close parenthesis\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr.Seuss","CreatedById":209202,"CreatedDateTime":"2021-01-04T20:25:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve been loving the EVA construction tools-- I\u0027m building a much larger space station now than i would have been able to do otherwise-- but I\u0027ve also noticed some bugs. Specifically, pieces stopped snapping to each-other in EVA construction mode at some point, seemingly randomly. also, It has occasionally allowed me to place parts inside of other parts, but without connecting them-- so they are considered two different ships-- which has the effect of more or less tele-fragging me into the great unknown\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
