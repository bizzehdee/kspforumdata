It is in development for a reason because if it were working perfectly we\u0027d be releasing by now.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen a lot more people that don\u0027t understand that since KSP turned up on Steam. I don\u0027t blame the Steam community, however. Basically, when KSP was just on KerbalSpaceProgram.com, it was hard to arrive there and not realize that the game was still in development, and while you were buying the released program, you were being given access to the game while it is still in development. And most people understood what that meant. Not everyone, but most seemed to get it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn steam, however, it\u0027s more in the presence of finished games, so not everyone is noticing the category it\u0027s in or the details, so they think they\u0027re getting a game that is either finished or nearly finished. If nothing else, it\u0027s higher profile now, so even if the same percentage of people don\u0027t get it, there\u0027s more people that don\u0027t get it just because there\u0027s more people.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the 0.20 release, there were bugs. There have been bugs in every release, though this time it feels buggier than usual, mostly because of the nature of the changes that came. Very few parts and features, it\u0027s more the game infrastructure that changed, and your average game player isn\u0027t as likely to notice that as they are new things to do, so it seems like we got almost nothing, but that almost nothing brought a lot of bugs. Some people saw it that way, some went farther to say that the testers fell down on the job because the devs never should have released this version with all these bugs. On the other hand, there\u0027s also people that aren\u0027t being severely affected by these problems wondering what all the fuss was about. You can\u0027t judge how many people are in each camp based on the forums. As a WoW dev once put it, judging the health of the game by the forums is like judging the health of the nation by the health of the people in the hospital.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs people on the forums started reporting issues with the 0.20 release, there were people who were upset and angry that the devs had let them down, and some of those people were quite vocal about it. There were people that were happy with what they got. And there were people who were disappointed, but trying to figure out what the problem was. The impression I had was that there were more in the first group than the third, but that could easily be that the third was going about it quietly while not everyone in the first group was. I still gave what advice I could to anyone that wasn\u0027t just raging. It\u0027s a game, the point is to have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen reading some raging post, though, I have to admit that I at least think \u0022It\u0027s an alpha. If you want a polished, mostly-bug-free experience, find something else to play until this game is released, or at least into late beta.\u0022 Not out of hostility, but out of honesty. It\u0027s a game and you should be having fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the record, I\u0027ve seen all of one bug that a dev said shouldn\u0027t be fixed, and that was as a joke because they found it fun abusing the bug. If I remember correctly, it was the youtube video about a kerbal stuck in an odd position but still moving, set to music from \u0022Saturday Night Fever.\u0022 I\u0027ve heard a lot of things that people say the devs have said, but lets be honest, that kind of stuff gets taken out of context or misremembered so much that I always take it with a grain of salt. Sort of like one of the conspiracy theory videos I watched on youtube. Fully half of their \u0022evidence\u0022 consisted of quotes out of context, not really meaning what they wanted it to say.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re all here because we enjoy the game, and many of us are quite passionate about it. I don\u0027t think anyone here wants the game to be bad.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tempest228","CreatedById":48494,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T03:07:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGuys, you are starting on the path of development discussion again.
