Another major point: it\u0027s not \u003Cem\u003Enecessary\u003C/em\u003E. Plenty of people have suggested better traits everyone can agree don\u0027t break the illusion of real physics. Let me make a summary of the best ones, for each area of interest we would have:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Science! (Science): that one is the only one we can agree on. Boost science gains/transmission rates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Engineering (Funds): A trait about this could be as easy as: \u002Bx% funds on recovery. Good care of the equipment means it ends up in better shape for reuse. And/or special EVA fixes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Badassness (Reputation): Obviously a reputation-related trait. You look so good under pressure and your stories sell so good, recovering these kerbals gives more rep, while killing them is either a PR disaster (heroes dead!) or could even be lessened (he went in a glorious way).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Piloting (wonky bonus): Bonus to the reaction wheels on the command pod they are in. If reaction wheels are magic already, we can keep that suspension of disbelief. That also means that the good kerbal pilots are actually better at turning their ships around. Who would have guessed, that makes sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Navigation (core feature that used to be free for every kerbal): We flew without maneuver nodes for a long time. Suborbital/orbital flight doesn\u0027t require them. So why not have them be something that only experienced kerbals can provide? You know, like airbreathers or rover wheels now are something only advanced careers can use that at some point weren\u0027t in the base game about building and launching rockets around kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere, the three main currencies touched by traits, I didn\u0027t cheat on physics, and there are a couple extra that have a lot of flavor. And I didn\u0027t involve SAS codes rewrites, or Mechjeb-like autopilots like some others suggest (and which would be pretty controversial and/or difficult to implement). You would have to decide when building a three-person experienced crew (I assume that\u0027s the standard) which currency you don\u0027t want boosted if you want a flying-related boost, or maneuver nodes, and the single pilot with \u0022navigation\u0022 would give you the current stock gameplay. That means probe cores would have the \u0022navigation\u0022 special, which makes sense since they are supposed to have a team of navigators on the ground behind them. They would work out as navigation computers on manned launches, too. And I only had to downgrade the 0-experience gameplay in a way that hurts only interplanetary flights, really, so that\u0027s a bonus too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd an even more important thing: having experience stats not really increase beyond the first step means you will be interested in training more than one crew. That\u0027s a big thing, if exp is handled wrong a lot of people are only going to see the gold crew. To illustrate, the opposite of what I advocate would be something like this: to gain \u002B.05% in thrust after each flight. That would mean putting jeb through hundreds of suborbital flights before the first real mission in order to get a super-jeb that can make orbit a ship lift off that shouldn\u0027t leave the pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERune.
