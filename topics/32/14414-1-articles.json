After a failed suicide bombing, I noticed that I had \u0027damaged\u0027 one of the winglets on the target rocket. Upon switching to the rocket, I noticed that the winglet was still attached, and I could still move it. The winglet appeared perfectly fine even though it was \u0027damaged\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-16T03:16:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\\\u0027s a certain amount of damage that a part can take before it fails, but below the damage threshold, parts don\\\u0027t seem to be affected by the damage.

Like a damaged canard might not work as well as a perfect canard .

Wings would get less lift and more drag, canards would be less effective, engines would still have the same thrust but tend to overheat more easily. Perhaps articulated parts would get stuck in one position. (A stuck gimballed engine could be very exciting!) \u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
