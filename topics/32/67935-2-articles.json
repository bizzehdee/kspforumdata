Having to spend more time on your lifter stage than on your actual mission is no fun at all (in my mind at least), as well as the framerate drop one tends to experience when trying to lift large objects into orbit. Now you no longer have to place a limit on the size of an object you launch into space (well, there are of course limits with the new parts, but they are much higher than before) and you can accomplish more than ever before! Lifting huge interplanetary bases or three-man Eve landers no longer require Whackjobian creations which contain massive numbers of parts, but you can lift them with something which takes a lot less time, effort, and parts to do the same task.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3 metre parts provide an extra dimension to the game which was lacking before. Now we can focus on achieving great things out in the solar system, rather than dealing with actually getting our ships to not fall apart on the launchpad. Instead of having to send up multiple Munar base modules, you have the option of sending up one in a single launch. However, the game never forces you to do this. If you absolutely love designing a modular base system/space station, then by all means continue to send up modules and watch them fit together. But if you find that tiresome and prefer building a whole structure in the VAB, you are now able to launch it without fear of having to build an insane lifter which contains more parts than your base.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo conclude, I find that this update gives more choice to players, rather than takes it away. Additionally, you should just be able to delete the \u0027NASAmission\u0027 folder inside your KSP directory if you really can\u0027t stand the ARM pack; you\u0027ll still be able to enjoy the maneuver node improvements, the stronger parts system, and all the other nice little tweaks the devs made to the base game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(As for the \u0027premade\u0027 parts in KSP, I feel like the devs made them that way for two reasons. First, they probably wanted to make them more closely match the hardware NASA is planning to use, and didn\u0027t want to have to include a lot of new adaptor parts. Secondly, since the new engines are better than the old, adding standalone versions would likely completely replace other engines. While the side booster is kind of odd, containing fuel and an engine, the engine itself is better than a Mainsail, in nearly all respects. Adding the limitation of a large tank of fuel and no bottom node prevents the Mainsail from being phased out entirely.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-04T01:08:12Z\u0022 title=\u002204/04/2014 01:08  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by CalculusWarrior\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-04T01:07:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cpt.

Same with combining engines into a multi-engine adapter, without giving us the adapter by itself.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003ENow this I can agree with somewhat. But I think that Squad were probably conscious of the game\u0027s known performance issues. The engine cluster and the LFB help keep part counts down (though not as much as the stronger joints obviating the need for struts everywhere). For those of us whose PCs struggle a bit to play KSP - and there are \u003Cem\u003Elots\u003C/em\u003E of us - that\u0027s a major boon.\u003Cp\u003EStill, not having the KR-1 and KS-25 as single engines is a bit of a bummer.
