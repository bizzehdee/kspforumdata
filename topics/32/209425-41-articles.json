I bought what was suggested but had some trouble getting up and running but managed to very carefully google my way through most of it (this was all way back in september, and i was completely new to the world of computer building and still sorta am). Then i had some gta v related distractions and then had to deal with life, then christmas rolled around. I poked at it here and there, had the mobo replaced, but still can\u0027t quite get it running properly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen i got my board back i had to use my own thermal paste, i was extremely careful and watched many youtube videos and read tutorials. I used the \u0022size of a pea\u0022 method and am pretty sure it worked out, there is no excess around the sides and can see through the gaps on the cooler to see it make contact all around, and the temp monitoring program said its within normal ranges.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow it will restart after about 3.5 hours if it uses an external graphics card, but it will run totaly fine if it uses the onborad gpu. I have used 2 different cards (NVIDIA GeForce GT 630 and AMD Radeon HD 7300) and they restart the system (but i only tested them in #1 of the 2 available pcie ports), i have tested them with another mobo/cpu and they do not restart that system. I have swapped out the PSU, the ram, the hard drive was from another mobo/cpu and worked fine in that build (and continued to work fine in that build when i sent of the new mobo for replacement), swapped the sata cable with the one plugged into the cd drive, kept the cd drive unplugged. I made sure all the connections are tight and have swapped out every part on the new mobo/cpu, and tested them with the old mobo/cpu and they all work fine (actually I got a new, more powerfull PSU but it didn\u0027t change anything). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI flashed the proper version of the BIOS, installed the drivers and such from the disk that came with the mobo, downloaded and installed the latest chipset drivers (but left out the audio, lan, utilities and sata drivers for some reason, are those important?). I downloaded 3 or 4 temp monitoring programs but only used speedfan. I ended up with some viruses from downloading that and have since reinstalled my os to get rid of them, but using speedfan and while playing KSP it would read the gt card at around 55c and the cpu at around 46c and both in the low to mid 20s when idle. I downloaded and installed the drivers for both cards, and deleted and uninstalled one cards drivers when installing the other. Even updated the BIOS of the gt630. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAslo sometimes when its idling, the task manager shows some strange things. The cpu usage will be at around 70% and the disk will be at 100% usage until i move the mouse, then it goes back down. Other times it will show small cpu spikes every 2 seconds lasting about 2 seconds, rapidly jumping from 1% use to 12% use and back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s probably worth noting that i might not restart if it\u0027s idling for the 3.5 hours (last night it was on for just under 5 hours after idling for most of that time), but even the web page looked up or even moving the mouse every once in a while will probably restart the system after 3.5 hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what did i miss? Are those extra drivers for the mobo i neglected to install as important as they sound? Is there something extra i should have done with my hard drive? Should i RMA my cpu? Or my board again? Should i disable my on-board gpu in the BIOS(tried that but not sure if i actually did it)? Should i disable and/or uninstall my on-board gpu from the device manager window(i got a black screen when i tried to mess with that)?
