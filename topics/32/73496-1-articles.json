It\u0027s kind of a philosophical question: if a rock falls on Kerbin and nobody is looking, does it leave a trace?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are two problems with my first theory: the rock is too small to be an asteroid (I think), and it doesn\u0027t seem to be affected by physics. I can just walk through it, and it doesn\u0027t move: just stays there, impossibly balanced on one of its corners. I guess it\u0027s just terrain scatter, but I had never seen any rock like that on Kerbin. Is it common? What are your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T21:42:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAsteroids are just parts, Like any other part that enters the atmosphere when physics are not loaded they dissapear at 20km or so. In short no not an asteroid that landed off camera unless you followed it in yourself. That said they have a silly high impact tolerance if you attach a probe core to them and then \u0022Fly\u0022 the thing through reentry there is a very good chance that its terminal velocity will be lower than its impact tolerance and it will bounce when it hits the ground. will also probably crush the probe but the asteroid will be on the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-26T21:44:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed its very presence, its non-solidness, and its texture rule out it being an asteroid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you have terrain scatter turned on, and are there similar-looking (but not balanced) rocks to be found nearby? If so, it\u0027s a misplaced bit of terrain scatter.
