Late May we had a bit of a house fire (not a super bad one, but the insurance mandated we scrap any electronics and move out during structural repairs) and have been without a suitable computer. As of yesterday I\u0027ve put together a temporary rig to play until I can build a proper replacement via insurance payout.\n\nNow that I\u0027m \u0022back in the game\u0022 as it were, I\u0027ve decided it\u0027s the perfect opportunity to start a new campaign I\u0027ve wanted to do for awhile -- and I might add, it\u0027s one where the less I remember about KSP the more enjoyable it will be!\n\nIntroducing the \u0022Campaign for Real Science\u0022!\n\nSo what is this \u0022Real Science\u0022 of which I speak? Let\u0027s start by highlighting what it is not: It is not a system where you click on a box, gain points, ferry said points home, and build better parts. Don\u0027t get me wrong -- KSP is a game, and \u0022science\u0022 is a good gameplay mechanic. It\u0027s just not actually very science-y. NASA doesn\u0027t learn how to make bigger fuel tanks by taking lunar samples, and neither will I.\n\nInstead, I\u0027ll be doing this new campaign based on actual scientific inquiry and analysis. For instance, where does the atmosphere of a planet begin? The easy answer is \u0022check the Wiki\u0022 -- the better answer is \u0022I\u0027ll tell you when I get a reading on my barometer\u0022.\n\nTo begin I plan on starting a \u0022funds-only\u0022 campaign with a custom difficulty set to where science is a non-issue, but funds still require some Kerbin-bound contracts. That is to say, the Kerbals have done lots of R\u0026D already and have a basic mastery of aerospace at home and are now turning their attention to the stars as their budget allows. I also want to make safety a real priority, so I\u0027ll be playing with permadeath and only invoking reverts/saves in the event of glitches.\n\nRight now my goals are to:\n\n1 - Measure the atmospheres of planets to determine where they start and what the densities are every ~1000m of altitude. This will allow me to test landers in Kerbin\u0027s upper atmosphere where densities (and parachute behaviors) are similar for greater reliability and safety.\n\n2 - Measure the gravity on planet surfaces, again for use in mission planning.\n\n3 - Measure the dV used in planetary transfers. Kerbals already know the rocket equations, but they\u0027re pretty useless if you don\u0027t know how much is needed to exit SOIs, stabilize orbits, etc.\n\n4 - Measure the sizes of planets by measuring size and duration of probe orbits (and maybe mass by comparing to gravity readings).\n\n5 - Observe night/day temperature differences on different bodies.\n\nMy play time is limited due to \u0022life\u0022, but I plan on documenting the missions and sharing my results. I\u0027d be really curious to compare my results to \u0027known values\u0027 from the Wiki after the fact.\n\nThe first mission will likely be to put a probe in a highly elliptical Kerbol orbit to measure available solar energy at the same altitude as different planets\u0027 orbits. The goal is to know how many panels I need on various probes so I can keep costs down.\n\n... I\u0027d also like to encourage anyone interested in this play style to consider planning and initiating a few experiments of your own and sharing the results in this thread. In the spirit of science, feel free to try replicating results for yourself to see if they jibe. And don\u0027t be afraid to propose mission ideas for others to try as well.\n\nGood luck and happy flying!"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:24:18Z","Content":"Sounds pretty awesome. I\u0027ve done a bit of the same myself, because I\u0027m using mod planets and don\u0027t have the same readily-available wiki as I do for the stock ones. It\u0027s really a new journey of discovery, even simple things like delta-V to orbit need to be found out. (Though I do have Transfer Windows Planner to magically tell me my transfers).\n\nHere\u0027s one of my atmosphere curves for example, [https://www.flickr.com/photos/52548818@N05/19879120658/in/photostream/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/52548818@N05/19879120658/in/photostream/) . That is then useful data to help work out how many parachutes a lander there will need."},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:46:51Z","Content":"I agree, the things KSP makes you do to unlock new parts isn\u0027t really \u0027science\u0027.
