When I had reached orbit I found that I had plenty of fuel for some adventuring, so I started looking at destinations and Eve was looking pretty tempting since Duna was at a bad angle. Long story short, I managed an encounter with Eve, but failed to consider Eve\u0027s atmosphere. Grazed it just enough to do some aerobraking, lol. Now I\u0027m in a stable but eccentric orbit.
