So does anyone know of a book that does a good job of teaching this stuff? Maybe a book that I can buy at a Barnes \u0026amp; Noble.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"phoenix_ca","CreatedById":50380,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-30T04:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAck, some physicist posted a book on here a while ago that covered orbital mechanics.
