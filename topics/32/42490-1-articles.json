Back in 0.17 when planets first got added, the number of achievements a given player could accomplish skyrocketed, and it wasn\u0027t long before someone devised an image-based \u0022ribbons\u0022 system to show off what you\u0027ve done on and around various planets in the game. Technically ribbons predate even that; they first started showing up around the time the Mun was added in 0.12 in fact.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SuperWeegee4000","CreatedById":71621,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-14T23:13:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think you can click on the ribbon set in a person\u0027s signature and it goes to the thread about it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"manskal","CreatedById":73159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T00:34:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWow... 111 hours here and still going nowhere.
