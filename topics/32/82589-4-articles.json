In the stock game I think using the LV-N is fine (although everyone can decide that for their own game IMO), but with KSPI installed I\u0027ve shied away from it a bit because it\u0027s a bit too easy to use compared to similar KSPI engines.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENerva is cooled by the LH2 before you send it into the reactor, it might be an issue if you run it on methane who is not cryogenic but would probably just require that you use more of the reaction mass for cooling before sending it into the core. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the reaction mass for cooling should work for an 800 m/s ISP engine but not something far more efficient as you would use to little reaction mass. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also think the nuclear reactor would last the mission, you don\u0027t have to swap fuel rods often and the reactor would just be active while burning.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-27T00:05:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jouni\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jouni\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe 48-7S engine has its niche in small Tylo landers and in the upper stages of Eve landers.
