Well, I\u0027ll explain (but I apologize for the rest of the images being crappy because they were pulled from a recoded video). As a matter of fact, if you take a look at my staging order you can see exactly what screwed up this entire mission right when it counted the most. Everything was going great at first, with Jeb at the helm I could do no wrong. It was a simple mission: Grab as much science as I could between Kerbin and a low pass around the Mun, and come back home. Jeb swooped down to ~40km from the surface of Mun and passed over as many biomes as he could, then collected the experiments that were about to be dropped with the cruising stage to save weight. Jeb burned the last of the fuel in the cruising stage we had set up as he made the escape trajectory from the Mun. Everything was going according to plan until this moment. He surveyed the trajectory and plotted course for a ~80km encounter with Kerbin (if I remember correctly) and then went to drop the dead weight. Stage separation -- engine dropped. Stage separation -- experiments dropped. Fire off the last engine? Hm. Seems to be throttled up, but nothing is happening. Fire off the last engine! Oh... It just separated the capsule from the little putt putt engine I had intended to go back to Kerbin with. DAAAAAMMMMNNNNNIIIIIITTTTTT JEB!!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe must have spent a good 2 minutes just looking around. What do I do now? Sit here in a wonky orbit and wait for help? No, not Jeb. As he looked at the trajectory he has also made another mistake that he tends to make in this situation (which wouldn\u0027t have mattered if he had an engine) -- He was going to have another encounter with the Mun and get thrown out into Minmus territory. Unacceptable. Jeb did no less than what I\u0027d expect him to... Against mission control\u0027s advice he calmly exited the capsule, grabbed all the data from it, and began to burn retrograde with his jetpack like nobody\u0027s business. He was looking at a Kerbin periapsis of ~1500 km, which wasn\u0027t good but we could deal with that. Then a streak of luck -- He managed to alter the encounter with the Mun just enough that it actually brought him closer to Kerbin -- ~600km. So we waited... And when that periapsis came, he started to burn retrograde again. He was able to bring the apoapsis down to ~2000 km before thinking he\u0027d better save some fuel for the rescue ship that was sure to come. ...Right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/EpicMunRescueMissionAKADamnitJebmp4_snapshot_002231_20140501_032404.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022EpicMunRescueMissionAKADamnitJebmp4_snapshot_002231_20140501_032404.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022...Crap.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b161/duke396/EpicMunRescueMissionAKADamnitJebmp4_snapshot_002450_20140501_034550.jpg~original\u0022 alt=\u0022EpicMunRescueMissionAKADamnitJebmp4_snapshot_002450_20140501_034550.jpg~original\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet\u0027s do this!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, a rescue ship was immediately thrown together from debris laying around the launch pad from the last 5 prototype rockets. Up up and away! Except wait a minute. The rescue ship has already started its gravity turn when everyone realizes Jeb is orbiting in the opposite direction. Let\u0027s try that again. James Kerman may not be the brightest guy in the world, but he\u0027s a decent pilot after all, and the rescue mission is a complete success from here on out, minus a few gallons of fuel wasted on maneuvers that weren\u0027t exactly necessary. He was able to get within 25km of Jeb on his periapsis and then burn to match orbits and form an intercept course. 3km. One orbit and he\u0027s closing in... He can barely make out Jeb\u0027s helmet from the glow of the engine as he closes in at 15 meters. Jeb enters the ship and naturally complains about how long it took James to get there.
