But its much better when its an actual mode rather than a self-imposed handicap. Now when I crash a big ship i might actually have to start the entire game over again, and the reduced science gains make it require much more effort to get all the science, so you will still be stuggling with with limited science by the time you run out of things to do on mun and minus, where before you could finish everything without leaving kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence. I\u0027ve already started over a bunch of times. I never realized how sloppy my shipbuilding was until i had to do it with no \u0022revert to hanger\u0022. Also challening is trying to test the pieces, before you could just fiddle endlessly with your ship to try to get speed and altitude right; Now that you only have 1 shot at it or try again with a whole new ship, even the manuvering without using quicksave to save your ass if you\u0027re cutting corners and taking risk is much more engaging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zylark","CreatedById":101018,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-12T01:52:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf I could trust the game to not get unstable and crash on me - or blow up my spacecrafts for no good reason - I\u0027d go Hard-Mode.
