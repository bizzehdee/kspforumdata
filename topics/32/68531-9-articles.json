If they wanted you to min max rockets and make difficult choices they would tell you what the dv is no? They would probably also make all physical objects have mass, and as you stretch a strut it would weigh more, and you wouldn\u0027t be able to refire a mainsail, and you wouldn\u0027t be able to refuel. That\u0027s clearly not going to happen though, that isn\u0027t the gameplay they seem to be after. I\u0027m not sure very many people want it either. I mean I played orbiter for years, when this came out, I never touched it again. And I\u0027m a hardcore SIM fan. Turns out space simulation is boring. Kerbal is fun, it\u0027s a huge success, orbiter well.. you can\u0027t compare the two easily but if you do.. I get the impression a being that uses an above ground swimming pool as a rocket fuel tank couldn\u0027t care less what dv or isp even stands for. That to me is why kerbal is fun. It\u0027s pretty cool that before it\u0027s all said and done I can mod it into a SIM as complete and detailed as orbiter if I get the itch. And let\u0027s be honest here even if they needed everything and balanced, this game still wouldn\u0027t challenge you, you already know what you are doing. The fun at this point for me is actually in the doing. At this stage when I want a challenge, I stop doing caring about math, but to each his own, I\u0027m glad this game is moddable though because it sounds like a lot of the vets are going to be disappointed in the final product. Thats kinda disappointing, even though I can see your points of view.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I\u0027m on my phone and that\u0027s a bit rambling, I apologize.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-12T02:06:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/12/2014 02:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 12, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Dogoncrook\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tarmenius","CreatedById":16990,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-12T01:52:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI seem to recall it being said some time ago that the pre-0.23.5 stock engines had terrible performance characteristics when compared to their real-life counterparts.

During the Campaign, the player gradually gains access to better weapons, expanding his or her combat capabilities, but in Multiplayer, only the later unlocks are ever used.
