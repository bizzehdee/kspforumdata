I\u0027ve got seven contracts accepted which is the limit at the moment, so I \u0027cheated\u0027 and timewarped about 170 days to a launch window for Jool, the first of the contracts being Explore Jool. This did allow my base on Ike to process enough science to get a few 300-science nodes done including the nuc engines. So, on my third attempt I decided to go for a minimalist approach for a Jool station, and came up with the following. It is three days into its mission and will take about 2.5 years to get to Jool, but during that time my other missions will come into play. In about a year and a half I go to Duna for three contracts, and 99 days after that to Eve and Gilly for three more.

I attempted to rebuild my space station after the whole break dancing thing (few pages back) and there was more weirdness going on. I had launched the first part of the station, got it into orbit, then I accidentally staged instead of undodcking which would be fine, just means that the faring base was still connected to the station via docking port but that is fixable of course. However... when I did that I saw the ADTP adapter go sliding down the rest of the tug going free... My first thought was I screwed up on construction (which I already knew I did because of where I put the fairing) but all seemed well. Fired up the RCS on the tug to move it away from the station just fine but then couldn\u0027t turn it to retrograde easily (started tumbling really fast) so I hit time warp to freeze it. Second it went into warp that adapter that floated through the ship suddenly popped back onto the nose. When I turned off time warp it floated away again and the ship started spinning again. Timewarp again and it happened again! Fired up the poodle engine to move it away and that is when things got really weird... I lost focus on the ship itself and instead was on the adapter which was spinning faster and faster and faster but staying in place over orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GDJ","CreatedById":58462,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T17:55:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBuilt a reasonable replica of Pioneer 10 and 11 and a massive launch vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot28_2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot28_2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe\u0027s heavy (probe weighed in at just over 5 tonnes, but to get it up to Jool trajectories I have to lift 568 tonnes off Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeaviest thing I\u0027ve launched, and it worked!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i40.photobucket.com/albums/e216/Max_Payne_0001/screenshot25_1.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot25_1.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt will spend around 45 days in the Jool system, then it\u0027s off to interstellar space.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TrooperCooper","CreatedById":110599,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-27T19:01:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe ESA launched its mission to the Moon.

Today I killed Jeb, Bill and Bob in my RSS/RO Test save. I\u0027ve been in a bit of a funk and didn\u0027t feel much like building anything, so I just loaded up the default RSS-ified FASA Saturn 5 and hurled the big three at the Moon. They might have had the chance to land had I not been ~400m/s short on the ascent and TLI (I blame Jeb). Given their severe lack of ability to complete the Lunar capture burn (to an altitude that would result in a safe landing) I decided to instead skip the Moon and return to Earth... but only after grazing the surface of the Moon at an altitude of 17km.

Nope. (Pretty sure I gave that away in the first sentence.) Capsule overheated to 100% immediately at atmospheric interface and then exploded somewhere around 90km.
