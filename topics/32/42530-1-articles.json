Unfortunately, the capsule lost its parachute and crashed resulting in the untimely death of its three Kerbal astronauts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter placing a set of heavy duty struts in strategic locations, the rocket flew as expected staging the boosters at 14,000 meters. Having a second SAS in that stage causes a power drain during coasting to apogee so solar panels have to be deployed during that phase of the launch. The second stage reached orbit with sufficient fuel remaining to reach Mun with the command module stage. That Kerbal crew is currently planning their burn for Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Drunkrobot","CreatedById":58034,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T04:01:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou, good sir, have acquired fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"deadshot462","CreatedById":13659,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-15T04:18:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you can see your engine out your window..\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
