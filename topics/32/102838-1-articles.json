Let us explain.... We have been playing Kerbal for many many months now and we recently gor involved with the DarkMP Mod. We decided to take this to the next level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe plan to create a group called KerbalOnline (KerbalOnline.com) and we are looking for some ideas as what regular players would like to see, both group admin wide and server wise.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe plan to follow NASA\u0027s systems (Approved Launches, Mission Control, COMMS with Teamspeak, etc....) \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOur server box is amazing. Dallas, Texas with an Intel 1270v2 and 32GB RAM including a Intel SSD. So resource and network is not the issue, member count is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe think we can get this group big, but we want some suggestions as too how we can do this right with features.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbalOnline Staff\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
