The reason it had to be out of communication during the flyby was that the both the sensors and the antenna on it are directional, and in order to orient the probe to collect its data that resulted in it orienting itself so as not to be able to communicate with mission control. Once the data collection was complete it reoriented itself for communications and transmitted the data.\n\nOn the subject of occlusion by intermediate celestial bodies, if the occluding body is not either the sun, the moon or Pluto/Charon, the distances involved are such that it is almost certain that the radio transmissions would diffract around those bodies, so effectively occlusion is not an issue.\n\nNone of these effects, ether the directionality of sensors, the limitations on the CPU capabilities of probe cores or the diffraction of radio waves is considered in any KSP mod I am aware of, let alone stock."},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T07:29:49Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E most people don\u0027t think about the speed of light in their daily lives (though many of us here do, I\u0027m sure)\n\nSo what?

Direct controls start getting a bit laggy already at Minmus. The fun thing with RT flight computer is that you can also cancel commands (staging and such) but the command had better have some delay if you expect the cancel-command to get there before the command is executed."},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T11:32:33Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Yes, we will have to deal with some form of antenna range and object occlusion in (as yet) unspecified degrees.

Next time the player selects that craft after the node has passed, it uses the new conic. If you make a node that the craft can actually fulfill, then the planned node (dashed line) is the conic the game will use.

Bottom line is that the game concept just does not really allow for robot ships. There are mods that try to work around this somewhat, but none of them feel 100% successful. And when playing stock, there is essentially no difference between manned and unmanned except that manned is not quite totally as bricked as unmanned if you lose all power."},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-30T22:17:23Z","Content":"I think the ideas shared by RoverDude sound pretty good for a stock system, but I think a DSN should be more than just having Kerbin \u0022be\u0022 the antenna.
