I attempted to put up a probe at the same time, but it lacked the delta-v to change orbits to the contracted orbit (a later probe was sent to complete the job), and the fuel of the lifter ran out suborbitally. I decoupled the shuttles, and they managed to finish circularising while unfocused.

The microshuttle is nice, and has air-brake functionality through deploying flaps (and inverted flaps), but it\u0027s probably not the most cost-effective method for orbit.

One design had a sudden failure of two of its boosters, but still managed to fly up until it ran out of fuel, still apoapse in atmosphere. The lifter I eventually went with is rather overpowered, but it worked. Once I docked with Stopover, I accidentally staged off a descent pod, so I had the rescuees EVA over to it and use it for their descent instead, leaving the monopropellant-fueler docked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.cubeupload.com/1uR5bk.png\u0022 alt=\u00221uR5bk.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFinally, I scared Jebadiah Kerman.

This will also be the first time I\u0027ve sent a Hitchhiker module to Mun surface and back again since The Great Engine Nerf of V1.0, so it\u0027s also the virgin flight of a new lander AND a new lifter to put it in LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy couldn\u0027t I just use a repetition of the vehicle that got her there in the first place, you ask?

So I picked up a rescue-from-Munar-orbit contract and a small orbital station contract, and should make a tidy profit on the whole thing.

After a test launch began to lose control authority, I added an additional AIS, too. The current version of the lifter runs dry when suborbital, but coasts out of the atmosphere. The two shuttles are staged off in the high atmosphere once the fuel of the lifter is out, and I raise the apoapse and periapse of one a little.
