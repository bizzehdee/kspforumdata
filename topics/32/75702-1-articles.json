Indeed, that last one is a limiting factor on the size of American space equipment to this day; the Michoud Assembly Facility at the Stennis Space Center is the only factory in the world that can handle building booster components up to 10 meters diameter--and that\u0027s ITS hard limit, since it was designed and built to assemble the 10-meter S-IC and S-II stages of the Saturn V. Any booster with a larger diameter than that would require an entirely new facility for stage assembly, which would cost an absolute FORTUNE and probably a decade\u0027s worth of regulatory red tape before you could even break ground on it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll also note that there was a proposal in the late 60s to build future Saturn V-derived boosters that replaced the existing S-IC stage with a cluster of four \u0022260-inch\u0022 solid rockets; those would be 260-inch diameter, roughly 22 feet and resulting in a somewhat thicker first stage.
