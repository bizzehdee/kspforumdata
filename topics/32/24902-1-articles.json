I\u0027ve not only filled my brain to capacity with new terms and concepts, but gained a newfound respect for the real space programs. I want to share this love and respect and knowledge and other warm fuzzies. My mother\u0027s a middle-school teacher, and is in charge of the MG program. I\u0027m thinking that this would be a fantastic game for the kids in the program. So what do YOU people think? Would this be good for kids of that age, or would it go over their heads? I hope not, and I think not, but I\u0027m basing this off of myself, and I\u0027m older and wiser than I was as a kid. The only real issue I can foresee is a time issue. This game is a total time sink, and it can take awhile to do anything of real meaning...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"HockeyToad28","CreatedById":41699,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T00:21:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m in middle school and i am fascinated with this game and understand it very well.

Personally, though I\u0027m going to wait until the full release before really hounding her about it. Right now there\u0027s too many bugs, and while I may have learned a preternatural calmness, I don\u0027t wish them on any young person\u0027s fragile, still-forming psyche. Of course, I\u0027d have to teach my mother the game so she could teach it to the kids, and that might be tricky! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GROOV3ST3R","CreatedById":27590,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-01T00:38:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EProbably the more unexpected future use of KSP \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But a likely one.
