Any recommendations on how I should record docking for my next turn? I\u0027ve tried it multiple ways. One is that I just end up with a 40 minute video of me tinkering with the intercept and the other just cuts the part where i tweak the intercept and gets right to the docking procedure.\n\nThat\u0027s the biggest problem with recording KSP. Sometimes it gets a bit too slow-paced. If you find some operation a bit to long (and adjusting a node is probably not too interesting for the viewers), one of the options may be recording that part without (or with minimum) commentary and cutting/speeding it to just a few seconds of showing essential parts. Also, docking something heavy and commenting may not go together too well. Don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m likely to either start babbling something not too interesting or just mess up the docking. Shuttle part of my video report turned into post-commentary over sped-up footage, but it seems to be the optimal way for me for operations at such scale (however for more fast-paced action-packed parts live commentary is better). But that\u0027s something to select individually.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E When my turn comes around, I\u0027m going to try and bring down (or magically terminate from the Tracking Station) some of the debris that\u0027s been collecting.\n\nYou can land my Callisto if you wish. (She just needs a few tons of fuel/oxidizer delivered.) Or you can use her to grab that spent stage from one of the modules left in polar orbit (securing the payload is not strictly necessary, but I guess a claw can be docked in for that purpose).\n\nSpeaking of Chronus station and shuttles, what do you think about this for supply and return vehicle?\n\n![3abb21b749df.jpg](http://s014.radikal.ru/i327/1503/6d/3abb21b749df.jpg)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-03-24T11:32:00Z\u0022 title=\u002203/24/2015 11:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 24, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alchemist**"},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T14:26:06Z","Content":"I just made a thread in the \u0022live from mission control\u0022 place for the project and anyone else who makes videos for the project is welcome to post them there."},{"CreatedByName":"Musil","CreatedById":132791,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T21:11:49Z","Content":"Since again we have no current user, I propose we start the second cycle."},{"CreatedByName":"bakanando","CreatedById":126310,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T22:26:23Z","Content":"Give it another day at least, and for Thunderous Echo to reply."},{"CreatedByName":"Thunderous Echo","CreatedById":120137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T22:32:36Z","Content":"When 72 hours have passed since the last turn, we will start the next cycle.

If you\u0027re looking for free stuff to get you started (or for a test drive of the YouTube universe), I\u0027d recommend Windows Live Movie Maker for editing and CamStudio for recording. Neither of them have any decals, but you have to play with CamStudio\u0027s settings for a bit to get the correct framerate.\n\nRecording doesn\u0027t actually increase your computer\u0027s workload by very much.\n\nAs for internet connections, mine\u0027s pretty terrible, but a 720p, 3 minute video only takes about 5 mins to render (with Movie Maker) and 10 mins to upload."},{"CreatedByName":"dharak1","CreatedById":61137,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T23:05:07Z","Content":"You can try out camtasia studio 8 for 30 days for free.
