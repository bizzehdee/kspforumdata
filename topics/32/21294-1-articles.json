My own rough plan involves a crew transfer vehicle (including hab) which travels to Duna orbit and back to Kerbin, never landing until the capsule splashes down, and an uncrewed lander, which only needs to make a one-way trip. I\u0027m having to start from scratch with the lander, beginning with an ascent stage that can reach orbit from Duna (or Eve or Laythe - my hope is to use the same design for missions to all the planets), then a descent stage added on to that, then a transfer stage, and finally a booster that can get all of that off the pad.

This will allow a colony/research base to be established in less time, without needing to deploy missions just to place habs on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Adding 4 MechJeb-controlled probes to the composite craft, likely by radially attaching them to the Duna Excursion Module. All four will be capable of making a completly propulsive landing on the surface of Duna, but will also pack a parachute to conserve fuel slightly. These will be used to scout out possible landing sites for the DEM.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Adding a possible fourth crew member to make possible a 2-2 split: two will go down to the surface in the DEM, and two will remain aboard the Nuclear-electric Transfer Stage and Habitat. This may perform a flyby of Ike on the way in, and drop off a pair of probes in the vicinity of said body for exploring possible LZs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Making use of Aerobraking to lower Apoapsis. I do NOT intend to utilize Aerocapture, especially with a composite craft. Later mission to establish a research base may make use of direct entry or aerocapture, but those are beyond the scope of this thread.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If Ion RCS exist, using these will allow for much more reusability of the NTSH. Currently, the RCS fuel is the limiting factor for the reuse of the NTSH. As such, if RCS are needed for vernier manuevers, they will be executed with the DEM RCS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-If is is within my mass budget, I will include landing gear on the NTSH for operations on Ike. Ladders will NOT be included. Any surface operations will be aborted at 25% RCS fuel remaining.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Initial thrust to kick out of the Kerbin SOI will be provided by the DEM launcher\u0027s upper stage.
