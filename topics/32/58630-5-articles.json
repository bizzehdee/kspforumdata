I also prefer a full improvement over a patch, but I doubt squad would put the work needed into that at this point.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAbout mods, that\u0027s personal taste. I prefer strutting over mod-fixing because I like to share my designs (not on the forums, but directly to my friends) and they play mostly stock, so using mods would put a barrier on that. I also work hard to keep them away from mechjeb, at least until they can do everything in the game without it. Like our community manager said \u0022It would stunt growth or something\u0022. My opinion on mechjeb (hate aside) would require a totally different thread and those always end on a flame-war and I\u0027m always late.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thiosk","CreatedById":81242,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T03:12:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m glad I\u0027m not in the game development business.

I\u0027ve heard a lot more good things about Bullet than PhysX. Of course, that all depends on how it\u0027s implemented. An aerodynamic system for instance still needs to be made from scratch, but from what I gather Bullet is generally much more reliable, and handles complex shapes better. Non-wobbly joints depend on setting the best settings for the joints themselves (which is all KJR does, I think?)\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThey should probably just hire Ferram to deal with these things \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
