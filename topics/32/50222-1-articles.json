About 125% of the multithreaded performance and around 80% of the single threader performance. Looks like the GPU should be roughly around 50-60% of the performance of the Celeron 847 as well based on clock speeds and EU count.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo if anyone has run KSP on a Celeron 847 based laptop, I\u0027d think that the performance would be roughly similar (with CPU probably being more of the bottleneck than GPU, especially with things turned way down).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlternately the z3740 seems to have roughly the same single thread performance as the current AMD Jaguar based chips out there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS this is really a curiosity question and I don\u0027t really intend to play KSP on the T100, I am just curious if it could.
