ATX is what most people get for their builds, can be refereed to as a full sized board, usually have plenty of Lanes for expansion cards and some of the higher end boards support Crossfire/SLI. Your EATX, or Extended ATX motherboards, are usually for your super high end enthusiasts who want features such as Quad channel memory, 4x Crossfire/SLI, and sometimes even provisions for an open loop water cooling system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESLI is Nividias name for their Multi-GPU system.
