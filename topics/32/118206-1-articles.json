I quickly realized this was not possible as the game crashed before i even made my first orbit. So i started again, and changed the settings to allow for loading games. I had two more restarts after catastrophic missions, and realized the \u0022moar boosters\u0022 approach leads to a quickly depleted astronaut\u0027s complex, so i toned down my ships and my general mindset to be much more careful with everything. Now i\u0027m thinking about \u0022allowing\u0022 a single reload per mission, simply to allow some wiggle room in the many cases of forgotten solar panels or antennae.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ewhat are your settings/house rules for ironman KSP, and what do you recommend? maybe there are mods specific to it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostOblivion","CreatedById":111504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T14:45:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy game crashed a lot in 0.90, but has not crashed once for me in 1.0.

The thing about XCOM is it autosaves after every move you make. KSP doesnt do this, so you have to manually do it via quicksave. If the game crashes, use debug menu to unlock quickloading for a minute, and reload your previous place (I believe the game autosaves on quickload so the persistence is instantly caught up). Also, unless you\u0027re a seasoned craft designer and use KER, I highly advise the use of a sandbox test save.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cryova","CreatedById":147379,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T15:35:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is what I do:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have the no research purchase required thing on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAuto hire crew members on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEverything else up there off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen everything else is typically normal settings, with me changing science gain to 150-200% depending on how little I feel like grinding science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESometimes I do this just all on easy mode if I am feeling lazy, but that gets boring pretty quick because it is absurdly easy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-11T16:39:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIronman mode?
