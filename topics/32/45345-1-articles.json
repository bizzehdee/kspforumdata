In my experience this tends to cause the other docking port bug, the \u0022state=acquire\u0022 bug. This one prevents the docking port from activating, causing the broken port to just bounce off of the other port. It\u0027s easier to fix than the can\u0027t undock bug (just change \u0022state=acquire\u0022 to \u0022state=ready\u0022 in the persistence file), but I still wouldn\u0027t tempt these kinds of things. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy advice for preventing the can\u0027t undock bug is to always have, and keep, at least one control point (probe core or command pod) on every, individually docked component of your station, vessel, or base. Most of my encounters with the can\u0027t undock bug have involved a tug moving a component that has no control point on it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for Squad fixing this, I still haven\u0027t seen anyone report being able to reliably replicate this and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s on the bug tracker.
