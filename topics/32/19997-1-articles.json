Are there any plans by the devs on creating parts for planetary structures that could be ferried whole or constructed on the spot?

I guess fuel itself is one thing, but something else, maybe just \u0022supplies\u0022 in general that get used up over time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe buildings themselves could break down beyond repair sometimes and you would have to replace them. It could be great to race against the clock when the nuclear plant on Minmus Base breaks down and the solar arrays can only keep life support up for so long. Can you get the replacement generator to minmus before you have to launch a crew replacement vessel as well? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"BeigeSponge","CreatedById":39997,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-23T10:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EUse the Kethane mod, it mines fuel from planets.
