Since it was the one major new part, we felt we had to test it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere are quite a few issues with it. If you land on it, it explodes and often destroys some important parts of\u00A0your ship. If you hold onto it too long it causes some aerodynamic problems low in the atmosphere. In the past, the jettison function did not work well. And more.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMany people propose separatrons, but those are high-tech, and there is not a really good place to attach them. It\u0027s also hard to blast the thing away from your ship, since its drag is so huge.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thing I noticed was that in the middle atmosphere, the heatshield caused my ships to have an extreme wobble. I decided to use this \u0022feature\u0022 in my solution for how to use the things.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just went for a straight reentry with the thing. Then wait until you have slowed to a terminal velocity and you are wobbling a lot. Set SAS to \u0022normal hold\u0022. This is 90 degrees to how you are moving, and causes the wobble to intensify until you are often beyond horizontal. So you wait until one of those moments and\u00A0\u003Cstrong\u003Ethen\u003C/strong\u003E\u00A0detach the heatshield. Since the \u0022jettison\u0022 function was iffy at that time, I was using a rockomax decoupler to get rid of the thing. But since you are beyond horizontal, the drag on the heatshield will cause it to immediately fly upwards from your craft, and you will never see it again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt seems to be able to withstand an 8km/sec reentry, though -- so it seems like it makes a wonderful interplanetary aerobrake/aerocapture device.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
