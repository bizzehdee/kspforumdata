It is too large and underpowered for his tastes, as it took several orbits around Kerbin to get to Duna because it didn\u0027t have the TWR to do it in a single burn. He thinks it would benefit from MOAR BOOSTERS. I guess that\u0027s what I get for trying to send the equivalent* of three big orange tanks to Duna with only four nuclear engines. Also, the landers were very heavy and attached with a single standard docking port each. They threatened to snap off at any moment, meaning Jeb had to be more careful than he was used to.
