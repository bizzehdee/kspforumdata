I doubt Harvester would stand for such unrealistic, debris-strewn separation events, given the other more realistic things slated for 1.0.\n\nIIRC, the fairing parts are considered the same as broken solar panels - they exist, but once they go beyond the physics bubble, they are deleted forever. Temporary debris, no Kessler Syndrome here.\n\nAlso yes, pls merge this thread into my Summary?"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T01:04:28Z","Content":"Yeah, its not any kind of deal breaker or anything, but the fairing separation bugs me.
