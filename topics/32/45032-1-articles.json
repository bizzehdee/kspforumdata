Then to see if they should stick with developing the game or scrap it with the idea that it might not have a good enough following, they released what they had to the public. After some time and a few updates the following of KSP grew faster than the development, which leaves them at a point to where the public demands more but the actual time needed to develop the game has narrowed. This would leave them at a point to where they need to hire on new staff (aka the hiring of modders) to speed production to meet demand. Also with the fact that the solar system of the game and numerous mods which open an entirely new directions to the game could altar how the Dev\u0027s actually want their end product to be. Now pile on a community full of KSP\u0027ers that bash and complain about the flaws seemingly whenever they get a chance to that putting out an update that doesn\u0027t revolutionize the game in some major way would be viewed as a failed update.

After that...dunno, SQUAD might have ideas. Actual missions you can elect to do within Career to give it more direction? Working on the Astronaut training/recruiting more?

Then I suspect we\u0027ll probably have a good 6-9 month Beta where they flesh out a few features a little, tweak some stuff and go on a bug hunt before they consider it \u0022final\u0022 and then maybe start working on major expansions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe major expansions might be when they look at introducing FTL and other star systems.
