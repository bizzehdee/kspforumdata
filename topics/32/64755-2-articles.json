I have difficulty with ultra-low gravity, such as that on Minmus. Everyone says \u0022Minmus is easy\u0022 but I\u0027ve lost more ships to it than I have with Eve. Maybe I build differently, maybe the atmosphere on Eve helped me some, but I\u0027ve found Minmus to be extremely difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo to answer the original question, as to when you should be able to call yourself an expert, I say it is a combination of things, but mostly these:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You have an intimate knowledge of the design of your basic lander craft and could rebuild it on a new save without carrying files over.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You have, at least once, made a \u0022challenge save\u0022 where all missions must be done with a certain handicap, such as \u0022open cockpit\u0022 or \u0022only SSTO\u0022 or \u0022No launch over 10 Tons,\u0022 or one I\u0027m doing \u0022Debris Sweep\u0022 where all debris must eventually be removed, including debris that lingers between worlds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You have, at least once, done an orbital transfer to any interplanetary world, landed, and came back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You tend to not need Quicksave, Quickload, or Restart Mission anymore, because the ship is engineered just right to make the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eand last, but not least\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-You are still, above all, having fun. Yes, being an expert means being able to have fun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"timsfitz","CreatedById":104387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-03T21:48:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LORDPrometheus\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LORDPrometheus\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhen your signature is like mine\u003Cp\u003EAll done in .19 and repeated in .23\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m new to the forums.
