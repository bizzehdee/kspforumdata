Being the genius that I am at night, I was being weight conscious of the mining rig since the Kethane tanks get pretty heavy. Figuring that Minimus has so little gravity that things practically float away unpowered, and that nuclear engines are pretty efficient, I didn\u0027t include any refining mechanism on the miner itself, instead relying solely on the large one my station is carrying (I also redesigned my small station for orbital mining, and it works like a dream). Now, even though the miner is not super heavy, it did use nearly half the fuel reserves on the trip to Minimus, and landing, and when I launched for the station 100km up, I found out that I had a little fuel to spare, as long as all I wanted to do was intercept the station. I was woefully short on the fuel needed to actually match speed, as I realized past the point of no return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis morning, I decided to try again from my quick save right after managing to establish a very near intercept, and decided that rather than try to land the miner when it came back down like I had been thinking about, I would use the orbital refinery as a rescue pursuit craft. It worked fairly well, the refinery is a capable ship in it\u0027s own right, though I have all the RCS ports mounted at angles where I had space, and that bugged me when I tried to dock it. Fortunately, part of the station redesign was adding a senior port on the front, intended to hold fuel tanks for refueling. The miner is intended to dock with a normal port on the front, but it has a senior port on the back, mostly incase I ever needed to tow fuel tanks with it. Brought the miner in from about 250m out, turned it around right at the end and backed up into the station. I had to leave off here, but the refinery is currently working to replenish all fuel reserves for both craft, and given the 6000 units of Kethane on board, I should have a bit to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will of course have to send this miner home and requisition an updated design to include a smaller refinery for personal use (also, some freaking landing lights).

The three musketeers are in orbit of Duna and sci-sats have been deployed to Ike and Duna orbit (managed to get the probe cores on backwards though; that was a bite in the butt). I am concerned about the mission\u0027s return trip to Kerbin, though; I burned more than the optimal from the transfer stage in both the trans-Dunar burn and the correction burn. I had to make two attempts at the transfer burn (my computer spontaneously shut down in the middle of the first attempt, which sucks because that one was supposed to be a 45-day transfer). I had to pull a third burn when I entered Duna\u0027s SOI to get close enough for aerocapture and in the end the transfer stage ran out of gas. Had to finish the burn for aerocapture with the service module engine - the one I\u0027d intended to use to get home. Long story short, I drained the main fuel tank of the ascent stage of the lander into the service module stage. Now, I do have the same size tank for the descent stage and the ascent stage does have some auxiliary tanks attached, so I think a landing is still in the cards, but I\u0027ll have to make doubly sure to get all the fuel drained back into the ascent stage before I take off and that all the remaining fuel makes it back into the service module.
