Trying to transfer to another planet by trial and error, or by having to go to a website that tells you a rough approximation of where and when to burn, is not fun. The lack of any way to know when the launch window for a particular planet is, is a huge oversight by Squad.\n\n2. I know how to do all the things MJ does, I just find them tedious to do after 1600 hours in the game.\n\n3. Getting into orbit from Kerbin was fun and challenging - the first 20 times I did it. Now I use ascent guidance and go read Drudge Report for a few.\n\n4. Again, using trial and error to figure out if my rocket could reach orbit was fun and challenging - the first 50 times I did it.
