Unfortunately, they have been fundamentally programmed by using stupid algorithms (not suitable for this kind of purpose) and it is practically impossible to fix them without rewriting huge parts of code. So, they will stay buggy and we have to learn to live with it. Therefore it is necessary to make multiple checks and reserve dv for corrections. It is best to plan first correction immediately (couple of hours) after leaving Kerbin\u0027s SOI. Typically it is on first half on orbit and magnitude is 0-20 m/s (from Kerbin to Duna) if ejection was reasonable accurate. In first correction PE is roughly adjusted to somewhere near wanted value (0-1000 km for low orbit, 2000-4000 km for Ike encounter).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext correction is planned immediately after executing first. It is 40-70 days before Duna encounter.

Instead, it is all about sampling. Differences between projected and actual orbits after an SoI change are caused by differences in \u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cem\u003Ewhen\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E you cross the SoI boundary. The projected orbit results from a calculated SoI boundary crossing time, but the actual orbit results from recalculating the orbit after \u0022oops, we crossed the SoI boundary between last frame and this frame\u0022. This means there will be variations based on how much you were warping when you crossed the boundary, your velocity when you crossed, your exact positions on either side of the boundary, and even how far into the save you are (UT\u0027s precision will slowly drop off as the game progresses, but you will have to warp for something like 10000 game-years for it to become much of an issue).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCould KSP do something about it? Maybe. Is it worth the effort? Less likely. So long as you cross the boundary at a low enough warp (5x-50x (personally, I recommend 5x)), you should rarely lose an encounter to any planet with a largish SoI, and regaining should be cheap for smaller planets. Similar for aerobraking: have your periapsis about where you want it, cross the SoI \u0022slowly\u0022 (warp), any adjustments should be trivial (if even necessary). I used to \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E warp at all when crossing SoI boundaries, but that can be a tad slow (real-time) and you then \u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E get the fun of 32-bit/64-bit floating-point math.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSomething else to keep in mind: in the real world, patched conics are only an approximation. Space agencies do not rely on them for anything more than planning (when can we go? how much delta-v will it cost? ok, add some for course corrections), though even that might be stretching things these days as they have sufficient data to just simulate it all to good enough accuracy that they can get away with smaller corrections. In other words: no matter how much you gripe about them, patched conics in KSP are more accurate than they are in real life.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother thing to keep in mind: orbits are chaotic systems (even 2-body).
