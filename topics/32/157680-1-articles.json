A design I\u0027m still refining has 13 Mainsails and 30 Thuds firing at launch, with seven cores boosted by six strap-ons (the latter of which have five Thuds each), and can orbit a transfer stage with 5000\u002B m/s delta-V (pushing a heavy lander that can land on, and hopefully return from, any low-atmosphere body in the stock system, possibly excepting Tylo) -- and I designed that before even unlocking the Rhino, Mammoth, or Vector.\u00A0 Sure, I could send probes to Moho, Gilly, Ike, Duna, Dres, Vall, Bop, Tylo, and Eloo with launchers a tenth the size -- but that would get the Kerbal Space Pilots\u0027 and Engineers\u0027 Union up in arms, and you don\u0027t want those guys to go out on strike (plus, they own the Design Committee and everyone in Mission Control is a member).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo space planes or glide return shuttles means everything comes down under parachutes, at least until I can build thrust-hover landers that return to Kerbin with enough fuel to, well, land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd no unmanned missions means I \u0022have to\u0022 send multiple missions to Mun and Minmus to mine the data from their various biomes, always do the local science when a command pod lands on land (in hopes of getting some biome other than \u0022grasslands\u0022, \u0022mountains\u0022, \u0022highlands\u0022, \u0022shore\u0022, \u0022waters\u0022 -- Jeb\u0027s been to the Northern Ice Shelf, but no one has been to the southern one yet, I\u0027ll get it eventually).\u00A0 So far, the science has been good, but I think I\u0027m going to have to send missions to Ike or Gilly soon -- the new ship can get there, the only question is whether it can get back after orbital capture and adjustments.\u00A0 You can bet a Kerbal will be checking the fuel gauge before undocking the lander...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-03-13T22:54:02Z\u0022 title=\u002203/13/2017 10:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Zeiss Ikon\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Snark","CreatedById":125662,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T14:57:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow there\u0027s an interesting set of rules. \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u0022no gliders\u0022 rule wouldn\u0027t affect me much, since I tend not to use them anyway.
