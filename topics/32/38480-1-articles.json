The higher the specific impulse the more efficient the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen picking an engine you have to consider 3 things:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Weight: A mainsail will certainly lift your moonlander. But it\u0027s a tad heavy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- ISP (specific impulse): The higher this is the better obviously.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Thrust: You aren\u0027t getting off the ground if your rocket weighs more than your engines can push. It also makes your burns shorter.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEngines usually excel in one of these things but suck in all the others. The nuclear engine is very efficient, but also heavy and produces little thrust (same story but even worse for Ion engines). The mainsail will lift your rocket but it isn\u0027t exactly fuel efficient and it is heavy. The ant engine is very light but has horrible thrust and one of the worst efficiencies of all engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are also a few jack of all trades like the red radial engine and the aerospike.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo you have to take into account what you want to do with your spaceship before picking your engine.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Oddible","CreatedById":74605,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T16:16:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPick up the addon \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/0-18-1-kerbal-engineer-redux-v0-5/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EKerbal Engineer\u003C/a\u003E and then go watch this Scott Manley\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZMkQvbk0zw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E.

By comparision, the ion drive has a fantastic Isp, but the thrust is pathetically weak.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIsp similar to \u0022miles per gallon\u0022 in an automobile.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAcceleration can be figured by dividing the thrust by the ship\u0027s mass. If you are trying to lift-off from Kerbin, and your ship\u0027s acceleration is less than 1 g, your ship is just going to vibrate on the launch pad while it burns all its fuel and goes nowhere. This is why you generally do not see any ion-drive booster rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust-to-weight ratio is a rule of thumb measure of how powerful an engine is. You divide the engine\u0027s thrust by the engine\u0027s weight (which is the engine mass times 1 g). If it is less than 1.0, you cannot use the engine to help a lift-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGenerally the only time you care about the thrust is for purposes of lift-off or landing. But there are limits. Ion drive has a thrust so low that your burn time can be measured in hours.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrust power is the thrust times the exhaust velocity, then divided by 2. This tells you how many watts of energy the engine puts out. Since it takes into account both thrust and Isp, it is a good way to measure the relative power of all the engines. Exhaust velocity is Isp time 1 g.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are stuck with an engine with low Isp, your rocket will need huge amounts of fuel in order to create the required delta V. There is a limit to how much fuel you can add before it becomes counter-productive. The way to get around the fuel limit is to use staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-24T16:39:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Phawks\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Phawks\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe ISP rating for each engine is a measure of its efficiency.
