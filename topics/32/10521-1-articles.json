Up until now, my strategy had been to get into a circular orbit at 11,400,000 meters like the Mun, but then I realized that it\\\u0027s very fuel-intensive and nearly impossible without MechJeb, so I decided to try an equatorial orbit and then extend the highest point to reach the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I built a craft and launched it into orbit around 100 kilometers, then waited until the Mun was at the very edge of the horizon and throttled up. Once the height had reached about 11,400,000 meters, I stopped and warped up. A few minutes later, I was being slingshotted around the Mun. I burned retrograde and ended up with an elliptical orbit around the Mun, my first one ever. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI let my craft orbit for a bit while I savored the moment, then waited until my periapsis and burned retrograde until I was on a sub-orbital trajectory. At that point, I deployed one of my parachutes (I\\\u0027m not yet skilled enough to do a parachute-less landing without MechJeb, even on the Mun) and lander legs and ended up on a flat expanse on the dark side of the Mun. I waited again to get some light in the area, then launched again to get into a circular orbit. I waited until my apoapsis was 30,000 meters and managed to get a circular orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot sure whether I\\\u0027m going to attempt a return at this point, but I got a screenshot of the ending orbit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i1079.photobucket.com/albums/w520/Jeb_Kerman/ScreenShot2012-05-12at50352PM.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ScreenShot2012-05-12at50352PM.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Thiel","CreatedById":13126,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T21:33:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jeb_Kerman\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jeb_Kerman\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E(I\\\u0027m not yet skilled enough to do a parachute-less landing without MechJeb, even on the Mun)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachutes have no effect on the Mun, so yes you are.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kosmo-not","CreatedById":14082,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T21:34:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Thiel\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Thiel\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EParachutes have no effect on the Mun, so yes you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was just about to ask him if he panicked when his parachute didn\\\u0027t deploy.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T21:37:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWill the chute still work when he jeb_kerman gets back to Kerbin?
