The legacyAtmosphere model that Kerbin and other planets use works as follows: atmospheric pressure = e^(-height / scaleHeight), times a multiplier (1.0 for Kerbin), where height and scaleHeight are both in km. It is clamped to 0 when the result of the exponential (e^x) drops below 0.00001. The variation from sea level to cutoff is entirely smooth; don\u0027t be fooled by the gauge displayed in the GUI with its bands, it\u0027s just a gauge. You can use a mod like graphotron to plot it. What you might be thinking of is \u003Cem\u003Etemperature\u003C/em\u003E, which does have bands in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for why people fly the pitch programs (aka not-gravity-turns) they do?

Since drag does not depend on surface area or orientation, turning your rocket off-axis so it\u0027s no longer streamlined doesn\u0027t actually increase drag, so there\u0027s no reason other than steering loss to make as sharp a turn as you can.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, I\u0027m pretty sure you\u0027ll find a gradual turn starting at about 7-8km will be more efficient (although slightly harder to fly, the third reason people don\u0027t). In fact, if you dig through the challenges in the Challenge forum, you\u0027ll find that those pitch programs are the most fuel-efficient in the stock atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for g0, it\u0027s off by a factor of 0.1%, not 10x.

I don\u0027t think anyone wants the game to be perfectly realistic or another Orbiter, I think we all understand that a balance must be struck that keeps the game accessible and fun while maintaining or improving the high level of realism that is a factor in the success of KSP so far.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it is a factor. The community that got the ball rolling for KSP was mostly composed of physics and engineering types attracted to the design and orbital mechanics aspects of the game. Almost all space games before then always oversimplified space travel, dumbed it down for the perceived limitations in player understanding. KSP was one of the first, if not the first, to feature realistic physics and orbits in a game rather than a Serious Business simulator, that made realistic space travel \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E. If you look at the list of simplifications listed in HarvesteR\u0027s post you linked, something surprising emerges:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA real orbital rendezvous (as per Orbiter), would require 5 different steps: Launch, Establish orbit at LEO, Plane Alignment, Orbit Sync, and finally docking.\u003Cp\u003EI want to simplify this to a point where the average gamer can do it, without requiring a reading of the JPL pages on orbital mechanics... So here\u0027s what I have so far:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Plane Alignment can be removed by restricting the game to a 2D plane. (the game is 3D, but all motion is restricted to the XY plane)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The game shows the space vehicle from the outside (a side-looking camera that is always oriented so that the surface of the planet is \u0027below\u0027).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Characters go into the rocket as it\u0027s \u0027crew\u0027, which justifies (more or less) the fact that space flight is made easy, since one might think they are doing all the heavy work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The whole concept of \u0027Orbit\u0027 can be distilled down to simply \u0027altitude\u0027, where once above a given point (say, the limit of the atmosphere), the game takes on \u0027orbital mode\u0027 and you fly about on your RCS thrusters.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- in \u0027atmospheric flight mode\u0027, the main engines default to 75% throttle. Pushing them up to 100% may be considered as \u0027afterburning\u0027 and will increase heat and pressure, and may lead to an explosion. In \u0027orbital flight\u0027, the engines default to zero thrust, and the retro-engines (if available) respond to \u0027negative throttle\u0027 (all throttle is controlled by the W and S keys)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- as you gain altitude, the planet below moves around so that it\u0027s always visible to the sideways-looking camera. It moves in such a way as to be right behind the ship once it reaches orbit... in this way, one might imagine your orbital trajectory as being in the direction of the locked Z axis.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- RCS is simplified to clicking around the command pod to produce thrust in the direction of clicking... this is calculated to take rotation into account, so orientation only matters when it\u0027s time to land or dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust about \u003Cem\u003Enone\u003C/em\u003E of these simplifications made it into the game, or stayed there if they did. We do our rendezvous/docking maneuvers using the five steps he wanted to simplify. The game has changed since that post, becoming more realistic as the game caught on with people that knew the difference. It is not despite its realism that KSP is successful, it is because of it, IMO. NASA doesn\u0027t approach all those dumbed-down space games to collaborate, they approached Squad because the simulation was so realistic and enjoyable that their own people were abuzz about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course, Squad is a business and KSP has to be a profitable product. Maybe the market for the realistic space sim has been tapped and the majority of potential buyers remaining are more casual-play oriented. So there must be great temptation to broaden its appeal by simplifying things or making no further realism improvements. I hope that KSP can stay true to its roots and continue to strike the balance of realism and fun that has served it so well this far. The casual gamers are just that, they will play KSP and cast it aside. Diluting what makes KSP so good (and it is very, very good) will lose the core audience that are going to buy DLC, or KSP 2, or merchandise, all while proselytizing for KSP to whoever will listen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m not demanding anything nor do I wish to sound preachy, just passing on my thoughts on the whole realism thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-09T22:57:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think generally \u0022Life support units consumed per person, per unit time\u0022 is entirely reasonable.
