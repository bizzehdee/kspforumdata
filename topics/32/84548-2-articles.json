Not only was it completely bogus (He was nearly stationary relative to her, so he pretty much should have already been moving back towards her, even if his pack weighed two tons. A slight tug might not have done it, but she was giving him a good 15 seconds of focused yank, which should have been enough to shift a very considerable weight in space), but it could have been fixed very easily- just make the station have gained some spin from the debris strikes. It probably would have, too, especially if a module depressurized asymmetrically. If they\u0027d done that, not only would they have made it realistic for him to experience a force (centrifugal force) pulling him away from the station, but it would have added to the dizzying and disorientating mood of the film to have her trying to board the station while it was spinning (and deal with the forces while trying to get around inside) while probably keeping it easy enough to keep track of what was happening. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not just an example of movies forgetting about how physics works for creative license, its an example where the correct physics would actually have made a better movie.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Red Iron Crown","CreatedById":12858,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-15T21:53:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022cantab\u0022 data-cite=\u0022cantab\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAs for Gravity, I found Sandra Bullock\u0027s damsel-in-distress character more annoying than the iffy orbital mechanics.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s funny, it was a very similar role to Sigourney Weaver in Alien, the damsel in distress who finds the inner strength to survive her difficult situation.
