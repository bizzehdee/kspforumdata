The thing is, it didn\u0027t fly there; Mergard Kerman drove it. Yep, it\u0027s a boat, and a rover. Specifically, it\u0027s a hydrofoil, with a top speed of 44m/s when the floats are emptied of fuel, and on Kerbin it can maintain that speed as long as there\u0027s sunlight. This is the reason for the command seat on top of the cabin; that\u0027s the bass fishing seat for when the pilot gets bored on long trips.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, that being said, I\u0027ve been turning it into a plane as well once I got the critical boat/rover functionality working. Right now it can also use the electric propellers to fly at ~130m/s at sea level, again as long as the sunlight holds out, but the aerodynamics aren\u0027t great so the landings are scary. Other features include:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0026gt; RAPIER engines, and enough fuel to get it to orbit.

(I\u0027ll put one on Laythe, and maybe another on Eve.
