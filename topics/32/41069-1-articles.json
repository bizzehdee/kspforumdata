Between World War K and the SpiritWolf/Hanland conflict, and others, there seems to be a LOT a person can do with this program. Kerbal Space Police? Kerbal Space Opera? Kerbal Space Port? Kerbal Space Debris Section? (oh wait, that\u0027s an anime already) Kerbal Space Hospital? Kerbal CSI? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs there any more series out there folks would suggest?

The kerbals have this \u0022manifest destiny\u0022 to expand throughout their entire solar system. They\u0027ll start close to home and eventually send probes, manned ships to every body in the solar system. Bases and eventually permanent colonies will be built everywhere possible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joshington","CreatedById":73509,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T01:17:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMyndFlame\u0027s Herman Kerman series...All 2 of them. lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut still pretty funny.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
