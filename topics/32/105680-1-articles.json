I modified one of my designs to add a small boster stage (solid boosters fleas, then hammers..) Both overheated when I used them, so I took them back off and decided to just use the old method, w/o the solids.\n\nSuddenly, the Thumpers I used before are overheating now. There\u0027s an array 4 of them, radially connected to the lf tank in the middle. Heat builds up VERY fast and they explode within 1km of the launchpads.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind. Restarted the game, now no problems even when at max thrust. Huh.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T17:03:14Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 05:03  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rdwulfe**"}]}
