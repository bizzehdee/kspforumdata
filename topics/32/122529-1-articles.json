It may apply somewhat to their spacesuits though, which seem only loosely coupled with whatever quantum state the Kerbal actually resides in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn fact, I think evidence supports the theory that kerbals are capable of partially phasing out of reality at will. A kerbal can \u003Cem\u003Echoose\u003C/em\u003E to walk on top of his spacecraft, but if he wants to get in that chair buried inside struts and whatever else, nothing seems to get in his way. If sufficiently agitated though impact, they also seem to temporarily loose cohesion, so maybe it takes a conscious effort of will on the part of the kerbal to remain solid. More severe impacts tend to totally disperse the kerbal with only transient remains- oddly similar to how high energy particle collisions work. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbals also seem to possess the ability to teleport over short distances, which further supports the theory that they are somewhat wavelike, and are really only describable in terms of probabilities.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-09T23:39:08Z\u0022 title=\u002210/09/2015 11:39  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 9, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by StevenRS11\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Whirligig Girl","CreatedById":36077,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T01:43:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlease make the title less spoilery.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jett_Quasar","CreatedById":117851,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T02:20:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat looks like the most uncomfortable seat ever!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJR\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GMM_113","CreatedById":150539,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T03:18:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure I\u0027d want to drive around with a box of radiation in my backseat, but then again, I\u0027m not Mark Watnet, badS botanist and space pirate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T10:17:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Jolly_Roger\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Jolly_Roger\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThat looks like the most uncomfortable seat ever!\u003Cp\u003EJR\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, I would rather put the RTG at the bottom and put the engine on it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-10T22:59:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHis expression in the first pic is spot on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-11T02:49:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can just imagine how the conversation at the KSC went...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But won\u0027t I be cold, sitting on top of that mini-rocket in space?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You see that RTG over there?
