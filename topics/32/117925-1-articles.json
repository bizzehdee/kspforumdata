It would have ended up being something like 15 parts to make what I had in mind. To save on part counts, I was going to use Ubioweld to weld it all into one part, but then went looking for a parts pack that had what I wanted, and the hex tress pack was just what I wanted.\n\nIt got me thinking: I don\u0027t hesitate to install mods that change how the game works, but normally avoid parts packs and try to stick with Squad parts.

A hinge could have so many uses.\n\nI hope we one day get more stock strucutral panels to build with, as there has really been no new individual building parts like that since ages ago. Another thing I have wanted for ages is a way to change panels to be transparent or have some kind of glass parts, as that would allow me to even make my own pods/cockpits."},{"CreatedByName":"SAI Peregrinus","CreatedById":125558,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-08T16:40:17Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Instead of Procedural Parts, wouldn\u0027t TweakScale accomplish the same thing?
