In other words, I don\u0027t like stuffing one kerbal in a mk 1 command pod and them sending them off to eeloo. So I did some research and now know the real life requirements, but I got stuck in an unexpected place, I can\u0027t find the interior volume of habitable parts in KSP. I would like to know if anyone else knows, but if not it might be a \u0022fun\u0022 community project to try to find them all out using the size of the capsule and where the windows match up or something."},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:30:48Z","Content":"The PPD-10 is about 13.73 cubic meters in volume."},{"CreatedByName":"kStrout","CreatedById":116630,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:51:17Z","Content":"That makes sense to me, did you find it somewhere or did you calculate it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Xannari Ferrows","CreatedById":125369,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-11T23:53:07Z","Content":"Calculated.
