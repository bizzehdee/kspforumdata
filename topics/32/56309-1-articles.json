Kerbin\u0027s biomes give so little science. They are okay when you are first starting career mode but further down the tech tree it would become pretty boring. You get a lot more science for exploring the moons and other planets. A one way probe to Duna/Eve really doesn\u0027t require that much delta-V either, not much more than Mun if you make use of aerobraking and parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Imran60","CreatedById":96647,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-16T12:16:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPoint Transmission is in the development phase, with detailed routing, permitting and technical aspects under careful evaluation.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
