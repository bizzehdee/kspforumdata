For example, sticking a tank under your engines before you try and put them on the radial decoupler. Then, getting them on straight is a matter of lining them up with what\u0027s already there, and practice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the forums!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Brok3n","CreatedById":65655,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-09T23:10:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll have to give that a go, thank you.

Now select 2,4 or 6 way symetry, remove booster and add it where you want it. Now you have the booster setup, add struts, fuel lines and seperatrons. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne other way is to add all of this first, then add boosters with two way symmetry multiple times, benefit is that its easier to get an asparagus setup, downside it that its a harder to place correct.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"koshelenkovv","CreatedById":53764,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-12T11:09:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Stealth2668\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI agree with PrISM.
