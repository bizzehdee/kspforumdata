The thing that bugs me the most about stations is the wobble and tilt that happens right after docking. With a 2000k \u002B core no reasonably sized ship is going to move that puppie at all, or at least it wont knock it out of alignment before I can do a quick timewarp to lock the rotation back down. I\u0027ve done similar things with a cluster of fueltanks as the centerpiece of the station (that I painstakingly refilled) to damp down the docking forces but the number of parts required to reach those tonages really kills performace around the station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mephane","CreatedById":59884,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T22:22:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vostok\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Vostok\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI think that the claw\u0027s pivot ability along with the fact that it keeps the whole thing as one ship will lead to it becoming a helicopter rotor bearing in many uses.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it shall be named... the Clawcopter!\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T22:45:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnybody else wanting to create articulated vehicles with it?\u003Cp\u003E...anybody?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m going to try to make a ring of rovers around the VAB! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dat_Spacewaffle","CreatedById":101662,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T00:33:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnybody else wanting to create articulated vehicles with it?\u003Cp\u003E...anybody?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E....no?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Starts drawing plan for a rover train using the claw*\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tanner Rawlings","CreatedById":58414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T00:52:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ei see some guy making a AT-TE with the claw using damned robotics that can climb up vertical cliffs, and using kas having kerbals swing around and stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SkyRender","CreatedById":10651,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-26T00:53:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERovers don\u0027t need seats any longer.
