Two of then are not ideal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst is adding more of the same content: new parts, new planets, etc. While this will entertain players for a little bit longer, ultimately the novelty wears ofthend players find themselves back where they started demanding more stuff to be added.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecond is that they develop new features that in no way enhance the restof the game. This is how I feel about multiplayer. KSP is and always has been a single player game. That is what allows you to have so much freedom to create your own universe. You don\u0027t need to compete or try to work around other people who don\u0027t see the game in the same way you do. Multiplayer brings nothing to the experience. It enhances nothing that is already there. It doesn\u0027t draw the player deeper into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdding new features should be about enhancing gameplay. Not bringing new gameplay in out of nowhere. That\u0027s not to say that new parts or planets can\u0027t be added if they contribute something new,as with the RAPIERs. New planets can be added, but it would make for more interesting gameplay and challenge progression if they were in another star system for example.Many of the more popular mods that exist now do that, and are therefore good candidates to be stock gameplay. Things like Kethane and KAS and FAR and deadly reentry. They already fit perfectly within the scope of gameplay, and add to the challenge of the game without being mandatory in their adherence (well, FAR and DR do but they don\u0027t do anything new players wouldn\u0027t expect in the stock game).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI disagree with the tone and approach of the OP, though I do think the development of KSP needs some refocusing. Not completing features (seriously when is the Mk. 3 cockpit going to get a stock interior?) and adding new ones that don\u0027t add anything to existing gameplay (I like the tech tree but the current implementation of science gathering is laughably unrealistic and exploitable) won\u0027t do anything to improve the quality of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPerhaps the best approach wouldn\u0027t be to add new features, or gameplay modes, but to stop adding new things entirely and polishing/completing what is already there. Build up before you build out, so you end up with a tidy, beautiful metropolis of a sandbox rather than a sprawling, innavigable shanty town.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"iDan122","CreatedById":24439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-25T20:21:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jchad\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jchad\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDear OP. \u003Cp\u003EIm sorry you are not entertained with career mode, as much as many of us are. I know I LOVE career mode, although I think the tech tree could be tweaked an ITTY BITTY bit, but that can be easily remedied with a mod. Now with career mode, I pretty much only use sandbox as a tool to learn how to get to other planets reliably, getting proper phase angles, etc. I also feel optimization of code is a KEY to a well polished game and Im very happy with what squad did to help OUR playing experience. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour statement regarding it taking \u0022literally like two days to make one\u0022 is baseless. I think that to support said statement, you should go develop a planet, do all the coding, properly match the collision messes *insert dev. mumbo jumbo* and come back on say, the 27th or the 28th and present it to us as a mod. where we can test it. Also we would like you to include a few biomes and science as well. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for multiplier I am not sure how I feel about it, however I will be open to exploring it.
