There are two views on planes (which can be aircraft and/or spacecraft; typically made in the SPH and launched on the runway or from orbit). I\u0027ve seen some posts by knowledgeable forum members actually recommending that the CoL be slightly ahead of the CoM. However, most posters and tutorials suggest that the CoM be slightly ahead of the CoL. In either case, they should be ahead of the CoT. I have actually done both with the CoM/ CoL arrangement. It all depends on your objectives. For general use, CoM ahead seems best. For some lower throttled planes which glide after running out of fuel, I\u0027ve had success with the other arrangement. I\u0027ve also had success with angled landing gear under the rear of the fuselage, for lower throttled planes. Full throttled or more powerful planes seem to do better with perpendicular gear at the rear. Some people prefer the rear gear as close to the CoM as possible; others like that gear closer to the rear so that its harder to knock the engine off during take off. Experimentation usually yields something in between for me. So try to have fun as you try things out.
