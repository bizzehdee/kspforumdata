I\u0027d built a little mobile crane that could carry new extensions, line them up and dock them, but during landing my 3rd component, the instant the base \u0026amp; crane unpacked, the crane either exploded so hard that pieces of it left the kerbol system within a few minutes, or the crane simply landed on the sun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022suncrane.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002290.00\u0022 height=\u0022671\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.kfs.org/oliver/ksp/suncrane.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe base also occasionally had a tendency to fly up and meet me during landing, but not in a good way like you\u0027d want. I removed all the auto-struts and that seemed to help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut now, every time I fly into range of the base or every time I exit timewarp, the base leaps up off the surface or begins making a hard turn.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUntil I turned on \u0022Pause on unpack vehicle\u0022 and \u0022unbreakable joints\u0022 this would destroy the base 1 time out of 3.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I did a small experiment and used some of the \u0022anchor to ground\u0022 elements from \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E etc, and they seem to have the ability to stay put, but I\u0027ve put a bunch of effort into this base at this point, and I\u0027d like to know if there is some way that I can affix an existing base to the ground?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI tried putting a stamp-o-tron or a K\u0026amp;K ground anchor with a docking port, but my base is big enough now that it can\u0027t get close enough to dock.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs there some way to affix an existing base to the surface it is sitting on? A part? A mod? An edit of the SFS file?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Aziz","CreatedById":150811,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-07-16T09:51:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is stock ground anchor, though to attach it to existing base you need \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E and use the connectors to join the two. Or indeed build a contraption from the anchor to closest wall to dock them, I haven\u0027t tried that though.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere\u0027s also parking brake mod, which helps with sliding but I don\u0027t know how it affects exploding bases on load.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAalso, there\u0027s a mod called World Stabilizer, it also should help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
