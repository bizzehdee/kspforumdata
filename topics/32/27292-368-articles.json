Before this one I did another test, unsuccessul because the probe was too small and the RCS system was too poweful, and because of my lack of control. So this time I tried a lander with more inertia. Also i put several RCS systems to test what happens when they are out of the center of mass.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-27T13:52:35Z\u0022 title=\u002207/27/2014 01:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 27, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LordCorwin\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kerman","CreatedById":166398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-27T13:54:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou must know about super light touch controls when you press caps lock don\u0027t you?

I did a lot more contracts. One in particular gave me trouble. OCD and pride prevented me from ignoring/rejecting a tough contract that I only accidentally accepted. This is a quote from another topic:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to get a LFB KR-1x2 (again!! :\u0027( ) to 6300 M traveling at at LEAST 470 M/s. It\u0027s impossible. I\u0027d love to see one of tou guys do it. I tried all kinds of super expensive configurations of Radially mounted (using girder segments) LFB KR -1X2 engines and no matter how many I had going at once there was never enough thrust to get the payload LFB KR -1X2 up to speed in time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I used my magnificent brain and thought outside the box like a maverick genius, and instead launched it much higher than the 6000M mark and cut my engines until free fall. I then sped it up to speed on the way back down and as I got within acceptable altitude requirements, I staged the test.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
