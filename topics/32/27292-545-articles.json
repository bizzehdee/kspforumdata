Craft must carry basic science instrumentation (no goo or materials required).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETypically what I do to land planes is I put a bunch of radial parachutes all around the center of mass, fly to where I want to be, cut the engines, stall, and pop the chutes. Then I can use the engines to taxi to a more precise location on the ground if needed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter several attempts to meet all the requirements, I decided the 30 part limit was just too restrictive. A VTOL would be ideal for \u0022in the wild\u0022 takeoffs and it solved the 30 part limit as well: I could launch it from the pad through the VAB. Of course I designed it in the SPH for the symmetry function, saved, then loaded it in the VAB and launched. This massively expanded my options, but I was still limited by the lack of custom control groups, which meant I have to manually activate and shutdown each engine, which in turn means I can really only have one vertical and one horizontal engine without producing fatally off-center thrusts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEarly versions were dual Basic Jet designs, which were scrapped due to the low service ceiling - it just wouldn\u0027t do more than poke it\u0027s nose over 14km, and couldn\u0027t reliably hold anything over 12km. (EDIT: I did fly the early version on several missions, but with the drop tanks it would barely hold 8km which made for some annoying detours around mountains.) Switching the Basic Jet on the back to a Turbo Jet required some re-balancing thanks to the extra 0.2t weight it has, but once done I had a really effective supersonic VTOL with considerable range.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt this point I\u0027ve just done some basic flight tests - it is stable with and without the drop tanks and at all fuel levels. I\u0027ve been able to climb to and maintain 23km altitude and I think I can eek a bit more out of it than that if I\u0027m patient. Speed record for this design so far is north of 1300m/s, and that\u0027s at over 50% fuel in the main tank (drop tanks discarded) in level flight, so I know I can get more if I need it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn unintended benefit of the design is that the drop tanks it uses to extend range to distant areas of Kerbin can also be swapped out for other parts for those pesky \u0022test such-and-such at this altitude range and speed range\u0022 missions. I can strap those things on under wing, fly them up and test them with far greater ease than a rocket now (and I have full control to return everything to KSC for 100% part value).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is one of my favorite things in KSP: solving a problem that is constrained by multiple layers of restrictions whether they be unlocked parts, buildings, or a penchant for distributing spaceplane parts evenly across a kilometer of runway.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-01-29T07:33:48Z\u0022 title=\u002201/29/2015 07:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Spektyr\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fr8monkey","CreatedById":76199,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-29T07:54:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, I would upgrade the runway.

Sent a science probe out to the Mun to satisfy both a satellite contract and a \u0022sci data from Mun\u0022 contract.

Probe at 5,000 m/s of delta-V in its own right (i.e. not including the booster phase), so I would certainly hope it\u0027s got enough to cover the inevitable screwups. That one should all go okay as long as I don\u0027t hit Minmus in the process of putting it in the right orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPut a satellite around Kerbin for a contract.

Complete success on the mission there, though I was worried about the landing there for a while. Being off-center on the Level 2 runway is most definitely NOT a good thing. Still, I didn\u0027t tear anything off, which is more than I can sometimes say about landing craft on the Level 3 runway...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETook on a whole bunch of new contracts to replace the ones fulfilled, of course. Got missions to put a space station up around Kerbin and ground bases on Mun and Minmus, one to collect EVA data from the Munar surface and a flag planting Mission (three for one, there), and a mission to do some ground exploration on Minmus (will try to combine that one with the mission I\u0027ve got to Minmus at the moment - not sure I can do that since the contract was accepted after the prior mission was launched).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot the Astronaut Complex and Administration Building fully upgraded at this point.
