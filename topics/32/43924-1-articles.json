For a request of this magnitude (particularly the subscription part) you are better off mailing Squad directly to discuss your proposition, perhaps \u003Ca href=\u0022/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b19486f3dec1c5d8dedf9486f5\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\u0022__cf_email__\u0022 data-cfemail=\u002280f3f5f0f0eff2f4c0ebe5f2e2e1ecf3f0e1e3e5f0f2efe7f2e1edaee3efed\u0022\u003E[email\u0026#160;protected]\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E is appropriate, but look on the Contact section of the main website. After all, depending on the specifics of your project, this might fall under partnership, sponsoring, etc.. which can\u0027t just be handwaved but needs to be formally handled on some level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAssuming your business model is sound, though, there is the problem of you needing to associate a real identity (for the subscription) to one or more game accounts, which can be problematic legally. Then there\u0027s the whole cheating aspect, it is unclear how you would prevent someone cheating his way to the prize by getting all the achievements one way or the other.. I am not sure how big an issue it would be on this scale but it can\u0027t be ignored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am not sure how far along your company is, but I just hope you\u0027ve carefully evaluated your business strategy, which would seem ripe for abuse to me given your description.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeblote","CreatedById":79303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T10:40:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022milankragujevic\u0022 data-cite=\u0022milankragujevic\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m presenting a company that\u0027s interested in offering really-cheap/free zero g flights and cheap... ish... suborbital flights, and we are operating on a system of achievements that get the user a number of points, and after a year the user with most points gets zero-g / suborbital (the user pays half the price, we pay helf) flight.

Even if someone fakes the points, he/she will get like 2 or 3 for every mission, like orbiting, landing on the moon, escaping kerbin\u0027s SOI, landing on duna, visiting jool\u0027s moons. People still need to solve tests which gain them points, and if someone goes so far to learn the tests... then he deserved it to go, since there should be a lot of questions. We also give points for education.. etc. we\u0027ll also monitor everything to make sure that it\u0027s fair, and we reserve the right to cancel someone\u0027s progress if we think they\u0027re cheating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that It\u0027ll work out, if not, we will cancel support for KSP and games and focus primarily on science tests and projects...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ted","CreatedById":26298,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-26T12:35:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESend a PM off to Maxmaps, he\u0027s the PR guy and should be able to help you out with any questions you have. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
