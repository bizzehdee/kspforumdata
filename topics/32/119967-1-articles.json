It just lands on the wings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I want to land on another planet, or even most of the time on Kerbal, if it has an atmosphere, I build it like this. Build it so it can fly like a plane, but lands on legs instead of wheels. I do it for these reasons:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Finding a nice flat place to land on is hard. Tail landers can land in a lot more places, and more safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. You can use parachutes to land, which saves a lot of fuel. Remember to bring an engineer if you want to use it more than once, so he can repack the chutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. If you want to land on a non-atmosphere planet, it\u0027s easier. The wings will do you no good whatsoever whether you land vertically or horizontally, but it\u0027s a lot easier to land vertically with no aero effects than horizontally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. When you come back to Kerbin, you don\u0027t have to try to land at the runway. Just land wherever.
