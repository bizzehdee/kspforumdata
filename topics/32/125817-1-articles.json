When I looked, he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not in LKO, he is in a failed transfer orbit to the Mun (Ap in lunar orbit, Pe in LKO but in the wrong direction) I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have a manned vehicle with that kind of delta V yet, so he\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ll wait.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nI proceed with my first robot lander on the Mun, all goes well.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow I look at my map, and this guy is on an escape trajectory heading out toward the sun!

And it was a very dangerous orbit. So I figure one of three things had to have happened:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n1. The Mun came by and pulled him out of orbit, but that violates everything I know by the on-rails physics system.\u003Cbr\u003E\n2. I guess it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s *possible* that he flew by the Mun, and within 22 km(?), while I was doing my robot landing. (what are the odds of that?)\u003Cbr\u003E\n3.

So any time you accept a rescue contract for Kerbin orbit that doesn\u0026#39;t expressly say it\u0026#39;s in LKO, or is a multi-star thing in Kerbin orbit, you risk accepting an impossible contract due to the stranded Kerbal being ejected by Mun before you can get him. But if he\u0026#39;s already in Munar orbit, he\u0026#39;ll be safe. So I recommend NOT accepting contracts that can potentially have the Kerbal ejected.[/QUOTE]\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWell you can easily predict it: there are two price categories for save-a-kerbal missions. The lower profit ones are from LKO, at 80-100km altitude, \u0022almost\u0022 in a circulat orbit. The higher once are above KEO and up to the orbit of the mun.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut isn\u0026#39;t it actually more exciting racing against the clock instead of being able to do the same boring 90\u002B day encounter?\n"}]}
