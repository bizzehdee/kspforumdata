Your space program will have reputation (based probably on how many kerbals/rockets you lost and the contracts you finished). Also we\u0027re getting two new engine parts probably.

That of course is not the only thing that will be in future updates, but the rest is all a secret for now and not set in stone until the team starts working on it.
