I tried making a ship with 3 \u0027handles\u0027 ( think [|] ) coming off the centre stack to hold additional stacks (fuel tanks and engine = stack)... the \u0027handle\u0027 will not join at both ends of the \u0027handle\u0027 (|-|-|), I have even carefully designed the \u0027handle\u0027 so it is connected at the top end and rests against the centre and tried to strut the bottom but its too weak and the handle clips into the centre when any weight is added to the handle. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tried tri stack designs with the payload cradled in the centre of the tri stack but the stacks just wobble like a stack of plates being carried , parts just fall off seemingly at random , strutting follows odd rules (one test strutting from heavy side to centre stack resulted in the side stack swinging and eventually falling off, strutting the exact same spot but from the centre to the side and the strut holds the side stack stable... seems parent -\u0026gt; child origins are crucial when strutting).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIllogical events prevent anything too out of place from being built , like a perfectly symmetrical vessel having a uncontrollable spin on take off ignoring canards and SAS modules.

All the side stacks are IDENTICAL as in I design the stack as a single, then pull it off and reconnect with 3 times symmetry ... so every part is the same in those stacks, even the struts.
