On accident, of course. It was my first Mun mission of that career save. I really screwed that one up. Fiery death... ouch. But I gave her a flag memorial at the beginning of the runway, and a probe in Munar Orbit. As well as the first flag on the Mun being called \u0022For VAL!!!\u0022\n\nJeez, this game punishes..."},{"CreatedByName":"LordFerret","CreatedById":111598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T14:06:13Z","Content":"Gees guys... poor Val. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\nI must say, my Val is unusual (??)... maybe just a quirk?

Her second flight she got to terrorize some poor tourist who thought she was just going to have a short sub-orbital flight but went orbital.\n\nI guess some girls just want to watch the world burn (around them during re-entry)."}]}
