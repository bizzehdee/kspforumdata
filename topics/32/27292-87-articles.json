Apollo 1 ended with a comedy of errors. Tipped over on landing as I didn\u0027t have an ASAS to control the RCS jets to keep from tipping. I think popped my rover without first getting a kerbal in the seat, so it rolled 3km down the slope of a crater blowing up as it went. Then I dusted a kerbal after planting my flag at the top of the a nearby mountain.

I also landed a probe where I was thinking of putting down to find a flat(ish) landing spot ahead of time as part of my issue was having to put down on a slope as the area of the mun I put down, there are zero flat landing places. So I have the area pre-scouted as well as a nice marker to aim for. I am still not positive at the LM will work perfectly, but I have tested the crap out of it on Kerbin (about 20 design iterations and at least 10 tests). The landing stage has about 700\u002B m/sec of dV and good TWR, the ascent stage has about 900m/sec of dV, but much lower TWR.

First, I turn too hard, sending Jeb flipping end over end soaring above the Munar terrain, but somehow, with the magic of reaction wheels, he only pops a few tires. All is good. THEN, as I am driving at ~22 m/s, there is suddenly no ground below my rover. Jeb drove, at 22 m/s, into a crater, dropping 100 meters, and the only damage was the popping of 6 of my 8 tires. Either Jeb is a wicked good driver, or my rover is invincible.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"info600","CreatedById":68640,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T06:55:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI transfered Jeb, Bill, and Bob out of \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/34402-O-A-S-I-S-Stardock-and-station-systems-Update-New-Terminus-Core\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E the OASIS Terminus Core\u003C/a\u003E with a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/45771-Crew-Transfer-Vehicle-mark-3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Emodified CTV\u003C/a\u003E, modded beause karolus10 said something about it being able to only reach a 80km orbit (ie. 4 MOAR 30second boosters!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I have trust issues with mechjeb with it overshooting the KSP for landing, for I just aborted the landing, popped open the parachutes by \u0022hand\u0022, and turn on the micro engines (fact, the ant engines does nothing noticable in the atmosphere if the amount of engines being used is less than 100).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was sort of correct on the landing part, cause I landed in front of the crew entrance of the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eaddendum: Forgot about the OASIS fuel tank that I sent up and docked (and deorbited the assembler for the aforementioned CTV)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-07T07:01:15Z\u0022 title=\u002209/07/2013 07:01  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 7, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by info600\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Zeroignite","CreatedById":1377,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T07:06:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVanDisaster\u003C/strong\u003E, can I please have a copy of the helipad-styled extraplanetary launchpad?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T08:59:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMade a ship that flies like a quad and landed on the VAB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s205.photobucket.com/user/Triple88A/media/Video%20Games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot10_zps55cb5c6d.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i205.photobucket.com/albums/bb210/Triple88A/Video%20Games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot10_zps55cb5c6d.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot10_zps55cb5c6d.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://s205.photobucket.com/user/Triple88A/media/Video%20Games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot11_zps7730dd3c.jpg.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i205.photobucket.com/albums/bb210/Triple88A/Video%20Games/Kerbal%20Space%20Program/screenshot11_zps7730dd3c.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot11_zps7730dd3c.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SRV Ron","CreatedById":69806,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-07T12:38:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELanded on Minmus.
