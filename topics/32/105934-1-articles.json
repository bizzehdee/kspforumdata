The heating in LKO reentries shouldn\u0027t be a problem anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut: When returning from the Mun, you have about 800 -900 m/s more speed. A \u0022shallow\u0022 reentry will end up in a bounce back into space, followed by a dangerous steep reentry if you aren\u0027t able to do corrections. A steep reentry - well you all know....

Coming from Orbiter, i am used to other dimensions. On Earth, you need 7000 m/s to reach LEO, as you probably know. So breaking this speed with Earth\u0027s atmosphere is a whole different story in terms of heating. With a real Apollo capsule, you brake with a maximum of 6g during reentry when coming from the Moon. You won\u0027t reach that value in KSP (without popping your chute, of course) I think that the relation of deceleration to heating is too far off in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fizbanger","CreatedById":141991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:27:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYep, if you open it before re-entry it doesn\u0027t animate until you get to 25K and under, then they chutes pop and drag you to a stop at 10G without snapping off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, I\u0027ve changed my approach to gathering science - I will EVA and bring everything down in the capsule to get around the heat shield having no mass and everything flipping with it - but the parachutes are indestructible brakes at the moment. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext I\u0027m going to try the types of Lunar landers I would build in 0.90 for gather Mun science and then landing safely back on Kerbin and see how I go with these aero effects.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI apologise for possibly going a little off-topic but i find the parachutes unrealistic only when the entry angle is too steep or too shallow.

It does not burn nor break off and can reduce speed very suddenly in ways that nature never intended. When the angle is too shallow, the craft accumulates heat for a longer period of time at altitudes where the parachute cannot deploy to slow it down.

This has helped keeping the craft retrograde on reentry. I also set my per around 20-25k for reentry from mun transfer and then deploy my chutes around 6-8k i am usually only going around 200-300m/s at this point. Took a couple tries to get the numbers right but this has worked for me no problems whatsoever.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T20:02:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Curveball Anders\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Curveball Anders\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI don\u0027t know how it\u0027s coded.\u003Cp\u003EBut as I understand it heat transfer is a big part of the new heat system.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETransfer by contact (or radiation) means that any part of a construction with higher levels of thermal energy will try to dissipate this excess to it\u0027s surroundings .\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo a hot engine will try to transfer it\u0027s excess energy (heat) to a cooler tank, and continue to do so until there\u0027s a balance of available energy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf we take a standard capsule returning from space one would assume that the heat shield is sizzling hot while the capsule and other attached paraphernalia is cooler.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd while the heat shield can dump some (and most likely the majority) excess energy into the water, some energy will transfer to the capsule (and attached dodads).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the entire craft will cool down, while at the same time some part (the initially cooler ones) will actually heat up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not exactly rocket science, it\u0027s thermodynamics \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#C0C0C0;\u0022\u003E- - - Updated - - -\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe effects of heat transfer was shown in vivid detail by some glorious streamer during the launch weekend (I don\u0027t remember who, I blame myself for being drunk and watching streams for too many hours).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Mk.1 capsule, with a heat shield and a Mk16 parachute, hitting re-entry by the book.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHeat shield doing it\u0027s job, glowing red and shedding mass to dissipate heat and suddenly boom goes the parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E...?
