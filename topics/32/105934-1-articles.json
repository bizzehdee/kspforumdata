As most of you already found out, parachutes are, well, powerful. Too powerful even when half opened.\n\nHowever, does anybody know how to modify the parts database drag cube of the chutes to make them a little more realistic? The numbers in the part configuration file don\u0027t seem to do much.\n\n2. Heating up is easy. Losing heat isn\u0027 t. Even when the craft has touched down and is sitting still (or floating in the ocean), the temperature still rises happily. Any ideas?\n\n3. Atmosphere pressure curve: below 25k, it\u0027s definitely there and will kill you when going \u003E mach2\u002B, and above, it\u0027s nearly gone, leaving your capsule returning from the moon with \u003E 3000 m/s nearly untouched. Meh.\n\nAny quick fixes for someone like me who doesn\u0027t hesitates to edit a cfg file?"},{"CreatedByName":"FreeThinker","CreatedById":117389,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T10:29:15Z","Content":"It realy depends what you are used to.

I\u0027m afraid, and haven\u0027t noticed any problems with 2. personally, although I\u0027ve only been landing Mk1 capsules from Kerbin orbit so far. \n\nWith regard to 3. I am finding that I need to change my old re-entry profile quite a bit. I\u0027m guessing that parachute drag will be changed at some point so I\u0027m trying to get into the habit of flying \u0027sensible\u0027 re-entries from the start. Specifically, only deploying chutes once I\u0027m through the fire and ideally through the aerodynamic shock effects too. \n\nSetting my periapsis to about 30km and coming in shallow seems to work OK because it gives me more time to slow down before deploying my parachutes. That\u0027s for return from Kerbin orbit - I\u0027ll probably need to go shallower still for a return from Munar orbit."},{"CreatedByName":"Poynting","CreatedById":103397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T10:59:29Z","Content":"I too have been playing it sensible and not using parachutes until subsonic speeds after re-entry.

I played a lot with Deadly Reentry in the past and that always gave me smooth temperature increases up to a certain peak, followed by a smooth temperature decrease until space (where it\u0027s pretty cold).\n\nNow we have a great and highly detailed vessel heat and temperature simulation that is leaps above and beyond in physical accuracy than Dealdy Reentry ever tried to be, but at the same time... the smoothness is gone. You have giant spikes or jumps in behavior when passing certain velocity or altitude marks - it feels like the atmosphere only knows 3 or 4 different, discrete states.\n\nExample 1: try looking at external temprature just as you\u0027re passing the boundary from atmosphere to space. It drops from several hundred Kelvin directly to 4 Kelvin instantly. No gradual decline, not even over as little as a single meter - no, it just switches *instantly* the very moment you pass the boundary.\n\nExample 2: This ---\u003E [http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117230-Whats-with-the-insane-heating-spike-at-Mach-2](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117230-Whats-with-the-insane-heating-spike-at-Mach-2)\n\nNow it\u0027s possible that some of what we\u0027re seeing is actually realistic and that the onset of certain types of shock heating really is that drastic - I wouldn\u0027t know, I\u0027m not qualified to comment on that. But that can\u0027t explain all the sudden jumps (certainly not the one in example 1). And it just doesn\u0027t... feel smooth, you know?\n\nDisclaimer: I like the new aero and heating systems and point out their flaws only because I care about them and think they could be even more awesome."},{"CreatedByName":"Old Foxboy","CreatedById":141736,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:26:03Z","Content":"Okay, let me get more precise ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI am a long term Orbiter player (if you know it) and have lots of experience in X-Plane, too. I am into realism, as far as it makes practical sense for a computer game like kerbal ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif) I don\u0027t have any issues with a real flight model. So, of course i played a modified version back in 0.9.\n\nI don\u0027t mean a simple LKO return. Of course i\u0027ve done that. Dozens of times, and never ran into issues - and i popped my chutes very low, like they should (immediate hyper high G force stop nevertheless, as you all know). The heating in LKO reentries shouldn\u0027t be a problem anyway.\n\nBut: When returning from the Mun, you have about 800 -900 m/s more speed. A \u0022shallow\u0022 reentry will end up in a bounce back into space, followed by a dangerous steep reentry if you aren\u0027t able to do corrections. A steep reentry - well you all know.... So i aimed at about 25k-28k, and the capsule followed a nice Apollo-style flight profile.\n\nOops i forgot to mention i had a stack of 2 capsules and a service bay (they used up all of my heat shield).\n\nOn the parachute, and later on the ground, the attached thermometer didn\u0027t measured a falling temperature, but still rising. My question is if this is through belated conductive heating or if it\u0027s a bug.\n\nAnother thing i did see was that the mk 2 heat shield didn\u0027t lose any ablator when i tried to do a reentry with a hitchhiker container. But that\u0027s another story.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s just that the Kerbin atmosphere resembles the earth\u0027s atmosphere, but it only reaches to 70km - and the planet is significantly smaller while having the same gravity. Coming from Orbiter, i am used to other dimensions. On Earth, you need 7000 m/s to reach LEO, as you probably know. So breaking this speed with Earth\u0027s atmosphere is a whole different story in terms of heating. With a real Apollo capsule, you brake with a maximum of 6g during reentry when coming from the Moon. You won\u0027t reach that value in KSP (without popping your chute, of course) I think that the relation of deceleration to heating is too far off in KSP."},{"CreatedByName":"Fizbanger","CreatedById":141991,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:27:14Z","Content":"Yep, if you open it before re-entry it doesn\u0027t animate until you get to 25K and under, then they chutes pop and drag you to a stop at 10G without snapping off.\n\nFor me, I\u0027ve changed my approach to gathering science - I will EVA and bring everything down in the capsule to get around the heat shield having no mass and everything flipping with it - but the parachutes are indestructible brakes at the moment. \n\nNext I\u0027m going to try the types of Lunar landers I would build in 0.90 for gather Mun science and then landing safely back on Kerbin and see how I go with these aero effects."},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T11:29:44Z","Content":"I apologise for possibly going a little off-topic but i find the parachutes unrealistic only when the entry angle is too steep or too shallow. To be honest that\u0027s most of the time, and abolutely they need to burn up or break off when the player gets it wrong (and Kerbals need to be killed by huge G forces).\n\nInitially i was irritated to see parachutes magically save Kerbals from certain death, but since i was trying to play permadeath i was also more carefull and kept re-entry speeds on my mind. I was pleasently surprised to find that in some cases parachutes worked exactly as you\u0027d expect them to. They reduced speed very gradually and the g-force indicator hovered in the red zone but never maxed out. Visually it looked \u0022realistic\u0022 as well. I guess these are the scenarios testers were using most of the time to see if things work as intended.\n\nLong story short, when the angle is too steep the craft experiences extreme heat and g-forces and the parachute is unrealistically strong. It does not burn nor break off and can reduce speed very suddenly in ways that nature never intended. When the angle is too shallow, the craft accumulates heat for a longer period of time at altitudes where the parachute cannot deploy to slow it down. The parachute should be incinerated once it\u0027s deployed. If you get the angle right, the parachute deploys as the craft begins to heat up then gradually and almost gently bleeds off excess speed.\n\nThey are broken though, in the sense that they will allways do their programmed job, no matter what the speed, altitude or heat have to say.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I too have been playing it sensible and not using parachutes until subsonic speeds after re-entry. They really should be ripped off/destroyed/over heated with all the other re-entry effects but they aren\u0027t low down in the atmosphere as they slow you down so quickly. Has anyone tried opening one before re-entry?\n\nYes, i tried deploying chutes at the moment the craft enters the athmosphere. In fact i\u0027ve begun staging chutes before the last decoupler on rockets that do not use heat shields. Of course they don\u0027t work until the correct athmospheric conditions but once deployed they get to work immediatley. They currently forgive unrealistic flying, though if you fly correctly they work more realistically.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-29T11:33:37Z\u0022 title=\u002204/29/2015 11:33  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 29, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by georgTF**"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:13:28Z","Content":"Fix for parachutes and many other 1.0 bugs: \n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-0-27-Apr-15%29-Misc-Utilities-%2818-Jan-15%29](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97285-KSP-v1-0-Stock-Bug-Fix-Modules-%28Release-v1-0-0-27-Apr-15%29-Misc-Utilities-%2818-Jan-15%29)"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-29T12:47:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E 2.
