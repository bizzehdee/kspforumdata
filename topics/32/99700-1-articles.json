I was all excited to zip around Kerbin in a spaceplane to visit all of these locations, but hitting them is hard as nails. The actual areas where the survey will work are super tiny. For example I need to perform an EVA at all three of these locations, and according to the game I am not currently in any of them. I\u0027m zoomed in on the map as close as it will go, I can\u0027t go any closer... \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/uCAsarV.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/uCAsarV.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really hope that with the biome refresh in 1.0 they make it more clear.

Any vessels not on the ground and out of physics range (more than 2.5 km) of the active vessel gets deleted.
