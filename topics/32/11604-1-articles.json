Your wings are not producing enough drag due to the thin atmosphere. Large delta wings should fix this issue.\n\nAnd on the unrealistically part, yes, yes they are.

The problem is that the F-15\\\u0027s intakes are much wider at the front, but at the rear the engines sit much closer together. It\\\u0027s simply not possible to achieve that without \\\u0027cheating\\\u0027 to some degree. This gives you two choices: 1) Straight engines with a large gap between them at the back of the aircraft... or 2) A large, obvious \\\u0027fault line\\\u0027 in the fuselage where at some point you have to connect the much wider-spaced intakes to the narrower engines at the back.\n\nI\\\u0027ve come up with a few designs but none of them really work good.\n\nThis isn\\\u0027t helped by the fact that the vertical stabs we\\\u0027re offered in-game are extremely tiny, and delta wings look like ass when used for that purpose.\n\nHere is one design I\\\u0027m trying, which involves 1m spaced intakes but engines close at the back. The obvious problem here is that the rear profile looks awful because of the clear misjoin between the fuselage parts. Ignore the fuel pipes - I modded my delta wings to carry internal fuel. Incomplete design.\n\n\u003E ![ev7Vt.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/ev7Vt.jpg)![MiVXg.png](http://i.imgur.com/MiVXg.png)\n\nHere is another I\\\u0027m totally unhappy with, but features the closest joining of the engines you can perform without major collision problems. Incomplete design.\n\n\u003E ![SD9zc.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/SD9zc.jpg)\n\nAnd here is the most complete fighter I\\\u0027ve made which is loosely based on the F-15E.\n\n\u003E ![e1KEP.png](http://i.imgur.com/e1KEP.png)\n\u003E ![HbZ0c.png](http://i.imgur.com/HbZ0c.png)\n\nNote that I normally fly it with canards (which also jettison on capsule separation).
