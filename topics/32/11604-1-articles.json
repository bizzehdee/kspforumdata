This gives you two choices: 1) Straight engines with a large gap between them at the back of the aircraft... or 2) A large, obvious \\\u0027fault line\\\u0027 in the fuselage where at some point you have to connect the much wider-spaced intakes to the narrower engines at the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve come up with a few designs but none of them really work good.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\\\u0027t helped by the fact that the vertical stabs we\\\u0027re offered in-game are extremely tiny, and delta wings look like ass when used for that purpose.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is one design I\\\u0027m trying, which involves 1m spaced intakes but engines close at the back.
