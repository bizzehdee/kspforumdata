The planned feature I am looking forward to is Discovery Mechanics. Now if it were completed then it would kinda spoil the discovery joy. Next logical conclusion would be that buildings or anything can now be constructed anywhere. So then we would use Discovery Mechanics to first try to peer and uncover what it is and then send a mission there. I soooo want to find an 25 x 100 x 225 km obilisk orbiting a gas giant.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFarmer Dave used his backhoe to dig up a big hole. After a year or so the pond was filled by snow runoff and rain. Then farmer Dave told me next year he will be goin fishin in that pond. \u0022What fish do you plan on stocking the pond with?\u0022, I asked. Farmer Dave looked at me puzzeled and said , \u0022Nah, just gonna catch whatever fish happen to be in there\u0022. Now I musta have looked puzzeled because Farmer Dave began to tell me that \u003Cstrong\u003Efish seed for ponds are from the birds\u003C/strong\u003E. Well the next year I visted and had to ask \u0022hows the fish pond\u0022, and farmer Dave told me that he first caught a catfish then a trout.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Egot the idea from reading \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022khyron42\u0022 data-cite=\u0022khyron42\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EA few things people who are unhappy about this \u0022secret feature\u0022 might consider:\u003Cp\u003E- what it really is, more so than blowing up buildings, is showing off that stock methods now exist for placing/replacing 3D objects from within the game engine. That will open up options for stock bases and/or for new mod-based bases using that stock mechanism. It also opens up the option for career mode of having a much smaller KSC until you purchase additional buildings/unlock additional tech, etc. Existing mods that place buildings can start using the stock method now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- the same stock method of replacing an asset with a different asset can be easily used by mods to add deformable terrain (place \u0022crater\u0022 asset in-game based on impact detection.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the next next next update does include builds of anything anywhere what would you build for other KSPeers to discover?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-09-30T02:21:20Z\u0022 title=\u002209/30/2014 02:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 30, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by MoeslyArmlis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Equote khyron42\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TMS","CreatedById":57134,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T19:45:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m hoping for a Gone Fishin\u0027 minigame.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T20:07:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDid you copy that from the procedurally generated contract text?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aethon","CreatedById":110755,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-29T20:13:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELol.
