Note that my usual sub-orbital trajectory has the Pe around 25km in atmosphere, so that the circularization burn takes \u003C 100 m/s dV. Now, i did this flight only to see the re-entry heating so i did not circularize. On my way down, all fine \u0026 dandy, the shield ablated roughly 50% of the ablative coating.\n\nNext, i took the same rocket - but this time without a heat shield. Roughly the same trajectory.. give or take. To my surprise i could re-enter even without the heat shield. Given the fact that it was just a sub-orbital flight, thats fine for me, since the temperature values were extremely close to the point where things blow up.\n\n3rd rocket.. same design, but with 2.5 parts. Mk1-2 pod, chute \u0026 heat shield. Same trajectory.. In this case, the max temperature on the parts reached ~600 deg, which translates to about 300 deg. celsius.. which seems extremely low for a re-entry. Even a sub-orbital one. On top of that, the heat shield ablated just 1.5 of its ablative coating. 12 units out of 800. That feels a bit underwhelming in terms of re-entry danger. Even feels a bit like cheating.\n\nEDIT #1: Just did another test run with the Mk1-2 pod \u002B chute but without heat shield. Pod temperature peaked @ 1300 deg. - seems extremely effective :-/\n\nEDIT #2: Re-entry coming from Mun with 25km Pe. Mk1-2 pod \u002B chute. No heat shield. 120% re-entry heating. Was perfectly fine. Peak temperature @ 1700 deg. Definitely some part tweaking is order in my opinion. ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)\n\n5th run was with an airplane, which started blowing up @ 600-700 m/s - but i admit, i wasn\u0027t trying too much either. Also, i understand it is normal since the aircraft stays in atmosphere for a longer time.\n\nGiven those test runs, it appears that *some* parts kinda need a balance pass regarding re-entry heating and how they handle it. It seems that heat transfer and thermal mass has a strong effect on how much parts heat up during re-entry (and i\u0027m referring to the 2.5m parts).\n\nAnyone else noticed these behaviours or is it just me imagining / doing something wrong?\n\nCheers,\n\nDJK\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T18:48:55Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 06:48  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DJK**"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T17:35:45Z","Content":"Reentry from suborbital is as slow as reentry can get.

I understand that they need a certain temperature \u0026 air flow to start ablating, so to speak. The problem is that the **Mk1-2** pod is extremely heat resistant, due to its high thermal mass, making heat shields useless in your day-to-day kerbal re-entries. Also note that every test i did was with the re-entry heating slider set to maximum - 120%\n\nThe 2.5m heat shield does not ablate because the pod soaks up all the heat.. acting like a huge heatsink.\n\nThats not necessarily a bad thing for some people.. but for those that lean towards a more.. \u0022real\u0022 gameplay, its not fun at all. And from my understanding, that is why there is a slider, to adjust the re-entry heat difficulty to suit your gameplay, but that is quite underwhelming at the moment due to the fact that some parts aren\u0027t quite balanced (personal opinion).

Or better yet, the way conductivity is handled. Lowering the conductivity flux worked fine for mk1-2 pod \u002B heat shield (high thermal mass). The shield heated up and ablated properly.. but at the same time, with the same conductivity value, the mk1 pod \u002B heat shield (low thermal mass) wasn\u0027t working properly anymore. The heat shield was indeed heating \u0026 ablating, as in previous tests, but there was absolutely no heat transfer from the shield to the pod. Apart from that, i am assuming that conductivity flux regulates all heat transfers, so it is pointless to tweak it.. that would render the Nerv engine, mining drill \u0026 space planes pretty much useless.\n\nAt this point i\u0027m pretty baffled of what is going on with re-entry heating.. but i\u0027m sure that its not properly balanced.. specially for a maxed out difficulty setting.
