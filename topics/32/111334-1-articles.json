Is KSP unusually addictive compared to some other games?\n\nI\u0027ve never had so much joy to be honest playing it, with so much freedom to use your day with. Many games I play get boring after a week or two, but KSP - I have been playing it for much longer. \n\nI\u0027m not saying addictive as in \u0022sugar\u0022 - addictive, but, for some reason, seems much more activity-filled than other sandbox games.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Does KSP affect you in such a way that you have much more joy playing it?"},{"CreatedByName":"Thomas988","CreatedById":92699,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T02:51:09Z","Content":"I do think KSP has an element of addiction to it.

I dreamed of being part of NASA as a kid. designing and building space ships was equally a part of my dream as flying them - but I never had the confidence to pursue that. I found I was good at teaching (ESL and English lit it turned out) and I enjoyed it - but my heart and dreams lay in space even then.\n\nFinding KSP for me felt an awful lot like going to Hogwarts must have felt for Harry Potter. Suddenly I\u0027m the wizard (or engineer and astronaut). Even though I\u0027ve really only dipped my big toe out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI in all my many many hours playing the game - I\u0027m simply amazed at how much fun and satisfaction I\u0027m still having and how much better I keep getting at design and flight in the game. I absolutely love the life I have, but there is a part of me that can\u0027t help but think that if I had had this game when I was 8 then I\u0027d be at NASA now (or possibly Space X)."},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T03:23:04Z","Content":"It\u0027s the snacks.

I have used SS since it was first released.\n\nKSP, though, is addictive in a different way. Real life science reports/videos, launches, space based movies and that type of thing will inspire me to play even when I am not thinking about KSP, whereas, SS or Civ V, I tend to plan more time around in advance and less on the spur of the moment, because, you know, the Poles....![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)\n\nKSP 1037 hrs\n\nMedieval II (with Stainless Steel 99% of the time) 525 hrs\n\nCiv V 438 hrs\n\nMedieval II probably has 5X that many play hours considering how many years I played it before Steam.

First time to Orbit on your new career save feels awesome. First time you pull off a two-ship docking, you have to wipe the sweat off of your forehead. Building your first space station becomes something to consider, and each module adds new Kerbals and a renewed sense of \u0022Wow. I did this.\u0022\n\nPart of it, I think, is because KSP isn\u0027t the kind of game to kick you when you\u0027re down. If you\u0027re failing to make orbit, there\u0027s something stopping you from doing it. Chances are, you can engineer your way out of the problem. Part of it is that it\u0027s like virtual LEGO bricks, putting together your space shuttle, or your Apollo mission, or just seeing if you can make this plane into a single-stage-to-orbit crew transfer shuttle. Then you get to fly your creations. You can put rovers on other worlds, other moons. You can send Kerbals onto these planets, set up colonies, collect science, and return the data to unlock new parts (in Science/Career mode. In Sandbox, you\u0027re doing this just to say \u0027yeah, I did something here.\u0027)\n\nMy only fault against KSP is that for as fun as it is, there is a hint of... Well, I\u0027ll say it bluntly. The learning curve, it doesn\u0027t exist. The \u0027learning curve\u0027 is a skyscraper inconveniently placed at the ends of your runway. Your first ever flights will often end in an explosion and dead Kerbals. Even once you stop making manned fireworks, you\u0027ll still fight to make orbit. Even when you make orbit, you\u0027ll fight to get any further. Then you\u0027ll try something new and find out \u0022Hey, sticking a nosecone on the back of these drop tanks makes you use less fuel!\u0022 or \u0022Making orbit costs less fuel if you launch this way.\u0022\n\nAnd there will be days where, despite everything, you grow to hate KSP and you shut it down... For a day, a week, or a month. And you\u0027ll wake up one day with a crazy new idea and KSP makes the perfect testbed for half of them.\n\nNow if you\u0027ll excuse me, I need to go send a biplane to Eve."},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-30T20:55:30Z","Content":"It did have that effect on me during the first thousand(s) of hours of playing, but then after going nearly everywhere making various bases/stations it kinda started to lose the magic for me.\n\nDid not help that it got more and more unstable with each version.

KSP being addictive and consuming every moment of your life, both waking and sleeping is just propaganda being spread by the Anti-KSP League. These are the same people who say we never landed on the moon or that steak-a-la-mode is bad for you. Unfortunately a lot of girlfriends, boyfriends, significant others and spouses secretly or even openly belong to this fanatical group of naysayers.
