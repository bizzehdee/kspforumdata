I also think that it\u0027s better for new players to start in career mode so they can learn by doing.

A player is already paying for one tier when they spend science to unlock a node, another monetary charge just seems redundant, especially when science and money are interchangeable. New players won\u0027t suffer parts overload anyway because they\u0027re only unlocking a few parts at a time at most.
