This thread serves as a \u003Cstrong\u003Erough\u003C/strong\u003E experimental observation to illustrate how SSTOs are now needed to be adapted for 1.0.2.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of testing various crafts, the ascent profile is a 30 degree climb up to 8000m where the pitch is lowered to 15 degrees. During this time as speed picks up, the sound barrier is (usually) broken and at around 20,000m the pitch is raised to 20 degrees, intakes closed and the RAPIER engines switched to rocket mode. All crafts used RAPIER engines and the desired apoapsis is 70,000m.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(1) The limiting factor for pre-1.0 SSTOs was the soupy drag, which requires all crafts to clear the soupy atmosphere as soon as possible to gain speed. However, engine thrust was constant and overscaled in high atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(2) During 1.0 the limiting factor was overheating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(3) 1.0.2 the limiting factor is now back to drag. Thrust is limited to speed and dependent on breaking the sound barrier, after which above 20,000m or so the engines die out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBeginning with a one engine craft, we have one with radial mounted tanks and intakes. It makes it to orbit, but had to take a longer time to break the sound barrier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/aS0Q7gN.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022aS0Q7gN.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERearranging the parts around to make a single tubular shape (Minus 1 intake and 2 Type A nosecones. These are considered negligible.) We also switch out the NCS adapter for a FL-T200 tank in order to fit the 80 liquid fuel for an inline configuration. Liquid fuel was adjusted for 80 units to compensate.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESurprisingly at 5000m it was already breaking the sound barrier. The ascent profile needed to be adjusted higher in order to prevent overheating. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/15IioTg.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002215IioTg.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis craft too makes it to orbit, the ascent profile was a lot easier to manage although the craft aesthetics leaves a bit to be desired.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sAw8HDz.jpg%5D\u0022 alt=\u0022sAw8HDz.jpg]\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a 3 engine 23.934 tonne craft.

Getting into orbit with reasonable amounts of fuel depends on leaving the draggy atmosphere as soon as possible. In order to leave the atmosphere ASAP, you will need to break the sound barrier ASAP. To break the sound barrier ASAP, you will need to reduce drag at all costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently inline placement to attachment nodes reduces this significantly. Attachment nodes are a requirement for the game to recognize an inline attachment to avoid drag. The game however does not recognize clipping and does not recognize inline placement of parts using the offset tools. This means that a streamlined looking craft will perform draggier than a not-so streamlined looking craft using attachment nodes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor a minimalist like me, there are 2 methods of getting payloads into orbit. If radial attachments of engines/nacelles/fuselage is unavoidable in a design, a brute force approach is required to overcome excessive drag, regardless of the use of aerodynamic nosecones or intakes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf a craft is an inline sausage, the number of engines can be reduced significantly to 2 RAPIERs. This also saves on the dead weight of having 1 extra engine in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will perform more tests and will continue reporting in this thread. Other reports are welcome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SpaceChipmunk","CreatedById":142023,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-22T14:30:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBy SSTO you are assuming Space Plane variant?
