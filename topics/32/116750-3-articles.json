It\u0027s no great hardship, at least if you don\u0027t opt for WW2-vintage, bone-stupid, marionette probes, and instead just rely on it to send science around space. Then it adds a modicum of extra challenge/work/expense to your gameplay, at least as long as the tech tree lasts. AntennaRange has no bearing at all, really, on sandbox games so in those, I PRETEND I need it and festoon space with fake, decorative commsats without actually installing the mod.\n\nAnd that brings me to my real gripe about all the added stock \u0022realism\u0022 features we\u0027ve been getting lately. WHY? There are, and have been since forever, mods that do all these things. And do them better, whether you define that as more \u0022realistic\u0022 or just more stable and/or balanced. This is because if somebody wants to make a \u0022realism\u0022 mod as opposed to a stock feature, he doesn\u0027t have to cater to the lowest common denominator but can go totally hardcore because the mod is optional. And most of these mods have been in rather intense development, with scads of audience feedback, for years. They are thus better products than whatever watered-down, bug-ridden version of the same feature that Squad throws into the stock game.\n\nSo, without any \u0022realism\u0022 features, KSP is all things to all people. If you want Feature X in your game, you can get the mod for it. Everybody can play however they want so the game is more attractive to a wider audience, which equals sales. Once you start putting \u0022realism\u0022 features, especially unavoidable ones, into the stock game, you start narrowing the target audience. Plus, because the new feature is watered-down, those players who wanted this feature in the game are dissatisfied with it and keep using the corresponding mod anyway. The net result is that nobody is happy with the result. Especially because the new features come with many new bugs, and due to time spent working on the new feature, the pre-existing bugs weren\u0027t fixed, so the game is noticeably less stable over all."},{"CreatedByName":"klgraham1013","CreatedById":105132,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-26T13:36:39Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E snip\n\nAs far as adding more realism goes, I feel these features (including life support) should have been included in the \u0022alpha\u0022.

For many, that would be easier, no? Having the antennas even matter is it being made harder contrary to realism, as the farthest possible transmission in KSP is about the typical close approach distance of Earth to Mars. Any transmission from a world inside the aphelion of Eeloo becomes pretty much trivial, the antenna combos are not much of an issue.

People throw around \u0022tedious\u0022 as if realism would require every single man-minute of work be modeled. In fact, we need only concern ourselves with what KSP bothers to model at all, and within that, what fidelity is possible. To the extent there is any correlation at all, I\u0027d not be surprised if more realism within what stock KSP does would be easier, not harder. At 1:1 scale (set kerbin to some reasonable size for a small, earth like planet). All the parts are scaled in lockstep, so similar looking craft behave the same. The atmosphere would scale less, since stock is too deep anyway. Distances are a non-issue because of time warp, the only change is launch/reentry given limited time warp under acceleration. Docking is easier in many ways since you\u0027ll have more daylight if you plan properly. \n\nPlanets could have some bigger, some the current size to make various difficulties. Minmus stays small, the Mun gets scaled up to the point that 1-stage vs 2-stage landers both have rationales. \n\nI\u0027d argue that most of the difficulty in stock KSP is added in after the fact because of the tiny scale used, yet trying to make it *feel* realistic. Look at reentry, if kerbin acts like earth, nasty things happen at other worlds.\n\nOn topic, this new feature creates balance issues as mentioned above for the simple reason that the game is not realistic about life support (that\u0027s sort of understating it since KSP is infinitely unrealistic WRT life support since it has none at all ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif) ).\n\nIt\u0027s a peeve of mine to see difficulty stated as a function of realism with zero data to support it.

It\u0027s bad enough we don\u0027t have a stock alarm clock for encounters and maneuvers without a mod, now you want to add life support to that.

Launching that many rescue missions is tedious to me. A few, sure, but without probes I\u0027d have to run 30-40 rescue missions to do everything I do in a game. That is assuming I only take 1 kerbal per craft."}]}
