It took about an hour. when he arrived, he thoroughly searched the craft and the area around it. Jeb was nowhere to be seen. Bill had to put 2\u002B2 together and the verdict is: Jeb got out of the craft while in decent to get more science. Usually he clung to the side of the capsule and got the science he wanted. he makes sure to wait for the Parachutes to deploy before he gets out. This time, however, Jeb got out too fast and tried to cling on to something and grabbed the Antenna, thus losing connection with mission control. Jeb plummeted to the ground, and died on impact. His remains were buried in the snow. Bill finished his mission, took the science from his craft, and with his head in hands, Bill went back to his craft. He returned an hour later.
