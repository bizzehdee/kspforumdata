Those IVAs are beautiful! Ever since we got the lab in .23, I have always wanted an IVA for it. We finally have one and it is gorgeous. The Mk3 cockpit IVA is also beautiful. Do the windows on the top and rear of the external model appear inside? The Mk3 crew cabin has just the right level of Kerbal humour (seat numbers ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)), while still maintaining a high level of quality. I shall have to start using the Mk1 Inline now after seeing it.\n\nOn the lab IVA debate, if some people don\u0027t like it, then a different one can be released by someone. If people want something different, they can have something different. While, I agree, having Ven and Tw1\u0027s IVA look is better for some applications, Frizzank\u0027s still has its uses. As has been pointed out, it is more reminiscent of Skylab than the ISS.\n\nAll in all, Frizzank, you have outdone yourself. I adore these IVAs, and cannot wait for 1.0"},{"CreatedByName":"John FX","CreatedById":59415,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T11:28:08Z","Content":"However pretty they are, if there are not multi function displays then pretty is all they are."},{"CreatedByName":"Wesreidau","CreatedById":75430,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-24T17:45:44Z","Content":"Nobody going to say it?

Skylab is what occurred to me as well when I saw the styling.\n\nWRT the horizontal vs. vertical interior orientation, it occurs to me that one could make a \u0027spaceplane\u0027 version of it and a \u0027rocket\u0027 version of it, which have the same functionality but different interiors."},{"CreatedByName":"Mister Kingdom","CreatedById":105121,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-25T16:52:10Z","Content":"The MK3 Passenger interior had me drooling at the keyboard.

To be clear, I love the new IVA, and I\u0027m not asking or expecting Squad to make a horizontally-oriented Science Lab IVA for 1.0.
