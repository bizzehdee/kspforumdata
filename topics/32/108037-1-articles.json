And that\u0027s the page that needs the most updates at the moment, as it\u0027s so outdated that it doesn\u0027t even acknowledge the existence of Science or Career modes. The rest the community can update easily enough, but that one page is going to make the whole process a bit gimped.\n\nEDIT: For anyone wanting to update the tech tree page, I have composed [a full record of the new tech tree](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/ksp_tech_tree_10.txt) and taken a screenshot of the completed tech tree as well:\n\n![Tech_Tree.PNG](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/Tech_Tree.PNG)\n\nEDIT 2: And here are the new tech tree node icons:\n\n![Adv_fuel_systems.png](http://www.skyrender.net/lp2/ksp/Adv_fuel_systems.png) Adv.
