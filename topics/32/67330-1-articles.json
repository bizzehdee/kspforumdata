Usually, however, Squad tend to keep this things a little less explosive; Information about updates is generally kept somewhat hush-hush and is not overly hyped by the developers and the media group. Sure, some upcoming aspects of the game are unveiled, but we don\u0027t tend to get as every little detail as we have here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn one hand, some people see this as a great thing: it lets us know that this huge amount of stuff is coming, and fast. On the other hand, others see this as a bad thing: all the new features are being spoiler for us, the air of adventuring a new and mysterious update has been stripped from us because of unavoidable spoilers about what\u0027s coming. For some, the hype has worn off - the game seemed so close to being finished and yet it still isn\u0027t released. I\u0027m sure that we all appreciate the immense effort that Squad go to for us to have a stable and enjoyable game, and being against the whole idea of hyping an update as far behind its release date as this update has been doesn\u0027t mean that you\u0027re against the development team.

This is, conveniently, a promotional tool by the developers to allow higher-ranking Youtubers to publicise the game and the coming update, with permission to do so in certain areas that are outlined in the previously mentioned NDA. This builds hype (whether you see it as positive or negative) for the game, as well as allowing the developers to indirectly inform their consumers of what is coming.
