I wonder if I was unintentionally exploiting that?), but when I get to the point of doing inter-planetary missions, is there an advantage to establishing a parking orbit first, then leaving LKO, or would it be more efficient to simply take off at Kerbol-rise or Kerbol-set (depending on whether I want to go farther in or farther out in the system) and rocket straight upwards? My intuition is that way there\u0027s no steering losses, and slightly less drag losses, but I haven\u0027t sat down and done the delta-V calculations. Come to think of it, I haven\u0027t done any delta-V calculations... seems somewhat un-Jebbish.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maltesh","CreatedById":17144,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T02:22:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen you head straight upward, you take maximum gravity losses, because the full power of the gravity of at your altitude is opposing your thrust.

Which lets you get to the proper ejection speed quicker, with less fuel spent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you do a proper gravity turn to get to your parking orbit, you can reduce the costs to getting to the parking altitude iver burning straight up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, every single real-world space launch does something similar.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Bioman222","CreatedById":30364,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T02:24:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, A LKO gives you much more margin for error.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T02:47:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPlus, if something goes wonky, you can \u0022abort\u0022 and return to the KSC, and rapidly try again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Temstar","CreatedById":24430,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T02:49:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EParking orbit opens up the launch window.

To put that much tonnage into orbit you need to use multiple high trust engines with bad impulse ratios.

This means that gravity is working to accelerate you around it without having to use any fuel. If you time it right gravity adds to your acceleration. The hammer throw image is a good one. Its always a better idea to make a gravity turn, whether you pause your acceleration and stay in orbit to fly a lap of Kerbin or not is unimportant. Someone said in a similar post that orbiting is just a velocity you pass through to get to escape velocity. Shooting straight up means that gravity is always working in the opposite direction to your vector, instead of swinging you around and into space it pulls you back down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T07:02:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Kiershar\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Kiershar\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EDirect ascent means not circularizing.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI \u003Cstrong\u003Eknow\u003C/strong\u003E that.
