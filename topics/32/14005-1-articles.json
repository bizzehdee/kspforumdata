When it\\\u0027s ready, it can than return to Kerbin with plenty of fuel left over. It was essentially the unmanned rover in the vid I posted in the videos thread, with a few changes to accommodate the manned pod and the need to return to Kerbin. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt actually exceeded expectations. It landed on a VERY steep hill (middle of a gigantic crater steep) and still manage to trek its way uphill for 35km and visited an arch. It took off and was on course to re-enter Kerbin with plenty of fuel left over. It was only when I was 50km from the surface that I realized I had forgotten to add a decoupler between the rover and the command pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI figured it\\\u0027d be no big deal, I added the decoupler, double-checked the staging, and everything seemed to check out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt explodes on the launch pad. The exact same thing, plus a decoupler, and it explodes on the launch pad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI really have no idea what\\\u0027s going on here. It happens as SOON as the startup lag goes away, and restarting the game doesn\\\u0027t help. I\\\u0027m really at a loss here, and was wondering if you guys could see something that I don\\\u0027t. My theory is that Bill and Bob, tired of Jeb\\\u0027s antics, are deliberately sabotaging the launch. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*Requires MechJeb \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aphazael","CreatedById":11981,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-10T23:55:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027m not on a machine that I can load up your .craft file and check it out myself, but my first guess would be that the extra .8 ton from the decoupler pushed some part further down the stack past its weight limit.
