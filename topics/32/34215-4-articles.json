Sadly, I have to say that the group is probably full. I keep going back and forth on this, especially after SkyHook dropped out and I accepted dharak. By that logic, since Pluto dropped out as well, we\u0027ve still technically got a space open. What does everyone think? I\u0027m totally cool with accepting Spyritdragon (he\u0027s been with us since the beginning, too) and that way we can have equal teams.
