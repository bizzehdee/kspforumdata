But then an idea occurred to me: if James Webb Space Telescope could have a huge main mirror by using segments, why can\u0027t I build a huge synthetic aperture radar / interferometer array out of individual dishes?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result was this prototype:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/33o05zr.jpg\u0022 alt=\u002233o05zr.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i41.tinypic.com/2q3duhc.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00222q3duhc.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELooks pretty cool. I\u0027m considering setting up an off world base (to avoid all that radio pollution of Kerbin) to construct an array. I have two questions:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I could either construct the array in space or on the surface or Mun/Minmus. If it\u0027s an orbital facility the array would be relatively easy to aim by moving the whole ship, but an surface base with a radar array has a certain... S.H.I.E.L.D. feel to it. Where would you build this array?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. If the array is to to built on one of the moons, what would be the best way to build the ability to train (ie, tilt) the dishes into each unit? I\u0027ve seen people build train like rovers with flexible joints between the train cars, how is that done?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I\u0027m interested in seeing what everyone else has come up with for dish design.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kottabos","CreatedById":36583,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-02T13:16:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a pretty cool project you have going here, thanks for sharing it.
