Unity\u0027s use of the RAM cache is simply terrible. it continues, to this day, to absolutely refuse to release RAM it has no more need for, and this continues to pluage us gamers as the game gobbles up more and more until it actually kills itself, crashing your game right to the desktop. this situation has become intolerable, and I for one am hoping that you will prioritize fixing this huge and glaring issue before deciding to make more content for the game. a game should be stable to play, not make us watch our usage like hawks to log off before it dies from starvation, causing us to lose our work within the environment.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAre you using the 64bit version?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDo you have any
