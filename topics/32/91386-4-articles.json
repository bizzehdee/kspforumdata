The old Interplay game Descent (which is awesome by the way, and available on Steam \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E ) would set your score to zero and display \u0022Cheater\u0022 every time you scored points if you entered a cheat code. Think about it: the means by which players could compare their performance was the part of the game \u0027compromised\u0027 by the cheating. I.E., the \u003Cem\u003Ecompetitive, non-singleplayer part \u003C/em\u003Eof the singleplayer game. Cheating existed as a conversation topic long before multiplayer games were popular because comparing yourself competitively with other players has existed long before multiplayer games were popular.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the context of an entertainment experience with \u003Cem\u003Ezero competitive relation\u003C/em\u003E to other players, tailoring said experience to meet your entertainment goals cannot be considered cheating because, far from harming your enjoyment, it is being enhanced. To claim that tailoring said experience to meet your own needs is \u0022cheating\u0022 arbitrarily assigns the developers ethical authority.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe may still call the process of tailoring our experience \u0022cheating\u0022 for lack of better vocabulary, but the event holds none of the inherent \u0022wrongness\u0022 your usage denotes. Personally, I prefer to call it \u0022having fun.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETLDR: \u0022Cheating\u0022 in a single player context falls in exactly the same ethical place as modding.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-03T18:21:59Z\u0022 title=\u002212/03/2014 06:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 3, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by JDCollie\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
