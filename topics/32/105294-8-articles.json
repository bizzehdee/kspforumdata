(I actually read this thread before I fired up 1.0 for the first time, so I didn\u0027t get any disheartening deaths.) Moreover, in order to bring a science bay back underneath your pod, I\u0027ve had pretty good luck with draining the monopropellant from the MkI command pod and adding a second heat shield under the science pod. As long as you\u0027ve tweaked the PhysicsSignificance flag so that heatshields have mass again, that should be enough to ensure that your center of mass is decidedly inside the science bay.

This time it was because a mandatory (sort of) adding a massless very draggy part below the capsules made this happen ).
