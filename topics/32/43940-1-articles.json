If so, did you rescue and return them successfully?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor me, personally, Bob was the first to land on the Mun, in the demo. He took off, but didn\u0027t have enough fuel to finish his maneuver to Munar orbit. Halfway, i tried to stop, but i\u0027d already used too much fuel. I didn\u0027t think of his pack at the moment, so i told him to bail out. Accidentally made him get back in rather than let go off the ladder. I managed to get him out of the pod again, but i couldn\u0027t make him let go and reduce his downward momentum. As if in a miracle, just as he had let go, the craft exploded, sending him flying off into a parabolic trajectory. I.e, suborbital. Sadly, his thruster pack malfunctioned here and from what i could see, he couldn\u0027t fly anymore (now i realise he might\u0027ve recovered given enough time, but then i didn\u0027t know that, sadly. I\u0027d just spent a few minutes waiting for him to skid to a halt after accidentally hitting the ground while travelling by jetpack on the Mun). I quickly tried to design a rescue ship, but constrained to the demo parts i had to use a turned-around tricoupler to get two command pods along. My launch failed, and by the time i would have launched the second one, Bob was already a while on his way on the trajectory.
