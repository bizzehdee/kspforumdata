That was an early EVA experiment to see if a pilot could survive bailing out of a plane by descending on suit RCS. Answer: no. The plane was under power and the airflow shoved the pilot between the fuselage and engine as they flexed apart while vibrating. (Ouch!) By the time he vibrated loose again, they were descending at a considerable rate. In the few seconds left before impact, I doubt any RCS alteration to his velocity could have been measured. Splat.
