This big ugly contraption was unevenly mass centered, but even then, the rocket managed to put it to minmus obit quite easily. I landed it with a eyeballed mass centered lateral Terrier. Did well too. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUntil then, I must say I was surprised everything went so well. Then I touch the ground, on a 6\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 slope...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the station slided for 20 minutes at 0.3 m/s (can\u0027t save, warp, return to space center, just had to wait). No brakes, no moving helped to stop it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen the slope was flatter and it stopped. But, it wasn\u0027t \u0022landed\u0022 (the mission didn\u0027t validate). And then, for no reason it was (minutes later)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I returned to space center, game crashed (all the time), until it didn\u0027t crash and the vessel totally vanished from save file.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo : beware of wheels it\u0027s kraken bait. I hope the new wheel code of 1.1 will be more stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS : Hopefully the kerbal engineer went for a pee outside/planting flag just before the station vanished. So I could target it\u0027s location with Hyperedit. I hyperedited a new version of the station with legs instead of wheels. No more crash and vanishing station.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-20T10:24:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a bug with rover wheels stopping the brakes from working.

I have reduced the brake torque to 5. I tested it on 2, and that wouldn\u0027t stop it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am aware of the weight of the tank and the leverage from the CoM, and the small weak links to the crane, and the extendy legs makes it all flimsy, but see that problem there i see the wheels falling off. This is my worst nightmare. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore worryingly previous tests were using the button on the screen, but when using the S key to slow the vehicle down and attempt to get the wheels in the \u0022right position\u0022 before applying the lock, when i nearly stopped I held the B key and I swear all the wheels went their own way full throttle. Ugh, maybe I need bigger wheels :/ I like these ones. Will keep messing around lol\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: That last pic is just cracking me up it looks totally retarded. It must be the kerbal way.
