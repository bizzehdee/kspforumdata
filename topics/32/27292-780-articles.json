After lots of thinking I decided it was better to go straight to Kerbin and rescue the last kerbonaut in a separate mission than to rendezvous with her and end up stranded in Mun orbit requiring refueling or another rescue which would just complicate things further. But then at the last second I changed my mind, and a third option came to pass.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI maneuvered the \u003Cem\u003ESalvation II \u003C/em\u003Eso that it crosses path with the stranded kerbonaut at 0.5km distance. As I wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to burn retro when near the kerbonaut and kill off relative speed, instead when under 1km distance I switched to the kerbonaut herself and for the first time ever manually, without instruments, using only the jetpack of the kerbonaut with very limited monopropellant, managed to rendezvous with the rescue ship, which was passing by VERY fast on a completely different and very eccentric orbit (stranded kerbonaut\u0027s orbit was circular). I barely made it with with about 1/5 monopropellant left. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had barely enough fuel in the ship to escape Mun orbit and bring the Pe down enough to be able to land at Kerbin. Even so, as the rescue ship was designed to land with engines and fuel tanks, I needed fuel to slow down while dropping through the atmosphere in order not to burn out the components that had no protective heat shielding. I didn\u0027t have enough fuel to reduce speed significantly and entered the atmosphere at over 3300m/s.

I began by landing Cerxie (the pilot) and tourists Jenedith, Neillong, Eldorf and Arissa on the surface of Minmus for contracts. The landing itself was a contract - I had one to \u0022put a new base on Minmus\u0022 and the Mun Buggy craft fulfilled all the necessary criteria. Earned about \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1225k all told for that effort, and since all the craft utilized were already up, it only cost me the price of fuel. So big profit there.
