Kasper responded \u0022Thats the goal.\u0022 This makes me wonder: why bother with the 1.0.5 update? Even if 1.0.5 is released next week (which i doubt it will be), that leaves only about 6 weeks until Christmas. Why bother with an update thats only going to be out for 5 to 6 weeks before being obsoleted by the 1.1 update?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI understand the reason for the 1.0.5 update. I get it and agree with it; I too am waiting in eager anticipation for the new parts, gameplay elements, and physics changes. When 1.0.5 was announced, it was explained and framed as a \u0022placeholder\u0022 update because 1.1 was still a ways off and Squad wanted to give the community something new to keep us happy. Thats cool; good on them. But if 1.1 is going to come out a mere 5-6 weeks after 1.0.5, why bother? I\u0027d rather they roll it all back into 1.1 and spend the next 5-6 weeks working out all the inevitible bugs and issues. We\u0027ve waited this long; a few more weeks wont kill anyone. And the present of a big, fat, 1.1 update with all the trimmings would make Christmas that much better.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Just Jim","CreatedById":148725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T15:09:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESimply put, 1.0.5 is the one present we all get to open before Christmas.... lol...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Richy teh space man","CreatedById":12511,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T15:10:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThey might be planning for a Christmas release, but don\u0027t be surprised if it takes longer..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frybert","CreatedById":97766,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T15:13:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESigns of life.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T15:14:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ll actually be surprised if they DO make that Christmas target.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-06T15:15:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EReading the tealeaves, I suspect that 1.1 should have been out already but has been delayed.
