Ive also found that our favorite green men are very slow to move around on Duna, due to its gravity. Ive adopted a sorta EVA-pack glide, followed by a face-first slide on impact. However ungraceful, its faster than jogging around. How do you guys do it, on Duna or otherwise?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"henryrasia","CreatedById":45695,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-08T01:01:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use your way, but it uses EVA fuel, which you can\u0027t get back unless you get back inside your pod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI came to use rovers (cart mod) but sometimes it\u0027s weight is costly \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI discovered, however, that if you press alt \u002B \u0026gt; or \u0026lt; you increase or dicrease the new physics warp.
