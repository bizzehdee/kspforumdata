I\u0027ve been playing KSP every day for years now. And you Modders are driving me *insane.* Listen, I play a modded KSP. Stock isn\u0027t bad, but modded is just how I roll. I mod even in RL, ok? I mean I modded my truck (nitrous on a 4 cyl is killer), my computer (overclocked the overclock), my house (fully electric shower), my girlfriend (nope, not saying what I did there, but it\u0027s spectacular). \n\nI mod everything, ok? Heckfire, I even downloaded Linux so I could add *more* mods to KSP. And all of you are driving me crazy! ***Every single one of you***. \n\nHere\u0027s the problem, just as soon as I download a mod, get it into my game, somebody finds a bug or suggests a new part and ***you do a new release!!!*** I\u0027m never getting to play the game because I\u0027m constantly downloading and updating. I had to buy a 3rd HD just to hold all of the updates. You know how many Mobo\u0027s I\u0027ve replaced just to get more RAM capability?!! CPU\u0027s??!! I\u0027ve just given up and now I build a new computer every release. ***And it\u0027s all your fault.*** \n\nSo I\u0027m begging you, please stop it. Stop being so responsive to your fanbase. Stop always reaching for perfection and playability. Stop giving unselfishly to the community. Please, I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to build my own Cray XK7 Titan if you don\u0027t.
