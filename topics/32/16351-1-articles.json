But for anyone who wants to see how seriously I take KSP (LOL), here\u0027s a photo album showing a very small amount of the procedures I plan to write up over the next few days. My mission is still in Minmus Orbit and I\u0027m about to go to sleep for the night. Been writing the book as I go along. After I complete a nominal flight plan, I\u0027ll get to work on writing up a series of \u0022what happens if this goes wrong?\u0022 plans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s the link to some of the stuff I have.
