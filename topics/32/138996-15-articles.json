Tesco also has to do the PR to retain customer trust, as well as having an administrative staff that includes regularly employed PR experts, legal experts, and others... Squad has... people in management that are also software developers and dreamers. It would be like comparing your local used car salesman that has a corner lot on the outskirts of town that works out of a portable building to the established Ford, Mercedes, Audi, or other named brand dealership that also happens to sell used cars...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad may have a lot of great contacts, such as Elon Musk, NASA, ESA, and other space agencies or other even other space industry leaders and even may be involved in educational ventures (educational pricing normally involves a deep discount on the idea that it will lead to future non-educational sales to former students-now-turned-customers, as EA/Maxis did experience with SimCity). However, that does not translate to instant capital (funds) in the bank NOW. Relationships lead to increased FUTURE revenues, much like the endorsement by professional athletes leads to increased sales of Nike or Adidas and those large companies can afford that kind of endorsement-translates-to-future funds because they already have investment capital, tangible assets, and liquid cash on hand, not counting revenue generated off product licensing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSquad, on the other hand, probably has very liquid cash on hand, beyond equipment - very little assets, and a small amount of investment capital, plus some revenue off product licensing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nActually, I completely agree. When I first got into this game and became the die-hard Kerbite that I am today I was quite frankly shocked at how cheap this game is. When you compare it to other games which cost far, far more, but offer such far, far less this game is ridiculously cheap. So yes, I would agree that this game should be higher priced and hell, I would pay it if it meant that Squad behaved ethically towards their employees. However before they can do that, they need to stop developing the game for a bit and stabilise at least one release. The 1.1.0 release was a diabolical clusterfrack leading to two near immediate incremental mini-re-releases - what the hell? Stabilise, increase developer salaries, increase game price, release press release providing explanation of behaviour - good to go!

These defenders of the faith seem to be gaining the populist vote, judging by raw numbers of \u0027likes\u0027 on their posts (I guess that could just be forum cliques rallying round their members - wouldn\u0027t be the first time I\u0027d seen that).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI wouldn\u0027t call it \u0027good tactics\u0027, but... well, you can\u0027t argue with stupid people.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn my experience flinging muck around and seeing if it sticks is about the only way for normal everyday guys to bring up any point of discord with administrative giants. Now, Squad may not qualify as the latter in economic terms, but in terms of employer-employee relations they sure seem to have acted like one, and based on my impression of their company thus far, it definitely seems like something they aspire to.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nNow here\u0027s the truth:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf we all just ignored it and moved on, this story would be over, Squad would carry on with whatever they\u0027re already doing, and nothing would change at all. Instead, and quite rightly, we\u0027re making a bit of noise about it, probing, questioning, stating concern, generally creating the impression through our internet medium that if true then these allegations damage Squad in our esteem. That\u0027s not the same thing as stating outright that Squad are an evil satanic demon of a company who should burn in the fires of righteous indignation. What it is, is applying pressure around this issue and asking for the truth, reassurance, a message from Squad that addresses the issue and tells us either that it\u0027s all lies, or that if it is true then they\u0027re very sorry and this is what they\u0027re doing about it. Even if Squad choose to ignore that pressure and hope it goes away, it is still making them think twice about how they treat employees, how they share the wealth that their workers create, and how they deal with their employees concerns before they reach the point of public expression.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nThis is absolutely right and proper, and how the modern world works to bring the shadier aspects of business to light and to bring those responsible to book.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nLastly, to those who are going around challenging those who contribute to this pressure, what exactly is it you\u0027re trying to achieve?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA bit difficult to address all of this in order.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022In my experience flinging muck around and seeing if it sticks is about the only way for normal everyday guys to bring up any point of discord...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my view, flinging muck around and seeing if it sticks is an immoral and counter-productive approach which is the bane of our political systems and a cause of misery the world over. It encourages group-think and knee-jerk reactions, and it privileges people that either look nice and sweet enough to trigger a knee-jerk reaction the other way, or who are devious enough to use people\u0027s prejudices or ignorance against them, or preferably both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now here\u0027s the truth: .... quite rightly, we\u0027re making a bit of noise about it\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is your interpretation of the truth. My interpretation is that a number of people are taking the words of one person (who, rightly or wrongly, has an axe to grind) and applying no critical thinking to what they read. They therefore make a boatload of assumptions, followed by accusations, followed by statements about how they want everybody to know how awful Squad is, even though lots of the parts of the story don\u0027t add up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo take one example, PDtv says that international workers were forced to crunch, but local staff had to keep hours. How do you think this set-up could actually work, in reality? How can a small company keep people on the other side of the world - and in places with much more protective legal systems - under some sort of corporate whip but be unable to do so in their own backyard? If these are indeed \u0022employees\u0022, how did social security and tax get paid on those pitiful wages, and how has Squad avoided the massive fines that they would incur in this sort of situation (failure to declare employees, failure to file tax/social security returns, etc.)? If Squad hired an Indian subcontractor with a sweatshop-style arrangement it would be completely believable and utterly condemnable, but that is not at all what is being suggested here. And that means that everybody who lumps this situation into the same category as other \u0022hateful international labor practises\u0022 (sp., sp.) is (1) getting drawn in by that flinging-muck knee-jerk reaction thing, and (2) not applying any kind of critical thinking to the question.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd this is why I, and a number of other people, consider this to be pitchfork territory. These are rabble-rousing accusations, and the rabble has been duly roused.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Now, right here we\u0027ve got a whole series of self-appointed Champions-of-Squad chiming in, naysaying the critics...\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis I find offensive, since I presume I enter into this category. I don\u0027t see many people defending Squad. Virtually all of the people \u0022naysaying the critics\u0022 are not defending Squad at all but are instead pointing out that the critics are jumping to conclusions and blindly muck-flinging and basically, being rabble. My personal opinion is that there is nothing in human history that has created more misery and injustice than when people allow themselves to become part of the rabble, and although nobody is going to get lynched in our case (\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003Ethough knowing where Squad is and what being visibly rich can get you, extortion, kidnapping and murder is not entirely beyond the realms of possibility\u003C/span\u003E) it\u0027s still a distasteful demonstration of that particular human flaw.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0022Lastly, to those who are going around challenging those who contribute to this pressure, what exactly is it you\u0027re trying to achieve?\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf I can convince one person to put their pitchfork down for a minute and analyse the facts, I\u0027ll consider I\u0027ve done humanity a favour.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-05-11T14:02:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222574995\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138996\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221462972747\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022153264\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Plusck\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n45 minutes ago, Plusck said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nsnip\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nPlusck, I fully respect your right to interpret your own truths, and to associate yourself with any particular group even if that self-association causes you to feel offended.
