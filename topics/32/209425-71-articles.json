I know it\u0027s not the best but maybe could fit near my budget?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWell, for that kind of CPU budget the Intel competition would be the Pentium G3258. It\u0027s the option I\u0027d prefer - benchmark results are similar to the Athlon overall but the Pentium\u0027s two fast cores will be more useful for more real-world things, Kerbal Space program included.\u003Cp\u003EAn Intel build also has much better upgradability, you can go to an i5 or i7 on the same motherboard in future if you need/want to. The Athlon would dead-end you on the CPU front since AMD\u0027s high(ish) end FX-series processors use a different CPU socket to the Athlon.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GalaxiesFinestToday","CreatedById":60035,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T01:27:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ETwo cores?

KSP only uses 1 core so that doesn\u0027t effect KSP performance. Most games wont use more than 2 cores (if they even use 2) so if you only game cores aren\u0027t too big an issue.
