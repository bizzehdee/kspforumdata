As for the engines, the staging usually works where if you add a decoupler it will create a new stage and anything below that decoupler will be in-putted into that stage. If you add anything using radial decouplers it usually depends on how high up you have placed them in terms of the staging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMost of the time you will just have to arrange the stages manually to get them the way you would like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helped.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T14:38:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a RESET button at the bottom of the stack view thingy. I generally find that it does a good job of fixing things. I typically then bump up the decouplers into the next stage so that the decoupling and next engines start at the same time.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
