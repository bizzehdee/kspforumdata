Some will be good for low-altitude, high efficiency flight, others will be good for supersonic flight at extreme altitudes. \n\nThe intakes on a turbine engine are really important. Look at the SR-71 and its peculiar shockwave-reducing intake spike, for instance.\n\nCheers"},{"CreatedByName":"Moach","CreatedById":9,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:06:42Z","Content":"does that imply the same will be for rocket nozzles?\n\ni mean, different nozzles for different flight conditions, i.e. over/under-expansion under different flight conditions, etc?\n\nthere is a length of requests about this very feature in the dev boards.... so, if this mechanic applies to one end of an engine, it would be logical that it must apply to the other one as well :![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"xclusiv8","CreatedById":20567,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:11:36Z","Content":"Thanx for the quick reply =)"},{"CreatedByName":"HarvesteR","CreatedById":4,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-18T16:16:00Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E does that imply the same will be for rocket nozzles?\n\u003E \n\u003E i mean, different nozzles for different flight conditions, i.e. over/under-expansion under different flight conditions, etc?\n\u003E \n\u003E there is a length of requests about this very feature in the dev boards.... so, if this mechanic applies to one end of an engine, it would be logical that it must apply to the other one as well :![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nWell, yes and no. If we split both intakes and nozzles from the engines, the engines themselves won\\\u0027t mean much anymore.\n\nWhat we want to do is later add a tweakable property to air-breathing engines, so you can change its nozzle for different operating conditions and flight envelopes. But the nozzle itself will always be part of the engine.\n\nThe intakes are split from the engines though, because being able to place them anywhere gives you a lot of design freedom. The air \\\u0027ducts\\\u0027 are implied. This was an area where we felt that creative freedom was more important than realism. If you want to make airliner-style turbines, you can, but if you want to have MIG-like intakes, that\\\u0027s possible also. \n\nCheers"}]}
