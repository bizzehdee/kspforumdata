If we split both intakes and nozzles from the engines, the engines themselves won\\\u0027t mean much anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat we want to do is later add a tweakable property to air-breathing engines, so you can change its nozzle for different operating conditions and flight envelopes. But the nozzle itself will always be part of the engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe intakes are split from the engines though, because being able to place them anywhere gives you a lot of design freedom. The air \\\u0027ducts\\\u0027 are implied. This was an area where we felt that creative freedom was more important than realism. If you want to make airliner-style turbines, you can, but if you want to have MIG-like intakes, that\\\u0027s possible also. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
