Typical RL daytime/nighttime variation is 10\u0027C (more in deserts less so in tropical forests and during polar winters) so that represents a 3.7% difference in density. Pressure is a surrogate for density\n\nFdrag = k \\* d \\* V^2\n\nequilibrium velocity at SL 9.8m/s = k \\* d \\* V^2 if situation 1 is 7 m/s then 9.8 = 49 \\* d \\* k otherwise d\\* k = 9.8/49 = .2\n\nThus if d then drops by 3.7% the d \\* k = 0.1926 (last two digits trivial) 9.8 / .1926 = 50.88 = 7.13333\n\nTherefore at 7 m/s the mean difference of a 10\u0027C rise is approximately \u002B/- 0.13 m/s therefore temperature should not explain the change unless D/N Temperature variation is considerably more extreme that earth. On earth daytime equilibrium velocity could be lower due to updrafts that occur over freshly plowed fields in mountainous region the down drafts on shaded sides and updrafts on heated slopes can be considerable. \n\nI don\u0027t know if the OP look at the fuel remaining in his tanks the capsule also has monopropellant, and other devices such as decouplers may have not be deployed completely. Another cause for differences is the landing altitude, vessels that land at higher altitude are landing in less dense air. \n\nThe atmospheric height in KSP is 5 km represents a 2.6 fold drop in pressure.\n\nFor launches, throttle changes at 2500 altimeter have the greatest impact on DV, this is because ships are generally accelerating until this altimeter, which means drag has not equilibrated. Once (drag \u002B gravity) = thrust a four fold increase in thrust only doubles the speed. It is very easy to see changes in DV with small changes in velocity.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-07-12T01:58:15Z\u0022 title=\u002207/12/2015 01:58  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666**"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T01:55:26Z","Content":"Honestly had no idea these mechanics were in this game.
