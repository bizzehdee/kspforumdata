Modeling for video games is a unique process. You need to refine it over and over again just enough that it doesn\u0027t have loads of polygons, but still looks good. The old VAB/SPH models were placeholders, so I doubt they were refined in any way. In fact, it used to be a lot worse, the VAB used to be so laggy that by today\u0027s standards, it was unplayable. It took until version 0.16 (I believe) where the VAB would stop lagging horribly on my machine. I\u0027m looking forward to this update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbol Prime","CreatedById":57626,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T14:51:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPerformance will improve if anything.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cloudx","CreatedById":59108,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T14:55:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat would be awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jon Tash","CreatedById":2681,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-10T14:55:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this interview from Myndflame with Maxmaps he said that the new VAB and SPH has better performance than before and it\u0027s better looking too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is the link for the interview: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://fr.twitch.tv/myndflame/b/426248761\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://fr.twitch.tv/myndflame/b/426248761\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pwlnw","CreatedById":77106,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-01T18:22:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u00C3\u00C5\u00BEn my configuration new VAB and SPH is really laggy.
