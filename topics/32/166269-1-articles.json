Now, back then I was\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ebad\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0at the game, and had next to no understanding of how to do interplanetary maneuvers properly. This new planet was in between Kerbin and Duna\u00A0and had fairly low gravity, making it a great first destination for someone with no idea how to plan an interplanetary mission.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother important point of note was that I still had yet to succeed with docking maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI unfortunately don\u0027t have any screenshots of this old mission (it was from around the time of KSP 1.0.x, I can\u0027t remember which specific sub-version it was though), but the rocket was fairly excessively-large and over-engineered - indeed, a very \u0022kerbal\u0022 design. It only carried one kerbal, a scientist (so I could get all the science from the new planet, I had MechJeb for piloting ability), who was contained for the entire several-year round trip in a Mk1 command pod. Attached radially to the fuel tank beneath the command pod were three engine pods -\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enuclear\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0engine pods. I was using the 0.625m nuclear engines from the Atomic Age mod because they were low-mass and high-I\u003Csub\u003Esp\u003C/sub\u003E\u00A0and they needed to be carried from the surface of Asclepius all the way back to Kerbin. And of course I forgot the radiators, so during maneuvers I had three extremely-hot nuclear engines only a meter away from my lonely scientist.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBeneath the nuclear return stage was a chemical ascent stage, and beneath that was the descent stage. This was a bulbous 2.5m extension to the vehicle, and it had to be 2.5m because it included a service bay which was stuffed full of every science experiment DMagic (and stock, of course) had to offer. Parachutes were also on this stage, which meant an...interesting descent.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe interplanetary stage was a nuclear one, 2.5m diameter with a nuclear engine beneath (once again, without radiators). It was massively overkill and I had to get rid of it once I reached Asclepius. And I don\u0027t remember much of the launch vehicle, but knowing my engineering methods at the time it probably consisted of an orange tank with a Skipper engine surrounded by six more orange tanks with Skipper engines (my Mun rockets were just shorter versions of this with a couple less orange tanks, but I didn\u0027t deviate much from that style back then).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen the time came for the interplanetary transfer, I luckily had had the sense to look up how to actually\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Edo\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0an interplanetary transfer, but I had no idea how much delta-v it would take so the nuclear transfer stage had about 4 times as much (it was only about 1000m/s to reach Asclepius, even less than for Duna or Eve). After a correction burn (which I had experience with from probably about sixty\u00A0hours of Mun base construction and even more spent on other generic Mun/Minmus missions) and waiting for the arrival at Asclepius, there came the time to circularize and land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOr to quicksave, try about 20 times, and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Efinally\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe thing with Asclepius is that, although it does\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ehave\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0an atmosphere, its atmosphere is only significant deep in the canyons. Initially I didn\u0027t know this. So my rocket, with its tiny nuclear engines on top\u00A0and its disproportionate descent stage and its parachutes\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Eway\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0too close to the center of mass, ended up doing a parachute-assisted suicide burn on the lowest possible point of the highlands (after a lot of attempts) because I\u0027d got onto a sub-orbital trajectory and\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Ethen\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0quicksaved. Aside from the parachutes barely keeping it pointed engine-down, the lander itself had a far too high center of mass so it almost fell over once landed (I think it actually did fall over on a couple of the attempts which didn\u0027t end with an explosion). But my kerbal managed to get out and do the science (luckily I\u0027d had the sense at least to include ladders).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThen it was time for ascent. With less fuel than expected after having to fire the engines on landing, the ascent didn\u0027t look good. Ultimately I had to raise the apoapsis far higher than I should\u0027ve done, and started firing the nuclear engines in-atmosphere. So we have three super-heated nuclear engines only a meter away from the kerbal all firing into an atmosphere of a planet which (if I recall correctly) was said in the science reports to plausibly be home to life. Great. But in the end the mission was a success, even if it did take about 5 years for the lone kerbal to return because Asclepius was so close to Kerbin and though I understood transfer windows I forgot that they have to work both ways. The nuclear engines ended up being dropped directly into Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere at several kilometers per second right before the command pod re-entered.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe \u003Ci\u003Esecond\u003C/i\u003E\u00A0time I visited Asclepius was some time later, after I learned to dock, and I built a massive Mk2 monstrosity that was basically a bunch of fuel for a nuclear engine with a Mk2 cockpit and crew compartment, with a couple of docking ports glued to the sides (there were also a couple of large drop tanks, again for the nuclear engine). This wasn\u0027t a spaceplane, I was still nowhere near being able to make a functional spaceplane, I just wanted to use the Mk2 parts for once. Now I really regret it because the whole thing was a mess. It was so long that the launch vehicle ended up having to be two separate rockets attached to the top and bottom\u00A0with decouplers, and it did\u00A0\u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E\u00A0fly well (it was one of those brute-force launches). I then launched two identical three-kerbal landers, one for Asclepius and another for its moon (the one for the moon was overkill but I couldn\u0027t think of a better way to balance the mass at the time). The one that landed on Asclepius suffered similar issues to the first mission (evidently I hadn\u0027t learned my lesson about the atmosphere, or lack thereof) and barely made it to orbit at all. I had to lower the orbit of the mothership to pick it up. Not a good mission. But at least I got all the science.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MoarBoostersRUS","CreatedById":181916,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-10-08T03:13:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst crazy mission:\u00A0I built a craft with the plasma nozzle from interstellar with the biggest 2.5meter fuel tank full of liquid fuel a generator some radiators and the 3man capsule with Jeb bill and bob in it.

That rocket later got expanded into a rocket series covering payloads ranging from 5 tonnes to 17 tonnes, plus an extra one designed to take 10 tonnes to orbit of either of Kerbin\u0027s moons.
