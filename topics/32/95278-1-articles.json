The key is to make the aircraft as light as possible, with very large wings.

Here\u0027s what I learned about landing on Duna:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- No oxygen so rocket engines are required. I went with nuclear engines because my spaceplane was big and heavy and I used those for interplanetary transit as well, but if you go light then other engines are of course viable as well. I\u0027m not sure about ion engines because they have a REALLY low thrust and gravity losses may be too high, but I\u0027ve never tried so it might work.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- easiest way is to do a tailsitter with chutes and a suicide burn at the last second to slow you down so you don\u0027t break your engine bells on impact. You can tip it over if you want to do a horizontal take-off. Low gravity and high impact tolerance on landing gear means you probably won\u0027t break anything tipping over. This obviously isn\u0027t that different from a \u0022conventional\u0022 powered landing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eif you want to go for a horizontal landing:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- get a TON of lift on you spaceplane. Seriously, whatever you think is enough, double it. More lift means less horizontal speed required to reduce vertical speed. For reference: a plane that does 80 m/s horizontal speed on a safe landing on the runway on Kerbin likely will need to do at least 200-300 m/s on Duna to get the same vertical speed, which obviously is NOT a safe landing speed. I usually take 100-120 m/s horizontal and 5-10 m/s vertical speed as a reference for \u0022safe\u0022 landings. (actually 10 m/s vertical is already a bit much and be aware that if you land on an upwards going slope, the impact will be much harder than what the vertical speed would lead you to believe)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- landing site matters! pick a low landing site. Anything under 3000 meters means a lot thicker atmosphere, which means more lift which will make your life TONS easier. When I did a horizontal landing I went with the flats that are located on the equator next to the large canyon. Landing on the equator also means you can save a couple of hundred delta-V in getting to orbit if you take off facing 90\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 on the navball.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- wingtip gears! Gears on the wingtips means you will be much less likely to clip the ground with your undoubtedly large wings and horribly crash and die.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- protect against tailstrikes. Because of the uneven terrain, tailstrikes are very much a real threat. Usually a few gears near the back will be enough, but be aware that this will make take-off from Kerbin harder. On Duna the low gravity and the large amount of hills means they probably won\u0027t be a real problem on take-off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ethat\u0027s about all that jumps to mind.
