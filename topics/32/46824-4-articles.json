I don\u0027t use the LV-N\u0027s generally until after I\u0027m in orbit. Also, from what I remember when Scott Manley was talking about them, much more than somewhere around 2-4 LVN\u0027s and you start loosing out due to the mass of the engine itself. I\u0027ve used 2 LVN\u0027s when I was testing a kethane miner/lander. It needed very little fuel left in them to land, and I doubt I was using the best landing technique. Not like that is a conclusive test, as I haven\u0027t tried other engines.\u003Cp\u003EI may have to try a test with one of my rockets I have with kOS on it.

As you keep adding fuel mass to the rocket, the mass of the engines and payload (which is fixed) becomes negligible, but the tank mass keeps increasing (proportionally to the fuel mass). So in the high-mass limit the rocket is just fuel and tanks to contain it, and the total-to-dry mass ratio becomes constant, thus resulting in a maximum delta-v value.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor the LV-909, the maximum value is 8406.4 m/s.
