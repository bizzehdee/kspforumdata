The thought behind my creation was to attach several probe bodies with the science canister, batteries, parachutes, and radial decouplers to create removable science vessels that are recoverable. As I fly through the ATMO I capture the science then decouple the experiment and allow them to re-enter atmo with parachutes already deployed. A sort of fire and forget science experiment.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy question to everyone is why doesn\u0027t this work? My probes seem to disappear approx. 1-2 minutes after being separated from my main vessel, leaving zero science goodies to be recovered for great scientific discoveries. Am I doing something wrong?

At your apopapsis, drop your periapsis to ~30km. Decouple one probe immediately after, and then raise your periapsis back to 70\u002Bkm. Now you can switch to your science package for its return! This will avoid any science packages disappearing. It requires a bit more time and fuel... But mostly time. Changing orbit by 80km should take less then 100m/s dV.

When you have a craft with an orbital path that takes it within the atmosphere of any planet (or a certian radius of any airless world) the game assumes that it will be slowed down by drag (or hit something) and be destroyed, parachutes notwithstanding. Thus the wayward craft/debris are summarily deleted. The exception to this is craft that are within 2500m of the craft you are actively controlling. Within that distance the game will start calculating the actual physical forces on the craft rather that making assumptions about what it will do. So as long as you either stay within 2.5km of the \u0027science bombs\u0027 or follow each one down (provided the next one doesn\u0027t enter the atmosphere until the first one touches down) your idea is quite solid.
