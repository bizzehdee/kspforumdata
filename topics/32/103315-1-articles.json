When you want to use up fuel without changing attitude or acceleration then enable these with the action group and run until the tank is at the level you want. It does waste a very small amount of mass but that might not matter if you are talking about a big ship.\n\nWould be even better to use a couple of vernor engines (massless and use regular fuel) but I never figured out how to get two RCS ports to fire in opposite directions at the same time.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T13:58:44Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 01:58  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Foxster**"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-03T14:09:11Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There is a way to do it without resorting to a mod...\n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/noB6BJm.png](http://i.imgur.com/noB6BJm.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E ...\n\nYes, this CAN work. But only when you have both fuel and oxidizer. If you\u0027re missing one you can\u0027t get rid of the other. And it will take time, with those puny engines it will take a lot of time.\n\nIn the rare occasions I need to dump I need to dump now. And now means NOW! Not over a period of 5 minutes. TAC Fuel Balancer can get rid of fuel as rapid as tipping a bucket.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-03T14:12:07Z\u0022 title=\u002204/03/2015 02:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Tex\\_NL**"}]}
