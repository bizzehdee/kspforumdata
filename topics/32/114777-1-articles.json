It sounds like an almost absurd pass-time, but someone with a web-affinity should set up a website where players could log on, pick a star in the Kerbal sky, and nominate a name for it- hopefully somewhat Kerbal-ish. This sounds rather do-able to me, and I hazard to say that a lot of poeple would love to be able to say that they named one of the stars in the Kerbal sky. The name for the star could be determined by \u0022moderator vote\u0022 (to eliminate \u0022Ed\u0027s Pizza\u0022 from nomination), after a certain time period.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes anyone else think this idea has merit, but furthermore, does anyone have the know-how to set such a plan in motion?
