I guess the actual problem is not the video itself, but that they are not allowed to quicksave/quickload.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Aphobius","CreatedById":79391,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-11T17:37:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scotius\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scotius\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFrankly, i do not understand this whole idea. Most efficient transfer - yes. Fastest interplanetary transfer using fancy gravity slingshot - sure, that is interesting. I did couple of launches of rockets that were mostly fuel, with a lot of intricate stages - so i could shed mass immediately and keep accelerating. Goal was to see how fast i could make final stage go after fuel runs out. But whats the point of going to the Mun and back in 10 minutes of real time?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point of going to the Mun and back in 10 minutes is to make you look like a noob, since it can be done in 2 minutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u0027s the point of Formula 1? You have to do things fast in a short amount of time, some people are better, some people are worse, so speedrunning makes a good competition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Speedrunning in kerbal allows for great creativity, but there is a small problem with people being able to copy what you do. For example anyone can copy the procedure from my 2 minutes Mun video. But I\u0027m sure that very few people could have invented that procedure or a better one by themselves. Procedure meaning the design of the ship, the maneuvers, the time warping etc.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-11T17:54:09Z\u0022 title=\u002205/11/2014 05:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 11, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Aphobius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
