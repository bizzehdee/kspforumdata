With previous patches we had squadcasts and many cool preview videos even a week before a release, now we only have those short (very short) feature videos and countdown riddles. It\u0027s like two day before the release and we know very little about the update.

It\u0027s a common pattern with squad\u0027s recent updates, they are moving the media releases much closer to the release point.

Sadly, the person who gave you the contract likes riddles.\n\nThe fourth object you visit is smaller than Minmus.\n\nThe seventh object you visit has an atmosphere.\n\nThe first object you visit is larger than Kerbin.\n\nThe fifth object you visit is a moon smaller than the Mun but larger than Minmus.\n\nThe third and sixth objects you visit are smaller than Vall, but are not moons.\n\nThe second object you visit is the only moon in a different SoI than the first object.\n\nEach object is, at some point in their respective orbits, further from the Sun than the previous one.\n\nWhich objects are you visiting, in what order?\n\nI think I\u0027ve constructed this with only **one** valid solution - but it\u0027s possible I\u0027ve accidentally left more than one way to complete the contract, and I\u0027m curious what people will end up with.\n\nEdit: had to change a couple of items within a few minutes of posting when I realized my list left too many solutions.\n\nEdit 2: making riddles with only one possible solution can be hard.
