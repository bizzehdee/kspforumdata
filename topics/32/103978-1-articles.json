Per the Kerbal Wiki, \u0022The Mun longitude for which Kerbin remains directly above in the sky (at the zenith) is about 47 degrees east\u0022. You can stare at Kerbin all the time.\n\n2) You want someplace easy to come and go. This means equatorial locations are the best.\n\n3) You could use a map ahead of time if you like. This site is awesome: [http://www.kerbalmaps.com/](http://www.kerbalmaps.com/). Use the slope map feature.\n\n4) You could use a mod like ScanSat to scan the body first, then determine a landing location from the map data and your visual surveys.\n\n5) You could send small landing probes to multiple viable locations with bright lights to both examine and mark your landing zone.\n\nSurely there are even more ways to make finding a landing site fun and exciting!"},{"CreatedByName":"Windspren","CreatedById":134441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-12T17:35:16Z","Content":"Make it next to the anomalies.

The reason is, that those locations are easy to reach from Kerbin. Beware when putting your base in a crater, as it might be challenging (or at least: tedious) to drive a rover over a crater wall, and sending out rovers to gather science is imho one of the main purposes of a mun base. (Another thing: If you build rovers for your Mun base, put a claw on them. This will make \u0022docking\u0022 much easier than only having docking ports which might not end up at a usable height if the base isn\u0027t landed on even ground.)"},{"CreatedByName":"Melcom","CreatedById":89393,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-13T09:43:26Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Although harder to reach, having a base at the poles would solve power generation issues.
