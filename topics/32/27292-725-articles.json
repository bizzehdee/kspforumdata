It should have worked. Even distribution of weight on all sides, one 4-way on the top, one 4-way on the bottom. I don\u0027t know why it didn\u0027t work because like you said, I planned ahead and 2 4-ways ought to be enough to perform any docking maneuver. 2 parallel jets on the top and bottom of the craft, performing pitch/translate forward/translate backward, and 2 perpendicular jets on the top and bottom of the craft, performing roll/translate left/translate right. The only thing I can\u0027t do specifically with RCS is yaw rotation, but that can be easily done with my reaction wheels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know all about RCS, that\u0027s why I\u0027m confused. I don\u0027t mess around with planes much, and my landers/rockets generally have 4 radially attached RCS 4-way blocks. I\u0027m not sure if it was a quirk of the game because it was a plane launched from the SPH, or if 2 blocks literally can\u0027t do certain maneuvers with KSP\u0027s user input AI or whatever you\u0027d like to call it. As I said though, I took precautions to make sure the configuration could handle any maneuver I thought I\u0027d need. 2 ought to do it. :[\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf anyone has a clue, could they fill me in?

The station has enough fuel and engines to give it a measly 0.65 m/s^2 when fully fueled, but has enough fuel to take it anywhere in the system and back to Kerbal orbit without refueling. Further, the space station comes equipped with 16 nukes for propulsion, a spare nuke (just in case!), two docking tugs (redundancy and balance!) along with their own dedicated slot, a rendezvous tug (used for moving large payload crafts \u0026gt;50t near the space station from a separate orbit), and a lander/refueling station, which has the capability to land and return to orbit on any body in the Kerbol system (with the exception of Eve!) while hauling 15t of ore.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause this is an all-or-nothing style mission, I decided to take a trip to the Mun and make my first temporary home there. After 12 or so burns to get into a 17km orbit about Mun, I sent down my refueling lander. I need to return about 60k units of fuel - which is a lot! If my math is correct, that\u0027s about 20 trips to and from the station. I should be able to cut back on the amount of trips, though, by filling up the tanks while I am on the surface. Because it doesn\u0027t take much to orbit Mun, I might be able to cut it down to around 5 or so trips.
