Discovering first the VAB biome was by accident (or by design, had only one goo and ship was off balance) because Jeb\u0027s rocket veered off course and head toward the VAB. Should make goo from bad situation so onward for science. I was just expecting to find the usual eva report and surface samples from KSC but , instead the results are from the VAB. So after exploring around KSC, have never bothered before, found all sorts of science. Each building and sub buildings, the crawlerway too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy accident again another of Jeb\u0027s rockets landed on top of the VAB, the EVA and surface sample was now from \u0022The Main VAB building\u0022 . So two biomes for the VAB. Now I am finding even more. There is the R\u0026amp;D, R\u0026amp;D Small Lab, R\u0026amp;D Main building, Tracking Station Building, Tracking Station Dish North. This is going to be growing list as Jeb continues backyard science.
