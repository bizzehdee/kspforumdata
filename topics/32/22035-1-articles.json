I then thought about the FTL system and when it becomes part of the game. (which it will eventually no matter how long it will take) Will there be ships that can hold 100 or 200 Kerbalians as you go to a different system? Maybe you could either colonize or build a giant space station. The awesome ship design I thought of that would go perfect with the FTL system was the Spirit of Fire, from Halo (My opinion only).

KSP is about building and flying rockets in a realistic physics newtonian physics environment. Basic interstellar travel would pretty much be an endgame goal. Once you\u0027ve mastered interstellar flight, you don\u0027t have much else to prove. You\u0027ve pretty much finished the game and you are entering into the realm of sci-fi.

Many ideas sound good at first, but can be dropped because it turns out that they do not fit well in the gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that developing FTL travel would be pretty much the end of the space program. It means that you have a level of technology where you are no longer building and flying rockets. At that level of technology, there is no more challenge in spaceflight and newtonian physics, since you are effectively bending relativity. It becomes a science fiction game about colonization and managing resources or whatever. It is no longer KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"mr_cookie","CreatedById":42048,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T22:37:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EPeople thought that space travel was not possible back then...

I mean yes Squad could do that, but there is so many possibilities for an FTL drive that would require everything you\u0027ve done in KSP beforehand. What if the FTL drive uses a wormhole outside the kerbal solar system you have to travel too? Or maybe it could work like Larry Niven\u0027s hyper drive, which requires the ship to outside of the sun\u0027s gravity well to operate. Maybe the Kerbals discover an alien artifact in the edge of the solar system they have to get to in order to use. There are so many options and ideas for a FTL travel that if squad does decide to implement it they can make it work with the game, at least I think they could. But I agree this would be a long ways off.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CommanderLOL","CreatedById":55382,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T23:21:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can change the font you know.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T23:24:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf it\u0027s that big a deal, I\u0027ll change it, (cracks knuckles) now lets see if I remember how to do this.....\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samstarman5","CreatedById":12469,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-12T23:28:09Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne should consider and read up on all the theories put out towards FTL travel before really giving an affirmative statement on how hard or easy it can be. Isaac Asimov details hyperspace travel quite well in his fiction and nonfiction writings, and many in the science field find it to be a quite solid theory. While it doesn\u0027t have the same mechanics, George Lucas put it to use in his movies, and stated quite clearly in the first movie made that it wasn\u0027t just a flick of the wrist thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has been about learning from the ground up about rocketry and aerospace mechanics. I believe FTL travel will come with its own challenges, and quite possibly present some more with what opens up.
