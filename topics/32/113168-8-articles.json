Why? It looks like Squad will be getting money for very little extra work: Flying Tiger are doing the hard work of porting the game, and Squad will get dosh for licensing the game to them. (Though we don\u0027t know the exact details, so my exact wording may not be legally appropriate.)\n\nThis is only good for KSP. More money means more resources for development. While we can be sure Squad are in a healthy financial state, there is no such thing as too much cash when it comes to the long-term development and support of a game.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E will the pc version get nerfed to conform to console limitations\n\nWhy should it? True, there are companies that are obsessed with a unified look-and-feel for their games across all platforms, but they do the development of ALL ports in-house and a unified look-and-feel simplifies their codebase. Flying Tiger are doing the development for the PS4, and Squad aren\u0027t bound by FT\u0027s decisions about any nerfing. While there is obviously some feedback - especially as regards the switch to Unity 5 - that doesn\u0027t tie Squad to chopping anything off KSP.\n\nEDIT: Worth reading [This Short Q\u0026A](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/344-Kerbal-Space-Program-is-coming-to-PlayStation-4-What-does-that-mean-for-you).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-17T10:23:12Z\u0022 title=\u002206/17/2015 10:23  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by softweir**"},{"CreatedByName":"katateochi","CreatedById":35181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:39:25Z","Content":"well...hmmm...was not expecting this. My first response is a knee-jerk reaction that I\u0027m very concerned because I really don\u0027t like what console gaming has done to PC gaming. BUT (with another cup of tea and some reflection) what I don\u0027t like about the console impact on PC gaming are things like button-mash boss fights and scripted player movements, which actually don\u0027t apply to KSP at all. \n\nI am still concerned that a move towards console support will result in a simpler control set a and overall dumbing down of the game. But so long as the console version doesn\u0027t require that the PC version is altered to fit the console then I\u0027m ok with it. So long as the PC version\u0027s interface is still designed around mouse\u002Bkeyboard and not changed to be a console interface that is then mapped to M\u0026K controls then it should be ok. \n\nMy worry about the game being made simpler is not so much for the flight control (I can see how that would work ok as it is on a controller), I\u0027m more worried about the building interface. I\u0027m struggling to see how the current building interface will be enjoyable on a controller and that worries me that it will get simplified and more constrained. But I\u0027m not a console player (at all) so maybe I\u0027m not seeing how that will work. So long as we can still be as free in craft building as we are now to put things exactly where we want and make utterly insane designs then I\u0027m ok.\n\nSo lets look at the positives. \n\nKSP is has a lot that is still quite broken and lots of work that still needs to be done, bringing in another potential market means more money for Squad (or Deported or whoever holds the leash now) and that means more incentive to continue development. I had been worried that the early access program had possibly already saturated the market and so it wouldn\u0027t be as viable to continue development for as long as we\u0027d like to see, but this changes that.\n\nMore players, more minds to the community is always a good thing.\n\nA more demanding platform and audience. Because of the limitations of console hardware (vs a well spec\u0027d gaming rig) there will be a pressure to improve the game\u0027s performance. The console audience will also be less forgiving of bugs because they won\u0027t have the \u0022just-add-mod\u0022 fixes we have available (as far as I understand it). So there will also be pressure to deal with more of the current issues.\n\nSo, pros and cons, but so long as the PC version isn\u0027t cut down in anyway to fit the console version, then it\u0027s mostly pros.\n\nMy main remaining (slightly resentful) issue is that right now due to the stuttering issues (known GC problem) and very poor performance with craft of 300\u002B parts I\u0027m not enjoying KSP anything like as much as I used to so I\u0027m feeling generally miffed and the annoyed part of me feels how dare they spend time on expanding the client base when the current one still has issues (but the more rational part of me realises that it\u0027s a 3rd party doing the console work so.....carry on)."},{"CreatedByName":"r4pt0r","CreatedById":90471,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:42:17Z","Content":"Between the touchpad and the gyroscope, the PS4 controller could manage I think, given a competent port team.\n\nImagine placing struts or something with this:\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nbXTIQWcBE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"},{"CreatedByName":"worir4","CreatedById":75980,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:44:45Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Between the touchpad and the gyroscope, the PS4 controller could manage I think, given a competent port team.\n\u003E Imagine placing struts or something with this:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/5nbXTIQWcBE?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\nI can imagine the smashed TV screens caused by the frustration of placing parts, i mean i find it difficult sometimes with a mouse."},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T10:50:02Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E It\u0027s just speculation to think that 1.0 was \u0022rushed,\u0022 given their [previous release schedule](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Main_Page) of something new every 4 months or so. Each and every release, early access or the one Beta, players wished for more bug fixing and features and testing. It\u0027s then another leap of speculation that it was \u0022rushed\u0022 because Sony asked for it by a certain date. Sony announces the game should be available next year, I think if Sony was so demanding, it would have been announced today for holiday delivery, not some unspecified date in 2016. A Holiday 2015 release would be the fastest way to build on free advertising, from E3 news reports.\n\nSure it was rushed..
