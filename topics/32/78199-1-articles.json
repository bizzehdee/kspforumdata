It\u0027s certainly a challenge. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did something similar last night. Test the LV-T45 on the ground (not hard) and then a very similar SRB test. Figured I may as well go for the 33,000m altitude test too. So I built a rocket with an LV-T45 powered lower stage, two strap on RT-10s (to get up to speed for the SRB test) and an RT-10 upper stage. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETurns out I should have picked up the \u0027escape from the atmosphere\u0027 contract too... Bob ended up doing an 800km\u002B suborbital hop and probably had enough delta-V to get to orbit (but no way of getting back down). Poor guy pegged the g-meter on the way back down but was still smiling when he climbed out of his capsule. Took the time to collect a bag of sand for science too - Bob\u0027s dedicated like that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Ruthgar","CreatedById":113799,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-22T17:28:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have found jets to be the best for testing at altitudes between 1 and 40 km as you have better control of your speed and altitude.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
