I always looked up at the lights in the night sky and wonder what they looked like up close. We were very poor and we would have never been able to afford a telescope so I stayed with the wonderful pictures. It wasn\u0027t until school started that I realized their were these amazing people called astronauts you were in space and have even been to the moon. My teacher showed the moon landing and I knew I wanted to be an astronaut (and a soldier I was young and public education never really explained why many astronauts were Commanders so I thought the astronauts were soldiers too that\u0027s public education for you). 2 years later I was diagnosed with a degenerative bone disease called Multiple Epiphyseal Dysplasia and after research I found out I would never be able to be an astronaut. A 9 yr old boy whose dreams of being an astronaut soldier were ripped from me. Even today I discovered that I probably wouldn\u0027t even be allowed on a private charter into space because of my disease. I will never go to space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo as a grown 28 yr old man I have spent most of my life living vicariously by playing space games and watching sci-fi films/shows and space documentaries. Moon Tycoon, that I am sure I am the only one who ever played that game, was the closest to a true astronaut simulator. But not until now had I ever felt this close to my long lost childhood dream. When Jebediah Kerman goes into orbit I get a rush. I put it into cockpit mode and blast off looking through the view-port as the blue sky turns a star studded black. Every time Jebediah touches down on the Mun I get back a little piece of that dream that I lost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will admit I had my reservations but playing the demo for 5 minutes and I had to have it. Buying a game is a big deal for me being disabled money isn\u0027t easy to come by I actually blew through the last of that months cash. But this game was so life changing for me and I was so thankful for what it gives me beyond simple entertainment that I had to buy it. Frankly to me this game is priceless I would have paid far more than $40 for it. I am currently mulling over the idea of saving up for an Oculus rift when I discovered that mod for KSP. the game would be absolutely amazing with VR and I would finally be the astronaut soldier from my childhood. It will take months of saving my extra money but I believe it will be worth it. But I digress this isn\u0027t the point of this post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy wish that someone anyone from the development team will read this and know that words cannot express how much this game has improved my life. When I am launching Kerbals into space I don\u0027t notice the crippling pain. I forget that I am trapped in a diseased cage of a body. My doctor has noticed I take less medication and I feel like I am winning my nearly 2 decade battle with depression. I have even gone back to complete college and next semester I will have 2 degrees in the Information Technologies and System Security. You have also inspired me to go for a a degree in Aerospace Engineering and maybe go on to work for NASA.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know many will read this and think its just a game but I think I have proven by now that to me it means so much more and that you never know what little thing that can happen that will not only change your outlook on life but change your life all together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just wanted you the development team of KSP that from the bottom of my heart.
