My interplanetary ships usually have a crew of 3, even though they usually have capacity for much more.

First in a Command Pod Mk1, then when it became available, the lighter Mk1 Lander Can. Explored most of the Kerbol system in that damn can. Must have been lonely on long missions like Eeloo. But while developing heavy landers for Tylo and Eve, I realized I had to mount them securely to the superheavy lifters that carried them to orbit. So I really had to use the Mk1-2 Command Pod, simply because it had a large base so everything fit securely. At that point I had the \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv to spare.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
