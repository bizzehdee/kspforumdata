I did a mission to place a sat in a polar orbit. Next I shot a sat to the Mun, brought it to 14K meter to get some science and flew it to an orbit in the solar system. In order to get some more science I fast forward the game for about a year and I noticed the sat that was in polar orbit flew further away from Kerbin. First I thought it was a graphics glitch because I was in the orbit map view for a long time. But when I returned to the space center it said that the first sat was also in orbit with the sun. This is wrong, the sat doesn\u0027t even has any rockets and/or engines on it. So I guess fast forward the game for a long period breaks orbits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDidn\u0027t find a forum to place this topic, so here it is. Maybe a mod could place it in the right forum.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks in advance\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
