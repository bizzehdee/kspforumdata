On the second flight, I ran out of gas and glided for a good amount of time. It wasn\u0027t on purpose but I think it shed the most light on the issue. I wanted to pull the nose level and hold it there to extend glide time for testing. I was able to pull it up with some difficulty and SAS was able to hold it.

It\u0027s a design problem, stemming from the limited amount of control surfaces on the craft.

I was troubled at first, however I quickly came to realize something: Advanced SAS no longer influences control surfaces on rockets. Combined with the fact that the engine I was using didn\u0027t have gimballing, the only thing attempting to right the large rocket was the gyro-wheels, which couldn\u0027t achieve this due to the fact that the rocket was just too large. However, I added two things that not only made my rocket stable, but more stable than any rocket I\u0027ve ever previously constructed: the first was a reaction wheel (which uses the old standard sas model, look for it in control). This gave the gyro-wheels the extra push needed. The second thing was I added a gimballing engine.

The fact of the matter is, that it\u0027s certainly an improvement over the old system, but it\u0027s indeed different. Like when electric charge was introduced, we had to accommodate in order for old craft to function properly, and the new ASAS system works the same. Sure, it means another part or two, but with these improvements much more reliable craft can be built. I have accommodated and tested all of my aircraft, and even the craft which were too unstable to fly can now be used for endurance flights with ease. That fact alone makes this system a vast improvement.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mulbin","CreatedById":55562,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T16:44:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Endeavour\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Endeavour\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe new ASAS is not an autopilot anymore.
