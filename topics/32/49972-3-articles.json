Apollo 13, with the lander and command module, was a total of approximately 48 tons. And that had to go up on a Saturn V, one of, if not the, heaviest lifting rocket system seen the world over at the time. The payload capacity of a Saturn launch system is ~50 tons to TLI. Players here fairly regularly are lifting much more than 50 tons to FAR further than TLI ranges, though most of the potential delta-V is spent in launch, the orbital portion is minute in comparison.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAerodynamics certainly plays a part as well, as the big, wide lift plates and asparagus systems I have seen *should* have VERY serious issues making gravity turns, meaning that the required delta-V for them increases as they fight gravity directly more than their smaller counterparts. In the real world, this means more difficulties in the launch vehicle, couplings for the payload, and, the all-important budget.
