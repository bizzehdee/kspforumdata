However, if your budget is limited it\u0027ll have to do... KSP will probably run as well on it now with Unity 5, as it ran on top of the line systems back in the days of Unity 4. In other words, it\u0027ll be fine in 95% of all cases. For other games, I can\u0027t really speak.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou\u0027ll need a socket AM3 mainboard. These are no longer being produced nowadays, but there\u0027s still leftovers to be had around 70$-80$ if a cursory look at the market is any indication.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHowever, before you buy anything, pay close attention to the specifics. If you say that you have 32 GB of memory available, then that means that you have either four 8 GB sticks, or two 16 GB sticks. If it\u0027s DDR4, then I\u0027m afraid no AM3 mainboard will support it, but the chances that you have that type of memory is quite low, I\u0027d say. It\u0027s definitely not DDR2, as that doesn\u0027t exist in that size. So it\u0027s most likely DDR3. So for starters, make sure the mainboard you buy supports DDR3, as there are a few DDR2 boards among the crop. Next, make sure that it supports not only DDR3, but also the \u003Cem\u003Esize\u003C/em\u003E of your memory sticks. Back when AM3 was a thing, the largest memory sizes were 2 GB per stick, IIRC. So it\u0027s possible that the memory controller can\u0027t deal with something like a 16 GB stick. Make sure you check this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNext, for a videocard in the 120$ range, you could take a GTX 750 Ti. It\u0027s definitely fast enough for KSP in typical FullHD resolution, and can run two monitors. Most of these don\u0027t need any additional power cables, so they\u0027ll just work regardless of your power supply (which you haven\u0027t mentioned in your list, so I hope it\u0027s included in the case). However, some third party manufacturers add a 6-pin external power socket, to facilitate overclocking. With those, it\u0027s important to remember that even if you don\u0027t plan on overclocking, you MUST provide the cable to such a card. Without one, the system refuses to boot. So if your power supply does not have any 6pin PCI-E connectors, stick to a videocard that doesn\u0027t require one. (It\u0027s doubly important because if your power supply doesn\u0027t have such a connector, chances are greater than 95% that it\u0027s unable to provide that much extra power in the first place.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can get GTX 750 Ti\u0027s with either 1 GB or 2 GB video memory. If the price markup is less than $10, pick the 2 GB variant; otherwise, don\u0027t bother. It\u0027s nice to have, but on a card in that performance class, it\u0027s not that important.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne step up in performance (but also price, of course) would be a GTX 950. Or, if you prefer AMD, comparable cards would be the R7 360 or R7 370. Regardless of which one you pick, always pay attention to whether or not they require external power connectors which your computer may or may not have available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-06-02T07:26:37Z\u0022 title=\u002206/02/2016 07:26  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EJune 2, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Streetwind\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T07:32:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis thread has loads of advice\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130821-anyone-else-recently-build-a-bad-pc-in-reponse-to-upcoming-11/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003Ehttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130821-anyone-else-recently-build-a-bad-pc-in-reponse-to-upcoming-11/\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Teilnehmer","CreatedById":143330,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-06-02T09:37:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe\u00A0 graphics card also matters.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI have an Intel Core i5 3.2 GHz, 8 GB RAM, with no graphics card, and I have some problems with the shaders in 1.1.x.

RAM will be you r main bottleneck, but you can live with 4gb if you dont install LOADS of mods, but you got a bit of room there. Factory graphics is a bit dull, but won\u0027t prevent you from playing, or building complex ships.
