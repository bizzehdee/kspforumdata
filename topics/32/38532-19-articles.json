This is not a \u0022bug\u0022 on some versions etc etc. It\u0027s simply that some people have different expectations as to what the system is. In all the pre-release dev videos I\u0027ve watched it acts exactly as it does in the released version, I just don\u0027t think it was made clear as to how it was going to differ from the original and not enough examples were given. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point being in the dev videos we saw the Ravenspear flying around and locking into position when it was moved DURING ASAS; which it does. However that is flying low in a thick atmosphere with lots of control surfaces. So even the most minute of deflections applies lots and lots of torque to the vehicle. In contrast flying the A4 in the upper atmosphere using the liquid rocket motor with ASAS is virtually pointless; human control is far more effective because the ASAS can\u0027t get hold of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest problem is when you are flying craft throttled in a vacuum, even partially. As MANY people have pointed out the system simply does not apply enough of the available torque to combat heading drift. This seems to me to be a symptom of the the fact the new system is \u0022soft\u0022 to counter wobble but now not aggressive enough to tame more demanding craft that require high levels of torque to change heading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason for the mixed feedback is because a lot of people simply don\u0027t come across any problems; especially if you fly balanced and symmetrical craft. In that case ASAS is basically just there for reassurance and helps hold you steady if your making a longer burn and that\u0027s fine. I have not a wink of trouble landing (for example) the Kerbal X lander on the Mun with the new system. The real shame is that complex and ambitious craft are now absolute monsters to fly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI use a VTOL shuttle that can run interplanetary transfers, landings and ascents in a single stage (to duna etc) In 0.20 I used the ASAS on Kerbin to test the balance of the craft watching the flight controls compensate depending on ground speed, fuel distribution and throttle. I then used the information to improve the balance of the craft and eventually ended up with something that I loved and was a joy to fly. This is absolutely impossible with the new system and I think that\u0027s a real shame. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not impossible to make complex usable craft it\u0027s just that it is far more difficult and time consuming. They also require unjustified amounts of attention during more trivial parts of flight. Don\u0027t tell people to \u0022be a better pilot\u0022 or \u0022design better ships\u0022 because they\u0027re annoyed they have to adjust their heading every 5 seconds during a 10 minute burn. ESPECIALLY when the ship obviously has more than enough torque to compensate. If anyone has seen (or indeed played lol) Desert Bus by Penn and Teller then you will understand why this system is NOT good. I can see what the devs were trying to do and I like the idea but it would be a bad move to keep it as it is now and kill a lot of the enjoyment from the game for many people.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boxman","CreatedById":61559,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T14:44:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think I understand this issue more now after watching some of the videos in this thread..
