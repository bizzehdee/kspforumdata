One of my roommates happens to be a Physics major, and he challenged me to park a satellite in one of the Legrange points, if they exist, in the game. After doing a big of snooping, I\\\u0027ve discovered that the physics engine in the game does not allow for the L1 and L2 Legrange points to exist. Is there any plan in place to incorporate this into the game?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Budgie","CreatedById":13840,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-26T04:33:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout the Space Kraken:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GroundHOG-2010\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GroundHOG-2010\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasicly, as you go farther away from the center of kerbin, strange forces act on you ship. Someone has called it the deep space kraken, so the name has stuck. It has been found to be caused by the games physics engine PhysX, which comes apon problems at 9000m/s, so is therefore not deep space at all. PhysX can also be linked to the reason we don\\\u0027t have N point calculations, and therefore no legrange points at L1 and L2, and the transitions between the mun\\\u0027s gravity and kerbins gravity (sudden switch over instead of a smooth transition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI just learned this myself, actually..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SiliconPyro","CreatedById":19734,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-26T04:34:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I\\\u0027m glad you brought this up since this was one of the personal challenges on my list.
