I wanted some input though, what\u0027s a reasonable time limit to give myself to make it fun and challenging. Say for example they are running out of air. I\u0027m not sure of the time it would take to build, launch, orbit, and land. Mission clock stands at approximately 2:15:15, most of which was spent in Kerbin\u0027s orbit, so presumably they were resupplied before heading to Minmus.
