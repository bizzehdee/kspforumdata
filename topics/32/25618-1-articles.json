Since those who have bought KSP before April get any future expansions for free what about if I have ported my game to Steam? How (if at all) will I receive these expansions? Will I be able to get activation keys or is there some other way the devs have in mind? I really hope I can receive these as I have bought the game some time ago, although I have just registered on the forums.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dr. Muttonstache","CreatedById":55896,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-05T23:34:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI messaged Skunky about this a few days ago.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Capt\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Capt\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Dr. Muttonstache\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Dr. Muttonstache\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI\u0027m not sure if you\u0027re the one to ask\u0027 date=\u0027 but screw it, i\u0027m asking anyway.

Also, for those considering purchasing the game, we will maintain this promise for all purchases made until the end of this month (April, 2013).\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd would people who bought it on steam from the start be able to accept this offer?
