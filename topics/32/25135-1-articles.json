However, I have found that interplanetary missions are much easier if I asparagus stage my interplanetary rockets (IE: drop tanks as they empty along the way). So while I have a clean Kerbin for now, my solar SOI is starting to get a noticeable amount of debris in it. What are the chances some of it will come back to Kerbin and have to be cleaned up??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShould I not drop my nuclear rockets when the tank they are attached to runs dry?
