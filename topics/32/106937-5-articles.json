Aero is not ok?\n\nWhat\u0027s your point?\n\nBuilding sea-level supersonic planes is trivial, if you just add enough power and use only the intakes you need for low-altitude flight. The turbojet-powered version of the plane breaks Mach 1 with thrust limiter set to 50%, and reaches 400 m/s with 60%. Spaceplanes probably can\u0027t break the sound barrier at low altitudes, because they\u0027re intended for high-altitude flight.\n\nYou shouldn\u0027t assume that a plane with a certain TWR should be able to reach Mach 1 at sea level. Drag is no longer based on mass, after all. In order to keep accelerating, the plane just needs to have more thrust than drag. If the shape remains the same, a large plane will fly faster than a small plane with the same TWR, because thrust scales by r^3 and drag by r^2."},{"CreatedByName":"delder92663","CreatedById":138576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T15:14:21Z","Content":"I ignore the whining.

The only real data point I\u0027ve seen is that the terminal velocity of a command pod was too high in 1.0, while 1.0.1 brought it closer to reality.\n\nThe plane is actually not that low-lift. My best estimate of the wing area is a bit over 9 m^2, so wing loading is actually lower than for most airliners. With thrust vectoring and reaction wheels disabled, the plane takes off at around 60 m/s, which sounds quite reasonable.\n\nYou TWR figures are also not that meaningful. I just added an extra FL-T800 fuel tank (4.5 tonnes) to the plane, and it still reached 350 m/s at level flight at 500 m with thrust limiter set to 60%.

If yes, then nothing went wrong, because stock aerodynamics don\u0027t even try to work with part clipping.\n- Did the shuttle use reaction wheels instead of relying on aerodynamic attitude control? If yes, a real aircraft might have done something similar with magic attitude control.\n- Would a real aircraft have stalled at such speeds? If yes, then the problem could have been intentional, because Squad wanted to make flying easier.\n- How heavy the shuttle was, how much wing area it had, and how much its fuselage would have contributed to lift? Appearances can be misleading, because aerodynamics are not scale-free, and large planes behave in a different way than similar-looking small planes.\n- Was the problem with the aerodynamics simulation or with misconfigured parts? In particular, there are some indications that aerodynamic-looking parts may have been assigned with too high drag coefficients.\n\nThe problem with safe reentry is simple. Real craft start developing structural failures below 200 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C, while most unprotected KSP parts survive temperatures up to 2000 \u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0C.
