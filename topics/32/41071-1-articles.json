This isn\u0027t a complaint really just a general question as to what causes this game to CTD. It happens a few times a session for me at anytime. In the VAB. ascents, descents, Kerbin surface. But mostly it happens when launching a flight. The game CTD\u0027s when trying to load the craft onto the pad. Yes I use mods and what not and they make it worse, but that\u0027s not what im here to talk about. I want to understand the anatomy of the crash. If I can figure how why its happening I think I can better avoid it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do know this is a 32bit .exe. And that it can only manage about 3gigs(?) of ram. Once the game goes over that via mods ( or any large craft it seems ).. crash. That makes sense, but what doesn\u0027t is why is it random? If this was the case wouldn\u0027t the game crash each time like clockwork? I reload the game and all is well until the next random instance. So whats going on here? The crashes are tolerable for me because I rape the quicksave button, but its a nuisance when performing a landing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECould it maybe be a graphical issue?

It\u0027s happened to me before I upgraded my computer. A good way to try and avoid it is to run the game in compatibility mode and to open task/resource monitor to see if you can reduce the load on RAM. If that doesn\u0027t work, try tuning down your resolution from full to half or even one quarter, that tends to reduce RAM usage by a good 100-300 MB Hope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"FITorion","CreatedById":7606,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-05T04:28:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMods generally...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBesides that could be any number of things.

Basically, on 32 bit windows, the total amount of RAM you\u0027re allowed to use is limited to 4GB minus your Video RAM, because your Video RAM is included in the 4GB limit, which is why people that would configure their system to go past 3GB (the default limit on 32 bit XP was 2gb, but it was possible to go higher with the right flags set) would vary. Some people could get 3.75 GB, some 3.5... Some only 3. Because their Vidcards had 256MB, 512MB, and 1024MB(1GB) respectively of onboard RAM. There ARE other types of memory that can pulled out of the limit as well, but rarer and usually much smaller than the vidram, at least on consumer machines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn \u002764 bit\u0027 this isn\u0027t a problem, because Microsoft allows \u002764 bit\u0027 OSes to use memory addresses larger than 32 bit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is still a 32 bit program, however (the 64 bit builds apparently come out very unstable due to some problem with Unity). But if you\u0027re on a 64 bit version of windows with more than 4GB of RAM, WoW64 (Windows on Windows 64, the Windows component that runs 32 bit programs on 64 bit systems) gives it access to the full 4GB, but only if the program has the \u0027Large Address Aware\u0027 flag set. Otherwise it only gets 2GB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP has the LAA flag set, so it gets up to 4GB.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECrashes can be caused by all sorts of things, but one thing I notice in particular is that KSP really, really doesn\u0027t handle being minimized while running fullscreen very well at all.
