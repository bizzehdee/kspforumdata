Colonization. Let\u0027s admit, that while learning stuff from space is cool and useful, what we\u0027re all really intersted in, in the long-term, is getting to the point where people are born, live, and die in space or outside of Earth/Kerbin. It\u0027s part of that question... what\u0027s next for the human race?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP should cater to that more. It let\u0027s me mine fuel from bodies. It let\u0027s me put Kerbals all over the place... but then what? why are they there? I know there are life-support mods and such, but waht I would really like is to make KSP more of an RPG once you progress to a certain point. Once you initially colonize a world, you should be able to help that colony grow. You would need to build all infastructure at every world you intend to inhabit, and once you have enough to support perminent colonies, have the game actually encourage you to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, contracts like \u0022ferry this loser to that god-forsaken place\u0022 actually make sense. They are colonists, and you are transporting them to their new home. Think about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne major hurdle for this is how many things you have flying around the game. If you build enough to make this a reality, most of our computers would start to suffer greatly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Legendary Emu","CreatedById":71911,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-13T21:08:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m pretty sure colonization is out of the scope of the game.

The resource-extraction stuff is great, and that will keep me busy for a while. But there are other possibilities too. The discussion on colonization on the preceding page is one idea, but I understand that might be outside the scope of KSP, and mods like UKS do address it. A more challenging science mini-game is also partly addressed by mods, but I think there might be room for more innovation in science: e.g., designing science projects the way we design rockets. Another possibility has also been discussed in these forums: more interesting places to explore on planets, and more varied rewards for doing so.
