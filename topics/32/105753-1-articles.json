Neither plane is beautiful, but they both fly near perfectly, apart from the Mk3 having to reach the edge of the runway, before taking off.\n\nBut when in the air, deploying the Mk1, and then trying to play tag with them is quite fun. Heck, if you\u0027re up for a challenge, deploy the Mk1, get it out of the cargo bay, and try and \u0022land\u0022 it back in there!\n\nHow to play this new game:\n\nCraft I used - If you are a pro craft designer, I suggest you make something prettier than this:\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/8vi0wywe5c...hip.craft?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8vi0wywe5c...hip.craft?dl=0)\n\nHow to set up:\n\nTake off as usual (the small engine on the front was just a test, that doesn\u0027t do anything feel free to just deploy it at any point).\n\nWhen you are in the air press 1 to open the cargo bay doors.\n\nPress 2 to ignite the engine of the plane in the middle\n\nRight click on the fuel tank (connected to the mk1 plane in the centre)\n\nStage to release the mk1 plane\n\nSwitch to it, and clear it from the mk3 plane\n\nJust be aware, due to a bug in KSP:\n\nIf you switch back to the mk3 plane, and close the cargo bay with 1\n\nSwitch back to the mk1, the air intakes no longer work... but if you re-open the cargo bay doors, they will work again."}]}
