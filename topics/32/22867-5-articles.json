Oxygen only exists in Earth\u0027s atmosphere because so much of the life on Earth works by liberating Oxygen from Carbon Dioxide to produce sugars as well as a lot of their cellular structure (more carbon to oxygen in a sugar molecule than there is in the 1:2 Carbon Dioxide). Mars has basically no free oxygen because it has reacted with surface minerals oxidizing them and/or bound to carbon in the form of carbon dioxide gas and ice.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the biggest issues is that a planet with no magneto sphere, or an incredibly weak one, would lose all of its water over time. Any atmospheric water (IE water vapor) will eventually be dissasociated because of UV and high energy particle interaction. The Hydrogen will then easily be blow off by solar wind errosion. It isn\u0027t something that happens on the time scale of millenia, more like hundreds of millions of years, but Mars is a Prime example. As is likely Venus. Neither have atmospheric water vapor on any meaningful scale in comparison to the Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA Duna/Mars analog does have a huge advantage in that melting both the CO2 cap and H2O polar caps would liberate significant amounts of gas in to the atmosphere and provide a thick layer of liquid water. IIRC the Mars Northern polar cap, which is mostly water, would be sufficient to cover the entire surface of Mars with about 10 meters of water. Granted, the surface isn\u0027t one level, so you\u0027d end up with a number of oceans and seas. I am not sure the topography results, but I\u0027d wager you\u0027d probably end up with 15-30% of the surface covered in water ranging from shore line to probably a couple of hundred meters deep in places. The CO2 frozen in the polar caps (Southern cap is mostly dry ice, nothern cap has a thin layer of dry ice over it and plenty of dry ice permafrost) I think is sufficient to create something approaching 30% Earth\u0027s sea level atmospheric pressure...enough to not need a pressure suit, though it wouldn\u0027t be breathable. Mix in plenty of CO2 to O2 conversion overtime and the atmosphere would be breathable if the CO2 was reduce to extremely low levels and the O2 was brought up to at least 70-80% of the mixture. You\u0027d probably need to add some pressure buffer gases, nitrogen and such. Probably some cometary bombardment and/or some asteroids and stuff from the outer planets should suffice (plenty of them have lots of amonia and it will dissociate to nitrogen and hydrogen gas given some time close in and warmer).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve/Venus you have to deal with removing about 70 atmospheres worth of pressure as well as possibly reducing insolation of the planet. Duna/Mars with a 30-40% atmosphere with a bit higher component of green house gases than Earth likely would be at a survivable temperature. Colder than Earth, but probably short sleeve weather near the equator in summer time. Winters might be a little brutal. Eve/Venus on the other hand, even with getting atmospheric pressure to 100% Earth normal, you\u0027d have to deal with the fact that it gets hit with twice the light that Earth does. It would probably keep temperatures habitable, but you would not want to live near the Equator. \u0022Arctic\u0022 circle and above probably. In addition if Eve follows Venus in day/night cycle, you also have to spin the planet faster. The long day/night cycle (about 116 Earth days long as it takes about 230 days to orbit and also spin retrograde at a speed of about 210 days per rotation), would mean that things would cook on the day side and freeze on the night side. Right now temperatures are pretty stable across the planet only because of the super thick atmosphere. Have a thin breathable atmosphere and that would not be the case. High speed winds and temperature extremes would be the likely result. You\u0027d probably have to spin the planet up by at least 3-6x faster than it is now to keep from having huge temperature swings.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERemoving that much atmosphere is bad enough, spinning up an entire planet is pretty much in the \u0022beyond science fiction\u0022 realm. Real terraforming, Mars is about our only option in the real Solar system that might actually some day be within our capability short of science fiction. We probably could terraform it using our current or very near term technological capabilities so long as we were willing to put in the time and economic investment to do it. It would likely take a couple of centuries to terraform it to the level of not needing a space suit to walk around outside and probably a couple of millenia to not need some kind of breathing aperatus. It wouldn\u0027t be super comfortable, but there would likely be a large swath of the planet that would be habitable and comfortable. Keeping it habitable super long term would be an issue as solar wind would still blow off hydrogen from disassociated water vapor because of a lack of magnetic field, but it isn\u0027t something future settlers would have to worry about for millions of years and could be replenished through asteroid/comet/ice moon mining and periodic replenishment. I\u0027d wager a guess that there is probably enough water-ice in the solar system to keep the atmosphere of Mars replenished for probably billions of years until the sun goes Red Giant phase and makes the atmosphere content issue moot.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Skyler4856","CreatedById":76452,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T16:05:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E12000DV no thanks I\u0027ll pass\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"chaos_forge","CreatedById":64960,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-30T16:07:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022lazarus1024\u0022 data-cite=\u0022lazarus1024\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIn addition if Eve follows Venus in day/night cycle, you also have to spin the planet faster.
