Makes things easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Docking is great and all, but I would be content with a simple Gemini style docking system. One that lets you rendezvous in orbit, link up, and EVA crew transfer-but I don\u0027t mind if it\u0027s not warp capable yet. Just plain and simple rendezvous and docking that works. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-I don\u0027t want any new planets yet, but I would love to see the existing planets fleshed out. Maybe put some cities on Kerbal (And have them light up at night! It would be so cool to look at the surface of Kerbin speckled with the lights of Kerbmanity). Valleys on Duna. Little islands on Eve and \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe. Maybe even methane gas vents on Minmus and the like. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Something to do when you get to the planets. Like, collect scientific data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Improved EVA. I really wish there could be a little action to stick a flag in the ground, or the ability to have Kerbals set up scientific packages on a planet. Or possibly even to make adjustments on a ship in orbit. For example, you could launch a ship with a certain liquid fuel engine on the orbit stage, but Kerbals could get out of the ship and swap the engine with say, a nuclear engine stored onboard (that would count for part of the weight). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Improved IVA. It would be so much fun to see Jeb float around and eat space food. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Data read-outs similar to those given by Mechjeb. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Some kind of dev supported water landing gear or whatnot. Tosh has a great mod, but with Eve and Lathye, water is now a bigger part of the game. Maybe make it some sort of airbag even(which would be great for Duna Landings as well)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
