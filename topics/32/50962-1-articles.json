I dont mind either - so far I simply tried to make stuff happen and was good with it, but somehow it irked me after reading this and I wondered how Kerbals really are like. If everything is \u0022found lying by the side of the road\u0022, who made it initially? Who came up with the blueprints and mathematical solutions? Rockets made with 50% duct-tape are certainly funny to think of, but once were a wee bit more serious about the matter: That wouldnt work - some serious work is necessary to get our contraptions air- /spaceborne and I dont see how a race capable of reaching space-faring technologylevels is incapable of feeling sad about tragic losses to their ranks - which has to mean they, despite all wonkyness, do try to avoid deathcases and failing Rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll this and more lead me to the following conclusion: Kerbals are an incredibly ingenious race capable of developing new technologies almost on-the-fly. Their only way of coping with the large influx of new developments is by live-testing with often only basic safety-measures. That in turn is only possible thanks to the Kerbals outstanding physical capabilities. They can endure a lot before breaking down and even then have regenerative abilities beyond what a human couldnt even dream of. Maybe that is because they didnt develop from apelike life-forms like we did, but rather had some prehistoric ties to Kerbins Plant-life. That would fit their healthy moss-green skintone. Moss, by the way, can be chopped into the smallest pieces and would still grow back, if the conditions are right.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI envision Kerbals as a genuinely kind-hearted race, being very connected to plants, the sun and living itself. Always diligent and busy they would only have very little \u0022sparetime\u0022, as all the work they do is actually what they enjoy. Furthermore I see them organised in a somewhat caste-like society, where those castes would only mean a field of craftmanship or science, a Kerbal has devoted itself to - not a set of social limits and taboos but more like a job.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow I dont think large Metropoles (like New York) are very Kerbalish - instead I imagine them living in small cities at max, mostly even larger towns only where the Inhabitants are very interconnected. This is a major factor to how the Kerbals can be so efficient in development and (eco-friendly-) industry. Whole towns/cities can sometimes be dedicated to a field of science/craftmanship. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETaking all we have so far we can even draw a picture on how their cities could look - In my Idea they have a lot of plant life (Affection to plants and sunlight) and open roads (which are less in the well sorted manner you see in the US, but more like the old cities in Europe.

Most Kerbal buildings have Cafes (if they have coffee - I vote yes!) or Workshops being open at any time. We \u0027know\u0027 Kerbals are attached to technology and arts and thus they have a lot of such places to meet and dispute (Somewhat alike to what the italian culture was said to be or still may be) Even if a structure doesnt really have a need for anything like that - their architecture would still promote open frontfacades (Reference: \u003Ca href=\u0022https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwan\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwan\u003C/a\u003E) as this is just one of the main features of kerbal architecture mirroring their strong community-spirit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKerbal Cities often dont grow so much in surface-area but rise in height quickly, making them look like a smaller mockup of high-rising cities on earth. Our Kerbals can maintain this buildstyle thanks to their astonishing stamina as that leaves them with a larger pool of resources and possibilities. Bac9s hit on the Kerbal Space Center (which is hands down beautiful \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E ) fits so well I see it as the basic style of Kerbal cities: Strong geometry for the basic shapes, large windows, warm tones and sometimes lots of white, large flat surfaces. What I would finally add is some ornamentic and some decorative additions to the city-builds. Patterns you would often see could be Voronoi and Penrosepatterns as well as Art-deco. How that could exactly look I dont entirely know myself yet, but I know I would like to make some sketches on that, soon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, thats it so far.
