This touches on something that I\u0027ve been thinking about, too, and that I\u0027ve given severely little thought to in the OP of this thread - that \u003Cstrong\u003Eone of the great appeals of the game\u003C/strong\u003E, and one of the ways in which its potential seems, in my opinion, the \u003Cstrong\u003Emost severely neglected\u003C/strong\u003E, is its \u003Cstrong\u003Epotential to educate\u003C/strong\u003E, and the \u003Cstrong\u003Epotential fun that \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ethat\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E is\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first started playing in the early, early days of KSP - back in the first releases when it was a free game - I had \u003Cem\u003Eno idea\u003C/em\u003E how orbits were achieved, or that there was anything such as an optimal flight profile that could be achieved by throttling the engines backward or forward; I had no idea that rockets are supposed to fly east to get the greatest speed boost from their planet\u0027s rotation, if counterclockwise; I had no idea that a rocket\u0027s fuel efficiency could be neatly and easily described by a single number, Isp, and that I could use a simple equation to give me a rough idea of their \u0022range\u0022. \u003Cstrong\u003EI had to learn all of this\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Eit was fun\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe reason I could do any of that and have any of that fun was because the way rockets behaved and behave now in the game is realistic in some way\u003C/strong\u003E - it wasn\u0027t simply a hard game mechanic, like learning to grapple with Dwarf Fortress\u0027s arcane control system. I actually -learned- something! Why shouldn\u0027t this figure into peoples\u0027 considerations of fun?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut at the same time, and to address your point - as the game grows in complexity, it helps \u003Cem\u003Egreatly\u003C/em\u003E to increase the amount of feedback, the amount of instrumentation, the amount of data and analysis the game gives to the player, in order to help them understand and make sense of what\u0027s going on around them. For example, I remember hearing something from HarvesteR along the lines of \u003Cstrong\u003Erefusing to implement\u003C/strong\u003E a delta-V readout or a set of aerodynamics readouts and instruments because \u0022it\u0027s not fun to know everything about your rocket\u0022; but that is \u003Cstrong\u003Enot true\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Enot good gameplay\u003C/strong\u003E. It \u003Cstrong\u003Esimply creates an artificial obstruction for players who want to learn the real physics\u003C/strong\u003E, and \u003Cstrong\u003Emakes the game seem more obtuse and arcane\u003C/strong\u003E to players who are unfamiliar with such concepts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEDIT 2:\u003C/strong\u003E As a further example, take the orbital Map view and all the data that it currently provides. The \u003Cstrong\u003Eorbital map\u003C/strong\u003E provides \u003Cstrong\u003Efairly plentiful information\u003C/strong\u003E on your orbital characteristics, and by doing so, it \u003Cstrong\u003Eallows me to set clear goals for myself\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Eunderstand whether or not my maneuvers have succeeded\u003C/strong\u003E - and by looking at the \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V left, at the inclination and dimensions of my orbit with regards to the planet, the ecliptic, other orbits, and suchlike, \u003Cstrong\u003EI can understand \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Ewhy they did or didn\u0027t succeed\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/em\u003E. If the game didn\u0027t have these readouts, it would not be more fun - it would be infinitely more frustrating. The fact is, I need to know this data anyway if I am going to advance my understanding of the gameplay; you can\u0027t just thrust randomly in space and expect to \u0022hit\u0022 Duna without knowledge of phase angles, much less knowledge of the dimensions of your very \u003Cem\u003Eorbit\u003C/em\u003E. Likewise, I think that providing better, clearer, and more insightful instrumentation and data for all other aspects of the game - \u003Cstrong\u003Esome kind of ruler\u003C/strong\u003E in the vehicle assembly building and spaceplane hanger would be muchly welcomed, for instance - will open up \u003Cem\u003Efar more\u003C/em\u003E opportunities for education and \u003Cstrong\u003Ecreativity\u003C/strong\u003E than denying them to players. It is \u003Cem\u003Einfinitely more enlightening\u003C/em\u003E to be able to see your orbit grow and shrink, and to be able to watch the numbers go up and down for its periapsis, phase angle, and so on, \u003Cstrong\u003Eat the same time\u003C/strong\u003E, than to simply watch a blue curve move around a planet, or even worse to have no orbital display at all.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd it\u0027s not as if people don\u0027t run out of fuel even though they know their rocket\u0027s delta-V, or crash aircraft even though they have all the readouts anyway - people run out fuel all the time in cars IRL that don\u0027t deplete their supply in such unintuitive ways, and people crash test aircraft in real life even though they have plenty of computer data. Knowing and being able to keep track of more or less how much range you can expect out of a car or the flight characteristics of an aircraft does not make driving a car or flying a plane less fun! But not being able to know without running the calculations yourself or installing a mod does make it more frustrating for people who want to be able to learn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt certainly helped me a lot when I started using MechJeb in .17 and I could begin turning to its readouts to learn about phase angles and watch my delta-V fall. So yes - it\u0027s definitely very helpful, very educational, and \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E to play the game with realistic elements for the purposes of \u003Cem\u003Elearning\u003C/em\u003E, and it definitely helps and increases that fun to have bountiful \u003Cem\u003Edata\u003C/em\u003E available on my flights! And if you want a challenge, you can go without the instrumentation - but just because you\u0027ve played it long enough for that to be a challenge doesn\u0027t mean that that\u0027s the only challenge there is, or that\u0027s worth undertaking.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECareer mode as-is currently doesn\u0027t allow a huge amount of room for creativity in terms of the overall shape of a rocket; generally, the most favorable shape you can build a launcher for a low mass and 18 parts in is the shape of a fairly believable pole(s) of varying dimensions, and this seems to be what most people end up building anyway - the kind of shapes you might expect from a real rocket, barring things like lack of nose cones. The main reason people don\u0027t include nosecones is, to my knowledge, that they simply don\u0027t have any use other than aesthetics yet. Aside from that, none of this changes if new aerodynamics are introduced.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOutside of Youtube videos, certain challenges, and the creations of Whackjob and his imitators and people like him, flying bricks if anything have seemed more of a rarity to me than a common feature of Kerbal design among players; KSP\u0027s part-tree construction mechanics and limited stock construction tools and unclear indicators don\u0027t lend themselves very easily to extremely unorthodox contraptions for casual players, and anyway many people seem to prefer sleek or otherwise Believable\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C2\u00A2 aerodynamic shapes for vehicles that are meant to operate in, you know, the \u003Cem\u003Eair\u003C/em\u003E. The undying popularity of the spaceplane SSTO and the space shuttle-esque design, as well as endless Saturn V and Soyuz replicas and generally rod-shaped lifters that litter the Spacecraft Exchange and the add-ons sections attest to this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if you really want to build that rocket of Whackjobian ambition, what\u0027s to say you can\u0027t?

I\u0027m sure any Whackjobians among us would be more than up to the task of designing the lifters that can take the craziest huge monsters up into LKO; half of Whackjob\u0027s own repertoire was monstrously huge launchers of various shapes and sizes anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo again, why is this even considered an issue? Does it have something to do with the devs\u0027 somewhat down-putting statements on realism, in the idea that it fundamentally isn\u0027t \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E but has to be tamed, as opposed to un-realism? It seems to color their announcements with regards to game mechanics, at least.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember that thing HarvesteR said a while back along the lines of how if you wanted to play a perfectly realistic game, you\u0027d go outside. But how many of us can actually reasonably expect to go out and be able to fly a spaceship tomorrow? Very few if any; much as most FIFA players can\u0027t expect to go outside and start a career in pro football tomorrow, or how most Tycoon players can\u0027t expect to go outside and start growing a business to massive proportions; you get the idea. I think it is neither un-fun nor unrealistic to gloss over certain grating parts of the challenge or leave it up to someone else or a background mechanic to take care of; leaders and executives in real life do this all the time, for one. There\u0027s clearly elements of real life that are fun and people want to do, and ways to present them so as to skip over the parts people don\u0027t want to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t deny that there are ways to design a game with certain elements that work better or worse than others, but why continually talk about realism (or believability, if you prefer) as if it\u0027s an elephant in the room? Sure, there are things you might implement that aren\u0027t very fun for many people, but there\u0027s plenty of opportunity for pitfalls if you\u0027re designing a game without a mind to believability, too. I don\u0027t think we should say that, for instance, if I wanted to play a perfectly unrealistic game, I should quit KSP and try lucid dreaming.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn a final note, I\u0027ll reiterate what I think is a pretty great post by Jofwu in the \u0022Should Squad drop backwards compatibility\u0022 thread, which summarizes pretty well what I\u0027m aiming to convey in terms of the relationship between \u0022realism\u0022 and fun:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022jofwu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022jofwu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EThe primary concern seems to be \u0022fun.\u0022 And I think that\u0027s a very noble concern.

Even in real life, not every person in mission control has to worry about every other aspect of a rocket\u0027s systems or its flight plan in order to be able to do their part, operate the controls, and make it work. Everyone splits off some work somewhere; that\u0027s true of any job.

I think of it like a slider with \u0022Fun\u0022 on one end and \u0022Realism\u0022 on the other end. As the slider continues to move towards the \u0022Realism\u0022 end, the amount of \u0022Fun\u0022 decreases. The best example of this is the Grand Theft Auto series of games. GTA San Andreas was a hell of a lot of fun to play with an appropriate amount of realism (driving, flying, shooting, etc). The subsequent games in the series: GTA IV and GTA V are a lot less fun to play because the game designers tried to focus more on making them more realistic and therefore less fun. I don\u0027t want my cousin calling me every 5 minutes to go bowling. I don\u0027t want to hop in a stolen car and have to feather the throttle out of fear the wheels will spin out and send me into a ditch; I just wanna mash the gas and go.

KSP currently has that, although I do believe it is starting to trend more towards realism in the last couple releases. This means the \u0022Fun\u0022 is decreasing as a result of the slider being moved the opposite way.

Because from what I\u0027ve seen the vast majority of active speakers on the forum cry foul when you mention autopilots, for instance, much less realism in general; the consensus seems to be, at least in my experience, that there are elements of real life that are worth putting into a game and make it fun, much as Jofwu iterates in their post.

I think of it like a slider with \u0022Fun\u0022 on one end and \u0022Realism\u0022 on the other end. As the slider continues to move towards the \u0022Realism\u0022 end, the amount of \u0022Fun\u0022 decreases. The best example of this is the Grand Theft Auto series of games. GTA San Andreas was a hell of a lot of fun to play with an appropriate amount of realism (driving, flying, shooting, etc). The subsequent games in the series: GTA IV and GTA V are a lot less fun to play because the game designers tried to focus more on making them more realistic and therefore less fun. I don\u0027t want my cousin calling me every 5 minutes to go bowling. I don\u0027t want to hop in a stolen car and have to feather the throttle out of fear the wheels will spin out and send me into a ditch; I just wanna mash the gas and go. That\u0027s fun. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is a fine balance between \u0022Realism\u0022 and \u0022Fun\u0022. KSP currently has that, although I do believe it is starting to trend more towards realism in the last couple releases. This means the \u0022Fun\u0022 is decreasing as a result of the slider being moved the opposite way. I don\u0027t know how far it can go that way before I no longer find it fun to play, but I hope it doesn\u0027t come to that. Of course, my \u0022Fun\u0022 threshold is going to be different from everyone else. So, I may give up on the game when you still find it fun to play.

I\u0027ve never heard anyone criticize, for instance, Dwarf Fortress for being unrealistic by not forcing players to manually carry out calculations for moving every pint of blood in every artery of every animal in order to advance the wildlife simulation going on around them; it just happens, as is realistic and as is conducive to gameplay.

Now that it\u0027s been years and FAR, Real Solar System and similar mods have long been established and gained popularity, and it\u0027s long been clear that new updates might break saves and old aspects of gameplay that are now obsolete, now there is suddenly a controversy? Why? Over what? It\u0027s not just the realism hardliners who\u0027ve been asking for this, I\u0027m sure; it\u0027s one of those features like multiplayer that people just expect. And it\u0027s clearly not going to destroy any wells of creativity that weren\u0027t already powerful enough to weather changes already.

My opinion is based on my personal experiences with games in general. I personally do see it as simple as a slider between \u0022Fun\u0022 and \u0022Realism\u0022 because my personal experience with games is such that more \u0022realistic\u0022 games are less \u0022fun\u0022 for me to play. I\u0027m not saying that is the case with everyone, or even that it should be. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the case of KSP, as I have seen the game become more \u0022realistic\u0022, it has become less \u0022fun\u0022 for me to play. I still play because my \u0022fun\u0022 threshold is high enough with this game that the \u0022realism\u0022 changes haven\u0027t killed the \u0022fun\u0022 for me. I\u0027m waiting to see how the new aerodynamic changes will affect that. If they changes make it more \u0022realistic\u0022 than I enjoy, then I\u0027ll stop having fun playing this game and will probably stop playing it or just continue playing an older version. But that\u0027s just me. I understand that a lot of people are looking forward to the newer, more realistic stock aerodynamics. But I\u0027m not going to campaign against it just because I don\u0027t think it is necessary (especially since there are several mods for that already). Like I said earlier, a balance needs to be found.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou didn\u0027t touch any nerves; I simply disagree very strongly with your point.

Certain elements of realism at the very least are fundamental to a good gameplay experience; real-life mission controllers wouldn\u0027t want a spacecraft that\u0027s impossible to control, for instance, or on the other hand that requires every last ounce of a person\u0027s concentration to pilot it by hand on the way up, manually turning valves and levers in the rocket to fine-control every last subsystem to the highest possible degree of micromanagement.
