I\u0027ve been building some ships that launch and fly fine for a while, but at some point just start oscillating like crazy. I can turn off the throttle and SAS, but the oscillations still seem to feed on themselves, getting worse and worse, until parts break off the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow granted I couldn\u0027t build ships this long without tons of struts on 0.23.0. When I was playing 0.23.0 I eventually started using the joint reinforcement mod so I wouldn\u0027t have to strut spam so much, but I\u0027ve never encountered such bad feedback with oscillations like this before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: I should mention that this was before struts were unlocked, so I didn\u0027t have them to use, but even so, I\u0027ve never had this kind of feedback with oscillations in previous versions, that I can recall.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-04-05T03:20:30Z\u0022 title=\u002204/05/2014 03:20  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EApril 5, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by lewisd\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xcorps","CreatedById":96531,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-05T03:17:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI got a taste of it, but not to the degree you are.
