After hearing a lot of positive feedback, we partnered with Squad to offer this service starting in March. However the community indicated to us that they wanted some changes that we we have spent the last 6 months working on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are curious of what we are talking about, Das Valdez from Kerbal Space Academy explains what we are doing in this video\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFqS5wR_8Wo?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe have two kinds of products which you can find on our website \u003Ca href=\u0022https://eucl3d.com/games/kerbal\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://eucl3d.com/games/kerbal\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECustomized crafts: These are your custom crafts that you made in Kerbal.
