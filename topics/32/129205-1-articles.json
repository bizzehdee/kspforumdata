I just recently started playing Kerbal. I am seeking to become better at Kerbal, but I just don\u0027t know where to begin. I want to be able to do the math, and really get into it and become quite the Kerbal Nerd, but I just don\u0027t know where i should begin. There are so many tutorials out there, I am a professional photographer, so I don\u0027t have the time to find the path or sift through the many tutorials out there. Can anyone give me some guidance where should I begin and the road I need to go down to be able to achieve this goal. So far all I am doing is simple mode and trial and error kind of not science path. But where I want to get to is, advance mode and beast science and math path.

Can you build stable rockets for example or can you get to orbit reliably? Assuming that you can and that you\u0027re looking for a less trial-and-error way of doing more advanced missions in\u00A0KSP, I can think of a couple of things that might help.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFirst - delta-V. Absolutely key to spaceflight, delta-V is the change in spacecraft velocity needed for any given manoeuvre, whether this be changing orbit or landing on the M\u00FCn. I don\u0027t know the details of how to calculate delta-Vs from scratch but fortunately there are a lot of pre-made delta-V maps out there for KSP. For example, on the KSP \u003Ca href=\u0022http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Cheat_sheet\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ewiki\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLooking at the map, for a basic Apollo 8 style flight around the M\u00FCn, you\u0027ll need a spacecraft capable of the following delta-V:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\n3400 m/s to get to low Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n860 m/s\u00A0to put your spacecraft on a trans-Munar trajectory.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n310 m/s to brake into a low Munar orbit\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n310 m/s to get back out of Munar orbit and into a trans-Kerbin trajectory.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nTotal delta-V required - 4880 m/s. You could probably get away with slightly less - the map does assume a very low Munar orbit which isnt strictly necessary in this case.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe Wiki page also has some useful information about the Rocket Equation which lets you\u00A0calculate how much delta-V your spacecraft is capable of. Now, deriving the equation might be tricky (depending on how good your maths is) but applying it is pretty straightforward provided you can use a scientific calculator (it \u00A0needs to be capable of handling natural logarithms or lns). And the really good news is that you don\u0027t even need to do it by hand, although you certainly can if you want to. Kerbal Engineer Redux (KER) is an extremely helpful add-on for KSP that gives the player a \u003Cem\u003Elot\u003C/em\u003E of useful extra information but at its most basic, it adds a delta-V calculator to the VAB.
