As the longest ship that was still active in my save file, I thought I\u0027d give it a fireworks display to say thank you for the years of zero-G scientific study that it allowed. Of course that meant sending it tumbling into the atmosphere \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/y17J6As.png\u0022 alt=\u0022y17J6As.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ztJBZcd.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ztJBZcd.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dNDicEt.png\u0022 alt=\u0022dNDicEt.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was room for expansion so it wasn\u0027t completely necessary to retire it, but it was already starting to get laggy as I approached if for docking, probably because it was so inefficiently built with many needless parts. It will make way for a station in a more efficient lower orbit (this one orbited at 250km) and will hold much more fuel (I\u0027m thinking 6-8 orange tanks), as it will be the launch platform for many future interplanetary missions. It will also have a counterpart orbiting the Mun and/or Minmus. I have just installed the Kethane mod, so these stations will store the fuel mined on the surface of the moons and regular transports will take the fuel back to the Kerbin orbit station ready to fuel future missions... this is an exciting time for the people of my Kerbal Space Program as they move away from simply exploring the Solar system and focus on harnessing it\u0027s resources \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was originally afraid to install the Kethane mod as it would be replaced in the next update by resources, but hearing that it has been pushed back and could take a few updates to implement I decided to bite the bullet and go for the Kethane mod.

Like you, I\u0027m also in the process of designing and implementing a new orbital friend, as I retired my previous one a few days ago. Mine orbits at about 350k, will hopefully have 2-4 orange tanks, and will serve as a launch station for future missions (I use nuclear engines for all interplanetary missions, no exceptions). Right now, the station can only hold 6 kerbals, but I\u0027m hoping to raise that to 14 this weekend.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust felt the need to rant to a fellow kerbonaut with similar objectives.
