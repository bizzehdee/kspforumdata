Usually they have a size of 20, 30 to 60 GB. But you see, games right now is little more than glorified art graphic with a little bit of programming. For example, take most FPSs today, strip all of it\u0027s graphic and it\u0027s still basically the same storytelling first person shooter/ arcade like counter-strike or half-life (which back then does not reach a price of 60$). What makes games expensive today is mostly because of graphics. Back then during the early years of gaming, people focused more in gameplay than graphic. Today, people seems only care about graphic first and gameplay second. This makes games being expensive since you basically buying a work of art (and even then, developer still aren\u0027t satisfied that you pay for their game, so they had to make DLCs and other shenanigans to make you pay more)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, back to main topic, KSP is a rare game (in terms of today\u0027s gaming trends) where it focused in gameplay than graphic. You had to appreciate the effort put by squad in creating KSP to have such a high replay value. Most game today is storytelling type, with insane graphic. Once the story is done (rarely it lasts for days if you play straight from start to finish), you\u0027re done. In terms of programming, for example, FPS, it\u0027s still basically hitscan programming, used way back during half-life era. Now take a look at KSP, what it lacks in story is compensated by the freedom of creativity, you can even make your own story. The graphic might look outdated, but you also must understand that KSP codes is very resource-intensive since there are many parameters that must be calculated, far more than most typical triple A game codes, while still keeping the game playable. Increasing the graphic quality of KSP DOES makes it extremely beautiful, but also makes the hardware takes a huge hit in terms of performance (as already demonstrated by most KSP graphic enhancement mods). Squad is not a triple A studio, and creating amazing graphic in videogames is VERY expensive. If you are bored with what KSP has to offer, there\u0027s always mods and community\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBack then I started playing KSP 3 years ago after a steam sale that reduce it\u0027s price to around 15$. Considering it\u0027s still cheaper today than most triple A games (which I usually delete after done with the story) and have a huge replay value, I don\u0027t see anything wrong with the price\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"damerell","CreatedById":123074,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-27T14:30:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223251149\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221514044989\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022125662\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Snark\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 23/12/2017 at 4:03 PM, Snark said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSure, the marginal cost is really low.\u00A0 But the \u003Cem\u003E\u003Cu\u003Efixed\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/em\u003E cost of actually producing the game, isn\u0027t.\u00A0 They have to pick a price point that will recoup their production costs, or else there\u0027s no point in producing the game in the first place.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is making the same error again. When one wonders about whether or not to produce a game, of course one plans on a price (well, a series of prices) that will pay for the costs of development, but that\u0027s not where Squad are; the money has been spent and the game has been produced. They do not now have to pick a price that will recover those costs; it is still worth selling the game even at a price that will not recover the costs if the alternative would be to recover even less of them.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThat is not to say I think Squad is in that position! The continued development and current price suggest to me that they think there are plenty of sales left in the game even at this price, and long may it continue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYour example of a game that costs $10 million to produce and that one expects to sell a million copies includes the same error (well, also it seems to think the demand is highly insensitive to price, but let\u0027s take that as read). During development one has to plan to make at least $10 a copy - but even then one can hope to get some copies out the door at $20, and also expect to sell some at $5 - and it is still worth planning to sell those $5 copies once no-one is buying it at $10, even though they don\u0027t amortise their share of the fixed costs.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut once it\u0027s developed, it may turn out to be a flop; it\u0027s worth then selling half a million copies at $5 if that\u0027s what one can get, because having a quarter of the development costs back is better than nothing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe price a game comes out at initially will reflect the intention of making a profit over the fixed costs, but the price it sells at after a while doesn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-27T14:38:30Z\u0022 title=\u002212/27/2017 02:38  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 27, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by damerell\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"maceemiller","CreatedById":130574,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-28T08:00:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot expensive at all.
