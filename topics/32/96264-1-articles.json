Calling something a bug just because it doesn\u0027t perform how you like it does not make it a bug. A flaw in the rocket\u0027s construction, yes. When the stock craft were first introduced in the respective updates, they were actually ideal for the game mechanics at that time. You could actually do a lot with Kerbal X, and it has actually been upgraded a couple of times. However, since the physics got an upgrade with planes in mind, that has changed how stages behave when they are ejected radially. Taking the time to improve Kerbal X yourself to work better falls well within the parameters of the game, and does help you learn a bit more of how a rocket performs. I would actually prefer the stock craft remain flawed as they are, as they are certainly not doing anybody in career or science mode any harm, at least until all the parts get researched so the entire craft can become mission-capable. In sandbox mode you are just tinkering with all the parts anyway, so you would either be in the camp that wants to tinker with the stock ships, or in the camp that doesn\u0027t.

The yellow/black circle is a really awful COM indicator for the side booster. The blue square is the decoupler location.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn part A, the decoupler is below the CoM causing torque in the direction indicated. This is the correct behavior (although in 0.24\u002B, if you\u0027re traveling at high speed, but below the krakenbane system\u0027s activation speed (750m/sec if I recall correctly), the magnitude of this force is insanely high).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn part B, the decoupler is moved up, above the CoM, and yet the torque hasn\u0027t changed direction!

The moment should be around the CoM in the opposite direction.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote also that in real physics, the closer the decoupler is to the CoM, the less torque there will be, until it\u0027s aligned perfectly under the CoM (at which point the torque is zero).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso note that stock aerodynamics are terrible ; most objects generate no torque regardless of orientation in airflow. KSP still does not model non-wing surface area at all.

An empty booster being ejected does not touch the core at any point. If you launch and get up to speed, they suddenly start turning in more and more violently, touching and exploding.

Now it flies for a lot longer (what, about 9x as long?), you can play with the reaction wheels for longer, and there\u0027s a chance the RCS could actually run out before you crash. It\u0027s still sub-orbital and has all the same toys and is just as useless, only it lets you play for a lot longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso... the last thing people need to be learning is to put reaction wheels into tiny ships, given how massively overpowered cockpit reaction wheels are...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"metl","CreatedById":82406,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T03:14:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI put reaction wheels on everything.

Honestly I never considered them lacking for a specific reason, I just assumed whoever built the stock craft sucked at the game, even though he was the one making the game (paradox?) My personal feelings is that they craft should be capable of performing basic feats for those learning the game to be able to use as a reference. I avoided building anything that looked like the X for a long time because I knew it didn\u0027t work. It made learning the game that much more difficult for me because I did not have working examples of how to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish. If the X would have been able to do a Mun landing and return, I would have understood much sooner some of the little nuances of the whole process.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-12T04:58:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022metl\u0022 data-cite=\u0022metl\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI put reaction wheels on everything.
