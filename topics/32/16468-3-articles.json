Naturally, after some photo-ops, I use the EVA pack to fly around the Mun. On my way back to the lander, I realize to my horror that I have had my finger on the throttle for far to long and Jeb splatted onto a slight drop off nearby the lander and died. He would have wanted to go that way...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy next mission involved me designing a Mun-capable rocket with a full, three-man crew. It took far more tries to get it right then the single capsule, but it was finally ready for launch. My new mission: Recover the previous rocket currently landed on the Mun! I had never tried to land close to another rocket on the Mun before, but now was the time to try it. I got far closer than I had though myself possible on a first try, but the stranded rocket was within visual range. However, the area of the Mun that the rocket was stranded on happened to have fallen into night. I gingerly approached the surface and hoped for a good landing spot. As I came down, it became clear that I was about to land at a bad angle....on a suspiciously familiar drop-off. As the lander started to fall over, I realized my RCS was used up trying to keep my hastily designed craft on course early on.....my only hope was to gun the engine and gain enough altitude to reattempt a landing. No luck, the craft had too much momentum to stop the tilt and crashed down the embankment in a glorious fireball. After holding my head in shame, I looked up to see a surprising sight: Three Kerbal thumbnails staring back at me. As the fire and smoke cleared, the only thing left of my lander was the Command Capsule.....not even the parachute on top survived! So what did I do? I hopped one Kerbalnaut out of the capsule, flew him (Gently!) over the embankment and across the short distance to the derelict lander, climbed the ladders to get in, and made a flawless return home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E.....Now, in full KSP fashion, I need to rescue the rest of the rescue crew....\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-08-19T18:54:47Z\u0022 title=\u002208/19/2012 06:54  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 19, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by BlackShadow03\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TheMonster","CreatedById":24609,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-19T21:20:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, this is the first major one I managed to get on camera.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe plan was to just use those outer stages as de-orbitors, then land with(what I call) \u0022the Weakling Engine\u0022.
