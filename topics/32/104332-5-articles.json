No one has reported that this is a feature. It may have been mentioned by Das, but if so only those who watched him know. As far as anyone else knows this is Free IVA and Squad are once again, not just shooting themselves in the foot, but using a shotgun to mangle their entire lower leg by *tweeting* to a mass audience a series of screenshots of 1.1 that *heavily* imply to the average person, who doesn\u0027t know about Free IVA, that this is a stock feature, despite the fact that it has never been mentioned anywhere.\n\nUnless it really is a new feature, which would be pretty crazy to show off via a few tiny screenshots with no other information. So I think either option makes the same amount of sense.

Screenshot sharing starts at 04:35:55. Das stated that he specifically asked Dr. Turkey for permission to share these 1.1 screenshots (slightly before the timestamp I posted). If I combine that with the tweet from Squad themselves, this leads me to believe this is indeed a stock 1.1 feature. If you draw any other conclusions from this, I\u0027d be happy to hear them =)."}]}
