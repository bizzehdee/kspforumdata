The rocket only made it up to about 5000 Meters before I decided to try and save the crew. Adding more parachutes doesn\u0027t seem to help either. In attempting to save the flight again, and see if maybe I just needed more parachute power, I added no less then 4 parachutes to the capsule, making it look like a blistered hideous mockery of itself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAll four ripped off in sync. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far my only living crew on the new version involves a mk1 plane cockpit with two of the small parachutes on it, and a Kerman I coincidently stranded on the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take it I\u0027m going to need to keep the lander stage at all times now just so I can slow down the rockets on rentry?

It was horribly embarrassing really. This was before I realized that we have a new Advanced SAS module for the larger sized parts, so I was using the little one strapped to the top of the capsule and then put the parachutes on that... not the capsule. So yeah, the ASAS module survives every time, what with four parachutes carrying it safely down, especially after losing all the dead weight of the capsule. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was far more derp then I was hoping.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T17:26:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis was happening to me, but with a small RCS tank instead of the ASAS, I even strutted the thing to prevent this to no avail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt turned out that the direction of the strut holding the RCS tank was critical to holding it in place, if you run the strut \u003Cem\u003Efrom\u003C/em\u003E the ASAS or RCS tank to the pod, it\u0027ll fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut if you run the strut from the pod to the RCS tank, it\u0027ll hold, even one strut is enough, you don\u0027t even need one from the tank to the chute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it\u0027s the pods mounting point itself that is to blame here, and as for the strut, I guess the check to see if the joint is overloaded happens before the check to see if the strut holds it on if it\u0027s on the wrong way round.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EndlessWaves","CreatedById":41302,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T17:48:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, parachutes themselves can tear away from their mountings but it\u0027s fair more common for the rest of the rocket to come apart rather than anything to do with the chutes themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MOhon","CreatedById":34115,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-06T17:48:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, the idea is that there is a maximum speed for the opening of the parachute and that they do not break when opened.
