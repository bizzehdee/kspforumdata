I love I love I love I love I love 1.0.\\* ... I think that sums it up.\n\nI\u0027m 800 hundred hours in to KSP, and I love it more than ever... no really, I honestly have 800 hours in a game I spent 20 bucks on... As far as money goes, this team is. I don\u0027t know the words. Awesome would be what the title page of the novel of awesome KSP has been to me, it\u0027s my game of games, all the games I\u0027ve played do seriously not equal the amount of fun and physical time spent played.\n\nTo the point, could we just assume that anything that was inside the fairings is securely mounted to the fairings, many times now I make a ship of awesome and am forced to shrink it down because I cant get it to sit still within the fairings. 800 hours, new stuff aside, I can\u0027t shinanigans this to work. If I could get struts to RELIABLY stick to the fairings that would be great as well.\n\nThank you,\n\nAz"},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T04:20:42Z","Content":"You can strut to fairings?"},{"CreatedByName":"Azuratte","CreatedById":72598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T04:58:02Z","Content":"I\u0027ve tried time and time again, 1 or two may connect, but the rest just shoot off.

Do the strutting(from the lower stage to the fairing-encased upper stage), temporarily detach everything below the fairing so you can complete the fairing, then re-attach the rest of the rocket. Detaching stuff removes the strut colliders, so the fairing can be completed."},{"CreatedByName":"Azuratte","CreatedById":72598,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T05:10:07Z","Content":"ERRRRMAGEERRRRD...

In short, you can\u0027t (normally) connect either end of the strut directly to the fairing shell, as when you try to mouse over it it dodges out of the way; but what you CAN do is place something (anything really, since this is a temporary piece) outside the fairing and then run a strut *through* the fairing. If you did it right, the strut will get \u0022blocked\u0022 by the fairing on its way from the inside to the temporary piece and end up sticking to the fairing shell. You can then remove the temporary piece with no effect on the strut. Interestingly, the strut\u0027s connection will remain intact even after the fairing is \u0022ejected\u0022 until the contents are actually decoupled from the fairing base. This technique also works the other way (outside to inside) for strutting the fairing to the launch vehicle."},{"CreatedByName":"uglyduckling81","CreatedById":129740,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-14T07:44:22Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E I\u0027ve figured it out and may make a tutorial on it if there\u0027s enough interest.
