It will simply overwrite the boot sector with it\u0027s own code (which cannot boot Linux) [i\u0027]without prompting. This will render an existing GRUB/Linux (or any other non-MS OS) setup unbootable until you use a live disk to fix the bootloader.\n\nMy advise is: If you have *any* non-MS OS installed, unplug every drive you don\u0027t want trashed before running the Windows installer. \n\nIt won\u0027t ask to preserve an existing OS, won\u0027t allow you (without some hackery) to install on a secondary drive or non-primary partition, and simply bulldozes anything already on the disk.\n\nBut yeah, a dedicated disk for GNU/Linux is the better plan, assuming you have one available. On a laptop this is obviously not an option.\n\nAlso, what on earth is \u0022format partition to FHS\u0022?\n\nMultiple partitions for GNU/Linux is a good idea: It allows you to put the swap (pagefile in MS land) on it\u0027s own partition so it won\u0027t get fragmented and can be positioned on the fastest part of the platter. \n\nSplitting out /home to it\u0027s own partition allows you to wipe and re-install or upgrade the OS part without touching your personal files and settings. \n\nA partition for /boot is for the same reason MS does it - so that you can still get to the bootloader if your OS partition gets trashed somehow.\n\nNone of these reasons are all that critical anymore, swap won\u0027t get much use if you have 8 or more GB of RAM, and you can use a file like MS does if you want to. \n\nLikewise /boot and /home can be part of / if that\u0027s more convenient for you. FOSS is, in part, about freedom of choice after all.\n\nAs for \u0022make proper partition of HDD for Linux\u0022 all of the above rambling about partitions is largely irrelevant unless you have special needs - the installer will usually handle it all for you.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Linux has to work around sometimes deliberate efforts and more often complete disregard from manufacturers and Microsoft.\n\u003E --8\u003C--\n\nYeah, that. Hardware vendors must always provide support for Windows, as it comes pre-installed on the majority of PCs. 90% of the hardware support in the Linux kernel is, by contrast, developed by the Linux kernel devs with no help at all from the hardware vendor.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Now all we need is someone else to suggest arch\n\nArch is awesome, but it\u0027s also more work to set up and maintain than a Debian or RH based distro due to it\u0027s inherent \u0027rolling release\u0027 bleeding-edgeness.
