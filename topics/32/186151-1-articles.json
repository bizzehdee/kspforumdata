Originally my first idea\u00A0\u00A0was to use it as a penal colony considering its somewhat cheap to access (especially one way) and that it wasn\u2019t littered with remnants of bases/spacecrafts like my other planets.

Since they\u0027re already in orbit that cuts down on delta-V compared to surface mining, and their orbits are much more consistent than near-Kerbin asteroids.
