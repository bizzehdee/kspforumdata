Thanks!]\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt occurred to me that it might be more efficient to send up one rocket with multiple probes than one probe at a time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI created a rig with nine probes on it--one main probe to serve as a communications relay and to operate a rocket-powered orbiter, and eight others clustered in groups of four around the scaffolding connecting the orbiter to the fuel and engine. The cluster probes each have a QBE for heat resistance, with a modicum of solar panels and antennae and instruments, topped with a M16 chute. Perfect for seeding Eve or Laythe with probes! (They might even survive Duna but I have doubts one M16 is enough.) While there is a chance of failure for one or two probes, I could probably get enough probes to survive to make it worthwhile. (And in my test below I found that was the case with a 75% survival rate on Kerbal.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce in orbit around their final destination, the main probe would adjust the orbit to allow for aerobraking. Then, it starts releasing probes, a minute or two at a time to allow for some separation, before readjusting its orbit for stability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore sending these probes half-way across the Kerbol system, I thought I should do a little test closer to home first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I sent up my rocket, put it in an orbital with the periapsis around 50km, deployed the probes, moved the orbiter back to a stable orbit, and waited.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd waited. And waited. Nothing was aerobraking. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI switched focus to one of the probes to see what was going in. Then, and only then, did aerobraking happen, with chute and touchdown coming at the end of the second orbit after focus-switch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe rest of the probes kept orbiting happily, totally ignoring that, technically, they were passing through atmosphere that should have degraded their orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had to switch focus to each of them individually and keep the focus on them to get them to aerobrake and land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf I let aerobraking happen on the first orbit, then switched to another probe, the first probe would continue in the degraded orbit, again as if it weren\u0027t passing through atmosphere each time, until I switched back again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn\u0027t entirely a bad thing, since it allows for better control of when (and by extension where) each probe lands. If the destination isn\u0027t tidally locked, it\u0027s easy to scatter the probes across the world\u0027s surface. Even if it is tidally locked, like in the case of Laythe, I presume that if I\u0027m orbiting it and not Jool then I should be able to pick moments in its orbit around Jool which would be good for keeping the probes separated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s not realistic. In this test I released all the probes only moments apart, hoping at best for a few kilometers of scattering, not having them more or less evenly spaced all around Kerbal. To scatter them better, I anticipated waiting until my orbiter was climbing out of the atmosphere during its sole aerobraking run, then releasing the probes several minutes apart as I traveled the rest of the orbit, with only minutes to readjust the orbit to prevent further aerobraking of the orbiter. But it\u0027s obvious now that it makes no difference--the only difference is in how long I go in-between switching focus between probes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain, I\u0027m sure Squad wasn\u0027t even thinking of scenarios like this when they designed the game. And I\u0027m sure there may be good gameplay reasons not to allow aerobraking for anything except the focused craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut it\u0027s something to think about.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-05-25T16:52:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2014 04:52  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by LitaAlto\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EClarifying comment added.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cirocco","CreatedById":100285,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T16:19:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s not gameplay reasons, but technical ones. Physics calculations are hard on your computer, they take a ton of processing power. Especially for large craft because the game has to calculate physics for each part and then add it all up. So the game takes shortcuts to run more smoothly. For example: anything in timewarp is not subjected to physics, just the orbital mechanics. (exception being physical timewarp, but that only goes up to 4x) Another shortcut is that anythin that is not in focus view or a few kilometers near the point of focus is also not subjected to physics. That is the reason you cannot aerobrake with stuff that isn\u0027t in focus. The game also assumes that anything that is in an atmosphere and below a threshold (I believe 20 km?) has/will crash and will delete it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"undercoveryankee","CreatedById":103505,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-25T16:38:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Cirocco\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Cirocco\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E The game also assumes that anything that is in an atmosphere and below a threshold (I believe 20 km?) has/will crash and will delete it.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe threshold for vessels that are unloaded in atmo to despawn is a pressure of 0.01 atm.
