Anyway, you asked, so here is how I would try to have things in KSP within about a year, skipping anything that the devs have \u003Cstrong\u003Econfirmed\u003C/strong\u003E they are working on:\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Stop making cinematics and put those artists to work on more concrete things in the game, such as fairings and cargo bays, and other awesome parts. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Said artists are also freed up to do things like pretty up the game, like Environmental Visual Enhancements does. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Said artists could also be creating other Kerbin-side assets, like more airstrips and launch sites. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Said artists could also polish up the stock planets and finish the biome maps. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Said artists could add a bunch more objects/planets to the solar system in order to make it really come alive. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E This game is crap as a teaching tool even though it is vaunted as such. We need more realism. Therefore:\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Fix the aerodynamics immediately. The stock implementation is completely unintuitive and offers the new player no experience whatsoever they can draw upon. This would also solve the problem of people calling a launch in KSP a \u0022gravity turn\u0022 when it is clearly not. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Fix rocket engines such that isp affects thrust, not fuel consumption. It\u0027s backwards and teaches players the wrong thing. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Fix jet engines so that they work in a realistic manner. ferram4 has gone on at length about this in other places. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Fix the solar system so it has a realistic size (Note: Keep the Kerbin system, it fits the Kerbals just fine, and I like Kerbals!) One way to make it friendlier to newer players is to have Kerbin as a realistic planet with a gravity of 0.75 G. Using realistic engines and part masses would make launches from such a Kerbin a breeze, and pretty quick, while retaining a fairly decent payload fraction. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add proper reentry heating and effects that really mean something. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add life support. It perfectly illustrates the difficulties involved in space flight, just like reentry heating. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Add axial tilt to planets. Give Kerbin a mild tilt, enough to make launches from other latitudes than the equator mean something. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Utilize the asteroid generation routine to its full potential and add more objects in: KBOs, Jool trojans, comets, an asteroid belt, etc... \u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003E Realistic fuels and such would be awesome, but they\u0027re not really needed (besides, gives us something to mod).

I prefer launching manned from the start as I think that\u0027s the Kerbal Way, but otherwise the tech tree is crap. Others have written volumes on how bad it is, I\u0027m not going to go into detail. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[*] Wrap up all these game modes into a selector of sorts that allows you to choose features you want in your save.
