I thought I was the one arguing from realism, while you were arguing from arbitrary gameplay considerations.\u003Cp\u003EIn theory, a jet engine burning magnesium with CO2 might be possible. There are still a million obstacles to overcome before we have a working engine, and it\u0027s entirely possible that the engine won\u0027t be practical. Even if we get a practical engine, its characteristics would be completely different from a jet engine burning kerosene with oxygen. Hence it makes no sense at all to use the same jet engines to simulate both in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA nuclear ramjet is a nuclear jet engine, so it would probably have a lower TWR than nuclear rocket engines. It\u0027s a ramjet engine, so its stationary TWR would be 0, and it would be useless at low subsonic speeds. It\u0027s an air-cooled nuclear reactor, so the airflow must be high enough or the reactor overheats. It can\u0027t go too fast either, or the airflow will heat the reactor instead of cooling it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is an extremely bad idea. It\u0027s the equivalent of giving kerbals rings of ISP \u002B10 (\u002B20 when hovering). It utterly breaks the suspension of disbelief, making KSP just another bad game with a lot of bugs. It would make even less sense in the sandbox, which is the primary game mode for many of us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf that\u0027s your experience, your missions are probably too similar to each other.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe concept seems just as workable to me as nuclear rockets and we use those without fusing over materials and propellants those things are abstracted in kerbal.

If you already have plans to do that, great! I understand leaving out things like the gold probe core though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Please add a Size 3 reaction wheel and/or probe core. My Size 3 lift rockets are currently hampered by the need to compromise the structure and aerodynamics either putting an undersized core in the stack or radially attaching a little one.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Please add a Size 0 drogue chute. There\u0027s already a Size 0 regular chute, but it breaks at high speed (as do the other normal chutes).

I\u0027d also really like a Mk1 / Size 1 cargo bay of some kind.

It\u0027s all knobbly and it has a big bell and tiny mount.
