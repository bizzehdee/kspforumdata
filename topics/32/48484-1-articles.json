The box contains him on the chair, two spaces for a Kerbal on opposite sides of the chair, one of which has an engine pointing at it. Attach remote control, docking port and SAS to the box, have him get up and tumble the box around randomly for a while. Now lock the box to a dock that will prevent further rotation, or make sure you have a second engine cancelling the torque from the one inside, and fire up the engine. Keep it on long enough to kill a Kerbal in front of it. 50-50 chance of survival, no way to know :-)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lohan2008","CreatedById":80945,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T14:22:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe scenario (also) needs to state that we can not observe the Kerbal inside the box. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; state that the box is sealed and contains a toxic substance that will break within a random amount of time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECorrection: Now we have a Kerbal that\u0027s both dead and alive {but not at the same time}\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnswer: it only \u0022becomes\u0022 a Quantum state once we observe the living or dead Kerbal.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022dead\u0022 Kerbal cannot interact with the \u0022alive\u0022 Kerbal within the same space..\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt is a paradox with no correct answer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-15T14:27:31Z\u0022 title=\u002210/15/2013 02:27  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Lohan2008\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Constans","CreatedById":83915,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-15T14:53:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not totally familiar with all the details of the game engine, but aren\u0027t the active Kerbals always on camera in the bottom right of the screen?
