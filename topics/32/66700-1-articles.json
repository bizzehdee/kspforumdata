But they are merely the product of logical progression in the development of the game. Necessary parts being added and features being polished.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I haven\u0027t mentioned the asteroids until now for a couple of reasons. Of course they are the main reason for the patch, and they seem to have been very well implemented so far. However, the way they work so far (remember, no n-body physics) require some workaround to be able to interact with them, besides crashing into them, that is, and hopefully future science parts to study them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the solution for that has been the Claw.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the idea is to rendezvous a ship/probe with an asteroid and attach yourself to it with the claw. It allows some gimballing, so you can point your thrust across its CoM and not spin around like crazy. From then on, it\u0027s just a part of you ship, and you can alter it\u0027s collision course with Kerbin, put it in orbit and build a station on it, throw it into the sun, make it escape the system or fling it towards Bob.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut you can also grab any other thing with the claw, including kerbals!

Also, parking brake for steep hills, but I don\u0027t know if the clamp will attach to the ground.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-More stable skycrane landings\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome people have said that being able to grab anything will replace docking ports. I can\u0027t see how, docking ports are still very useful to keep your different modules positioned the way you designed them, and maybe in a future only docking ports will alow IVA crew transfers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what would you use the claw for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo be honest, I have had my copy of KSP a bit neglected lately, but it\u0027s always very exciting to wonder about and imagine using the new additions to the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MKI","CreatedById":77241,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-25T08:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree, the claw is the best feature of the new patch beside the under the hood changes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI want to learn more about the \u0022gimbaling\u0022 of the claw more than anything.
