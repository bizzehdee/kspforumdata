Gaming, trivial as it might seem, is actually one of the harder consumer tasks one can do with a computer. Unfortunately, a lot of calculative power does not combine well with a small package. Powerful gaming laptops are hardly portable and portable laptops suffer when it comes to speed. Either way, a laptop is significantly more expensive than a similarly performing desktop computer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the desire is to play only KSP on the laptop, it is wise to check the specific demands KSP puts on the hardware. A processor that is as fast as possible (within budget) on a single core will help a lot. Mind you, this is not purely a GHz comparison, as some chips are capable of doing more work within the same amount of hertz\u0027 (significantly!). As KSP will not use more than two cores (Yes, two, as some stuff is offloaded to a second core. Just the physics are limited to one thread), a dual core computer will probably do. KSP is not graphic intensive, but you will need some video capability. A discrete GPU or APU is preferred over an on-board video chip. Finally, KSP is, as you will probably know, 32-bit. This means it cannot use more than 4 GB of memory. You can probably get away with 4 GB system memory, but having a little extra for Windows and other applications will not hurt. If 8 GB is affordable, why not? AMD APU\u0027s tend to like faster memory, which is something to remember when you happen to opt for one of those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are going to play other games as well, everything changes, as those games have seperate needs and issues. A system that is suitable for KSP will be very suitable for pretty much all every day tasks, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022briansun1\u0022 data-cite=\u0022briansun1\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003Ethe tim thing in haswell isn\u0027t really the problem anymore.... it\u0027s really only on Ivy bridge\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do not agree. The extensive experiments and overclocks done by various experienced overclockers have shown that Haswell proportionally still does not overclock as well as Sandy Bridge. TIM is inherently a less ideal solution than soldering, but it is obvious Intel is more interested in overall power reduction than in high end (and very small scale) performance. I can not say I blame them, as reduced power consumption is wat most of the market demands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-11-05T05:52:19Z\u0022 title=\u002211/05/2013 05:52  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 5, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Camacha\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dudester28","CreatedById":61717,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-08T03:14:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI would like to upgrade my aging computer to increase its performance in ksp and gaming overall.
