As to the Mark 55 Radial engines, take a look at the graphs linked in my sig line. They are from a chart which is based on engine testing I did. You can see that 3 Radial 55s are capable of lifting a total mass of nearly 39 tons to an altitude of over 7200 meters at Kerbin; with half the mass being non-fuel. They lift over half the mass in the same tests as did the Skipper. They carry more mass than the Poodle, to the same altitude. The thrust for 3 of these radials is 360 kn. They really are good not only for launching stages, but for landers. A minimum set up of 3 Radial 55s can act as landing legs too, so the mass and drag and part count of legs is eliminated. Plus the radials do not add to the length of a craft as do inline engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want more thrust on the same stage, just add more engine(s).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pockrtplanesairways","CreatedById":101834,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-12T22:10:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022 data-cite=\u0022The Destroyer\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI would rather use 909s or a poodle.

Even if the main body of the craft were literally an ion engine, a xenon tank, and a probe, it would need so many generator parts that it would still be too heavy for the engine. In fact, the only use I\u0027ve found for it was making rovers before rover wheels were added (and even then it couldn\u0027t climb the smallest hill). I\u0027ve also tried making solar aircraft with them, but I find that most of the power comes from the infiniglide bug to the point where the engine may as well not exist.
