Instead of turning off SAS to gravity turn I left it on and it went rather smooth, no rotation or at least very little. It took more work to get a good orbit going but not too much. Then I noticed SAS didn\u0027t do a bad job of keeping my lander aimed where I needed it to be it actually worked pretty well. Node maneuvers were a little more involved and whatnot but nothing too bad. I couldn\u0027t even get into orbit last night.

Some craft are probably more or less prone to showing the effect given design variations. And then there\u0027s variation in piloting technique. Myself, I noticed I tend to anticipate the need to counter momentum and apply counter thrust early even when I was trying to test it. That habit comes from playing a lot of free rotation 3D space games over the years that require manual stabilization and this lessens the effect of weak SAS somewhat, but that type of piloting shouldn\u0027t be necessary according to the demo videos. Also, it was clearly releasing hold on all axes when it was given an input, when it should really calculate how to project that hold onto the rotated axes allowing you to adjust one dimension (or that\u0027s what described). Depending on the craft that release of controls will affect some a lot more than other under certain flight profiles.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tiron","CreatedById":51836,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T22:52:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022 data-cite=\u0022stupid_chris\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EGlad to know it\u0027s fixed.

It\u0027s still a bit tricky to get the attitude lock set on the precise point where you want it, but because it\u0027s so much snappier and aggressive about holding it, it takes far less time and many fewer adjustments, and it\u0027s actually quite good at staying there once you get it there. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s also much more immediately noticeable when it\u0027s got the lock target set a little bit off and pulls it off, because it\u0027s a much more rapid movement now and happens sooner, so it\u0027s a lot more obvious when you have got it there (or not).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot quite perfect, but I think much more usable now.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-25T22:53:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENow THIS is a SAS.
