Then when I started going backwards until I crashed and realized something was wrong, I built an even BIGGER rocket and attempted to repeat the entire process? Orbital mechanics were consistently lost on me for the first few launches! As the moon continued to move out of my firing line and I would try my hardest to correct, but just never could seem to catch up before running out of fuel. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith a few thousand launches now out of the way, I finally have most concepts at least understood.
