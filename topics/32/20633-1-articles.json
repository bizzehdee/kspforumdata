I got in an orbit around Eve, mapped it with ISA MapSat, then dropped from orbit and parachuted my 3 Kerbal lander to the surface. My first excited Kerbal that I chose to be the lucky first ever Kerbal steps on another planet climbed out of the lander, down the ladder, steps off... and \u003Cstrong\u003Eexplodes\u003C/strong\u003E. WTF? That must have been a glitch or something. Ok. Second Kerbal climbs out, jumps towards the purple ground, \u003Cstrong\u003EPOOF!\u003C/strong\u003E I now have one Kerbal alone in his 3 Kerbal pod afraid to leave. Is this a bug or something? Has this happened to anybody else? My lander doesn\u0027t have engines it\u0027s just a pod with legs and an extended ladder (wasn\u0027t planning a return trip since it\u0027s Eve) so I can\u0027t move it. Is there something wrong with the ground on Eve? Like is it made of purple lava or something? WTF is going on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cocomoe1002","CreatedById":42519,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-28T00:39:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIKR!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut mine is differnt?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think it is a glicht??\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy Kerbals step out and they are half sinked into the ground and then i make them jump and POOF!
