Not really sure why they changed it. Since the science lab demonstrates the ability for two hatches, I can\u0027t see why they cant just have it on the side and then mirror it. Seems easy enough and it\u0027s truer to the original mod, which was pretty damn flawless IMHO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-10-13T00:13:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Basilo1146\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Basilo1146\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI have to do a weird thing with turning the camera and pressing W and D and the same time to get them to go from side ladder to the one built in to the fuselage.
