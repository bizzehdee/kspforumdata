I made it very close on the first try. I got excited when I saw I could slingshot off Ike and save myself some time (since I\u0027m using a nuclear reactor and ion engine, fuel is \u0022free\u0022). However, I quickly learned that one should zoom WAAAY in and closely examine the encounter orbits. My teacher? Hearing my probe slam into Ike instead of harmlessly whizzing by! My second try was much more successful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote about the engine and \u0022free\u0022 fuel - yea, it was hard to get it up there. 300\u002B ton launch vehicle, intermediate stage about 80 tons. The actual probe? 25! Not much on the probe except for the nuclear reactor, ion engine, and battery... but holey smokes that was heavy. Taking off of Kerbin, there\u0027s a spot where I have about 20 seconds before I hit apoapsis while still in a ballistic arc. I catch even about there, and only then start pushing it out ahead of me and gaining orbital velocity. Talk about cutting it close! Not to mention, a single ion engine pushing 25 tons is... slow. Like, really slow. (about 1m/sec \u00C3\u017D\u00E2\u20ACv)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, here are some screenies. I realize the 4x NERVA is quite heavy - but as I can get up there with those tanks half-full, those will get me quickly into solar orbit. They are also used (half their fuel goes there...) on the last stage of my ascent, where they have full efficiency (specific impulse of 1100)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two heavy-lifting stages and SRBs return safely to Kerbin via parachute. The payload nose fairing free-falls back. The nuclear engines nacelles go with me to solar orbit, and are abandoned usually during the mid-course correction to the destination orbital body. The probe does not return (though it does have indefinite delta-V, it\u0027s just slow - I could always drop it into the sun or whatnot I suppose).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know, \u0022eeew MechJeb!
