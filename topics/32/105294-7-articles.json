The new aerodynamics are supposed to be more realistic and shaped based.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell in this case the aerodynamics model is working just fine. It\u0027s the craft that\u0027s broken - more specifically the heatshield. The CoM isn\u0027t where it should be, so the (realistic) aerodynamics are causing it to flip around. Don\u0027t blame the poor aerodynamics for the incredible massless heat shields. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Franklin\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Franklin\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wasn\u0027t even suggesting bugs don\u0027t exist, or that this wasn\u0027t a bug.

Int he center, I had 3 capsules (2 of the starter capsule, and one inline... since that\u0027s all I have unlocked so far, and I wanted a three Kerbal crew), a service module with goo, and other science, and a pair of radial parachutes, and a bunch of batteries, and a materials bay.

I just want to get enough science to get the 90 level unlock to snag solar panels. Then i can do a jet powered rover (got the entry wheels) to spam the KSC for science. At least enough, i hope, to unlock most of the science parts... Though i might aim for larger rockets. This is getting ridiculous, being stuck with only the first tier of liquid parts. Soooo...
