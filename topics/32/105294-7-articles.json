This means a simple, Mercury style flight with a single crew report could possibly lack EC to pop the chute even should to manage to keep the craft centered. Or any non-pilot astronaut cannot ever reenter (say mk1 pods as escape/return pods for a station) since they cannot use SAS. Note that without the heat shield, the mk1 pod (shape of the bottom is the same, BTW) flies as one would expect (blunt side facing prograde).\n\nLook at the graphic above. It is actually close to current KSP pod attitude---but the heating is a simple ray-trace I think, and you can see how the lower side would intersect the nose in that case (blowing the chute or pod itself)."},{"CreatedByName":"ola","CreatedById":82138,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T04:08:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E While I agree there\u0027s plenty of tweaking Squad has on its plate now that 1.0\u0027s released, you guys all saying, \u0022My approaches aren\u0027t working, something must be broken.

What you did was claim the correct response was to consider the behavior correct and learn to play the game that way. You are now pretending that that means the same thing as calmly waiting a bit to expect a fix later, which it emphatically does not.\n\nOne of the reasons for the complaining was precisely BECAUSE the issue was getting marked as \u0022not a bug\u0022 on the forum, which doesn\u0027t sound like anyone should expect it to get fixed any time soon. Thankfully saner heads prevailed, and that fact that it is a bug and not proper behavior is accepted by squad. THAT means it\u0027s okay to chill and wait a bit. Prior to that, it was not.\n\nI don\u0027t mind if the bug takes a while to get fixed, as long as it is \\*recognized\\* as a bug to be fixed, as now finally seems to be the case (precisely because users pointed out to squad what the problem was - in other words, they complained) When there\u0027s not even any plans to fix it ever, because the buggy behavior is being redefined as \u0022correct\u0022, then that\u0027s a problem, and its exactly the reason the complaints were being raised here.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T05:21:50Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 05:21  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Steven Mading**"},{"CreatedByName":"acerola","CreatedById":92738,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T05:13:23Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E A small suggestion to this flipping problem.
