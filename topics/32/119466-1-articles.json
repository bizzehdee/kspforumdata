The list goes on. However, 1.1 will reintroduce 64 bit to windows, taking away many ksp users reasons to switch. So for the people who have already switched to Linux, do you plan on going back after 1.1? Personally, I installed linux to play KSP when it did not work at all on my 2011 macbook air, but after using it for a bit I became accustomed to it and started using it as my daily driver.

When doing the \u0022normal\u0022 daily stuff like surfing, researching, emails, watching videos, etc I don\u0027t feel any negative difference.
