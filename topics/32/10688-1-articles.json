Here is my little monster. I have put many hours into this sucker trying to get everything just right, in the end it was my goal to see how big I could make it and it actually work.\n\nIn my little mission I wanted to create a \u0027moon base\u0027 from stock parts to land my other craft nearby. I like trying to see what I can do with the stock parts to improve my landing and navigation skills. So I build this moonbase launcher and lander, that frankly was borderline not flyable as it was choking out the graphics engine getting somewhere near .5 FPS.\n\nStats :\n\n- 9 Stages -\n\n1 SAS Module\n\n4 RCS Tanks\n\n13 Stack Decouplers\n\n18 Boosters\n\n32 Engines\n\n64 Full Fuel Tanks\n\n19 Half Fuel Tanks\n\n18 Winglets\n\n48 RCS Thrusters\n\n6 Landing Gears\n\nOn Pad\n\n![Pad.PNG](http://www.silvagi.com/images/Pad.PNG)\n\nIn Flight\n\n![stg2.PNG](http://www.silvagi.com/images/stg2.PNG)\n\nMain Stage Sep - \n\nThis is actually a funny side effect. For some reason the ship starts to barrel roll at 20km, but still keeps its course. It makes this stage work perfect as the tanks and engine peel right off. Wish I could say this was by design, but no idea why it does it.\n\n![Sep.PNG](http://www.silvagi.com/images/Sep.PNG)\n\nHeaded to Moon Orbit\n\n![stg4.PNG](http://www.silvagi.com/images/stg4.PNG)\n\nFinal De-Orbit and Descent\n\n![deorb.PNG](http://www.silvagi.com/images/deorb.PNG)\n\n![descent.PNG](http://www.silvagi.com/images/descent.PNG)\n\nLanded!\n\n![landed.PNG](http://www.silvagi.com/images/landed.PNG)\n\nNow that I have finished this, would love to see what everyone else has done with stock parts. I need a new goal to hit!\n\nThanks!"},{"CreatedByName":"K Kap","CreatedById":22416,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T22:32:08Z","Content":"Now get back home"},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-16T23:39:30Z","Content":"Awesome ship, just maybe a little over engineered... ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"SteevyT","CreatedById":6183,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-17T00:05:47Z","Content":"I learned that with very careful throttle control, this could reach orbit.

The outer engines were designed to break off on the pad, they were only used to hold up the outer tanks until liftoff.
