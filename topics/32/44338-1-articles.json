Anyway last week I had to take a trip to my grandparents house not bad I like it there they have a boat and are generally pretty fun, only one problem no ksp. I don\u0027t personally own a laptop and when taking trips I generally use my mom\u0027s but I can only usually use it for 30 minutes to an hour because we either have to do stuff or someone else needs it. Not a big deal a week without playing I should be fine and at first it was alright. One day nothing two days I kinda wished I could play because I checked the forums and saw some cool ideas well day three I went on the forums when I had some free time and started reading a lot of the AAR\u0027s and I got some pretty cool ideas so I decided to type them up so I wouldn\u0027t forget them. So far the forums had been slightly making it easy but not by much and late into day three after typing up those first ideas I decide to elaborate which lead to actual mission planning, sketching up rocket and station designs and laying out the logistics of a Mun base. And then it happened, we decided to visit my other grandparents who live about three or so hour\u0027s from my dad\u0027s parents, there would be no internet so I would now have to go without the forums also. Things were looking dire as I fell into a habit of every time I got free time I\u0027d plan out missions by the end of my eight day trip I had planned out 30 missions involving 110 launches and laid the groundwork for about 15 to 20 future missions. So have you ever had to go without playing for an extended amount of time and what was your experience?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-30T01:43:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EId be lying to myself if I said I don\u0027t think about this game constantly. Yea whenever I go away I simply cant wait to get back and play again. Im always thinking about new ideas. Am I addicted? Yea... several times now ive seen the sun come up from an all night session, but im use to that. Im an avid amature astronomer so it goes hand in hand. Ill often times be playing ksp on my laptop as my telescope takes pictures all night. I check the forums almost constantly on my phone. If you see me looking at my phone..its KSP. Not facebook. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut its like anything. Moderation is key. Sometimes the game aggravates me and I take a good break. But let me ask you this.. did the game feel fresher to you after your trip? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThing is for me I play other games aswell. Im currently playing through Mass Effect again, Elder scrolls, my buddy and I play a lot of Supreme Commander.

I love playing it and love designing missions but if the game begins to feel like its a chore or I run out of ideas I will stop playing for a couple of days, maybe a week or so and play other things.

I get 10 minute break and a half an hour break and the whole time i dont even look away from the phone.
