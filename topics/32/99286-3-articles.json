There were a couple more things that surfaced when looking at \u003Cstrong\u003EReddit\u003C/strong\u003E\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s opinions, most people think there are way too many key bindings to remember, which is true, although there\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s not much we can do about it, since KSP is a complex game with many actions, so I thought of adding a little key binding reminder during flight, sort of what you get in fighting games, just a screen that lets you see the key bindings you currently have assigned in a case sensitive manner, e.g. if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re on EVA you will only see the relevant key bindings for EVA, if you\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re in Map View you will only see what you can do in Map View and so on, in order to prevent a wall of text that won\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t be of much help. The final conclusion we drew from the survey is that some people think the docking UI mode is basically useless, but we still haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t decided what we\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2re going to do about it, other than gather more intel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eunless they will also do a poll on the forums and actually look at it I\u0027m getting bummed, \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Epersonally I find reddit horrible to follow individual posts and their replies (I don\u0027t have an account there and will probably still not use any subscribe feature either way) with its single pool of posts where topics get pushed off the first page before you can see them\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe forum here is at least properly sectioned off so I can ignore parts of it (like introductions, the off-topic section etc.)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AlexinTokyo","CreatedById":104401,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-11T13:02:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can understand using twitter for teasers and quick, off-the-cuff announcements that don\u0027t (necessarily) merit the weight of a full forum post.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMaybe the solution is a thread in \u0022Announcements\u0022 or \u0022The Daily Kerbal\u0022 that gets a post added to it when a Kerbal-related tweet is made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOther than that, it takes no less time or effort to write a Reddit (or wherever) piece than it does to post here, so it should be posted here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EAt the absolute minimum\u003C/em\u003E, if it just \u003Cem\u003Ehas\u003C/em\u003E to be posted on Reddit first, it should be immediately followed up here with either a copy-paste (better IMHO, \u0027cause Reddit makes my eyes bleed) or a link.
