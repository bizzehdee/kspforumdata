It\u0027s a crutch at best for multiplayer to shore up for simplistic design resulting in not much variety, but in single player it\u0027s an invitation for Sod\u0027s Law to set in at the worst possible moments. And don\u0027t think it can\u0027t! Even with the passive randomization the game already employs for certain background things (like the title screen loading messages and the track selection), the current lack of a reducing-list randomizer function over an unrestrained one means that you can get the same few results over and over and over again. And I have, many many many times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Random is a dangerous thing to use. It\u0027s meant to simulate chaos, which as best we can tell is nothing more than a magnitude of order so complex that we can\u0027t make heads or tails of it due to all of the variables involved. KSP already has enough of a complex system that much of the things that can go wrong feel random, and quite frankly, that\u0027s a much better alternative anyway. If random must be used, it should always be restrained somehow, because an unrestrained randomizer can and eventually roll nothing but snake eyes a dozen times in a row.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"aven17","CreatedById":67014,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T15:13:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it would be difficult to have any sort of random failure in KSP and it not be catastrophic since just about any failure will affect your delta v in some way.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nhnifong","CreatedById":12196,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-28T18:19:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KasperVld\u0022 data-cite=\u0022KasperVld\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EOr you have accidently engaged the staging lock (Alt\u002BL)? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E Anyways random catastrophical failures are something the devs say will never be implemented, because all it adds is frutration.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo I thought of that. :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is definitely a problem where decouplers sometimes don\u0027t work. they make a sound, the COM moves, and the lower parts of the ship are no longer clickable, but they are still physically connected. and it\u0027s not just clipping, Ive tested it. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only workaround I know is to take the ship to the vab, remove the offending decoupler and any engine connected to it and all decouplers and engines above it (because they will be affected too) and replace them all from the top down.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lazro","CreatedById":55825,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-29T00:42:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat happens to me all the time.
