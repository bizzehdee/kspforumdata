With some aircraft you can point to a heading and it will keep that heading just like the old SAS. With others however the SAS won\u0027t keep heading you started with but drift to the velocity vector and only maintain a certain attitude once the two meet. Even odder stuff happens when trying inverted flight: most of the time the craft will pitch towards the ground and the SAS will not apply any action to counteract this drift, despite the fact I could easily maintain attitude with some trim.

With SAS on, releasing the pitch control causes the control surface to reset its angle to zero before slowly climbing back to its original angle again.

It initially tries to fine correct it, and brings in more control force gradually as that fails to do anything. This is pretty much how it\u0027s supposed to behave, it just doesn\u0027t work very well on a craft where you need full force to initiate or stop a movement of any significant rate. It seems to take the new SAS system awhile to realize that the small inputs aren\u0027t actually doing anything and go to full power...and then it does the same thing AGAIN when it gets back to where it\u0027s trying to hold. This causes it to bounce back and forth before gradually settling in and stabilizes.
