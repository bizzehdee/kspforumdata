I recently thought I\u0027d put together a simple rocket to go to Mun; no separate CSM/LEM or rendezvous and docking here. Just a basic lander with enough dV to land on Mun and return to Kerbin, on top of a two stage rocket for getting to LKO and a munar insertion stage. Boy oh boy. On launch of the first iteration of my design I thought someone had snuck in to the VAB and replaced all the rocket parts with imitations made of rubber! This thing would have given a bendy bus a run for its money in a \u0027how close to your tail can you get your nose\u0027 competition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a few tweaks and design alterations, I now have a rocket that fulfils the original design brief, and pretty much behaves itself in flight, though I have still had to use rather more struts than I would have liked.

Struts were introduced by Squad as a lazy fix to their wobbling joints problem. This \u0022problem\u0022 was supposedly fixed in latest iterations of the game but like every other problem with the game, obviously not fixed at all. If anything struts are there as a crutch for people with ridiculous designs to somehow get them to fly, not the other way around.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-31T05:32:44Z\u0022 title=\u002205/31/2015 05:32  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by raidernick\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T01:38:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022gogozerg\u0022 data-cite=\u0022gogozerg\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ESpeaking of stock SAS, I always wondered why it was so bad (compared to Mechjeb\u0027s Smart A.S.S.). Wrong impulses, wobbling, stabilization... My conclusion is that Squad do not want efficient assists. But the problem now is we got assists that make the game more difficult with default configuration.\u003Cp\u003EReally? Why would the root part change the simulation?

Everything is branched off of the root part of the craft. So your root part is the command pod up top for instance. Imagine holding a penicil at the tip and trying to control it. Now imagine holding the same pencil at the center and now control it. Much easier and more stable. No splitting of the ship and im not sure what you mean by manual page. With the root part gadget or whatever its called tool in the VAB. After your finished construction flip on the CoM indicator to see where its at. ( will most likely be in the first stage fuel tank so thats the one you want rooted ) Hit the root part button, click on a part next to the part you wish to be the new root then select the part. Now your craft is rooted from the center out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm not sure of the technicalities and forgive me if that explanation is a bit foggy. But it works really well.

If we want to launch anything bigger than sattelites, we basically have to either build pyramids or use struts,... which always gives an odd look to the rockets imo.
