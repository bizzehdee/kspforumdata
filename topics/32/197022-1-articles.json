The point of the video was to show that getting into orbit, performing an ejection burn, and circularizing around the Mun are better than just trying to go straight for the Mun. This is just a question that I see come up pretty regularly, so I thought I would demonstrate both ways so people could see that getting into orbit is the correct way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-09-26T08:03:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223858653\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022197022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221600912894\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022203995\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Vezbot\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 9/24/2020 at 3:01 AM, Vezbot said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaunching straight up to the Moon never works due to the arcing of your orbit compared to the Muns, and the relative velocity will the the orbital velocity of the Mun going on it\u0027s path.

A gravity turn minimises the losses due to gravity and air drag and is a lot more efficient which saves fuel. Likewise, a high angle suicide burn at escape velocity uses more fuel than a low altitude deorbit then a short descent.\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u2019s entirely possible to time a direct ascent to intercept the Mun (as demonstrated in the video) while still having a periapsis below the surface of Kerbin, but it\u2019s a lot less efficient to do so and you\u2019ll save fuel doing it the normal, orbit-y way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
