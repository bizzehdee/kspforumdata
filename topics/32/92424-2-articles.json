If you use separate sheet, you have to update masses by hand after every change.

Personally, I go by the definition that if it is not easy to correctly and repeatedly attain the desired result, then something is hard. Note that this is very different from something being complex. If doing something involves a task that is extremely simple, but needs to be executed a very large amount of times with a 100% accuracy and no room for error, then the overall task is very hard even though it is made up of extremely simple parts (humans very easily make mistakes when performing repetitive tasks).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat is I think the case with calculating delta-V. As slashy stated before, it\u0027s not super complex: once you have your input data, it\u0027s just one logarithmic function and a couple of very simple calculations. Thing is, in order to get the desired input data (wet mass, dry mass, etc), you need to do a LOT of addition of different parts of your ship. That is a very tedious task in which it is extremely easy to make a mistake (I speak from experience. My first Eve return vehicle designs were laughably underpowered because I forgot to add the mass of a part here or there on the final ascent stage). Add to that the complexity that comes in when you start using asparagus or some other more intricate staging, and it becomes (in my experience) best left to mechjeb/KER/other software because said software will do all these calculations for you without error.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course once you go into an atmosphere, delta-V calculations get very complex very quickly. We\u0027re talking differential equations if you want to be accurate over a full ascent profile in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein short: are Delta-V calculations too complex to do by hand? Not if you got the hang of it and have all the needed input data. Is it difficult to reliably achieve a high degree of accuracy when done by hand? Yeah, pretty much.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs with all things in this game: play however you prefer and don\u0027t feel a single bit bad if other people do it differently.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"J.Random","CreatedById":63332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-10T10:52:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GoSlash27\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhy does everybody keep saying that?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWho exactly is this Everybody you\u0027re talking about?
