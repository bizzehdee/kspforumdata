This is because SQUAD isn\u0027t a console developer and has to contract out to another company to release things on console, and they\u0027ll only hand updates over to that company once they\u0027re stable on PC. In addition, anything released on consoles has to go through a lengthy certification process. 1.11 will release on consoles as soon as all of that is done, but considering how long it takes you might see 1.11 content bundled in with 1.12 or even 1.13 content by the time that happens.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
