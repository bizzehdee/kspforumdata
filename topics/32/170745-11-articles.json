I\u00A0probably could have recovered the roll if I\u0027d had reaction wheels. A lack of reaction wheels on that rover limited my driving speed to about\u00A015m/s too so that 5 hours of science collection was quite painful. I can safely travel at least\u00A05 times\u00A0as fast with reaction wheels...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222019-01-05T20:59:03Z\u0022 title=\u002201/05/2019 08:59  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00225 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 5, 2019\u003C/time\u003E by TanDeeJay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EFix typo\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaverickSawyer","CreatedById":11952,"CreatedDateTime":"2019-01-06T08:19:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOkay, got a great one for y\u0027all, in celebration of this being picked as Thread of the Year for 2018...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve always loved Tweakable Everything, as it allows me to do things like throttle back the EVA pack thrusters on the fly for precise handling while in space, set my docking ports to have almost no \u0022magnetic\u0022 pull and no ejection force, fine tune the reaction wheel strength, stuff like that.

Clean everything except for the Squad and SquadExpansion folders out of GameData, update the game, start installing stuff, and, well, Tweakable Everything... wasn\u0027t. Matter of fact, It was causing all sorts of grief. I found this odd, due to the fact that pretty much every other plugin wasn\u0027t doing anything out of the ordinary.
