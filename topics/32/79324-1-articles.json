I know there\u0027s a thread on how your build styles may have changed, but I\u0027m curious as to whether people think Asparagus usage in particular is changing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs a point of anecdotal reference, I started a new career in 0.24, and just got it to the point that I\u0027m getting ready to hit Duna and Eve (one-way probe to the latter), and have most of the tech tree unlocked, with only landing on each of Kerbin\u0027s moons once (with some biome hopping on Minmus).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been building my mid-stages to be recoverable, but unless you go full SSTO, of course the lower stages are just easier to design to be disposable. With SRBs being cheaper, even in the quantities needed, I\u0027ve been using those mostly for the first (and sometimes second) stages. However the lack of throttle and gimbal control makes them \u0022less fun\u0022. So I\u0027m considering going back to full asparagus and just eat the additional cost, since the money is rolling in faster than I\u0027m spending it anyway. The cost difference doesn\u0027t seem that huge anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat has your experience been with different (non- SSTO/spaceplane) lifters in the new cost structure? How has that influenced your preferences?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs an example, here\u0027s my Duna concept below (with a plan to land on Ike too). The SRBs fire in two stages, an outer ring of 16, then an inner bundle of 9, both of which are disposable. Everything above that is recoverable. The mid-stage is intentionally a little over-designed, because reasons. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://www.necrobones.net/screenshots/KSP/KSP%202014-07-24%2009-55-30-12.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022KSP%202014-07-24%2009-55-30-12.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-07-24T14:11:29Z\u0022 title=\u002207/24/2014 02:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJuly 24, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by NecroBones\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NecroBones","CreatedById":105424,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-24T14:01:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAs another example of something I built, that I never would have done before budgets, is this test rig for testing a bunch of engines in orbit.

I also try to reduce the use of disposal containers, although I accept that it\u0027s needed sometimes. (For personal challenge, my rule was I needed to \u0022recover\u0022 a test stage/booster in career mode at least once, and then I can consider all other events as succesful de-orbits and be allowed to not manually de-orbit them properly on future missions). One challenge I am running into, however, is the fact i use Kerbal Interstellar, which is reasonably balanced for cost at the start, but the more exotic propulsion systems are exorbitant (as they should be). I nearly always VTOL my fission/fusion/AP-drive equipped craft, but those lost percentage points add up in lost cost recovery.

I\u0027m just describing my challenges to fund and fuel antiproton-powered fusion engines using the new system (lol!!), and it\u0027s fun as hell. One future I\u0027d hope to see would be some procedural generation stuff which can scan mod part lists for cool things to test, but I know nothing of programming and have no expectations otherwise. Yay for 64 bit!!)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-25T20:31:29Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022LethalDose\u0022 data-cite=\u0022LethalDose\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E...I meant \u0022large\u0022 as in rockets fat, wide diameters and short heights. IMO, rockets qualify as ugly if they look more like pancakes instead of, well, actual rockets. We\u0027re also looking at different definitions of \u0022efficient\u0022 now. Asparagus staging may be efficient in terms of payload fraction, but it looks like it\u0027s economic efficiency in terms of expense to put a ton of payload into LKO is pretty poor...\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHo hum, same argument, same response -\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAsparagus:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imgur.com/tTTCrfn.png\u0022 alt=\u0022tTTCrfn.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only difference between parallel and asparagus is the fuel lines and you can\u0027t really see them. Therefore, if parallel isn\u0027t necessarily ugly neither is asparagus. In contrast, if parallel IS ugly, then asparagus isn\u0027t what\u0027s making the vehicle ugly. Either way, the ugliness does not derive from asparagus staging. Hence, it is wrong to say, as have many other people who haven\u0027t thought about it, \u0022asparagus is ugly\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you want to say \u0022any rocket that isn\u0027t a single stack is ugly\u0022 then that\u0027s an entirely different matter - and still nothing to do with asparagus.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes; I was talking about asparagus staging\u0027s mass ratio as \u0027efficiency\u0027 because that\u0027s what dictates how large or small the rocket has to be. Defining \u0027large\u0027 as short and wide is a novel usage which seems a bit Humpty-Dumpty but we\u0027ll let that go. This whole thread is about whether asparagus is cost-effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck with the dissertation - what\u0027s it on?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
