For me at least, it\u0027s something I will play around with a few times to see the effects and then go back to running a space program. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m all that great a player but my stuff rarely blows up or goes out of control anymore, certainly not in such a way that it would hit a KSC building. So I guess I\u0027m one of the players MaxMaps was referring to that would rarely see this feature.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a bit surprising that the launchpad and especially the runway are destructible, those sort of structures are build specifically to withstand incredible punishment. I hope that the damage resistance values for those structures are set appropriately.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for it being a side effect of the big art project for 0.26, I\u0027m guessing that we\u0027re getting a lot more buildings around Kerbin which is nice from an aesthetic perspective I guess (though if we get more launch sites that would be fantastic). I suppose it has implications for multiplayer, many of the players most interested in multiplayer seem to want to blow up each other\u0027s stuff and I guess destructible buildings would be a part of that. I\u0027m not really into deliberately blowing things up, either mine or others\u0027, so that\u0027s not really a hit for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that does concern me is that Kerbal Space Program seems to be turning into Kerbin Space Program. All the focus seems is on improving things in and around the Kerbin system while the rest of the solar system is left stagnant. Maybe the data indicates that most players don\u0027t leave the Kerbin system so that would be the place to spend development resources, but that is backwards in my mind. It would be better to improve the other planets and add tools to make transfers to them more accessible to encourage players to get out and explore them rather than puttering around Kerbin, to my mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I\u0027m still looking forward to the other features coming in 0.25 that are more relevant to my playstyle, so I\u0027m not trying to rain on the 0.25 hype parade or anything.

Then it just delays developing. But I am sure that building crash models and animation have taken hundreds if not thousands of workhours and it is very little thing in game. Bang for the buck is ridiculously low. And they say that it is base work for something bigger, so it seems that they have no intention to develop interesting parts of game in the near future. I fear now really, that their \u0022large artistic project\u0022 will be some stupid KSC bling bling instead of desperately needed complete overhaul of planets. I can not imagine any interesting feature in space traveling game which needs building crashes. Game have already collision detection and to all gameplay purposes some kind of information \u0022Object A hit building B. Damage: 45 % Rebuild cost: 50000 money.\u0022 is enough. It would have been work of one day.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI could understand it better, if it was last polish to almost ready game, but now there is huge amount of much more important basic work to do. Most planets have very simple graphics and topography. Aerodynamic model is awful. Orbital predictions are inaccurate. And there are tens of minor issues in alpha phase, which are in same category as realistic building damage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-27T13:30:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hannu\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Hannu\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI am very disappointed. Next step will probably be to remove 1/r^2-gravity and replace interplanetary transports to arcade cave flying mechanics including asteroid fields, black holes etc. fancy stuff, maybe even weapons and enemies, and of course very spectacular visual effects. Unfortunately KSP is now developed to direction less interesting to me, although I understand that childish building crashing with pretentious explosion effects will sell much more than nerdy celestial mechanics. On the other hand, I wonder what new KSP or any other game can add to that genre which million old games do not have. Small company can never compete against large mass products with budgets of millions of dollars in visual and artistic things.\u003Cp\u003EOf course, it was self evident from start, that when this kind of game will be more popular it changes more to easy mass entertainment. And I have to say, that this game has given me more fun and interest than any other game ever.
