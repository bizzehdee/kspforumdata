I\u0027d be happy with a first step just the animation to scoop up some regolith or pickup a rock action and put it in sample bag and then in your pack/belt. Later it would be neat if you could actually do something with it, like identify what material it was made out of (maybe by returning it to your ship and putting it in a rock identifier science instrument or something).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"AmpsterMan","CreatedById":32671,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T16:20:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAbout the flag:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only does it add a visceral experience and finality to landing on the other bodies, it also has a practical value.
