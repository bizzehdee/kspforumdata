Bill, Bob, and Jeb Kerman never show up in my flight roster. And that\u0027s too bad because I miss the guys. I currently have my game registered on two computers. On one of them, they show up fairly regularly. On the other, they don\u0027t show up at all. Help would be much appreciated.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-09T23:33:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHi kaljar, you can get them back if you delete your persistence file, it will reset them to \u0022Alive\u0022, or you can edit the file and set their State to zero, so they are eligible for re-selection as crew \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust don\u0027t use wordpad, it\u0027ll mangle the file.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elven_sword","CreatedById":16427,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T00:09:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you\u0027re on a mac, TextEdit works fine too.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"A Fat Pokemon","CreatedById":29245,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-10T01:22:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you do this, could you also post the text for the 3 kerbs, their stats..
