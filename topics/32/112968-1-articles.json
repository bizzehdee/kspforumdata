I was pretty annoyed restarting KSP all the time (especially recently when I\u0027m getting more and more mods and it loads more and more slowly while it happens more and more often) until yesterday I found that I can go to debug menu and free up all the input locks without restarting KSP (yes I do want to advertise this workaround in case someone also suffers from it, sounds like a new feature in the debug menu).\n\nBut regardless, I heard this bug is [already fixed](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106407-Game-Starts-In-Odd-View), but apparently not for my case? Do people experience the same problem, or it\u0027s just me? If it\u0027s a problem from mod, how do I figure out which one is suspicious (binary search is not going to work as the problem is not deterministic)?\n\n(I guess it doesn\u0027t qualify to be posted in support forum because I\u0027m just asking for opinions not support cases, or not?)"},{"CreatedByName":"Joonatan1998","CreatedById":97636,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T22:22:19Z","Content":"Clearly not fixed, I often get that bug."},{"CreatedByName":"T.A.P.O.R.","CreatedById":137748,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T08:22:42Z","Content":"I get it every handful of boots to ksp."},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T22:55:55Z","Content":"Wow, I thought I was the only one!
