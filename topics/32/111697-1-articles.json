Then click on the button called \u0022Activate navigation.\u0022 This adds a marker on your navball in the direction of the site. I may be hard to see as it is the same color as on the map view marker. Travel towards the marker until a message like \u0022Entering Lagerdine\u0027s Gap Alpha\u0022 appears on your screen. Pay attention while travelling as the message is only visible for a few seconds. Stop, take the EVA report and you have completed the objective. Do the same with the other site and you have completed the contract. You should still recover or transmit the reports for the science points, but the contracts don\u0027t require that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T06:44:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EJust install Waypoint Manager, and you\u0027ll soon forget that there were some navigation problems in stock.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"georgTF","CreatedById":57397,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-02T09:59:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEasy with a rover or plane. Not so easy with landers. What i do, is try to use the craft\u0027s navball to guess which direction i should walk/jetpack in by tilting the craft in the direction of the marker. Then EVA in that direction and hope to enter the area. Some areas are viciously tight though. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving learned how tricky those contracts can be, i try to remember not to try them without plenty of extra fuel for navigation/errors or without a rover.
