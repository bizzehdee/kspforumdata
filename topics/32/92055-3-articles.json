With that in mind, the artificial part limit seems less like an arbitrary roadblock, and more like a way to simulate early engineering hurdles that discouraged convoluted ship designs. Think: did early space ships have tons of RCS thrusters, gadgets, solar panels, storage modules, boosters, etc.? No, because the engineers of the time were more interested in keeping everything manageable and streamlined for their specific needs. Using a general part limit allows players a degree of freedom while still somewhat holding them to the constraints of early rocket design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd, of course, the launchpad already has a mass limit, so a part limit for the VAB makes a lot of sense from a \u0022cohesive design\u0022 standpoint.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-12-06T17:32:44Z\u0022 title=\u002212/06/2014 05:32  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 6, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by Sasquatch_Punter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rune","CreatedById":52690,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T17:38:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have jumped the last few pages, but I really think I have to comment something. See, I happen to really like the new way kerbal experience is implemented. A lot. All those restrictions are awesomely thought out! So let me explain why I think that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, people are freaking out at the thought of playing without SAS and orbital lines, maneuver nodes, and the like. But we already play without \u003Cem\u003Edecouplers\u003C/em\u003E. Why would you want to see a maneuver node when you can\u0027t get over 1000m without your SRB fizzling out?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, all these changes further define the \u003Cem\u003Eprogression\u003C/em\u003E throughout the career mode. If you want all the bells and whistles right away, sure, go ahead and jump into sandbox. All pilots and engineers will be level 5, everything is free and unlocked. But if you want to play a career mode where you start from scratch and work your way to the heavens... well, you have to start humble, right? So let\u0027s see how that would work out with the changes as they have outlined right now, with apractical example:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESay I start in a crappy space center without SAS, tech, map view, or the ability to build big ships. I go into the VAB and... yeah, only about four parts available. So who cares I can\u0027t plan a trip to Eeloo because I don\u0027t have patched conics or maneuver nodes? \u003Cem\u003EI shouldn\u0027t be able to\u003C/em\u003E. I mean, I don\u0027t even have decouplers, and we all know SRB explosive staging is an exploit. And with the new part count restrictions I can\u0027t build absurd SSTOs with a gazillion tiny tanks (that I couldn\u0027t afford anyway, or land afterwards without legs). So what do I do for the first missions? I do a few suborbital mission hitting a couple biomes. I make sure I do contracts at the same time. I build funds and science, unlock new tech... and upgrade my buildings too of course! Through the missions I also trained a couple pilots and a scientist or two. Great! Now I have to unlock a decent tracking station, because the next mission is orbital! No problem, though I might have to do one more contract with a plane or something to get funds because I was wasteful. Do I have SAS to handle the ascent? Sure, my pilots know their stuff by now, they might even be good enough to hold prograde for low-thrust long maneuvers if I know how to design good enough to need them (say, I\u0027m flying by Minmus on the first orbital flight, because I am that awesome and know how to do it without patched conics). Then I do this great mission, and get ahead of the curve! I can go straight back down and perhaps unlock a few more tech trees. Since I\u0027m a great navigator, I hold on on buying maneuver nodes, because I want the NERVAs ASAP and going really far out. Perhaps I spend the extra funds I save there into advanced probes so I can get high-level SAS on unmanned flights earlier than I should instead, it\u0027s entirely up to me and my playstyle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoes that palythrough not sound incredibly awesome? It sure does to me! \u003Cem\u003EAnd you could always opt out by setting a different difficulty and/or playing sandbox\u003C/em\u003E.

(My guess is that this is just their first stab at the idea.) Hopefully they\u0027ll refine the concept. Limiting by mass makes a lot of sense, because you need increasingly large / expensive equipment when you move from trying to lift 10t to 100t to 1000t.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Upgrades should definitely control accuracy of information instead of artificial limitations like not displaying asc/desc nodes or Ap/Pe locations / values. Hopefully they find time to refine that in the release after 0.90.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I also think that when you unlock a fuel type in the tech tree, that you should initially have difficulties getting it 100% pure. Maybe it starts at 80-90% pure (with equivalent loss of performance) and you slowly refine it over time using science points / funds / tech tree advances. So if it starts at 80%, the first step would be to reduce the impurities by 1/2, the next step would reduce the impurities by 1/2 again, etc. So the iteration values would look like:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E80% pure, 90% pure, 95% pure, 97.5% pure, 98.75%, 99.38%...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- The same could be done for engines. When you first unlock the engine, it only performs at 80% of theoretical. Then you work on improving it through a few iterations until you have an engine that is 98.75% compared to theoretical performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could even start to play with the costs of the improvements. Going from 80% to 90% might be fairly inexpensive and only take a Kerbin day to do. Going from 98.75% to 99.38% might take a Kerbin year and $500k of funds and 500 science points. Just make it so that each additional refinement step takes 30% longer and costs 30% more funds / science points.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Damien_The_Unbeliever","CreatedById":129715,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-06T17:48:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m also surprised about so many people who have strong opinions about how broken new feature X is despite the fact that they\u0027re only working from a description and haven\u0027t actually tried feature X yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs to the arguments that a part count is \u0022artificially\u0022 limited (as if that means anything in a game) it\u0027s perfectly feasible to conceive of buildings that have limited inventory available on-hand.
