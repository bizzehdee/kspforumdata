It will still wobble a little, but tends to be less likely to snap in two.\n\nYou see, what happened was, Squad decided that the 0.90 SAS was too useful. In an effort to up the difficulty a touch, they kidnapped a cab driver in Mexico, got him drunk, then hooked him up to a Kermancephalogram machine and cloned his brain waves while driving. Thus, 1.0x SAS was born.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-10T20:25:11Z\u0022 title=\u002206/10/2015 08:25  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 10, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"PTNLemay","CreatedById":30142,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-10T20:25:16Z","Content":"@Randa\n\nHmm, I\u0027ll try that, thanks.

It is a known and undeniable fact that the SAS overcorrects badly, and the increased engine gimbal range has made the problem worse.\n\nYou are correct, it is possible by applying otherwise unnecessary limitations to your vehicles, to design around the problem. This does not mean there is no problem, or that vehicles not designed specifically to get around it are bad design.\n\nFor example, a vehicle that snaps in half with gimbals unlocked that flies a perfect ascent with them locked is not a poorly designed vehicle.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-11T15:23:36Z\u0022 title=\u002206/11/2015 03:23  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 11, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-11T15:20:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Incorrect, again.
