So whistling \u0027Uranium Fever\u0027 from Fallout, and with precious little planning I shot off to Mum to make my fortune mining these Rare and Exotic resources.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn my greed and haste I had selected a 2.5m Kontainer from MKS (below)\u00A0to store my haul in.\u00A0 A quick check showed that one of those full\u00A0had a value of 2.4 million funds!!

I was extremely wrong.\u003Cbr\u003E\nFully loaded that Kontainer weighs\u00A0~85 tons. It was going to take a much more beefy lifter than the one I brought,\u00A0and a complete rethink about how to get it back home.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, somewhat miffed, I returned to the space centre and this time did some planning. Which is of course always a hazardous occupation in KSP, and I rather went down the rabbit hole on this and ended up with something that\u0027s so insanely profitable that it really kinda breaks the game from a funding point of view.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022D8Y8tne.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/D8Y8tne.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022vRaxU2G.jpg\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/vRaxU2G.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis is Romeo-Echo-Foxtrot (REFinery), a base that mines Exotic Minerals, Rare Metals, Silicates, Substrate and Minerals. It also requires Metallic Ore but that isn\u0027t available in the same location as the other resources, so it\u0027s mined a few km away and trucked in.\u00A0 Those are refined into Silicon, Refined Exotics, Polymers, Metals and Chemicals, which are then further refined into \u0022Specialised Parts\u0022 and \u0022Material Kits\u0022. The two building blocks for creating and deploying DIY kits from scratch. And this is the final product.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022fCUtt2U.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/fCUtt2U.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhat is it you ask....\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt\u0027s a set of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E containers filled to the brim with Gravmax Gravioli Detectors (1600 of them), which I think have the highest cost to mass ratio of any part.\u00A0 Weighing only 10t it\u0027s easy to transport and has a value of...... 14 millions funds!\u003Cbr\u003E\n(note: the containers only have 40 item slots, so originally I scaled the containers down so they matched the volume of 40 Gravioli detectors. But as I was already running into part count issues I went with the larger containers and added a config line in the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E settings that enabled stacking detectors so I could put more than 40 in a box. That doesn\u0027t effect the volume constraints and it also meant\u00A0I didn\u0027t have to drag 400 of them in one at a time!).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt it\u0027s current level of efficiency\u00A0this base can produce one of these every 15 days......this base can generate around \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:16px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E364\u00A0Million funds per year.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd that\u0027s not even running at full efficiency. As I was new to MKS I hadn\u0027t understood what the significance of the \u0022Machinery\u0022 resource was, and didn\u0027t know it effects the efficiency of the converters.\u00A0 So my design for the base only factored in power consumption for mid-range efficiency. I also have some (slightly odd) issues with overheating on the base.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut a quick check suggests that with a bigger power supply and more cooling, I could potentially push the output of this base up to something like 680 million funds per year. I\u0027m not going to, that\u0027d just be absurd!\u00A0 As it is I never need to accept another contract ever again.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo from one extreme to another;\u00A0 with this system I\u0027m now generating actually too much money. I was aiming for something a bit more balanced;\u00A0a good source of off-world income, but not so ridiculous it completely breaks the funding aspect of the game!\u003Cbr\u003E\nI think next time around I will apply some constraints that say that certain resources can only be found on\u00A0certain planets (ie Rare Metals are only on Dres) and then there will be the need for a more complex transport network and the process slowed down by interplanetary travel time.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nI guess in the end the main thing is I had a load of fun designing it. Its way more complex than it needs to be, has stupid details like tracing lights that show \u0022direction of flow\u0022 of resources from the drills and has way more storage capacity for the component resources than it needs, but that was an aesthetic choice.\u00A0 It\u0027s also fully self sufficient for TAC life support resources and has 6 Kerbals living there, potentially indefinitely.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBuilding the base was the really fun part though.\u00A0 I chopped it\u00A0up into small parts, shipped them out over about 14 launches and It was mostly assembled on site by Kerbals (with the power of Kerbal Inventory System) and a couple rovers to move heavy parts around (a few of the really heavy parts were joined with welding docking ports from MKS).\u00A0 All in the base cost just under 3 mil to build and launch, took about 40 Kerbal days to assemble.\u00A0 It then took several weeks to get it up to higher efficiency, but it\u0027s already made about 30 mil profit in it\u0027s first 100 days since construction began.\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022mNxyhIe.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 data-ratio=\u002256.25\u0022 height=\u0022675\u0022 width=\u00221200\u0022 src=\u0022https://i.imgur.com/mNxyhIe.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI thought I\u0027d share this gold mine process, although I think overall it\u0027s too \u003Cabbr title=\u00221.

I\u0027m planning to do a post on how I built this and also post the couple of rovers I used to help with construction, but that will have to wait till tomorrow now.\u003Cbr\u003E\nBut the general idea is chop the base up in the editor into small manageable sections which you can launch and that aren\u0027t too heavy to move about, either using EVA Kerbals (with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Inventory System (mod)\u0022\u003EKIS\u003C/abbr\u003E installed) for the smaller parts or with rovers for the heavier parts. MKS has a special docking port that once docked can be \u0022wielded\u0022; you click join on the docking port and the docked ports disappear and the parts they connected to are joined.\u00A0 So for the heavy section I used a low-loader rover (there\u0027s a couple pics of it in my post on KerbalX) to move them into place and they were joined with those MKS docking ports. Everything under 6 tons was put into place by Kerbals.\u00A0\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\nTwo sections (the central part and the workshop with a hab module attached to it)\u00A0where too big for either option. So for those I used Global Construction to build them on site (you package up the section as a DIY kit, fly that out along with some Material Kits and then use a workshop with some engineers in it to build the kit).\u00A0 The workshop bit was added towards the end, was too heavy to move with a rover so used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Attachment System (mod)\u0022\u003EKAS\u003C/abbr\u003E winches to drag it into place and it\u0027s joined with docking ports (getting the winches to drag it so it lined up close enough to dock was awkward!)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou could package the entire base into a single DIY kit and just fly that out and assemble it from that.....only problem with that approach is the DIY kit for the entire base weighs 95 tons and you\u0027d also need around 82 tons of Materials Kits (plus a workshop part and some skilled engineers, and it\u0027ll probably take quite a while for them to assemble it!).\u00A0 That\u0027s the easy option in the sense you don\u0027t have to chop it up and then re-assemble it on site, but transporting 95 tons to Mun won\u0027t be so easy!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
