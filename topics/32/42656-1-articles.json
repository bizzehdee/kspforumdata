It can be done, but only after extensive practice in docking. Normally, the in-line \u0027single\u0027 Clamp-O-Trons require alignment on two axes (plural for axis), the X and Y axis (or up, down, left, and right) to dock succesfully. Multi-docking requires two X/Y planes (or more, depending on the number of ports to dock) to align perfectly, and simultaneously. Any error in the docking can prevent the multi-dock in some designs. I\u0027ve seen some versions that allow some torsion in the docking section so that the other docking ports can still swing home into the other docking ports (Confusing? Let me know)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in short, your best shot is for multi-docking. It is impossible, without mods, to add any structural components in flight without docking ports.

I really like this game, but it lacks so much that could make it better.\u003Cp\u003EOn a side note.. is there a common place to find mods? I haven\u0027t done any in this game, and for mincraft they have a forum setup for mods. and SC4 they have a site dedicated for mods.. what do we have?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all its still in alpha...........be patient, you should seen what it was like back in 0.14. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondly, no wonder you think it lacks so much if you don\u0027t know where to find mods.

You might want to add dropable engines to launch huge ships into orbit and then refuel and add small parts like landers afterward. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis was done this way, launch ship, 90 liter tanks with T30 engines mounted on the sides gave TVR to get it into orbit, they was dropped before circulating, added landers including eve lander on top and refilled the outer tanks in three launches afterwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhich is the way some of my ship sections have had to go up in the past, especially the heavy nuclear powered drive units need their engines turned on just for the extra Dv to make it into a 130km orbit, then refuel the thing while adding the extra fuel tanks/payload.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome folks mod the parts file to add an empty jumbo fuel tank to make the job of flying a big ship into a parking orbit a lot easier... then doing a refueling flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut its up to you to come up with a solution that works for you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoris\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dewm","CreatedById":76148,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-16T18:57:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022OopsThatNotWork\u0022 data-cite=\u0022OopsThatNotWork\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFirst of all its still in alpha...........be patient, you should seen what it was like back in 0.14. \u003Cp\u003ESecondly, no wonder you think it lacks so much if you don\u0027t know where to find mods.

You can build multi-craft ships in orbit, using just ports and no fancy quantum struts.\u003Cp\u003EBelow I have a pic of three crafts with additional fuel tank, where all four were launched separately. From left to right, a seven seater command craft, the jumbo tank for extra range, a one seat lander, and a two seat lander with a small rover buggy that can be re-attached. Using x4 and x2 symmetry, I can run all the LT-Ns at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for the reply. I think you misunderstood me though, when I said more then one docking port I worded it poorly.

I have done exactly what the OP is trying to do, assemble a ship in space using multiple docking ports to increase stability. It\u0027s not easy and will take many, many tries. But eventually I pulled it off.\u003Cp\u003EThe plan is to have a completely modular ship (Control and habitat module \u002B energy module \u002B several fuel modules \u002B docking module \u002B Engine module) connected with 3x medium docking ports to easily be able to construct new parts and replace as needed.
