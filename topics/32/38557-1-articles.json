First, you can\u0027t go necessarily by the name of the part. You have to go by the capability listed in the VAB/SPH.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.20, there were (I think) three types of turning capability:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ECommand pod (or probe core) torque\u003C/strong\u003E, which was\u003Cem\u003E user-controllable\u003C/em\u003E (ship turned in reaction to QWEASD)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ESAS torque\u003C/strong\u003E, which was passive only and \u003Cem\u003Enot user-controllable\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- Functionally, this had the result of \u003Cem\u003Ekilling rotation\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EASAS \u003C/strong\u003Eprovided no torque, but used a \u003Cem\u003EPID controller\u003C/em\u003E to control other systems (SAS, RCS, gimbals, wings)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- Functionally, this had the result of \u003Cem\u003Ekilling rotation *and* locking heading\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my very limited testing so far, in 0.21, there are two types of turning capability:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003EReaction Wheels:\u003C/strong\u003E Act like command pod torque (\u003Cem\u003Euser-controllable\u003C/em\u003E) but require electricity (usually at the rate of 6E/min/unit of torque, though there are a few exceptions). NOTE: Parts with reaction wheels contain a \u0022Toggle Torque\u0022 option on their right-click menu, so you can turn them off to save power (at the expense of turning power, unless you have something else like RCS to compensate).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- \u003Cstrong\u003ESAS-Equipped:\u003C/strong\u003E This is meant to be the flight computer/PID-controller; like the original ASAS it provides \u003Cem\u003Eno inherent torque\u003C/em\u003E of its own, but controls other devices. However, functionally, it seems to behave more like the old SAS, in that it \u003Cem\u003Ekills rotation\u003C/em\u003E, but I don\u0027t think it restores heading. As a result, it sometimes tends to drift. It\u0027s also rather more sluggish (especially with rolls), and it allows manual turning (yay!).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn terms of parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All command pods have *both* RW \u0026amp; SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- All probe cores have *only* RW.

This can be used to supplement your torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- The Inline Advanced Stabilizer has *both* RW \u0026amp; SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E--- The Large Advanced S.A.S and the Avionics Package have *only* SAS, thus they provide no torque.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@DangerWillKerbinson! Note: Probe cores are NOT SAS-equipped. I suppose you could throw the Large ASAS on a lifter or upper-stage that\u0027s launching a probe? Otherwise, I\u0027m not sure I see the use either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit 2: What I\u0027d like to see is a probe-sized SAS. KSPX has a probe-sized SAS unit, so it\u0027s puzzling they didn\u0027t use that.
