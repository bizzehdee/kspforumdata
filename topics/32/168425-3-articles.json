KSP becomes very affordable in both respects. Comparing a movie to a game is illogical - apples and oranges.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor \u0022an experience\u0022 - I think you need 2 things: love of a challenge and a community spirit. Just look through the forums and you\u0027ll see people boasting about their accomplishments.\u00A0And the fact that all players face the same challenges creates a great community. It\u0027s like a small town - everyone knows Eve won\u0027t let you go (easily), and most know where to find the Kraken corpse. Everyone can appreciate your accomplishments because we\u0027re all in the Kerbal solar system and we know what it takes.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI bought the game way back\u00A0(0.18, I think) - back when there were no tutorials. But there are plenty of YouTube videos, and if you don\u0027t know Scott Manley, then you haven\u0027t even tried. The learning curve was difficult at times, but I did actually learn something about orbital mechanics and rocketry - as opposed to how just to beat the game. Making my first rendezvous and docking was exhilarating. We all chased science when it was released. We all did the contracts when career mode was released. We will all be building and doing missions with the DLC. And the mods provide many layers of complexity making the game\u00A0as challenging as you like.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut maybe it\u0027s just not your game...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m very aware that people put price and hours of playtime together. KSP is a great game in this regard. However, my point is that the game is still incomplete and we\u0027re paying full release price for an unfinished product. I know, it\u0027s hard to define \u0022complete\u0022 when it\u0027s a game that\u0027s in continuous development, but as a ballpark definition I expect a 1.0 release to be something that is a balanced, cohesive, complete experience with the necessary game system in place and working. Even after over\u00A0two years of development since 1.0, I still feel that KSP hasn\u0027t reached this point. We\u0027re still missing any sort of official life support, which is one of the fundamental issues facing real world manned spaceflight and would help balance out how \u003Cabbr title=\u00221. Original Post(er). The first post in a thread, or the person who posted it. 2. Overpowered. A part or mechanic that upsets game balance by being too powerful.\u0022\u003EOP\u003C/abbr\u003E manned flights are in the game right now compared to probes. Part balance is still all over the place, there\u0027s holes in the stock part lineup, and career mode is still a mess. Even the part models are of wildly varying degrees of quality, and a lot of audio is still missing. I realize that things are slowly improving with the new devs, but until the game actually finishes these things I still consider this game to be an early access title in everything except name and price. Which gets back to my original issue with the price of the game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve had the game since 0.19 and been on the forums nearly as long. I know KSP has a great community, especially with modding, and that\u0027s what\u0027s kept the game alive in spite of the devs. Scott Manley\u0027s videos are great, but the game really should provide all the information the player actually needs to play the game. It\u0027s poor game design, especially in a \u0022released\u0022 title, to expect the player to use the wiki for everything. Maybe that\u0027s part of the rationale for the new expansion pack, since it shifts the burden of creating decent tutorials off the devs and onto the player base so that\u0027s one less thing they have to do.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI can partially agree that it\u0027s not my game, at least not the current incarnation of the title. Especially since a huge amount of\u00A0dev time (especially in that critical time leading up to 1.0) seemed to be eaten up by console development to the detriment of the rest of the game, and I have no interest in playing KSP on a console. The concept of KSP is extremely appealing and I\u0027ve got lots of hours of enjoyment out of it, but I also cringe every time I see the stock career, tech tree and part balance and have to spend a bunch of time getting mods set up to make it my game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-13T20:57:28Z\u0022 title=\u002212/13/2017 08:57  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 13, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Corona688","CreatedById":2511,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T22:30:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI broadly agree with many of your points, but here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n2 minutes ago, Lord Aurelius said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI realize that things are slowly improving with the new devs, but until the game actually finishes these things I still consider this game to be an early access title in everything except name and price.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA $10 indie game like FTL is clever and entertaining, but -- at some point you realize it\u0027s a barely-animated card game with spaceships and catchy music.\u00A0 (And I\u0027m saying this as someone who \u003Cstrong\u003Elikes\u003C/strong\u003E the game.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it realistic to say there\u0027s four times as much value in a realistic, build-it-yourself 3d spaceflight simulator with persistent and explorable planets?\u00A0 You\u0027re entitled to your opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-13T23:05:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223243648\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221513204213\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u00222511\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Corona688\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n36 minutes ago, Corona688 said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI broadly agree with many of your points, but here:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA $10 indie game like FTL is clever and entertaining, but -- at some point you realize it\u0027s a barely-animated card game with spaceships and catchy music.\u00A0 (And I\u0027m saying this as someone who \u003Cstrong\u003Elikes\u003C/strong\u003E the game.)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIs it realistic to say there\u0027s four times as much value in a realistic, build-it-yourself 3d spaceflight simulator with persistent and explorable planets?\u00A0 You\u0027re entitled to your opinion.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKSP is clever and entertaining, but -- at some point you realize it\u0027s an empty sandbox with a bunch of dull planets and poorly balanced mechanics and placeholder parts, and no real sense of purpose other than what you\u00A0come up with to challenge yourself.

Most video games these days are mostly art jobs, with a little bit of coding and scripting. Squad, meanwhile, has had to put into code orbital mechanics, atmospheric effects, thermal effects, and countless other complicated features that are far from commonplace in video games. The sort of art passes you\u0027re suggesting are major investments, and Squad may not even have the talent to get those working; a coder might have had no prior experience making 3D models or textures, but that\u0027s what they had to deal with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-14T02:48:17Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2017 02:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Starman4308\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nightside","CreatedById":150244,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T02:47:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223240345\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022168425\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221512923504\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022183456\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Hans Kerman\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 12/10/2017 at 8:31 AM, Hans Kerman said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhy Does Kerbal Space Program Need to be THAT Expensive, $39.99 Wont get you anywhere playerwise, Somewhere around $24.99 Would be more Reasonable\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/183456-hans-kerman/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022183456\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/183456-hans-kerman/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Hans Kerman\u003C/a\u003E,The very first time I heard of KSP I knew it was the video game I\u0027d been waiting for since I toggled my first joystick.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut I didn\u0027t buy it for at least a year because\u00A0 I didn\u0027t have a computer that could run it!

Most video games these days are mostly art jobs, with a little bit of coding and scripting. Squad, meanwhile, has had to put into code orbital mechanics, atmospheric effects, thermal effects, and countless other complicated features that are far from commonplace in video games. The sort of art passes you\u0027re suggesting are major investments, and Squad may not even have the talent to get those working; a coder might have had no prior experience making 3D models or textures, but that\u0027s what they had to deal with.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFair enough, but Harvester doesn\u0027t work for Squad and isn\u0027t involved in the game\u0027s development anymore. Developers sometimes make mistakes, and given the popularity of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Engineer Redux (mod)\u0022\u003EKER\u003C/abbr\u003E and MechJeb even with players who otherwise play completely stock, I would suggest that it was more of a mistake. A seat-of-the-pants trial and error approach to spaceflight is fun for the first little bit, but\u00A0then gets extremely annoying when you realize that the game is arbitrarily hiding critical information from the player (but still displays that little \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E readout for maneuvers) for \u0022reasons\u0022.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhich is a classic example of a placeholder part that should have been replaced but wasn\u0027t.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLike in my reply to Corona688, there is such a thing as graphics settings. You simply leave the higher graphics options disabled for slower PCs so they\u0027re doing exactly the same graphics they are now, but the ceiling is higher now for players with the extra performance.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI do realize that Squad has put a tremendous amount of effort into KSP and don\u0027t dispute\u00A0that it still is likely a lot of work to really finish the game and polish it up nicely. That doesn\u0027t change the fact that the game as it stands now is still pretty rough and unfinished in many ways despite being \u0022released\u0022, which has been my point all along. Again, I\u0027m not advocating photorealistic 4K graphics. Fidelity improvements would be nice, but the biggest issue is the lack of consistency that makes a lot of rockets look pretty terrible with all the mismatched textures.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222017-12-14T08:42:38Z\u0022 title=\u002212/14/2017 08:42  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 14, 2017\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Epicdreamer","CreatedById":167797,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-12-14T09:42:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI agree with Frostedshoe (last reply on page 1)\u00A0\u00A0It\u0027s not a mainstream game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI \u0022get\u0022 the game.
