I don\u0027t like sending rovers to new places anymore because they really have no purpose other than look cool on another cool looking planet. Sure there\u0027s the scientific tools for temperature and atmosphere, but what else? I don\u0027t want to land on any other places anymore because I\u0027ve already got tons of flags on pretty much every planet except Moho and Jool *Jool for obvious reasons* I tried forcing myself to do a budget thing with missions and all, but because it was all in my head I didn\u0027t find it very fun. However career mode will probably fix that for me. I\u0027ve built tons of planes/spaceplanes but those get boring after a while. The problem: I\u0027ve come down with the minecraft syndrome.
