Does anybody have a functioning (preferably LF-only) SSTO plane? What is your flight profile for it? How much LF do you carry?"},{"CreatedByName":"Starhawk","CreatedById":131400,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T20:26:35Z","Content":"You probably need to change your flight profile with the recent aero adjustments.\n\nI found with Rapiers I need to start by flying a shallow ascent until they build some speed and then begin to pitch up until climbing very respectably. Once in their power band they perform well.\n\nI am finding the new aero enjoyable, and I expect that it will be stable now while the dev team works on moving to the new Unity engine.\n\nThe [Stock Payload Fraction Challenge](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/116729-Stock-Payload-Fraction-Challenge-1-0-4-Edition) has a couple of excellent spaceplanes working in 1.0.3/1.0.4.\n\nI believe that the [K-Prize](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/11214-The-K-Prize-100-reusable-spaceplane-to-orbit-and-back) has entries made in 1.0.3/1.0.4.\n\nHappy landings!"},{"CreatedByName":"Evanitis","CreatedById":145424,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-25T21:24:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E preferably LF-only\n\nIs that even possible? As in no oxidizer at all?\n\nAhh, forgot about nerves. I see now. I envisioned an SSTO that uses monopropellant once the jets flameout. That sounds fun.

Using only stock parts I got a Mk2 sized SSTO into orbit and can do so regularly now. Taking that to the Mk3 I got into orbit on the first try with tons of fuel to spare. I\u0027ve found that full throttle, point the nose 20 degrees above the horizon and let that sucker fly is the most efficient way to get into orbit. You \\*will\\* almost blow some parts once you\u0027re at ~Mach 3 below 10km, but you should just make it. I ride Rapiers in Airbreathing till the velocity levels out, then kick over to closed cycle mode. Works with a Mk2 passenger and Mk2 cargo setup, as well as a Mk3 passenger setup. I haven\u0027t tried a Mk3 Cargo SSTO yet."},{"CreatedByName":"Aanker","CreatedById":70274,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T07:32:43Z","Content":"I can still get my x2 orange fuel tank carrier to at least a 90x90 orbit, in fact it seems even easier now, and its ascent profile is basically hold 30 degrees."},{"CreatedByName":"Fire-Dragon-DoL","CreatedById":113470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T01:49:10Z","Content":"An image of your ssto would be lovely"},{"CreatedByName":"Gravaar","CreatedById":83438,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T11:58:48Z","Content":"Not very practical yet but it does work\n\n\u003E [Javascript is disabled.
