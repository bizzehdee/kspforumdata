Flying manually, you\u0027re less constrained in that you can vary your pitch and throttle almost arbitrarily (only subject to throttle ramp limits and rotational inertia). If MechJeb\u0027s type of trajectory happens to coincide exactly with the true optimum, then there will be no way to beat MechJeb. But that would be a complete coincidence and there\u0027s no mathematical reason for it to happen for all general designs. For example, if different stages have significantly different TWR, then the optimal trajectories during those stages should likely be a bit different.

Assuming your delta-V was measured with respect to Eve gravity and atmosphere, I think 8800 will just about make it from the highest altitude launch and smart flying.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Edelta V is invariant with throttle in KSP. real rockets vary ISP with throttle, but not in game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-12T23:50:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/vvN5ivF\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/vvN5ivF.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022vvN5ivF.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI like this location close to the equator, 6.500 meter. It as two benefits, fist its an pretty large and flat area, secondly as its close to equator it required lite plane change burn and it was easy to do manually with mechjeb to show landing point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs my Eve landing was part of an minimal weight grand tour. fuel used during plane change was just as important as fuel used during accent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENote that mechjeb sacrifices fuel use for accuracy then landing automatic on planets with atmosphere. Pretty smart of it as any fool with an parachute can land with atmosphere the main issue is to get close to the target.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis lander was not fully able to reach orbit, lacked around 100 m/s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-12T23:53:46Z\u0022 title=\u002209/12/2013 11:53  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 12, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by magnemoe\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
