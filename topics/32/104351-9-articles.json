But now I\u0027m thinking that I\u0027m normally using several - sometimes lots! - of intakes *for each* engine.\n\nIn other words, I\u0027m not too concerned that I still may need 6 or 8 jet engines for a larger plane, as long as I don\u0027t need 30 or 40 intakes for them!\n\nThe new intakes, wings and gear will already greatly reduce partcount on large winged vehicles.\n\nOn another note: For some time now, I\u0027ve been trying to build a whole range of vehicles - a \u0022colonization architecture\u0022. The first generation of it got thrown away unused because the partcount was too high. The second generation was about to be finished now, but I will probably throw it away because the new equipment bays will make much nicer vehicles possible....."},{"CreatedByName":"Capt Snuggler","CreatedById":65092,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T12:05:20Z","Content":"\u003E Honestly, I expect most if not all parts to be changed in some way or another, given that there\u0027s a big rebalance as part of this update.

Unfortunately, such a list would be provisional as things are obviously still changing (like the Round8 fuel type change and then revert just recently). Best to assume all parts are changing, and back up your 0.90 install so you can rework as necessary when the release is finalized."},{"CreatedByName":"Yakuzi","CreatedById":85181,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-18T12:38:46Z","Content":"Wow great amount of info, so excited. First of all, thanks for listening to the community on the ROUND8 thing Squad\\*! \n\nNow onto the Squadcast:\n\n- Good to hear about the contract system adjustments. Also, an ability to propose your own contracts/missions when your rep is *very* high would really help out career\n\n- The drill looks great, but does it always come in two or is there a single drill part as well?\n\n- New intakes look great, looking forward to seeing sleek nosecones with similar aesthetics!\n\n- The Mk3 wings look great as well, and they\u0027re wet wings! Are all wings in the game now moisturised?\n\n- Loving the new 2.5m and 1.25m cargobays! Great job Roverdude!!!\n\n- Ablative shielding looks good, but maybe play with the colour/contrast a bit more.\n\n- I\u0027ll join the masses in expressing my concern with the fairings. On ejection they should split up in 2 (or more, make it an option) sections along the longitudinal axis, it makes no sense that they split up in multiple horizontal cross panels as shown in the image.\n\nOn the \u0022no procedural wings\u0022 et al. comments:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E \u003Csnip\u003E I prefer having a list of parts and then putting stuff together. It\u0027s like a puzzle. And that\u0027s half the game, right there, too.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Csnip\u003E but there are mods you can use. This is actually an okay argument here because proc parts aren\u0027t really suited to the game\u0027s puzzle of building rockets.\u003C/snip\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/snip\u003E\n\nI disagree, by your reasoning we wouldn\u0027t have stock proc fairings either. Procedural wings are by no means a single item that limit \u0022lego-ness\u0022 in KSP, instead they allow for composite and creative design of winged craft without going into single digit FPS because of part-count (since part-count is still a thing). One of the main concerns with proc wings were that they would break off in large chunks, but now the same can be said for large Mk3 wings. Furthermore, with harv\u0027s recent explanation on the new fairing part-count:\n\n\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s only one part, which is the fairing as a whole. Fairing *panels* aren\u0027t independent parts, they\u0027re sub-objects of the fairing until you deploy them. A fairing that is 10 sections high and divided into 4 sides would have 40 panels, yes. How many objects this will produce on deployment depends on how they group together (that\u0027s next up on my to-do list actually).\n\u003E As for how the broken-off bits behave after deployment, they are handled as solar panel pieces or engine fairings. They aren\u0027t fully persistent (which is good if you like 2 digit framerates). That doesn\u0027t mean they aren\u0027t solid objects, however. Point away from face.\n\nThis means that all proc parts can use this system right? So your proc wings could break into subparts without affecting the part-count. This is quite neat, if not in stock than definitely for the procedural wing mods out there.\n\n\\*Please also listen to your [community on the 1.0 release](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/108318-Do-you-feel-KSP-is-ready-for-1-0/page97).
