Cross-possibilities include having liquid boosters radially attached (liquid so that they can throttle to mitigate release sag) at strategic points corresponding to the clamp release stages; lighting the main stack at low throttle to compress gently from the bottom, possibly in concert with an upward-cascading clamp release setup; strutting directly to the launch clamps pre-ignition.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESecondary thought -- with such tall clamps as you would obviously need to survive physics-load, the problem emerges of sliding smoothly enough out of your vertical coccoon of released clamp towers.
