Essentially with the mod kerbal side we would divide up the bases and territory of Kerbol, then Using BDArmory we will build defensive or attacking units. There are rules of course.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nRules:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYour reinforcements are based on the amount of bases you have, divided by\u00A0five rounded up to the nearest 1.\u003Cbr\u003E\n(no more than 10 reinforcements)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n1-5=1 reinforcement, 6-10=2 reinforcements, 11-15=3 reinforcements, 16-20=4 reinforcements, 21-25=5 reinforcements,\u003Cbr\u003E\n26-30=6 reinforcements, 31-35=7 reinforcements, 36-40= 8 reinforcements, 41-45=9 reinforcements.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou may not attack the first round, the first round everyone places down one unit at each base, there are about\u00A045 bases, so if 4 people join everyone will have 11 bases and 1 person will have 12, so everyone gets\u00A03 reinforcements on there turn unless they loss more territories and fall into another category above.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nFirst round you can put down only one defensive\u00A0unit at a base, and you may launch\u00A0one\u00A0of two things into space, a com sat, to communicate with others, or a spy sat, which allows you to look at enemy troops, that it passes over. (note: you can combine both into one unit and launch it.)\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nA com sat will have either a Communotron 88-88 or a coms DTS-MT, a spy sat will have a M700 Survey Scanner and a coms device, a communotron 16 is a spy sat com only, if other comms are used the spy sat is also a com sat.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can shoot day a spy sat, but not a coms sat, if a sat is both it cannot be shot down, a spy sat will be able to be shot down after and on\u00A0the agreed turn, a coms sat will be able to be shot on the same turn we decide to use nuclear\u00A0devices.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nWar councils are convened to decide on new rules of war. The first one will take place on after turn five, and can be brought up in case of emergencies, other wise will take place after every other turn. Ex after turn 5, then after turn 7, then after turn 9 and so on.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nOn round two you can attack for the first time, to take a base you must destroy the defensive units, or disable them, you may not take a base if the defensive unit still works. Then you take down the flag and out down your own.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nDefensive unit cannot be made out of indestructible parts, since I cannot remember them all, any indestructible parts found being used will be deleted, the person who owns it notified, and they will get a chance to put a new one down, and replace any others using that part. This is only replace old ones with new ones, after they do this the attacker will resume at the start of his/her turn, after he/she got his/her reinforcements, so he/she will not get more reinforcements.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can take two bases, one enemy and one base you had at the beginning of the war. You fire upon\u00A0a total of 4 bases.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nIf you get shot down you cannot retry your attack by reverting the flight, that is used for going back from glitches, or in other special cases to be decide by war council. You can retry with another vehicle. War council will decide the turn when this number can increase.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nQuick saving and loading is allowed, to get around glitches, any other uses are forbidden,\u00A0special cases can be taken to the war council.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNote you may only take part in the war council if you have a coms sat, you can only make treaties or contact people who have coms sats as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nSpy sat can only see unit that they pass over,\u00A0so a non polar orbit will not see everything. This is one example where you can quick save, fast forward to see what unit your spy sat passes over, then quick load back. The units your\u00A0spy sat passes, over are the only ones you can look at besides your own.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u00A0There is no part limit or cost limit, however nothing to big or extravagant, it must be able to be destroyed, it can be really hard to be destroyed, as long as it can be.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNote you may create another world save\u00A0separate from the war save to test your vehicles and defensives.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou have up to one week to make your turn. Additional time may be granted by the war council in special cases.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nNote that reinforcements are addition units you can launch on your turn, if you still have units out after your previous turn you may restock them with ammo and missiles without\u00A0using\u00A0up\u00A0reinforcements,\u00A0you may also reuse vehicles\u00A0you have left by refueling them, without using up your reinforcements, and you can attack with them and\u00A0keep using your reinforcements for defensive purposes.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can carry up to four probes or turrets with\u00A0you at one time.\u00A0The turrents make only have two PAC-3 Intercept missiles, and two Vulcan Turret guns attached to it.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAll these rules can be subjected to change by the war council, additional rules can be added by the war council.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nThere are only two ways to win, one is to take all the bases and control Kerbin, or all the governments left in the war must have a diplomatic treaty of non-aggression. That last for\u00A010 or more turns. Example being there are four governments blue, red, green and yellow. Yellow is taken out, blue and green sign a non-aggression pact till red is gone, red is defeated. This is not winning cause\u00A0blue and green\u0027s non-aggression no longer stands as valid, they must make a new one. The war council can also change the turn limit on this as well.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou can record this series on your channel, as long as your willing to list others that do this as well. One person can be decided on by the war council that can make a playlist of all videos in order of turn order.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nTurn order and bases and territory will be decided by a pre-war council\u00A0before the first turn, everyone must have the same mods with some exceptions made by the pre-war council, and the same version of KSP.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nIf anyone want to join and willing to play fair and by the rules can reply, please respond with what your government name is and if you get selected you will asked to provide a unique flag or pick a stock flag from the game to use.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-04-27T04:11:58Z\u0022 title=\u002204/27/2016 04:11  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EApril 27, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by willflatt\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Curveball Anders","CreatedById":107529,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-26T19:33:42Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222541479\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022138188\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221461693081\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022162885\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022willflatt\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n1 hour ago, willflatt said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI am looking for two to three players to go to war with in ksp.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\ntl:dr\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBut good luck.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
