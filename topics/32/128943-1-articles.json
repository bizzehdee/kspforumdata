Ever since then I\u0027ve launched EVERY single rocket with it. Seeing as how it\u0027s not realistic and not a used technique I kind of want to start building rockets that do not use it. I want to make more realistic like rockets and not have to rely on Asparagus staging. Is building rockets that put landers on Mun and stuff pretty easy to do?

It\u0027s quite easy to put Kerbals on Mun without building a 5 mile high rocket. You just have to have balance between building up and building radially.
