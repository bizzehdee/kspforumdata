I used Foursh\u0027s Munitaur II spacecraft to achieve this. Once landing on the Mun I decided I didn\u0027t WANT to make the return voyage. It felt like there would be no trace of my journey if I simply headed back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had an idea. The mods I had installed were: Cart Mod, ISA MapSat, Camera Mod, and Flag Mod.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPLANNING\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided to conduct a mission to land a rover on the Mun. It would be composed of a cart with a command module and camera on top and a height-mapping satellite tucked under bottom. I wanted to use the Munitaur again but it is used to land a \u0022command module with fuel and an engine for landing and return to Kerbin\u0022. I wanted it to land my rover.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI did some major changes to the \u0027Mun orbit insertion/landing/return\u0022 stage and tested weight and I finally came up with a design that would not require changes to the first stage of the Munitaur. Not needing to make a return trip helped too \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was almost ready to make the journey but when I tested the lander I realised that once I disconnected the radial engines (used for Munar orbit insert/landing) my rover couldn\u0027t move as it was surrounded by the engines. I INSTANTLY came up with a solution. Once landed using the landing legs I would turn on the radial engines slightly, JUST not enough to lift off. Then when I disconnect the radial decouplers the change of mass allows for the engines to fly away from the rover in a kind of water fountain shape \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:cool:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETHE MISSION\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was ready. I got into a low orbit of 12km, waited for Munrise and fired my engine. Once into an Mun passby I retro-burned into a Munar orbit. I lowered the Periapsis to 5km, reached the Periapsis, then retro-burned again until the orbit was broken. I lost all of my horizontal momentum then slowly descended, burning upwards occasionally to slow my fall. Once I was only about 20m above the munar surface I lowered by landing legs and slowly touched down. I had finally landed but the greatest show was yet to come. I had to separate out my rover. I performed the technique I have named the \u0027Jonmund maneuver\u0027\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E (someones probably done it before me.) and turned my engines \u0022slightly\u0022 on. I hit the space bar and watched them fly away and my rover had finally landed safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]31130[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]31131[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]31132[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]31133[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E[ATTACH=CONFIG]31134[/ATTACH]\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"COBALT","CreatedById":37153,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T10:44:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Euh oh. typo in TITLE. how do I delete the post??\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cykyrios","CreatedById":17639,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T11:49:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFixed the title for you \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"simplemunrockets","CreatedById":22495,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-12T13:52:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I would advise: a 12km orbit seems to give me too little time to slow down, I usually use a 50km orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"COBALT","CreatedById":37153,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-13T06:20:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Enope. my Kerbin orbit was 12km not my munar orbit \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E did the pictures work?\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
