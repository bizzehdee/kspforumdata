The way I see it, if you don\u0027t like Microsoft, then do not use their products. It\u0027s that simple.

I began to explain that I had been following the game since .22 as a paid subscriber, but had downloaded the .17 demo. I then told this student that the reason I was landing a probe on Duna is because I play KSP the same way I play card games - want to win big? Bet big! Want to walk away with just the money you came to the table with? Play conservatively and don\u0027t take risks.
