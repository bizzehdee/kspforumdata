You\u0027re going to need to clean up how the orbiter is attached to the external fuel tank since right now staging will tear the craft apart. I would suggest only using 1 coupler and keep the struts on the same stage so they\u0027ll break when you need them to. Also, you really only need 1 fuel line to do the job.
