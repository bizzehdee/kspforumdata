For shorter ranges, usually you want something small and light with moderate thrust, aerospike wins. And well, for extremely lightweight craft the LV-909 is better then the aerospike, but i dont really build many such vessels, so for me its almost always a choice between aerospike and nuke. For pure space i usually elect to use nukes every time since even for shorter ranges you need less fuel and thus less mass at any given dV, while aerospike is usually for either atmospheric ops such as on duna, or when you need to land somewhere since nukes are not very good landing engines).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe aerospike is one of few engines that is competitive in atmosphere (its way better in Duna\u0027s surface for example), as engines such as the 909 and poodle, which both get similar ISP, are useless within atmo due to their horrid atmo ISPs. It isnt the best raw ISP from the LFO engines, but if you think about it, its one that doesnt have any hard limitations unlike the pure space rockets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing, is that well, its extremely lightweight and high TWR. Compared to the rapier (although not that anyone would use a rapier in space exclusively), its half teh mass and same thrust, with better ISP. It is also a very good replacement for the mark-55, since it has better thrust, better ISP, and its only 0.1t heavier. Its harder to mount, but by no means difficult to use especially since its so short.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIts so small, that it can fit almost anywhere a 909 can fit in. This makes it extremely easy to actually use on anything really, and shorter rockets are always nice (it has a back node now so that old weakness is irrelevant).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOhh, and it has 20 impact vs the sub 10 of most LFO engines, making it more deadly in a collision (all my new capital ship torpedoes use aerospikes since its not only good TWR and all around stats, but its much better impactor then alternative engines). Ofc this last one is kinda situational, since i know not everyone plays KSP by making capital ships and shooting at them, but hey, more options are always nice.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-11T16:48:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Temeter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Temeter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWeight was reduced to 1 ton\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat happened in 1.0.2, IIRC.
