I think half my videos are about building rockets and testing them. As I completely suck at math, I generally don\u0027t bother calculating Delta V (up until recently I had no idea how, in fact) so scratch building and winging it was key to my (often questionable) success.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"StarStreak2109","CreatedById":118557,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-02-05T11:04:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI like to build a standard set of launchers, one for each form factor (i.e. 1.25, 2.5 and 3.75 metres).
