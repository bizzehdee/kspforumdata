I used to always try to build around this problem by trying the minimize the drift in the CoM due to fuel consumption, but this lead to designs with either large fuel tanks or engines very far to the front and just looked plain ugly in my eyes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I saw a post on the forums by Janos1986 and I had an idea: angling your jet engines upwards a few degrees with the gizmos gives you a lot of torque which can offset the nose-diving and troublesome take-offs that heavy SSTO\u0027s with a lot of engines in the back suffer from, but they would also make your plane flip out instantly if it comes back into the atmosphere at the end of a mission with near-empty tanks and a CoM that lies super far to the back.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut what if you angle all of your jet engines upwards except 2? You leave those 2 horizontally aligned or you might even angle them slightly downwards. Then, when entering the atmosphere with near-empty tanks and a tendency to flip nose-up instead of nose-down, you use those non-angled or slightly downwardly angled engines to compensate. You wouldn\u0027t need a lot of thrust anyway because the majority of your mass is gone and hey-presto, stable aircraft at all times, even with extreme CoM shift!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother option is to slide your engines slightly up- or downward, but in my designs this would be somewhat difficult (though with this new info in mind, my designs may change radically \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you guys think?

In order to keep the CoM from shifting in big and heavy spaceplanes (I\u0027m talking like 200 tons and heavier), you need to either put a lot of tanks in front of the plane, smaller tanks faaaaar in the front, or a lot of dry weight in the front.

They have a CoM that lies near the back, but in order to try and compensate for the CoM shift, I place the CoL as far back as I can. That means CoM in front of CoL on take-off and behind it on re-entry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese problems are much less of a problem when not using the Mk III parts, but I really want to use those.

As for the TWR: I personally use 12 jet engines on a lighter design and 4 nuke engines near the CoM. Two on each side, one above and one under the wing. The jets provide just enough TWR to lift off and I\u0027m hoping 4 nukes will be just enough thrust to circularize. If it isn\u0027t, I\u0027ll replace a couple turbojets with RAPIERS and use the rocket mode to give it a bit of a boost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JebKerboom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JebKerboom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/2RUs09N.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/2RUs09N.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know that it\u0027s no longer a SSTO, but the boosters gave it enough punch to get the jets running.

Love it to bits and a great solution for heavy planes that have trouble taking off. Might just resort to it myself. Quik note: even though it won\u0027t be an SSTO anymore, you *can* make it a 100% recoverable by adding chutes to the SRB\u0027s and setting them to deploy at minimum altitude (50m). That way they should splash down in to the ocean before they leave the 2,5 km physics bubble.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JebKerboom\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JebKerboom\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESuch a feat would be WAY easier with Mk2 parts.

I run stock and when I did my Duna flight lift was a giant pain in the butt, had to more than double my initial wing surface. I think it has to do with the way FAR calculates lift. A wide plane will have more lift in FAR, even with small wing surfaces. In stock, only the wing surfaces count so I had to cover the entire plane in wing surface to essentially create a flying delta wing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
