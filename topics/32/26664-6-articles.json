Put any ADD and insistence on instant-gratification away.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking is really, really easy... once you learn what the NavBall markings are actually telling you and figure out how to use them to nudge you into a path that will intersect the target while you sit back and watch it happen, rather than doing all that frantic button-mashing to drive yourself into the docking port. A single little white bottle of monoprop is good for a half-dozen dockings, if you just don\u0027t squirt it around all over the place trying to rush the process.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf your docking is boring, because you\u0027re just watching the ships drift into the right position on just a few puffs of RCS, then, you\u0027re doing it right. It will be time-consuming, but the faster you try to do it, the harder you\u0027re making it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-11T03:07:14Z\u0022 title=\u002208/11/2013 03:07  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 11, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by RoboRay\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"dylloop","CreatedById":2502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T03:40:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if you have seen it yet but I have a docking tutorial that has helped many people.\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022480\u0022 height=\u0022270\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQfSp-dqCXw?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dingbat1967","CreatedById":75953,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-11T03:44:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks Guys.
