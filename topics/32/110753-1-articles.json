Or if such an engine was added it would have to at least have a horrible vacuum Isp or something else to balance it out versus the larger engines.\n\nWell it isn\u0027t more powerful than the 2.5m engines.\n\nGo try to make a large Munar-surface-and-back rocket with 1.25m parts only. It\u0027s going to be pretty beefy and probably have [a lot of booster stages to shed getting to orbit](http://i.imgur.com/PvguGFl.png), and it\u0027s mainly in part because there\u0027s a large \u0027power vacuum\u0027 between the LVTs and the 2.5m parts... and it\u0027s further complicated by the fact that (stupidly) the bi/tri-couplers are completely inaccessible at that point in the game. Hell, the bi-coupler is the last coupler you get, after the tri- and quad-. Explain \\*that\\* one.\n\nA first-stage 1.25m engine is definitely missing from the lineup. What\u0027s interesting is if you use Tweakscale, which uses basic math to scale parts up, the 0.625 \u0027spark\u0027 engine is actually a better engine than the LV-T45, if its parameters were scaled up to 1.5m.\n\nHere\u0027s the K\u0026W 1.25m lifting engine. As you can see, it fills a good niche, and it\u0027s definitely nowhere even close to as powerful as a Skipper engine. Regarding the efficiency, keep in mind these are pretty old parts - when they were made, the LV-T30 had an ISP of 320A/370V, making this engine much less efficient. It hasn\u0027t been patched yet. \n\nYou use this engine on the launchpad, the Reliant to push yourself up to your apoapsis, and the LV-909 to circularize, giving you a complete 1.25m family.\n\n![a1Ku6j2.png](http://i.imgur.com/a1Ku6j2.png)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-25T08:09:04Z\u0022 title=\u002205/25/2015 08:09  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 25, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Frostiken**"},{"CreatedByName":"AbacusWizard","CreatedById":116476,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-25T07:39:06Z","Content":"More moving parts, especially hinges and perhaps telescoping beams.
