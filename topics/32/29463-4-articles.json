It was all dandy ad well, until I tried to launch my second fuel station into orbit. What had gone so well the first time proceeded to explode twice while entering orbit (one the pilot survived, the other not so much). So once I finally got it into orbit, I realized it was incredibly difficult to move a heavy fuel tanker with my RCS port located on the front (I the command capsule was use both to guide the fuel tank to the station and then reattach with the engine). So after about 3/4 of my RCS being burned doing that, I turn around and managed to attach to my engine with relative ease. From their the mission went dandy, until I went back to check on the station. Surprisingly nothing went flying off while I realigned it, but instead of hitting space center, I hit end flight. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELuckily, I had managed to have a quick save with it in orbit.
