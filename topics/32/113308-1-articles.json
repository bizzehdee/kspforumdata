My craft would have been much more efficient if I\u0027d skipped the LM entirely and slapped some landing legs on the CSM.\n\nI would have left less fuel behind on the Mun in the landing stage of the LM and wouldn\u0027t have been carting around a redundant lander can mk.2 and set of engines, let alone docking ports and stability struts. It seems that having a separate lander is only more efficient for interplanetary trips, and even then only to leave the main drive in orbit without redundant crew pods etc.\n\nAm I missing something aside from extra crew safety that makes the separate lander worth the extra delta-V?

Once it was chosen, The Gemini program was launched with the main objective of pathfinding these technologies.\n\nEarth Orbit Rendezvous was a compromise between the two. \n\nInterestingly the Service Module engine was sized for a Direct Ascent (though the module itself would have been bigger), and was massively overpowered for Trans-Lunar Injection burns. They were stuck with the engine developed for Direct Ascent! Note that the Orion engine is much smaller proportionately.\n\nDirect Ascent works best in KSP because proportionately the required DV is a lot less and rendezvous is a hassle. Larger missions both in KSP and planned IRL benefit from both Earth/Kerbin Orbit Rendezvous and Target Orbit Rendezvous efficiencies.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-18T08:35:28Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2015 08:35  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by RCgothic**"},{"CreatedByName":"Corw","CreatedById":7116,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T08:31:32Z","Content":"Op, you are missing the point.
