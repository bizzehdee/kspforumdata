In KSP, you have to be really efficient to get a Lander/CSM to be more efficient than a direct lander. The nerfs to engine Isp in 1.0 helped with making mass ratios bigger, so landers were more required. Once you do things like going out to Dres or Duna or the Joolean Moons, then you will want to do the lander/CSM stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s worth noting that the first time I returned from the Mun was an Apollo-style mission, despite having landed on the Mun several times before.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"xtoro","CreatedById":79015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-18T14:04:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot worth a lander: Moons like Minmis, Gilly, Bop etc, low grav.
