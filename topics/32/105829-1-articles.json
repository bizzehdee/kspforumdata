The highest I noticed on re-entry was about 1200m/sec which is why you experience no heating to speak of. The landing is broken though. The biggest problem with that design for a proper ship is the drag on launch would be much higher than a parachute so it\u0027s a very inefficient design. Also you Kerbal can\u0027t get out really."}]}
