Being able to do a basic docking maneuver, or calculate a good (not perfect) intercept trajectory, or drive a rover to a specified point, or repack parachutes/repair wheels, or keep a station oriented towards/away from the planet\u0027s surface.

One Kerbonaut might get \u002B10% to the ship\u0027s turn rates, one might get a 5% improvement to fuel efficiency, and so on. This\u0027d also give us a tangible reason to use the larger capsules, although you\u0027d probably need to limit this (like having the Captain give his full bonus, and all others give half their normal amounts). Jeb should have a little of every bonus, because he\u0027s just all-around awesome, but the others could specialize in various ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(You could also do both options, of course.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing is, this\u0027d require us to be able to assign a specific pilot to each mission, instead of the game just auto-assigning whoever is next in the rotation. Between this and the headaches of a training menu, it\u0027s a lot of overhead for something that might or might not make a difference. So, it\u0027d NEED to be important enough that we\u0027d want to go out of our way to manage it.

As far as training apparently (again from what I understand) they will gain experience whenever you manually fly a rocket and after a certain point a well experienced Kerbal will have the option to be able to work and fly missions on its own*. There hasn\u0027t been any word on aging, aging and retirement would be nice so that you don\u0027t have a 200 year old super-experienced kerbalnaut flying around and doing everything for you, breaking the gameplay.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*A way I think they could implement a Kerbin with free will is by recording a player\u0027s flight pattern and over time average the flight paths out, which the experienced Kerbal would follow. For instance you send a Kerbal to the mun five times, the game records the flight path and the moments in flight when you decoupled stages or made burns. The game then takes each of those times and chooses the middle ground in-between the best and worst path and that is what the Kerbal will take if you launch a mun landing mission and let the kerbal fly it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T01:15:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022johnpoz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022johnpoz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E say how long kerbals life spans are?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ein my space program...about 5 min\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DarthJazno","CreatedById":57464,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-22T02:07:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Scrogdog\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Scrogdog\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWell, I think it was Project Space Station which modeled conflicts among science teams on the ISS, and Buzz Aldrin\u0027s Race in to Space modeled crew members not liking who they were teamed up with affecting performance.)\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI played both of those games and it wasn\u0027t my favorite part.
