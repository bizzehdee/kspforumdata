Color interpolation of the biome map sometimes causes the edges between specific biomes to match a third biome that often isn\u0027t supposed to be anywhere near. IIRC there is a spot on the M\u00C3\u0192\u00C2\u00BCn where there are 7 (or was it 9) biomes within walking distance of each other all because of this bug. Since the biome map is just used to look up the biome and not drawn on the screen it should not be interpolated. I have no idea how difficult that is to achieve in Unity though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
