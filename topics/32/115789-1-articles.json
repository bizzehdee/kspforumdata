One of my coworkers and I originally set it up to discuss things while playing on our lunch times, but we\u0027ve decided to open it up to the public. As of this posting, we are the only two members, so you\u0027re being invited to be some of the first members! Simply follow this link: [ksptalk.com](http://ksptalk.com/) and submit your email address; it will automatically send you an invitation email.\n\nWe have channels including [#assembly](https://ksptalk.slack.com/archives/assembly), [#mods](https://ksptalk.slack.com/archives/mods), [#orbiting](https://ksptalk.slack.com/archives/orbiting), and [#screenshots](https://ksptalk.slack.com/archives/screenshots)\n\nStop by today!\n\n**What is Slack?** ([https://slack.com/](https://slack.com/))\n\n\u0022Slack is a messaging app for teams: everything in one place, instantly searchable.\u0022 \n\nFrom companies to video games, there are many slack communities popping up."},{"CreatedByName":"mbx","CreatedById":124137,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T13:23:58Z","Content":"Is ksptalk.slack still active? ksptalk.com has currently no dns entry.

If you\u0027re really interested, you might try sending that user a PM, since a lot of people have their forum notifications set up so that they get an email notification when someone PMs them.  No guarantee that that\u0027s the case here, of course, but at least there\u0027s a chance you might reach them even if they\u0027re not checking the forum."},{"CreatedByName":"TheKosmonaut","CreatedById":40652,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T15:35:41Z","Content":"You might also want to look into the Discord instead, or hop on over to the IRC!"},{"CreatedByName":"Cpt Kerbalkrunch","CreatedById":175588,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-06-30T15:39:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E 4 minutes ago, Snark said:\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\u003E Given that this was posted two years ago, by a person who made only one post, and whose last log-on time was only a few days after he posted it, I\u0027m going to go out on a limb here and guess that the answer to your question is \u0022no\u0022\n\u003E \n\n[@Snark](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/125662-snark/) gettin\u0027 snarky.

I like it.\n\u003E \n\nNot at all, but this is getting off-topic so I\u0027ll put my response in a spoiler section.\n\nSpoiler\n\nThe person I was responding to is fairly new here, and it\u0027s quite common for new folks not to notice things that have become second nature to us old codgers, like checking how many posts a person has made, or how long since they logged in, or how old the thread its.  It\u0027s an easy mistake to make, and we were all new once.  Nothing at all wrong with that.\n\nSo basically I was just trying to provide, 1. an answer to the question, and 2. helpful tips on how to answer such questions oneself in the future, and 3. a small leavening of humor to lighten the mood (and also indicate that hey, I actually *\u003Cu\u003Ecould\u003C/u\u003E* be wrong and it might still be a thing somewhere).\n\nSo actually my intention was the exact opposite of \u0022snarky\u0022, though in hindsight I can see how it would be easy to read my post that way.  So, just to be clear, in case there\u0027s any doubt:  No mockery intended, even slightly.  ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif \u0022:)\u0022)  Just trying to be helpful.\n\n(And for the Nth time, that particular usage of the word \u0022snark\u0022 is not the [etymology of my username](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunting_of_the_Snark), which I\u0027ve been using since before *\u003Cu\u003Ethat\u003C/u\u003E* usage was a thing (yes, I\u0027m old), though I suppose it\u0027s unreasonable of me to expect that to be anything but a losing battle.  Oh well.)"}]}
