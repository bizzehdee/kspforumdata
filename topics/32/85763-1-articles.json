I don\u0027t really want to start a debate or get folks riled up, I\u0027d prefer to keep things light and positive, I\u0027m just wondering how the people who complain that this will make the game harder/more annoying are justifying it, considering that most likely, people revert.

I don\u0027t like reverting but especially for silly things, like grabbing one of my lift stages from subassemblies and the struts and fuel pipes get omitted somehow and I don\u0027t see it. Failures because of that I usually revert. I try to build unmanned \u0022test\u0022 rockets but that gets spendy. This is a deep problem that I feel the career system doesn\u0027t really take into account.

I was pretty proud of that. Today I had a stranded kerbal running low on life support and managed to get him off minmus by landing my entire starship (oversized service module) on minmus. Never would have tried that otherwise. Screw-ups are bound to happen and they can be frustrating but some of them pose interesting challenges, specially when using life support and RT2.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Linear","CreatedById":26619,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T21:05:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s always the bloody staging.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"TimberWolffe","CreatedById":119811,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-30T21:10:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI laugh, repeat twice (explosions are fun) and then revise the design.
