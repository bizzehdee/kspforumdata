Side-note, I play 100% stock, not even MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had some plans for a friday night that fell through, so I was stuck at home with nothing to do. 0.18 had just come out, which I had been pretty psyched about, so I was like, \u0022Hey, I should build me a space station!\u0022 So I sent up some simple orbiters to attach together to get used to docking controls, and then I built what I called a \u0022Space Tug\u0022, a craft that can not only throw heavy stuff into orbit, but also maneuver said heavy junk with finesse and precision. Basically a big ol\u0027 tugboat in space for docking unpowered stuff (space station parts, large ship parts, etc). An hour and some test flights later, and the Space Wawa core was up and running in an almost perfectly circular 100km orbit. Four hours after that, the Space Wawa has almost 500 parts, four of the large orange 36 ton fuel tanks all topped off, and lots of hitchhiker containers for travelling Kerbals to spend the night. At this point, it was around 2 o\u0027clock and I had had quite a long day, so I decided to call it a night and go to sleep. I\u0027ll test it in the morning.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next day, lots of unexpected junk came up, followed by even more unexpected junk, followed by a week\u0027s worth of massive piles of homework, and then I just forgot about the Space Wawa altogether. Fast-forward to last weekend, and I booted KSP up for the first time in a while to find that there was an update. I was about to update it when I remembered the Space Wawa and said to myself, \u0022Self, you should just test out the Space Wawa at least once before you upgrade, just in case the update somehow breaks it.\u0022 I thanked myself for the suggestion and resolved to do so. Just as I finished building my Eve lander, I got a phone call from my girlfriend telling me that \u003Cem\u003Eher\u003C/em\u003E plans fell through and that she was free for the night. Naturally, I decided to postpone docking my rocket to my space station and spent the day hanging out and playing music, followed by a romantic dinner, followed by docking my rocket to the space station. And then I went home and got back on KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I get my lander up in orbit with my tanks about half empty, and set up a rendezvous with the Space WaWa. I set the Space WaWa as target and wait. And wait. And wait. A few orbits later, and we\u0027re close enough to start docking maneuvers. This is it. The first real test of both my lander and my space station and my skills as a rocket scientist. The moment of truth. I\u0027m getting closer. Closer. Man I\u0027m tired. \u003Cem\u003ECloser. CLOSER.\u003C/em\u003E Wait, how do I read the nav ball doohickey for docking again? What\u0027s the pink circle thingy? Oh wait, what are even the docking controls?

They are the three pilots of the lander and two crew in a hitchhiker, and they are the lucky ones. The two captains in the control room are sent spinning back into the atmosphere. They\u0027re on the opposite side of the planet from KSC, there isn\u0027t enough time to launch a rescue mission. The station was never designed to re-enter, there were no parachutes. As one group in Mission Control guided a rescue rocket to save the Kerbals in the surviving Hitchhiker containers stuck in orbit, another watches helplessly from the tracking station as the Space WaWa captains plummet to Kerbin. Ten minutes later, the rescue rocket approaches the first of the two remaining Hitchhikers, with four Kerbals trapped inside. They come in close for a rescue before realizing that in my excitement and horror and general tired state, my skill at piloting an EVA kerbal has absolutely plummetted as some miscellaneous Kerbal crashes into the side of the rescue ship and goes spinning off into space. At that point he was still rescueable, but I just completely gave up and decided to put them out of their misery by deleting the save before updating to 0.20.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis post was written in memory of the brave crew of the Space WaWa, and the Kerbals on the ground who did everything in their power to save them. 5/25/2013.

I just experienced my most spectacular fail to date:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was launching a heavy lift rocket, but somehow subassembly loader decided to unattach most of my fuel transfer lines. So I started my ascent just fine then at about 6k I started to spin a little, and soon it was a heavy end to end tumble. By this time one of my mainsail boosters was empty, but it\u0027s twin was still full. So I hit the stage button and a nearly full mainsail booster took off away from my ship and my empty one fell harmlessly away. I then was able to stabilize my ascent and I think I had a small chance at actually reaching LKO...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut the booster I had ejected had another idea. He had apparently gotten the memo that I wasn\u0027t going to space today and executed a perfect loop-d-loop. And after about 10-15 seconds I noticed he was coming back around to remind me of this fact. He bowled a perfect strike into the rest of the rocket shattering it to bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo in conclusion. If just one booster says he doesn\u0027t feel like going to space today, just tossing him aside doesn\u0027t always solve the problem.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo wish i had recorded this.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CosmoTot","CreatedById":68233,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-02T07:31:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI learned a valuable lesson today.
