Okay, there is a mod for that already, but it would be fun for to see how would be the one made by Squad...\n\nAnd perhaps some new solar system with moar challenge...

As well as posing risk of death to Kerbals for being in them too long. Perhaps adding radiation shielding parts to counter this. So possibly a new resource of rads that accumulate when in those spots. And EVA would =instant death.\n\nMicrometeorite or similar damages to ships that an engineer must look for and repair. If damage is to a tank, it would slowly leak, damage to a solar panel or RTG or antenna would cause it to not work etc... This could be something that would take you out of a time warp and notify you of the damage.\n\nMore things to do on the ground that require more planning. Like taking a surface sample requires searching for a good one and not just any old clump or rock or sand, and you need a piece of equipment to do this and not just put it in your pocket..."},{"CreatedByName":"The_Rocketeer","CreatedById":81727,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-17T17:16:19Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Would make sense since all the kerbals always have their helmets on in stock.
