In my vision of the game, the tech tree would only be the \u0022tutorial\u0022 part of the campaign: let the players discover the parts gradually rather than throwing the whole toolbox at them all at once. But it\u0027s fine with me if you can have pretty much everything after a few visits to the Mun. Getting to Jool is difficult enough, I don\u0027t need the additional \u0022challenge\u0022 of having to do it on inferior parts. Besides, what would be the point of Kerbodyne Launchers and large docking ports if you could only get them *after* the big missions? The current admin strategies are a bit too much though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn a similar fashion, I\u0027m quite fond of the \u0022free money\u0022 missions. If I need to plant a dozen flags in order to finance my next mission, that gives me a nice sense of tedium (and is enough to make me consider launch costs), but I like how it doesn\u0027t actually stop me from doing anything. The flag and science missions strike a nice balance in this regard; what troubles me is making half a million from a simple part test in Kerbin orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESomehow I guess the finished game will be quite different, though.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can see the point of the tech tree as a tutorial, but it would make more sense if the order of the nodes\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 made sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe real point is to have some sort of, well, \u003Cem\u003Epoint\u003C/em\u003E.
