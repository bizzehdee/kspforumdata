My impactor was pretty small and basic, but as I worked along to the manned vehicle, designs, grew, shall we say. \n\nWe launched to the space station. Four crew were already present on the station in LKO, as was the command module of the four part lunar ship. The new crew, three of the six for the Mun vehicle, boarded, partied, and looked through the windows, as the massive fuel tank was launched at sunset. Later came a larger habitat, and the lander itself, as well as three new crew members in a fuel carrying craft.\n\nAfter all was arranged, all the Kerbalnauts at their stations, the commander sitting looked out the window over the solar areas, and detatched, firing the cold gas thrusters slightly to pushe away from the station, comprable in size to the component that had just left it.\n\nThe hours went by, and the station grew smaller in the windows of the ship. As we got into position, the liquid fuel engine was fired, setting up a course for a 10 km orbit of the Mun, or there about. This proceeded well, a few days later the first landing pair climbed into their vehicle, detatched, and fired retrograde, slowly falling away from their comrades. \n\nFuel was getting short, but not so much so that it posed a problem. We landed on the rim of a large crater, and took what turned out to be too liberal of a flight with the MMU, 10km of walking uphil is slow. Launch back was fairly good, and the docking strained but acheived. It seemed the mission was over, but still, we needed to wait for the Kerbin return leg. THat happened some months later, if I recall correctly, after anoher few Mun landings (everyone got their turn)."},{"CreatedByName":"bitbucket","CreatedById":6676,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:14:43Z","Content":"Excessive horizontal velocity, explosions, and tears."},{"CreatedByName":"KanadianCerbal","CreatedById":107127,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T19:26:06Z","Content":"Version 0.21.1 Landed on the Mun horizontally.

I figured I just had to watch the craft, watch the ground, and try to estimate what needed to be done. Of course the lander was rotated around such that pressing the WASD keys bore no bearing on which way it would actually tilt, so we had a lot of pilot errors and crashes due to tilting the wrong way before I finally got it right.\n\nLandings got a lot easier after I made the little mental leap that the nav ball retrograde marker was your friend on a landing. :-)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-12T20:10:37Z\u0022 title=\u002205/12/2015 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 12, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Yakky**"},{"CreatedByName":"tater","CreatedById":119411,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T20:10:18Z","Content":"I landed after a beer or so\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 think I was in science mode?
