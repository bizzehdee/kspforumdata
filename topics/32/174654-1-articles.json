is a problem I have seen from time to time but recently it is getting severe.\u00A0 The problem is the approach markers will jump to a completely erroneous position when changing the maneuver node slightly or sometimes when I go to space port and then reload the vessel the markers are out of whack.\u00A0 Sometimes as I\u0027m doing a manual burn to fine tune my approach the marker will show decreasing distance and then all of a sudden jump to a position on the opposite side of the orbit.\u00A0 It\u0027s very frustrating and makes getting encounters to planets with eccentric orbits very difficult.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBefore I get into all the mods I\u0027m running and everything, I\u0027m wondering if anyone else has seen similar behavior.\u00A0 Is this a known problem.\u00A0 I\u0027ve searched the forums and reddit and haven\u0027t found anything quite like what I\u0027m seeing.\u00A0 Mostly just conversations about \u0022always show closest approach\u0022 setting.\u00A0 Any thoughts?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"pandaman","CreatedById":130621,"CreatedDateTime":"2018-05-06T07:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes i noticed\u00A0that

usually the current orbit\u0027s inclination being too far\u00A0off.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThis means there will be a \u0027closest possible\u0027,\u00A0until you fiddle with another handle a bit and can squeeze it a bit more (which works within the constraints\u00A0of your current relative inclination).\u00A0 So once you pass\u00A0that \u0027closest possible\u0027 point it just \u0027tips it over the edge\u0027 and it jumps to a completely different point.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell, that\u0027s my theory
