Clearly, Isp and price are easy to pin down, since they are linear to relative worth. All things being equal, an engine that does the same thing for half the price is twice as good. Likewise, all else being equal, doubling the Isp doubles the worth of an engine. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E But this is not the case with t/w ratio. Doubling the t/w of an engine won\u0027t make it twice as good. Depending on where it was to begin with, a doubling could have a much more dramatic effect or no noticeable gain at all in the performance of the vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBasically, doubling the t/w is saying I\u0027m carrying half the mass of engine for the amount of thrust, leaving more payload and fuel, but that won\u0027t be twice as much. For it to be truly linear and scalable, we\u0027d have to take a natural log of the (engine mass\u002Bfull fuel tanks\u002Bpayload)/(engine mass\u002Bempty fuel tanks\u002Bpayload)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E The question is where to set fuel vs. payload and where to set the sum total of both for an apples-to-apples comparison. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Would setting the fuel\u002Btanks in a stage equal to payload at 1G generate a useful ballpark datum for Kerbin launches?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOpen to suggestions,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Slashy\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-11-04T02:10:58Z\u0022 title=\u002211/04/2014 02:10  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 4, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by GoSlash27\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T03:55:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou can compare thrust, specific impulse, and price, as they are all linear quantities.

The score is then the weight of those engines. This is a direct calculation from TWR, so effectively ignores the other factors, while still giving a number that is more linearly representative of capability.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem is very low TWR engines can\u0027t make the minimum goal (Nuclear has trouble making 2.0, the ship needs to be 80% engine... Ion struggles to make 0.5). Of course, if rating engines for launch capability this makes sense... nukes ARE terrible launch engines, an ions simply can\u0027t launch at all. On the flip-side, both are really handy in space.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing to consider is you probably want to normalize the price to something like price per kN of thrust... otherwise smaller engines are getting a bit of an unfair advantage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"cantab","CreatedById":104935,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-11-04T13:43:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMass, cost, and thrust are like extensive properties.

It\u0027s pretty simple to check - if your figure of merit changes when you consider a pair of the engine, it\u0027s not a valid figure of merit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately I think a simplified version of tavert\u0027s approach is best. Impose a required delta-V and initial TWR, assume for simplicity that you can use fractional engines, and work out the price per ton of payload for the various engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is though a gotcha. A multi-stage rocket where each stage is mass-optimal will be mass optimal in total, but a multi-stage rocket where each stage is price-optimal may not be price-optimal in total because if the upper stage is cheap but heavy it becomes a bigger payload for the stage below. This may limit the use of these figures.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
