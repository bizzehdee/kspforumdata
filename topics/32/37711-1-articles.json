I am also able to change the probe speed from just reaching the Mun to actualy gain enough speed to leave into Kerbol orbit, without using any fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShouldn\u0027t it then be possible to save alot of dV by using the gravity og ex Duna when traveling to Jool or Eeloo?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd if so, are you using it, or is it just to much waste of time?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"EmissionGeneration","CreatedById":71859,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T07:45:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, it sounds like you enjoy playing the Game in a more Real sense, and due to the fact that Gravity assists are used in RL, then I\u0027d suggest you do it.

And I guees you could try it, but I dont think you should. Keep in mind the gravity on minmus is tiny and you really should slow down because it is very easy to overshoot the SOI\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Accelerando","CreatedById":543,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-19T07:50:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA long time ago, I flew one of Giggleplex\u0027s flyby probes (New Horizons) to Eve, Duna, and Jool primarily using gravity assists. First Eve to boost me back out to Duna, then Duna to boost my orbit out to near-Dres, and Eve again to set up for a Jool capture. Gravity assists can indeed propel you across the solar system with a small amount of setup \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0V, but unless you plan them out (which I do not know how to do), they can take years of waiting to set up. Setting a planet as target helps tremendously, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
