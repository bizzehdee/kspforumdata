Basically, it involves a huge multiplayer change. Things like factions, International space stations, private bases, stock parts that include weaponry, and all around crazy. Right now, KSP mimics current space programs, basic orbits and satellites, as well as some interplanetary (in the next update) travel. But I think when we look at Earth\u0027s space program, we can see space fighting in the next few centuries. So, why not include that into the KSP game. It would be a huge boost to the game, making this not only the best space simulator game, but also the best space fighting game. I am tired so excuse my bad grammar/spelling/stupidity. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I hope Squad looks at this and puts it in mind. I don\u0027t expect anything in the next couple updates, but I think this would be an awesome thing to look into implementing. This game has so much potential, and is already addictive as hell in Alpha. Again, this gives us a new objective: Build, conquer, fight. Not just travel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThank you so very much if you put the time into reading this ******** of a text paste thing.

The single player game will be done and complete before Squad even looks at the concept simply due to the difficulties of issues like warping.
