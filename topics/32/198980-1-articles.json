I am assuming you are experiencing this issue in the PC version of the game and I will focus my observations on that version. There are a few other things which can cause this issue to happen:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003E\nYou are maxing out your system\u0027s memory and it is using virtual ram (on Win10 machines). This slows down the game to a crawl at times.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou are using a lot of memory intensive mods, which ^^^\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nYou are using an out of date or messed up mod that\u0027s throwing errors whenever you try to place it in the craft editor.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\nThe best way to do is to periodically save your design progress as you build your craft. This way, if the game does go wonky, you at least have some progress saved. And unless it causes the game to freeze, simply exit the craft editor and then go back into the editor and reload the saved craft file. It should take you back to the last time you saved it and still be able to continue developing the craft.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
