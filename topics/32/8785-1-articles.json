This would make navigating around other space crafts so much easier, as of right now I tend to get the directional keys mixed up in space when using the RCS controls because the craft is constantly changing directions different from the cameras.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso what kinds of plans are there for optimization? The game lags severely when building complex rockets and I have a relatively powerful machine. It feels so unnecessary to me for 12 different rockets all going off at the same time to be casting individual particle effects when they could potentially just be replaced by a larger less dense particle effect when they are grouped (this goes for explosions too).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Elude","CreatedById":20681,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-29T18:17:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EBump \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI suppose both these questions don\\\u0027t have to be answered as I\\\u0027m sure optimization techniques like the one I posted would obviously be done in later versions of the game.

I\\\u0027ve yet to make the purchase to the full game yet and have been playing the demo hours on end but I have been keeping tabs on what has changed from version to version, it would be awesome to see such a feature when I have finally made up my decision to buy it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks and best of luck!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rico88","CreatedById":3712,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-03-29T19:44:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDon\\\u0027t worry.
