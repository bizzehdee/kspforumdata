Especially factoring in the limited benefits of this method. The shuttle, while very impressive and even iconic, was a huge boondoggle and waste of money.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, all of that said, I actually have been experimenting with true NASA shuttle designs with no ridiculous gimmicks like counterweights or SRBs on the shuttle itself, and as others have pointed out, there\u0027s only one way to really make it work, and that\u0027s by angling the shuttle\u0027s main engines so their direction of thrust passes through the center of mass on the shuttle stack. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESounds easy, right? Not so much since your center of mass is going to shift as you consume fuel from your main tank. This means you\u0027ll either need to be a design savant, or you\u0027ll need some way of angling the engines in flight or at least controlling their thrust on an individual basis. You may be a design savant. If so, I\u0027d love to see your shuttle design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf not though there are two mods that will at least make this somewhat possible. Neither is going to make this easy by any stretch of the imagination, but at least it will give you the tools you need to succeed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first mod I found is the \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/18-2-throttle-steering/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EThrottle Steering\u003C/a\u003E. This mod will dynamically alter the throttle settings on the active engines based on steering inputs, both manual, ASAS, and Remote Tech. Probably Mechjeb too, but I don\u0027t use it. This is useful, as you\u0027ll be able to have the main ascent engines offset at an angle, as well as non-angled orbital maneuvering engines (OMS) and this mod will alter the thrust between the various sets of engines during ascent, effectively altering your center of thrust. Its a bit finicky, and requires a decent amount of babysitting, but I have been able to get a small conventional shuttle into orbit with this mod. A tip, have action groups set up to switch between the various engine clusters. During initial ascent, you\u0027ll probably need to shut down the OMS engines. Once your main tank is nearing empty, you\u0027ll probably need to shut off your main engines. Action groups will make that a lot easier. Also, while this mod is extremely effective, its not foolproof. You\u0027ll still need to finesse the throttle on the way up. I\u0027ve also found its easier if the shuttle is in the ventral position position to the fuel tank during ascent. Which makes sense, as I believe the real shuttle maintains that position during ascent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next mod that will (maybe) make your shuttle aspirations a reality is \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/damnedrobotics/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EDamned Robotics\u003C/a\u003E. Truthfully, I\u0027ve not used this mod to make a shuttle (that\u0027s next), but it does include powered hinges which could act as an effective gimbal for your main engines during ascent. You\u0027ll need to manually adjust the engine angle all the way up, but in theory, this will allow even more control than the throttle steering mod. I\u0027ve seen a few examples of people who do this, and it does seem to work pretty well. You might also be able to trim a bit of weight off of your shuttle with this mod, since you can remove the requirement for dedicated OMS engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHmm, again I\u0027ve been a bit too verbose in my post. I really need to work on that. Anyway, one final thing, don\u0027t think of these mods as cheating. I promise you. They won\u0027t make it \u0022easy\u0022 to create a NASA style shuttle.
