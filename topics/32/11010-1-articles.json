Landing gear location. This is surprisingly important. Think of your aircraft as one big sea-saw. If you put your rear wheels at the very back, it\\\u0027s going to be near impossible for the elevators to \\\u0027lever\\\u0027 the nose up. The best location for your rear wheels is just behind your aircraft centre of lift (just behind the wings). It DOES mean you have a risk of destroying your tail if you get over excited with your take off, but that\\\u0027s an issue with real world aircraft too...\n\n2. Keep your aircraft balanced. Unfortunately while burning fuel your weight will shift. As a rule of thumb, it\\\u0027s better to be nose heavy than tail heavy.\n\n3. Don\\\u0027t bother with ailerons! but do put rudders and elevators on your aircraft. Your command module will roll fine without ailerons anyway and thanks to the code in KSP your \\\u0027elevators\\\u0027 will also do the work of the ailerons for your...\n\nAnd one last thing... Have a free jet fighter/stunt plane!\n\nYou might need a joystick or be really good with a keyboard to fly this jet, but it\\\u0027s a lot of fun \n\n(SAS and hitting capslock is recommended!)"},{"CreatedByName":"rkman","CreatedById":15721,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:21:07Z","Content":"In my experience larger airplanes are more stable than small ones, and even large planes need only a minimum of control surfaces. \n\nMy most stable airplane so far has control surfaces only on the canard and the tail wings, none on the main wing."},{"CreatedByName":"sal_vager","CreatedById":16426,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:21:35Z","Content":"Canards are just front mounted tail surfaces, I have a few planes with more conventional layout and canards only at the back, but C7\\\u0027s stuff does make combat jets too easy to make.\n\n@BamBam, yeah that\\\u0027ll work, you\\\u0027ll move the center of lift as well so watch for that.\n\nBtw I find rudders are not much use as they make craft roll in an unwanted fashion, but that\\\u0027s just my preference ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"BamBam","CreatedById":11581,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T14:29:59Z","Content":"here is my other attempt\n\na bit easier to fly, still hard to get off the ground.\n\ni will modify this later on with moving the wheels forward, and use bigger canards. maybe that will help"},{"CreatedByName":"JellyCubes","CreatedById":11002,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T15:04:23Z","Content":"You can try to attach the canards to your aircraft with a positive angle of attack in the space plane hanger to increase forward lift.
