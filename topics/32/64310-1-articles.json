The craft worked perfectly except for a staging mishap in Kerbin orbit and a slightly too low engine (1 out of 3) when landing on the Mun, but other than that everything went well. The ship landed, jeb took all the science from his ship and brought it to the capsule of his new rescue ship which is connected to a reaction wheel and then connected to the Mk 1 airplane capsule. Getting back was flawless, except for the parachute. I had only put chutes on the airplane capsule, not the rescue one. So when the chutes deployed, I was powerless watching Jeb\u0027s capsule snap off from Bill\u0027s and plummet to the ground...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn hour of work reverted away \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:(\u0022\u003E Next time I\u0027ll put a chute on Jeb\u0027s capsule as well.
