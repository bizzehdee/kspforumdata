Also I here KSP has now gone to 64bit. Is this true or just rumor? If its true how do I get the 64bit version? I use steam to run KSP so I\u0027m not sure if it just gives me the 64 edition or if I have to find it elsewhere?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"LostElement","CreatedById":78368,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T16:51:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYup KSP is 64bit. But its optional. You go into the KSP files and it says KSP_64x. Run that and your KSP is running 64bit. You can run more mods but 64bit is buggy, and some mods aren\u0027t compatible with 64bit. Use at your own risk.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-09-10T17:08:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, if you\u0027ve got Steam, that will keep running 32-bit by default.
