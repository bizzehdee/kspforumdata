My trial runs with the rocket had shown that I\u0027d save total dV if they could burn a little longer, and why add more fuel when I didn\u0027t actually need to? Once in orbit, I could just transfer fuel back from the remaining center stack before ditching it to fall back to Kerbin.\n\nThis rocket, which in early testing had been pretty rock solid on the ascent, started flipping like a baton no matter how well I kept it in the airflow, no matter how many fins I put on the bottom, and no matter how much I tried to correct manually.\n\nNow at this point, from what I see in so many posts in this forum, most people would have thrown their arms up and complained that KSP was killing their fun. Instead, I looked at it, thought about it, and realized my problem. By emptying the fuel out of the top of the rocket, I was making the whole thing EXTREMELY bottom heavy. I was - to continue to overuse an overused analogy - throwing a dart backward. Putting the feathers on the arrow head won\u0027t make it fly backwards, to overuse another analogy.\n\nSo I undid my change, found a better way to add a little more time to my early boost stage, and the rocket made orbit with the payload intact. I could even deviate significantly from prograde very low in the atmosphere and at high speed, all because I (re)applied a little aerodynamics know-how.\n\nSo thank you, Squad, for introducing that sort of necessary thinking into the game."},{"CreatedByName":"Xkay7","CreatedById":129537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T13:46:44Z","Content":"A thousand and one threads complaining about rockets flipping for no reason and finally someone understands the problem.

You just need a bigger rocket and lower speed. It\u0027s a bit easier, though, since the lack of FAR\u0027s destructive aerodynamic forces means complex constructions and unprotected equipment are less likely to break apart when coming close to sonic speed.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E I just wish we had more tools to control fuel flow in the rockets.

The produceral parts mod allow you to avoid those issues, since you can make a single tanks as large as you want.\n\n[http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106975-0-90-Procedural-Parts-Parts-the-way-you-want-em-v1-0-Jan-11](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106975-0-90-Procedural-Parts-Parts-the-way-you-want-em-v1-0-Jan-11)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-16T16:08:47Z\u0022 title=\u002205/16/2015 04:08  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter**"},{"CreatedByName":"Bill Phil","CreatedById":127797,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T16:40:40Z","Content":"Yeah, people don\u0027t often realize that the old rules of thumb won\u0027t work anymore...\n\nI\u0027m glad some do."},{"CreatedByName":"hellion13","CreatedById":66719,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T17:31:40Z","Content":"I\u0027m actually flying rockets immensely better than before thanks to the new aero.

Around 340m/s a rocket will reach the most dangerous part of the sound barrier and around the highest level of drag you\u0027ll encounter.\n\nI recommend activating the aerodynamic overlay via F12.

Possible there is just some part of your rockets/gravity turn where fins indeed cause trouble.
