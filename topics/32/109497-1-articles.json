My trial runs with the rocket had shown that I\u0027d save total dV if they could burn a little longer, and why add more fuel when I didn\u0027t actually need to? Once in orbit, I could just transfer fuel back from the remaining center stack before ditching it to fall back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis rocket, which in early testing had been pretty rock solid on the ascent, started flipping like a baton no matter how well I kept it in the airflow, no matter how many fins I put on the bottom, and no matter how much I tried to correct manually.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow at this point, from what I see in so many posts in this forum, most people would have thrown their arms up and complained that KSP was killing their fun. Instead, I looked at it, thought about it, and realized my problem. By emptying the fuel out of the top of the rocket, I was making the whole thing EXTREMELY bottom heavy. I was - to continue to overuse an overused analogy - throwing a dart backward. Putting the feathers on the arrow head won\u0027t make it fly backwards, to overuse another analogy.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I undid my change, found a better way to add a little more time to my early boost stage, and the rocket made orbit with the payload intact. I could even deviate significantly from prograde very low in the atmosphere and at high speed, all because I (re)applied a little aerodynamics know-how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo thank you, Squad, for introducing that sort of necessary thinking into the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xkay7","CreatedById":129537,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-16T13:46:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EA thousand and one threads complaining about rockets flipping for no reason and finally someone understands the problem.
