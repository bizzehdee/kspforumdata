Even a halfway competant testing system would have found the major issues in literally ten minutes of play. Either the testers where not give 1.0 as it released, or they where not listened to, or they testers chosen where some bizarre element of the community that uses kerbal to simulate truck driving or something. (unlikely)\n\nI agree with this too. It might seem like v1.0 was tested properly... from the standpoint of the handfull of testers that did it in a breakneck pace over a bunch of rushed weeks. Is clear now that v1.0 needed either more testers to work out bugs in such a hurry, or more testing time with the current batch of testers.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T21:12:01Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 09:12  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Wooks**"},{"CreatedByName":"Lord Aurelius","CreatedById":71687,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:09:40Z","Content":"@Aerindel\n\nI very much agree with this. Bugs in any release are more or less inevitable, but when major gameplay-affecting bugs that show themselves within 10 minutes make it into the release (especially one as significant as 1.0), there\u0027s something wrong with the system.\n\nI\u0027m glad that Squad is dedicated to supporting this game and pushing out hotfixes, but as Aerindel said, they shouldn\u0027t have been necessary.\n\n@Yemo\n\nVery much this as well. I think a big part of the reason the community is so polarized right now is that there\u0027s basically two groups of people: those who treat 1.0 as just another release number, and those who understand that particular number to be something significant. If this had been just another early access release, there would still have been some complaints for the things the hotfixes addressed, but by and large it would have been a very positive update because the new aero and heating system especially really addressed some of the things missing from this game.\n\nIf you take 1.0 to mean that the game is \u0022finished\u0022, then it is easy to see why so many people are frustrated. IMHO, this game still feels like it\u0027s in early access, and still lacks polish in a lot of areas. Granted, a lot of games at 1.0 have issues (even big AAA releases), but just because \u0022everyone else is doing it\u0022 and treating 1.0 like a public beta doesn\u0027t mean that it\u0027s the best way to do things.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-04T19:28:59Z\u0022 title=\u002205/04/2015 07:28  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 4, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Lord Aurelius**"},{"CreatedByName":"Nachtwind","CreatedById":41015,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-04T19:12:57Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E What was totally insane was to introduce entire new classes of gameplay without testing.

That is the entire point. In order for people to even start to think about change they have to be upset. \n\nYou keep trying to say I am claiming to be a hotshot or something but that I\u0027ve said nothing of the sort and its entirely besides the point. The gameplay problems with 1.0 where not things you needed to be good at the game to find. They where things that a novice player would have run into on his second or third launch. The only difference is that a novice player wouldn\u0027t have known that it wasn\u0027t supposed to be that way, he would have just thought the it was a bad game. \n\nMaybe that was the problem? all the testers where so experienced they never tried a simple rocket re-entry? There is a real problem in many fields where people become overqualified and start missing the basics. I\u0027m an EMT and help write standard operation procedures for a fire department and see it all the time where people who are trained in advanced techniques lose sight of the actual job at hand in favor of specific procedures. I honestly could see that happening. If I hadn\u0027t started KSP over from scratch with 1.0 it could have been a long time before I ran into some of the problems.\n\nI just don\u0027t know, I wasn\u0027t on the test team, I don\u0027t know how it works...I only know what the results where. \n\n- \n\n\u003E \n\u003E I would think there is a more constructive topic at hand which is = \u0022How might squad optimize future releases to take advantage of community input without compromising established internal testing and QA processes?\n\nEstablished QA\n\n*is*\n\ncompromised.\n\nBut I do have a suggestion: the testing phase should be divided between teams testing for stability and performance and a team that is testing actual gameplay as those are really very different problems. There is no doubt that 1.0 had less technical bugs and had better performance, but that is like saying that a book was really good because it didn\u0027t have any spelling errors. Where the testing team failed was in looking at the actually\n\n*experience*\n\nof the game. How the new features made you feel while using them.\n\nInstead of bug reports they should have asked for psych reports. They should ask people how re-entry felt in 1.0 rather than just asking if the game crashed or not. If you read the various slam posts on 1.0 very few of them are about technical details but rather about the emotion that the game creates, or fails to create.\n\nThe second and most obvious issue was that they moved way too fast, adding entire classes of new features in one update without a beta. New Aero, a heating system, a mining system, a heat shield system, these weren\u0027t just updates, these where entirely new fundamental systems that where just thrown out in the wild, all at once, when normally any ONE of these would have been a major new release.\n\nLuckily, about 80% of the problems with 1.0 where fixed in 1.02. The only reason we are even talking about this still is because this type of incident is not normal for KSP and it has people rattled. Lets face it, we are in a dark age of gaming right now, the industry as a whole is floundering around, AAA is releasing broken and boring content and trying to squeeze more money out of us while doing it. The indie scene is in chaos with true gems, shovelware and vapor ware all competing for attention. FTP and PTW games are poisoning every level of the industry. Kerbal is one of the very few good things to come out of gaming in the last few years, and it almost shot itself in the head with its big official release.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T12:17:12Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 12:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by DuoDex**"},{"CreatedByName":"rockowwc","CreatedById":138930,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T11:38:23Z","Content":"God forbid any of these people paid the big dollars for Watch Dogs..

But add in another \u0027test group\u0027, taken from experienced players of varying styles, they are then given (with relevant NDAs of course) a copy to just play with and get general real world \u0027in play\u0027 feedback, in essence a more controlled way of releasing a beta version out to the world so as to reduce the quantity and proportion of unhelpful responses. This could help find some of the balance issues and more obscure \u0027anomalies\u0027 that only seemed to show up in the pre release live streams or after we all got our hands on it.\n\nThis is basically the system we already have--and it doesn\u0027t work. What they need to do is keep the Experimentals and Q\u0026A teams more or less as they are, but leverage the Beta option on Steam more effectively. After the Experimentals and Q\u0026A teams have at the game, use the Betas tab in Steam to release a \u0022Pre-Release\u0022 build based on that smaller team\u0027s feedback. This build is open to the whole community, but doesn\u0027t force anyone, at least for the moment, to use it. Anyone who is interested opts in to the Beta, plays it, and provides feedback on a public Beta Builds forum that the devs watch closely.\n\nMinecraft, Project Zomboid, StarMade, Subnautica and other games use a system just like this and their respective communities really appreciate it. Not sure why Squad doesn\u0027t--maybe it will \u0022delay\u0022 the process of updating? But Squad is independent. They make their own deadlines and like Blizzard can say to the community \u0022It\u0027s done when it\u0027s done, now test this sucker for as long as you can.\u0022\n\nThat way there is an ever-increasing pool of testers from truly all segments of the KSP community critiquing the game. At least for me, things like the 1.0 release heatshield bug, while annoying and seemingly obvious, aren\u0027t the issue--it could have been an honest mistake toggling a flag that shouldn\u0027t have been toggled while addressing other Q\u0026A feedback literally moments before pushing the update. \n\nThe issue is huge balance revisions that increase the drag for every part across the board that can or have the potential to render whole fleets of rockets useless across the entire player-base with no warning. The Steam Beta tab feature is a way to work around that while experimenting with the balancing of features.\n\nHot-fixes and bug fixes are good...across the board gameplay balances implemented with no discussion (even if they are marketed as \u0022fixes\u0022 or provide a \u0022better\u0022 game) are not so much, regardless of whether or not it takes the game in a favorable dimension. If Mojang for example wanted to \u0022fix\u0022 building in Minecraft by incorporating a physics based structural integrity simulation, while making people craft a \u0022cement\u0022 item to make placed blocks stick together if they don\u0027t have direct contact with the ground (i.e. no more floating houses in the sky), the game might be more fun because it involves management of another resource and also make the game more \u0022realistic\u0022. However, whole structures across the entire player-base would come tumbling down.\n\nMojang, however, before they implemented such a game-changing feature would release it during their opt-in Pre-Release build phase the whole Minecraft community can take part in. For some reason Squad makes similar game changing, uh...changes, but does not involve the community in this manner, using instead a very small group of players relative to the ever-expanding player-base.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-05T17:11:32Z\u0022 title=\u002205/05/2015 05:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 5, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Scourge013**"},{"CreatedByName":"HafCoJoe","CreatedById":80363,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-05T17:25:00Z","Content":"I gotta say that all you devs and testers are amazing.
