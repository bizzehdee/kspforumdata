Some day in the near future, we\u0027re probably going to get to a point where the limitations that Unity places on the game will outweigh the benefits of continuing to use it. I think at that point\u2014or honestly, even now\u2014it\u0027d be easier to build a brand new game from scratch in a custom, dedicated engine than it would be to try to port it to a new engine while also overhauling it.  \n\nI know it\u0027s hard to imagine multiple installations (in the sense of a series of things, not .exe\u0027s), since the game just updates here and there to add new things, and we\u0027re all just used to that cycle. It\u0027s hard to imagine that there\u0027d ever be a *last* update. But I can definitely see a point in the future where a brand new KSP would make more sense, and frankly, I\u0027d welcome it. I really honestly would be happy with a \u0022next-gen\u0022 style of sequel, where almost all of KSP as it currently exists is a part of the new game, but with massive overhauls to everything and lots of new additions. I\u0027m thinking of the kind of jump in quality and power like upgrading from PS2 straight to PS4.  \n\nWhether that will happen is certainly moot, but isn\u0027t really in the scope of this thread.

However, when developers open up what is essentially single player games for multiplay, they always have to make some changes to UI/gameplay/interaction which in my experience ruins valuable and unique aspects of the originally conceived (or previous version) single player game. Some may think MP is worth it. I don\u0027t. Essentially, my opinion is that adding a MP element always ruins the single player game, - at least to some extent.\n\nWhat I\u0027d expect from KSP 2.0 is an interstellar element, with space technology like the Daedalus project, and some neighbor solar systems of course. From what I understand, this is not immediately possible to add to KSP as of today.\n\nI\u0027d also expect more and better balanced (the challenge) planets, and more to discover and explore on them. But that, I gather, should be possible to add to the 64-bit client of our current KSP.\n\nI\u0027d like a more planned and rational hierarchy of rocket components. Planned as in serving the gameplay progression. We have mods, so this can be argued to be a non-issue, but the stock assortment feels peculiarly incomplete and unfinished. The problem with mods is also that the sky is the limit. It\u0027s easy to get into the habit to \u0022buy\u0022 the solution, instead of solving the problem - which is really the essential gameplay element in KSP. But again, it should be doable to the 64-bit version today.\n\nAs for planes, I pretty much refuse to meddle with them, since I feel that the essential design craftsmanship is missing from the current system. You don\u0027t design aircraft by bolting together parts. You have to be able to adjust things like wing area, aspect ratio, profile thickness of every wing and fin. And the aerodynamic simulation should reasonably accurately model the consequences. Otherwise, I\u0027m not interested.\n\nEdit: P.S.  In my judgement, a KSP 2 would be a prime candidate for becoming one of those \u0022Oh-but-the-first-game-is-much-better.-That-is-the-one-you-should-get\u0022 -games.

Click or slide and all the part specifications change with it.  \n\nIt will save parts, you can choose for instance how big your aircraft wings are without having to add incomparable parts to let\u0027s say a BIG-S wing just to get enough lift.  \n\nYou can change wheel, gear, fairing, and aircraft wing settings, so should you be able to have a tweakscale setting.  \n\nIf a simplified tweakscale setting would be introduced, it\u0027s only going to make the game better without complicating it for amateur players. Maybe even add a \u0022unlock\u0022 tweakscale setting in the game settings menu or on the part settings menu before tweakscale settings are visible so the part settings menu remains easy to operate."}]}
