(This was only yesterday lol) And oh how wrong Iwas, after 11 launches, my massive space craft was still unable to enter an orbit around Kerban, as the last fuel tank was so long and unweildy, it kept snapping off but still sticking to the top stage, sending me in an uncontrollable whirl wind of kerban tears and blood. But, finally, on our 12 launch, we got to the moon! *Applauds* I carefully ejected my lander down, and we were going in for a descent. At this point I horribly overestimated the gravity of the Mun, and began burning full throttle before I even got under 60km, which then led to me being bunny hopped all the way onto the dark side of the moon, here I couldnt see anything, but was still determined to land with what little fuel I had left.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy 3 brave kerbonauts piloted the lander down, but this time, i horrible underestimated the gravity of the mun! And only began burning at 5km. I hit the ground at 300m/s and everything exploded, except the pod! No, the pod awaited a different fate, the vile moon goddess Serene had a different destiny in store for my kerbonauts. They were flung straight up into the air by the blast of the explosion, and skimmed narrowly along the moons surface for 3 whole years, before they finally touched down. By this point they had been making their own whirl pool of acceleration, and were going at the speed of 6000m/s roughly, and when they hit the ground, I had some hope that maybe theyd just slide. But nope, as soon as it very carefully tapped the Mun\u0027s surface, KABAMOOO. And thus was the end of my 12th launch to the moon. If anyone cares to know my 13th launch was a success (humorous because of apollo 13.) and we now have a nice little lander that unfolds into a small mun base sitting on the Mun with its crew of 3 \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E This is my first time landing on the moon so Im still proud of it, as it was only yesterday xD And my next mission is to send them a rover to play with.

KNOWING that my fuel is now imbalanced on one of the outer tanks because I didn\u0027t think to transfer out of the CENTER tank, I decided to not bother burning the mainsails for landing burn as I knew that the skycrane has enough power to lift the entire rover on Kerbin, but decided to keep them on to help keep the twisting of the ship as I adjust on the way down.
