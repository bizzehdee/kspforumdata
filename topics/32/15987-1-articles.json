I was actually trying for mun then overshot it and burned the last of my fuel arching myself to follow the suns orbit lines. they\u0027re going to be floating around the sun for a long long time. It wasn\u0027t really the suns orbit that made it special, it\u0027s the fact that it\u0027s a transfer orbit. given enough revolutions around the sun I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll eventually catch up with a planet and smack into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
