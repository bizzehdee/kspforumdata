They have a much higher thrust:weight ratio (especially the smaller yellow ones), which is vital for a good ship. Only problem is they don\u0027t burn for as long, and are slightly more prone to exploding. Just think about it: once they add some sort of campaign to the game, SRBs will be non-reusable, and therefore more costly. yet, they will still be useful enough to keep them ingame. theyre just that awesome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealso, why not use stock parts? the mods that ive tried seem to make the game far too easy, especially since there\u0027s no cost to parts yet.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
