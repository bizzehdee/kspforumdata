The original idea was that folks - both game designers and modders would focus on parts. But as you can see from the forum, mods are a lot more than just new parts. As the game changed and modding the game became easy, the way KSP was designed changed that. The idea was to keep the game as uncluttered in folder structure and organized to help with game design.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEverything - parts mods, planet pack mods, the parts from the two Squad DLCS, etc. - were put into a new folder called GameData (Kerbal Space Program\\GameData).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI hope this helps.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
