I looked around the forums but couldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t find any ships that did what mine did, (apart from infinigliders), so I thought I would post them here instead of the Spaceship Exchange as I thought the mechanisms these work with would prompt further discussion. Sorry if this post is a bit long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA little background first. I had completed many challenges in the game but hadn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t got around to getting a ship on and off Eve and didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t want to build a 200 ton monster to do it. So, after being inspired by some of the stock helicopters people had built I wondered if this would be a viable method for escaping Eve\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s thick atmosphere. Despite my enthusiasm and after numerous failures I decided that while the concept did work to a degree I always ran out of fuel before making it very high. It then struck me, why not build an infinicopter? People have made infinigliders so surely I just need to make some rotors, put some control surfaces on and use SAS to make them twitch like mad and the thing should start spinning enough to carve itself through the atmosphere. Right? In hindsight this shouldn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have worked since the latest update had changed the way SAS worked so you don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t get control surfaces that twitch so much but I didn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t think of that at the time and tried it anyway and came across an interesting effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Links instead of emdeded images because they haven\u0027t been resized, sorry)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883021005/676E74D1E3A393EA5D88D6443B682DEDC79A3542/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883021005/676E74D1E3A393EA5D88D6443B682DEDC79A3542/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883083665/3B06DD13B95BD0F6B4D4B281925A71D95B922193/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883083665/3B06DD13B95BD0F6B4D4B281925A71D95B922193/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a base configuration as an example. I haven\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t included a craft file as it should be simple enough for anyone to build. To fly it you simply turn on SAS and prime the rotor by holding down Q to turn it clockwise until the rotor becomes self sustaining. The flaps lock into an downwards position and they generate thrust which turns the rotors fast enough for the airflow over the flaps to generate lift and the thing takes off. I have no idea why this works as the SAS is supposed to try and stop the ship spinning but it actually does the opposite. It is definitely SAS that is powering this because as soon as you shut it off it drops from the sky like a stone. It is also MechJeb friendly with the effect working with both the Ascent guidance and Smart Ass enabled.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are many different configurations you can play about with and it can lift very heavy loads with only a small number of control surfaces, (well over 100 tons), but the disadvantages are that you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really control the craft, (it can only go up), centrifugal forces tend to put a lot of strain on complex payloads and of course there is the dreaded cartwheeling. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m not sure what causes this but it is when the craft starts to tip off centre and slowly becomes uncontrollable until it falls to its death. It doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t seem to be a centre of gravity issue and flex on the rotors affects this whereby if it spins too fast then centrifugal force straightens the rotor arms, increasing the effect and then the craft ascends to quickly and cartwheeling starts to appear. Adding vertical wings seems to mitigate this, I think because centrifugal force on the tips forces the rotor arms to bend back downwards moderating the lift but after many tests I cannot be sure. If anyone can cure this once and for all I would be very grateful. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, I eventually built an Eve version and hacked the save game file and deorbited it. Unfortunately the spinning on the way down, (even with high altitude parachutes), broke one of the 8 arms in half. It landed ok and it did work propelling the ship up to 13500m high but when I decoupled the rocket from the base rotor the wobbling caused the rocket to hit the rotor and it blew up. Further attempts to make Eve infinicopters have been futile and I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m a bit too burned out to attempt more.

As you can see I copied the bearing design from him. Now, with the ability to stack SAS that the latest update enables this infinicopter doesn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t even need RCS or engines to hold it steady, the SAS modules are enough to hold the infinicopter stable. It uses no fuel and only needs electricity to run, (powered by about 28 RTG\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s), although it is more of a novelty as you can\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t really control it well enough to steer it anywhere. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883183947/F1AD42215CC3395F138E50B71131AF856C373708/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883183947/F1AD42215CC3395F138E50B71131AF856C373708/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883227141/FCD4F187EDFF88961BE7CC2A8FDF341FCC3588EF/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883227141/FCD4F187EDFF88961BE7CC2A8FDF341FCC3588EF/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883260691/B5AF4C9B00FF0E664D9E8151792236D6DED66335/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/921270022883260691/B5AF4C9B00FF0E664D9E8151792236D6DED66335/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECraft file - Super Copter III : \u003Ca href=\u0022http://www./?7ua32ep70x4iap7\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://www./?7ua32ep70x4iap7\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EInstructions for use:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) Retract gears\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Press Space to decouple the rotor from the main body of the craft\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) Lower gears\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4) Press the close square brackets key to switch to the control ring on the rotors\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5) Engage SAS\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6) You will need to prime the rotor by holding the Q key.
