Sometimes having other surfaces pitch in can help, but at other times, it can harm in different ways. For (the most simple) example, you can end up with too much control authority (especially in roll with narrow craft), resulting in twitchy controls and flappy SAS. Another issue that can crop up is that you can be adding too much drag by having control surfaces with bad authority pitching in. Other issues include strange interactions resulting in a skid, or such.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn short, \u003Cem\u003Eintelligent\u003C/em\u003E assignment of surfaces will always beat the pants off of the \u0027all helping\u0027 model.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFAR\u0027s widget for controlling the surfaces is even better: you can have a surface react negatively to an input.
