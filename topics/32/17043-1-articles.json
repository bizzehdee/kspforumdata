I disagree with you that the aim of the KGSS is naming geographic features. It is just one of the things the KGSS does. It also collects exographic data. (One of the posts in the KGSS f.i. has an attachment with over 1Gb of data). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand creating a detailed map of the planetary bodies with photographs is something i would like to be done. (how and at what resolution etc. is beyond me). \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy suggestion is to combine your efforts with those of the KGSS (make it a sub-departement of the KGSS?), talk to the creator of the KGSS about how and what and what structure would be the most afvantageous to all. It will at least prevent doing some things twice.

I love this idea. I tried to read through the KGSS thread, but it\u0027s quite long and seems to have fizzled a bit. I was also unable to find high or ultra-high resolutions of the maps in that thread. I would be interested in an ongoing project to increase the resolution of the maps available and come up with a sort of atlas with something like this. As well, it\u0027s not as if there aren\u0027t multiple agencies here on Earth to record geographical and topographical features in competition with each other. I don\u0027t see the harm in having two, especially if we aren\u0027t interested in naming or RP. Each of my mapping satellites bristles with hull cameras as well. Photos shouldn\u0027t be too hard. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere are my results so far: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/a/79X0Q#0\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://imgur.com/a/79X0Q#0\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will be continuing my scans until I have a pixel perfect map at a resolution of 3600x1800. Unfortunately, polar outputs get messy when you try to bump the resolution up (they overlap), so this is what we get until that\u0027s fixed. On my overclocked 1100T, (6 cores, not 8 -- I was mistaken), the maps take about 3 minutes to generate, but this increases by about a minute per day of scans and we\u0027re looking at another 4 days for the 3600. The merged csv is well over a gig at this point. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo tl;dr, I completely support this and would be willing to continue my mapping missions until we have 3600x1800 or higher resolution maps of the worlds of KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tim_Barrett","CreatedById":3206,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T16:07:07Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAre you guys going to race to get cartographic images of the new bodies or something?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sixteenbit","CreatedById":40233,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-16T16:29:44Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tim_Barrett\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAre you guys going to race to get cartographic images of the new bodies or something?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESure?
