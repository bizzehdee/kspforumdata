I might just do that my self lol. Also I think once it\u0027s offically out, being as the demo will also be 1.0, I\u0027ll likely post it on my FB (separate from the \u0022OMG 1.0 is here\u0022 post lol).\n\nOn a side note, another thing I just thought of (which also might have been mentioned already) it would be neat if Squad had an app that would generate notifications right as the game is officially released. How ever with the site still (as of 5 minutes ago) down, the first clue to the possible imminent release of 1.0 will be the site coming back up."},{"CreatedByName":"REGZZZ","CreatedById":141152,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T16:32:36Z","Content":"MmHHhyPpPMmnhghppmM (That was \u0022Hype\u0022 with a mouth full...
