I don\u0027t think you need to worry too much about speed. If you want to implement the more accurate discrete-tanks version then you can always put the new code behind a checkbox to switch back and forth between discrete and continuous tank results, then we\u0027ll know for sure how much difference it makes in both results and speed. If you put the code up on github I might even send a pull request or two. Feel free to PM me on reddit /u/tavert if I\u0027m offline for a while here, I might not check back all that often.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m realizing the JS JIT compilers are indeed pretty fast. The JavaScript port of the calculation definitely outperforms the original Python implementation (granted, that\u0027s not saying too much since Python isn\u0027t fast by any measure, but it\u0027s still an interesting observation). Uploading the code to GitHub so other people can work on it is a great idea.
