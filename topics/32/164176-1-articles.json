First off, always double check your contracts. I was fulfilling a contract and I have always had trouble nailing orbits. I finally get my equatorial orbit almost perfect to the contract specifics. I wait for a minute and the contract doesn\u0027t get completed. I\u0027m wondering why. I review the contract only to discover I forgot to put on antenna! So I deorbit this satellite and fix my mistake and build a new rocket. Re-launch it. Absolutely nail the orbit (better than the previous attempt actually) again, contract isn\u0027t closing. I then discover I\u0027m going the wrong way!!
