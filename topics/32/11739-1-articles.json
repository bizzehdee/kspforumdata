Because it is on the far side, it had no way to relay the data to Kerbin. I decided to launch a satellite into orbit around the Mun. It orbits at 30KM. As the craft swings around the far side (as it is about to), it will send a signal for the probe to beam its data to the satellite. As MRO crosses into the near side, it will then send the info to Kerbin.\n\nHere is a photo of the Munar Recon Orbiter as it is about to go into the darkness above the Mun.\n\n\u003E ![index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13405.0;attach=21580;image](http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=13405.0;attach=21580;image)\n\n-EDIT-\n\nSurveyor Probe sees the indicator that MRO has passed above!
