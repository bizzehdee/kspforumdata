Then I\u0027ll have to refill the tankers which are already in LKO, and send up some more tankers to go along to Eve. Also the test flight of my 14000 dV ship is nearing its end. Jebbediah did some crazy maneuvers over minmus to test how usable the ship is and is now on his way back to Kerbin. The first stage is not capable of docking, so it will be burnt in the atmosphere (with all remaining fuel in it).

Don\u0027t wanna leave this thing behind, and to do this i had to design a clever self-rightening mechanism. It uses the landing legs to achieve this before takeoff, as demonstrated below: \u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VCDtEg7.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/VCDtEg7.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/mwC08ez.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/mwC08ez.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/nUX0KiT.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/nUX0KiT.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/eK2NXQ6.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/eK2NXQ6.png\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESit, Rover.

Well, at least the refueling before it will go to Eve orbit. When it\u0027s there it will be between 10 and additional 15 refueling missions, depending on how much fuel is needed for the transfer of the lander and the tankers (of which probably 10 will be sent along with the lander during the next transfer window). When talking about tankers: I deorbited all the empty tankers that were parked in Kerbin orbit, since I realized that it\u0027s rather useless to send up non-reusable tankers to fill the tanks of other non-reusable tankers of about the same weight...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfterwards I played around with a space plane design that is supposed to be able to lift small LV-N powered ships up to LKO.

After sending the rover, it got stuck under the repurposed Minmus lander so I had to use the \u0022emergency\u0022 decouplers on the lander. Meh. After finally getting the rover to the Kerbal I got almost to the anomaly (about 5km away give or take?) and flipped the effing rover! GRR!

I didn\u0027t realize this ship was quite this big, I had it at a 90 degree angle on approach and almost took out my solar panels with a wing. Well I guess it\u0027s about 37 tons at takeoff so it has a right to be kind of big.
