In fact I think the only reason people believe they work better is because they aren\u0027t able to do half the things we try to do which might bring a problem to the surface. Most gaming for example, or throwing together a bunch of parts that haven\u0027t necessarily been tested together then tweaking the settings in all of them... Not to even mention the lack of a real malware threat. But yes I\u0027m stuck too, at least on this computer. I do tend to run a Debian based Linux distro on whatever computer isn\u0027t my main one. I actually have KSP running decently on my old laptop with Mint. There\u0027s something to be said for an operating system you can mess with until you can\u0027t even tell what version it was with backports and forced installations of unsupported software, and it still run without a hitch for the most part. \u003Cp\u003EI agree 8 is nice once you get used to it. There are some things that need to be ironed out. For one I\u0027m not a fan of the big push towards everything being in the cloud these days -- by all means make it an option after the fact but please don\u0027t make it default and then you have to hunt around to disable it. But I think it has a lot of potential if people will stop grumbling about it being \u0022different\u0022. I mean really, if you don\u0027t like Metro it\u0027s not that hard to put the start menu back, there are several programs for it and some are free (the one from IOBit comes to mind). I helped my mom set up her new laptop with 8 on it and we did just that, now she doesn\u0027t have a quite as confused look on her face when she uses it \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E But I grumbled too at first and after thinking about it, it was time to change up the UI. It\u0027s been pretty much the same since NT4 / Win95 with most major changes being under the hood. I kept saying why not make it optional within Windows setup to run Metro or classic. Linux has GNOME, MATE, KDE, LXDE, XFCE, etc why can\u0027t Windows have just two options?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBoth the 280X and 270X seem to be good cards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EYou were kidding about the loan, right?\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYes, the 270x wasn\u0027t bad before the flaming incident. It did have some slightly off colors from what I was used to and some microstutter though. I looked at some real world comparisons and it appeared that the Radeon drivers do better at spiking the maximum framerate than keeping a steady one across the board.

You are quite certainly not going to play games with it for 7 years. Top performers are a little more prone to defects and in one or two generations you will be stuck with a slow, hot and noisy card. You paid a bunch for it, so you will not get rid of it, yet much cheaper and less power hungry cards easily outperform it. It is the law of the handicap of a head start in all its glory. Unless you need the performance now, I always strongly advise against buying high end computer gear. Buying speed for the future simply does not work in computer land. If you have 700 dollar to spend you are better off with two 350 dollar cards or even three 200 dollar cards instead of a 700 dollar card. The latter will be fastest initially, but in a year or three you still have money to upgrade to a new card when buying the cheaper ones. It will certainly outperform the older, more expensive card at that point. On average, you will have more frames for more years.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother things is that I think that taking out loans on anything but a house and education is generally ill advised. Especially so in the case of electronics, where the device often wears out before you make your last payment.
