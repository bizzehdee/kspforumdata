Kerbalkind has decided to class the asteroid seen from the observatories on Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere one mission was sent out to gather samples of one of the larger asteroids determined to be on a collision course to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a successful push to allow it to miss at just 107Km altitude and samples successfully returned to the scientist on Kerbin a chart was made.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EClass:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA - Awesome shooting star for the night sky watchers.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EB - Bang will be heard as the asteroid breaks up and explodes in atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC - Crater hole will be made or a large splash in the ocean. Give\u0027s something cool to examine if no-one gets hurt.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ED - Destructive impact expected. Tsunami waves will cause damage to coastal areas if hits in water or Devastating the area it hits if on land.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EE - Extinction of Kerbin is expected. Be somewhere else when this hits or push it away at all costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/792940443881895951/F95D6AA5F6EEC00DEAFABD4CE5A07DD4FB965BFB/\u0022 alt=\u0022F95D6AA5F6EEC00DEAFABD4CE5A07DD4FB965BFB\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-4.steampowered.com/ugc/792940443881907940/5F62DA0C517D85DBB3F96D6CB6CDC955F3CFA1F8/\u0022 alt=\u00225F62DA0C517D85DBB3F96D6CB6CDC955F3CFA1F8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell, after the studies, it was determined that Kerbalkind got into space travel in just the nick of time. The E class above is estimated to be at 2100 tons (2192 for roid \u002B ship). Jeb, Bill, and Bob are already our heros. It looks as though the space program MUST expand if the survival of Kerbalkind is to continue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what do you think of the chart?
