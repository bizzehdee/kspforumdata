Not sure yet if that was due to a poor ascent trajectory or poor calculations. Might also have to do with the improperly-installed launch escape system. Or maybe Jeb ate too many enchiladas the night before launch. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as the reentry package failed to ignite. Had Jeb made orbit, he would have died there.
