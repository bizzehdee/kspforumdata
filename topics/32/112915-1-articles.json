In career mode, I was trying to complete a contract to build a Mun Outpost that needed to support 11 kerbals, include a research lab and 4000 units of liquid fuel. I launched the outpost in 3 pieces that were docked together on the Mun\u0027s surface, and then I filled the fuel tanks with a nearby drilling rig (and using KAS) in order to meet the 4000 units of fuel requirement. For some reason, the program doesn\u0027t think I have a facility with an antenna, a docking port and the ability to generate power... which I have all of those things (and all pieces were made after the contract was accepted... since I think this is also a glitch I used the cheat menu to complete the contract).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe glitch comes when I try to decouple a probe core that I used during the launch from one of the docking ports. The probe core doesn\u0027t detach and instead the whole outpost starts to slowly float off the ground and I lose all control. Kerbal Engineer shows no mass. Has anyone else come across this glitch? I suspect it has something to do with how the probe core is attached to the docking port because I\u0027m not able to remove the probe core using an engineer and KAS.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/hnLyw1K.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/hnLyw1K.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/UX5rUed.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/UX5rUed.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/dts7aP0.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/dts7aP0.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ftHiyVx.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://i.imgur.com/ftHiyVx.jpg\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Feradose","CreatedById":111211,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-14T12:29:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah.
