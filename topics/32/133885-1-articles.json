I installed and \u00A0saved the original install files to a back up. Over the last year I upgraded to version 1.01. At that time I was using a SATA drive. I recently had to replace\u00A0that hard drive and I chose an SSD drive. When I visited the webpage several weeks ago, I saw that a newer version 1.0.5 was available. I downloaded it in addition to the installer and gave it a try. It did not work and after uninstalling and trying my original files from purchase, that too did not work. Any ideas?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe message I am receiving is: The game crashed. The crash report folder named \u0022 2016-03-09_214124\u0022 next to game executable.
