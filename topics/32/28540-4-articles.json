I believe that at the next update these issues will be solved since they changed the memory loading procedures. During launch the lag at large part count is smaller than 0.19 and the launches are very beautiful. I like that they fixed the radial coupling and i hope that at a future update we will have back again (or as an option form the graphics menu) high resolution planets at the map view.
