I am someone who will send a mission to the Mun to explore a new crater because it is useful to the space program scientists back home. Or I will send a rescue mission for stranded astronauts as quickly as possible so that they dont die from lack of an imagined running out oxygen supply. I am absolutely unable to design an unfeasibly wide craft without nose cones because that just would not happen in real life. Similarly I cannot carry large rovers that dont fit within fairing covers. If I am re-entering Kerbin I will try to do it in the sea as close to the base as possible so that it would be easy for the navy to pick them up, and I try to avoid landing in the deserts. And if I lose a Kerbal I half-imagine a funeral back at base with a plaque erected to celebrate their achievements.
