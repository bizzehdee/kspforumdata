I had envisioned space tourism and other commercial concerns playing a strong role in contracts in addition to the base government-initiated budget for achieving orbit and so forth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Basically, I had imagined that as one\u0027s reputation rose, a variety of parts such as communications satellites, scientific experiements, space telescopes, or non-crew passengers, etc. would need to be taken farther for greater rewards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022please test my part\u0022 missions, in contrast, are a clever idea that sensibly tend towards low rewards and fit a commercial theme. However, I have two problems with them. First, the reward for those missions must be low to be plausible, and so making them profitable must sometimes involve making bizarre frankenstein rocket designs to accomodate a set of them. Second, they really ought not to be so repeatable: how many separatron tests would they really be willing to pay for? Third, since the only visible high-revenue sources are for exploration missions, it feeds back into the theme that all aerospace funding is government-sourced exploration. It\u0027s not that this is implausible, but my personal dream is that ambitious aerospace will become a self-perpetuating commercial venture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E So, to sum up, this is my shout out. Are there plans to make commercial funding lines based primarily on bringing satellites and such to the reaches of space and leaving them there (perhaps servicing them once in a while)? If not, is there demand for that kind of contract in the form of a mod?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(PS.

But for me, many of the part contracts were simply irritating from a completionist perspective, because having a contract to fire a solid rocket booster at 14km available compelled me to accept it. Then I had to arrange two stages below the booster in order to meet the height and speed requirement for the stage. After that I fired off a useless separator to meet another contract, followed by a parachute which now met its height and flying requirements, which then needed to be cut, and so forth. I realized I was building Rube Goldberg machines to get petty cash that barely paid for the rocket, and it sort of irked me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E On the other hand, the thought of building space infrastructure like a satellite network somehow or repairing telescopes seems grander to me for some reason.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Pecan","CreatedById":96332,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-07-30T17:33:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMods that add equipment such as SCANSat (mapping satellites), and CactEye (new, space telescopes) and others tend to incorporate their own contracts for exactly this sort of thing.
