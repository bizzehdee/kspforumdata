You cannot downgrade with any version, unless Squad still has 0.90 on the website.

Leave the default game folder stock and use it as a backup ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nFor downgrading, I\u0027m afraid Steam only allows you to revert to 0.90!"},{"CreatedByName":"G\u0026#039;th","CreatedById":98595,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-29T03:54:25Z","Content":"I don\u0027t see why you\u0027d want to downgrade.

As they want you to always keep your game up to date since it saves them space on their end. Which could be used for new games to bring in moar money."}]}
