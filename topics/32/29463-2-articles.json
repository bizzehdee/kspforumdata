That was the \u003Cem\u003Eonly\u003C/em\u003E part of that mission that went smoothly; everything from there on out was beset by all manner of problems. As it turned out, the insertion stage didn\u0027t quite have enough juice to actually get me a Minmus interception, which meant I had to rely on the command / service module\u0027s engines to finish that -- which, in turn, made me worry that I\u0027d have to reallocate fuel from my lander module to get home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I finally get interception and capture, and move my two crewmembers from the command module to the lander. I plan a landing on one of the ice lakes that happens to be right on the terminator at the time, so that I\u0027ll have a nice, steep shadow I can use to gauge my final descent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, this is where things \u003Cem\u003Ereally\u003C/em\u003E start going wrong:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. I didn\u0027t account for Minmus\u0027s rotation, and thus end up coming down over the mountain slopes right next to the lake.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. The lake itself is still lit by Kerbol; unfortunately, the mountains are in the shadow.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. My lander doesn\u0027t have any lights.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here I am, less than 1km up, coming down onto a steep, unlit mountainside with no way of telling how close to the ground I am and no idea of how to correct my course to get me over the lake instead (I was still a relative newb at this point). Naturally, my lander smacks right into the side of that mountain, breaking off one of the landing legs. I panic and put the thing at max throttle, still not quite processing what just happened. Somehow, I did this while it was still pointed skyward, so it wasn\u0027t a total loss.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided not to take my chances with a second landing attempt. Rerendezvousing with the CSM proved to be tricky, since I came back up on a bit of an inclination, but I managed it, and I got the crew home safely.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat was one of the tensest missions I had in this game that didn\u0027t end up being a total loss.
