This type of measurement is tricky.

A map has the complete picture otherwise it is unfinished. \n\nIt is all in the details. There is not much in scenery detail in KSP, it all looks the same. But many explosions later there can components (with physics programming) scattered throughout and could then be considered interactive scenery. \n\nThe level of detail in the physics programming of the interactive scenery could be what distinguishes KSP.\n\nThe distance between interactive scenery on the 1 1 1 plane could be a method for measure.\n\nVery interested in finding out the winner of this."},{"CreatedByName":"Mandelbrot","CreatedById":112838,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T05:40:45Z","Content":"I think the release of No Man\u0027s Sky will render this question moot."},{"CreatedByName":"ChrisSpace","CreatedById":140622,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T05:47:46Z","Content":"Minecraft is only a mere 64,000 by 64,000 kilometres, so small it could fit within the orbit of minmus.\n\nKSP is a good contender, and it\u0027s \u0027box\u0027 technically never ends, although at some point the altitude meter flips back to metres (m)\n\nSpace Engine has a visible boundary where the galaxies stop generating, however one can fly beyond that barrier into the blackness, and continue on forever\n\nOrbiter, like KSP and Space Engine, also has an infinite \u0027box\u0027, however there is nothing new beyond Neptune (or pluto/eris/sedna if you have mods installed)\n\nUniverse Sandbox is also technically infinite.\n\nSo, yes, there are infinitely sized games, however in terms of \u0027distance to the furthest thing\u0027, Space Engine is the undisputed winner"},{"CreatedByName":"Deutherius","CreatedById":125381,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-21T06:06:47Z","Content":"I think the OP meant \u0022the amount of land/sea you can explore, measured in square distance units\u0022, kinda like \u0022The map of GTA V is 5x bigger than the map of GTA: San andreas\u0022 thing you see a lot in reviews and stuff.\n\nIn which case, yes, KSP would have a LOT of ground to explore.
