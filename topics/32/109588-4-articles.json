My job is 38 hours a week, but I spend more time playing KSP.  I took almost a year off though, with the excrements(\\*), when 1.2 and then 1.3 both consecutively torpedoed mining.  I don\u0027t use Steam except to download.\n\nSo my estimate is 5K hours.  At least.  (And that doesn\u0027t include time at work spent thinking about what I\u0027ll do in KSP when I get home..)\n\nI haven\u0027t been to Dres.  I haven\u0027t been to Eeloo.  I landed on Vall this year which is the most I have achieved in the Joolian system.  I\u0027ve set foot on Eve and I\u0027ve left.  (\u0022How do you get a single stage off Eve?\u0022  Same way they say you make a small fortune in the airline industry: \u0022start with a large fortune...\u0022)\n\nWhen I look at what I know now about KSP compared to what I knew back in 2015, I am astonished.  When I compare the little I know now with what the KSP community knows about KSP...  I am astonished.\n\nWhat matters is it\u0027s been a ball the whole way.
