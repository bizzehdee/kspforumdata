All the answers I wanted were conveniently answered in existing posts. But 10 minutes ago, I\u0027ve had the strangest experience and I would like to have your thoughts on it. Here\u0027s what happened:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI eagerly started 0.21 and built a very simple rocket to shoot into orbit; no fancy stuff at all. After making an orbit round trip, I landed at KSC. At an altitude of 6000 meters I executed the final stage of my rocket: decouple everything from the pod (tank and engine). During the descent I can see the tanks fall below me... 300 meters, 200 meters, 100 meters............. nothing! No impact, no explosion... nothing. The pod landed safely on the ground almost next to the still intact tank and engine. Anyone has an idea what\u0027s going on here?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://imageshack.us/a/img138/1393/9u6.png\u0022 alt=\u00229u6.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bogpad","CreatedById":70927,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-26T08:15:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ewere you able to recreate the problem?
