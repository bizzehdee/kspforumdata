But as I docked a couple of them to my interplanetary ship, I noticed that the wheels would jiggle suddenly when I came out of warp. That was troubling, but no harm was done, so I flew the ship to Tylo and set an orbit. Upon exiting warp in Tylo orbit, the rovers tore themselves to pieces. As you can see in this pic, those delightful little cubic struts jerked so violently that they actually ripped themselves off of the rover core and went flying off into space. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/H7UOqX9.png\u0022 alt=\u0022H7UOqX9.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent about 6 hours this evening flying these things to Tylo, but there was nothing left to do but discard the rovers that were the primary reason for the mission. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FwyaGyz.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FwyaGyz.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs others have discovered, having cubic octagonal struts in an assembly that also includes docking rings can cause strange rotations that have caused vehicles to flip while sitting on the surfaces of worlds, but apparently, it can happen while in space as well, and on small vessels, it is not just a nuisance but catastrophically violent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I am keenly resenting that this forum does not allow swearing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thederper121","CreatedById":64096,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T08:29:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot sure if this thread belongs in KSP fan works.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-21T08:36:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, me either.

Basically an X with lander legs on the ends and a Mk16 chute in the center, rover on a stack separator underneath.
