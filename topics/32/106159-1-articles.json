There are some pretty awesome vanilla parts that are simply great. As I was flying some aircraft I noticed some trees! TREES! Yes... something to break up the barren landscape was much needed! Again, pretty awesome.\n\nAs with any update, I lost a few mods to compatibility issues: B9 Aerospace, STX, SCANSAT, SETI Greenhouses. Of the most painful mods to lose was B9 - simply for the landing gear. The one thing that really needs to be added to the stock parts is landing gear of differing heights that would make it possible to have wing-attached gear and nosecone gear on smaller one and two Kerbal aircraft. \n\nMy disappointment is not in the KSP game itself, but that the large number of mods that I lose each time the game is updated. Not sure what we can do about it.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T00:36:09Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 12:36  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**"},{"CreatedByName":"musicpenguin","CreatedById":57938,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T00:23:43Z","Content":"Just give it a little time.

We all have real lives and believe me, I am very aware of it.

When the mods do get updated, they\u0027ll be likely to stay fresher longer.

I would agree with something constructive, like Squad having some sort of modding program whereby modders could get maybe a final beta ahead of time to get their mods ready before release.

If they select some \u0022key\u0022 ones, someone is always going to feel left out and disadvantaged for not being \u0022one of the chosen ones\u0022. Or do they give it to all modders, in which case it\u0027s more likely that someone will spill some beans to the community, and some (less scrupulous) people might even pretend to be a mod maker as a way of getting early access.

For some reason, I didn\u0027t think that it was going to be as much as a complete overhaul (and I was looking forward to the barn) and that so many of thedownloaded mods would be incompatible. I do understand the works in progress, and am patient, just wish there were a better way to do things. AVI is very good about locating most of the mod updates... I am definitely going to make my mod AVI friendly before I release it...\n\nI do understand about the unscrupulous modders... too many already.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-30T02:06:36Z\u0022 title=\u002204/30/2015 02:06  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 30, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by adsii1970**"},{"CreatedByName":"DMagic","CreatedById":57416,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-30T02:18:15Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E No, just a general announcement, would not really have to be very specific other than \u0022changing the way we do the background textures...\u0022 or even \u0022changing scripting language where X no longer means...\u0022 just keys such as this.
