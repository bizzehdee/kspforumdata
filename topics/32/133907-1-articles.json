There\u0027s some sort of frame of reference shenanigans that happens below 100km altitude where the revolution of the planet around the sun affects node orientation but not ship orientation. My memory is hazy on this, I think it uses the rotational frame of reference below 100km and the celestial frame above that. \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100668-claw/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022100668\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100668-claw/\u0022\u003E@Claw\u003C/a\u003E explained this effect to me some months back, perhaps now that I pinged him he could share his wisdom here? \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"fastbikkel","CreatedById":101702,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-03-10T14:12:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks for the replies!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAt least i am not the only one.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIt can be really annoying for sure.
