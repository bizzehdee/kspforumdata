The primary determinants of atmospheric formation appear to be gravity, magnetic field, gas density, and systems (organic or otherwise) that continue to distribute and maintain the atmospheric elements as they bleed off into space and/or settle back down onto/into the surface. The distribution systems count for more than anything, as demonstrated by Venus in the real solar system: lower gravity than Earth, much thicker atmosphere. Even with the heavier elements comprising Venus\u0027 atmosphere, the whole mess of it would eventually settle back to the surface (and bleed off into space for the lighter elements) without the heavy vulcanism on the surface constantly stirring up the mix. The main reason why Mars\u0027 atmosphere is thinning so fast is because it lacks any sort of system to keep the atmosphere in place and replenished: no vulcanism, no magnetic field.

Observe how the upper 1/3 to 1/2 of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is so thin you don\u0027t get any flames at all until at or below 40km. The other planets, in contrast, effectively have oceans, not atmospheres, due to their lack of wide zones of low-density gas. The result of this is that you ship slams into much denser air than should be there even when just barely dipping into the top of the atmosphere. Another way to look at it is that the arbitrary heights of the atmospheres decapitate them.\n\nSo, that\u0027s broken. Until the other planets get fixed, you have several choices:\n\n\\* Leave reentry heat at 100% and have dangerous reentry from LKO, accepting that interplanetary aerocaptures (and even aerobraking) are well-nigh impossible. Then either do the well-nigh impossible to make them happen or just bring enough fuel to do without.\n\n\\* Lower reentry heat to about 20%, which makes \u0022traditional\u0022 aerocapture at Jool and Eve possible but still rather challenging, but also makes any less-energetic contact with atmospheres a walk in the park.\n\n\\* Turn off reentry heating entirely and play like it was still 0.9. \n\nEve is probably the worst-case scenario because at Jool, you can (with some effort and forethought) gravity brake off one of the big moons to capture without touching Jool\u0027s atmosphere and will little extra fuel burned.

Ships IRL don\u0027t handle the increase in the total absorbed heat well. A legitimate manned aerocapture has never been done, nor is it standard procedure. Therefore even Mun landings should \u0022realistically\u0022 call for a braking burn, to withstand the atmosphere. I would expect to bring \u0022slow down staging\u0022 to enter Jool or Eve atmosphere.\n\nAs I understand it, the total amount of heat absorbed is higher when performing aerocapture, vs. higher maxiumum temperatures incurred with steeper re-entry.\n\nThis means that the Kerbol system atmosphere is probably *more* forgiving than our atmosphere (capped atmospheric height non withstanding), given that our ships can handle aerocapture within reliable parameters (that or they have stronger building materials). If they\u0027re able handle aerobrake maneuvers than it **should** be at the cost of multiple passes/time, as it is now.\n\nIf these atmospheric bodies with the strongest forces (Jool and Eve) had their atmospheres extended by around 100km, and their curves adjusted to be slightly more forgiving, this could fix the problem, no? I don\u0027t think that the atmosphere of Kerbin needs much tweaking, i find it to offer a fantastic challenge.

I don\u0027t think that the atmosphere of Kerbin needs much tweaking, i find it to offer a fantastic challenge.\n\nYes, that\u0027s what needs to happen. I don\u0027t think anyone is suggesting changing Kerbin\u0027s atmo.\n\nThe problem with the current system is that there is no way to aerobrake at Jool from typical interplanetary transfer speeds. If your periapsis is 200,010m you get no braking whatsoever because you\u0027re outside the artificially decapitated atmosphere. If it\u0027s 199,990m you burn up instantly. Not only is this not realistic, it essentially eliminates a mainstay of Joolian missions in KSP.\n\nMuch the same is true at Eve. With shields and airbrakes and a very high periapsis, you might survive, but you probably won\u0027t capture. A lower PE at interplanetary speeds is death. There is no practical option for slowing down at Eve except to pack along the extra fuel and burn your engines to make orbit. Even thereafter, aeorbraking to shrink your orbit and eventually slow to a landing requires many many passes through upper atmosphere.\n\nThe \u0022many passes\u0022 problem is relatively realistic, but it\u0027s tedious as hell to perform in the game. I\u0027m not keen to spend hours watching my ship travel in a circle with no need for control input, and I can\u0027t time warp effectively because I keep dipping through atmo.\n\nI\u0027m not bothered if it requires a heat shield, but for game play reasons I feel it should be practical for typical craft to aerocapture from a Hohmann transfer at bodies with dense atmospheres. Currently in stock at 100% heating, it is not.\n\n1) The atmospheres don\u0027t continue to get thinner and thinner out into space, they terminate at an arbitrary altitude, which means you can\u0027t aim \u0022high enough\u0022 to not burn up almost instantly. I\u0027ve heard it claimed that there is actually a curve to the density as it approaches the decapitation altitude, but if that\u0027s the case the curve is ridiculously sharp.\n\n2) The heating math doesn\u0027t seem to be scaling correctly at non-Kerbin planets. Something about the way it scales off velocity or density or altitude is broken. Example: once you\u0027ve slowed down enough at Eve that you can make a braking pass through the very highest part of the atmosphere, you make as deep a pass as you dare and nearly fry everything to a crisp, only to find that your velocity is almost unchanged.\n\nIf the atmosphere isn\u0027t dense enough to slow you down meaningfully, it really shouldn\u0027t be cooking your craft in seconds. Something about the \u0022turbulent flow\u0022 heating wasn\u0027t balanced for non-Kerbin atmospheres or interplanetary transfer speeds.\n\n- - - Updated - - -\n\n\u003E \n\u003E But what really bugs me is that the part heat data suggests that the atmosphere itself is quite hot: I received most of the heat through convection.\n\nI suspect that this is the new \u0022turbulent flow\u0022 feature, which kicks in if you\u0027re going \u0022too fast, too low\u0022. I\u0027d bet that speeds above SoI escape speeds are \u0022too fast\u0022 as soon as you touch the upper bound of Eve or Jool\u0027s atmosphere (meaning the highest possible atmospheric contact is \u0022too low\u0022 and turns on the new Turbulent Flow heating feature.\n\nBecause obviously my rover is fine sitting on the surface not melting or anything.
