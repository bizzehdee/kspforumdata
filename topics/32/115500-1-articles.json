The primary determinants of atmospheric formation appear to be gravity, magnetic field, gas density, and systems (organic or otherwise) that continue to distribute and maintain the atmospheric elements as they bleed off into space and/or settle back down onto/into the surface. The distribution systems count for more than anything, as demonstrated by Venus in the real solar system: lower gravity than Earth, much thicker atmosphere. Even with the heavier elements comprising Venus\u0027 atmosphere, the whole mess of it would eventually settle back to the surface (and bleed off into space for the lighter elements) without the heavy vulcanism on the surface constantly stirring up the mix. The main reason why Mars\u0027 atmosphere is thinning so fast is because it lacks any sort of system to keep the atmosphere in place and replenished: no vulcanism, no magnetic field. Gravity not being \u0022strong enough\u0022 to hold it in place is not the cause, or Titan wouldn\u0027t have any atmosphere to speak of.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T22:02:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022samstarman5\u0022 data-cite=\u0022samstarman5\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWould hardly call it absurd when Eve\u0027s gravity is higher than Kerbin\u0027s, which allows for a thicker and denser atmosphere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat is absurd is that the atmospheres of other planets don\u0027t fade out gradually like Kerbin\u0027s, but end rather abruptly (I\u0027m told they really do taper down to zero but the slope is nearly vertical). Only Kerbin has a real \u0022atmosphere\u0022 that behaves like a wad of gas bounded only by gravity. Observe how the upper 1/3 to 1/2 of Kerbin\u0027s atmosphere is so thin you don\u0027t get any flames at all until at or below 40km. The other planets, in contrast, effectively have oceans, not atmospheres, due to their lack of wide zones of low-density gas. The result of this is that you ship slams into much denser air than should be there even when just barely dipping into the top of the atmosphere. Another way to look at it is that the arbitrary heights of the atmospheres decapitate them.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s broken. Until the other planets get fixed, you have several choices:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Leave reentry heat at 100% and have dangerous reentry from LKO, accepting that interplanetary aerocaptures (and even aerobraking) are well-nigh impossible. Then either do the well-nigh impossible to make them happen or just bring enough fuel to do without.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Lower reentry heat to about 20%, which makes \u0022traditional\u0022 aerocapture at Jool and Eve possible but still rather challenging, but also makes any less-energetic contact with atmospheres a walk in the park.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Turn off reentry heating entirely and play like it was still 0.9. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEve is probably the worst-case scenario because at Jool, you can (with some effort and forethought) gravity brake off one of the big moons to capture without touching Jool\u0027s atmosphere and will little extra fuel burned. But no big moon at Eve so if you choose to leave heat set high, you either have to brake with engines or build some monstrous heat shield.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Laie","CreatedById":110461,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-09T22:06:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOrbital velocity at 100km is 3200m/s, just for scale.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn my last test, I extended radiators.

If your periapsis is 200,010m you get no braking whatsoever because you\u0027re outside the artificially decapitated atmosphere. If it\u0027s 199,990m you burn up instantly. Not only is this not realistic, it essentially eliminates a mainstay of Joolian missions in KSP.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMuch the same is true at Eve. With shields and airbrakes and a very high periapsis, you might survive, but you probably won\u0027t capture. A lower PE at interplanetary speeds is death. There is no practical option for slowing down at Eve except to pack along the extra fuel and burn your engines to make orbit. Even thereafter, aeorbraking to shrink your orbit and eventually slow to a landing requires many many passes through upper atmosphere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u0022many passes\u0022 problem is relatively realistic, but it\u0027s tedious as hell to perform in the game.

Currently in stock at 100% heating, it is not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) The atmospheres don\u0027t continue to get thinner and thinner out into space, they terminate at an arbitrary altitude, which means you can\u0027t aim \u0022high enough\u0022 to not burn up almost instantly. I\u0027ve heard it claimed that there is actually a curve to the density as it approaches the decapitation altitude, but if that\u0027s the case the curve is ridiculously sharp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) The heating math doesn\u0027t seem to be scaling correctly at non-Kerbin planets. Something about the way it scales off velocity or density or altitude is broken. Example: once you\u0027ve slowed down enough at Eve that you can make a braking pass through the very highest part of the atmosphere, you make as deep a pass as you dare and nearly fry everything to a crisp, only to find that your velocity is almost unchanged.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf the atmosphere isn\u0027t dense enough to slow you down meaningfully, it really shouldn\u0027t be cooking your craft in seconds.
