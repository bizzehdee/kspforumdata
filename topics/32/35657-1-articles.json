One was mounted in front of the lander, the other behind. After long docking procedures I refuelled entire ship and tested it - teh objective was to get enough delta V to get to moho. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately my ship started to revolve after i throttled it up. What did I do wrong? HELP ! I cant attach my save file, but If u want I can mail it to you.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/2hmikah.png\u0022 alt=\u00222hmikah.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T00:17:01Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI can\u0027t see the details of your ship very clearly, but I have some suggestions/questions for you. Redesign the ship so that the LV-N engines are not the link between stages. The length of the engine seems to provide leverage for masses ahead of it to swing around and draw the ship off heading: far more so than with any other engine. Are only the rear set of engines firing at the time you\u0027re talking about? Engines to the front of the ship contribute little to stability. What kind of capsules/cores are you using for guidance? Do you have enough torque for the mass in question?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nimaci","CreatedById":57635,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T01:41:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThe game doesn\u0027t reverse controls for gimballed engines that are in front of the vessels centre of mass, try only using the rear engines.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galacticruler","CreatedById":58398,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T01:48:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EAlso, be sure not to use ASAS if there is one on each vessel and RCS helps to dampen any velocity based swaying from the orbital path.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"msyblade","CreatedById":69250,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T03:58:38Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, Gorgeous build. That thing would stop my cpu in its tracks! I think the suggestions here are correct however.

Right click through your fuel tanks and make sure you don\u0027t have a weird fuel line problem. I had a rocket that for whatever reason considered a random tank on a stack as debris and wasn\u0027t using the fuel out of it. All the other tanks worked, and they were all placed in 4x symmetry. But only that one tank was borked. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheck fuel balance. Transfer things around if necessary.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, you may have to use a combination of front engines AND rear engines to keep it from cartwheeling. If the front end is massive enough, inertia might play a factor. The back end getting pushed and the front end not wanting to move can cause a rotational element. Play around with using 2 or 4 of the front engines to help balance out the thrust.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGood luck.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CCKinnison","CreatedById":71439,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T13:39:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot just front and rear engines...
