Use 1 ASAS instead of all those SAS units. Use crossfeed to feed fuel to the center rocket - run one fuel line from the very bottom tank on each side rocket to the center rocket. Then, fire all your rockets at once. By the time you run out of fuel on the sides, you\\\u0027ll be well into orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFollow an increasing trajectory angle, starting about the time you cross 10km. Steer by watching the ball, don\\\u0027t look at the rocket for guidance. Once you get out of the atmosphere (about 70km), kill *all* your rockets with \u0027x\u0027 and just coast until you get to Apoapsis. Then, just before you get there, turn to 0 degrees inclination, and burn the rest of your side rockets until you establish a stable orbit. You should probably be in a solid orbit just about the time those things run out. Then eject them and use the center rocket to increase your orbit until it intersects the Mun or Minmus\\\u0027 orbit.
