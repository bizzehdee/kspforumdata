Getting those last few points just isn\u0027t worth the time and expense. Even doing it twice isn\u0027t really worth it unless you can easily access the biome, or if you are returning with new experiments that you didn\u0027t have on your first visit. You get far greater return for your buck by visiting new biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course there are other ways to squeeze a few extra points on a single visit. For instance, if you are transmitting the data back to Kerbin, just run the experiment, transmit the data, and then repeat the experiment until you exhaust the number of points you can get from it. This doesn\u0027t work for Mystery Goo and Materials Bay because those experiments are non-repeatable. Also, for unmanned missions, if you plan to return the entire experiment package back to Kerbin, carry multiple copies of the same experiment. And for manned missions, you can mount the experiment on the outside of your pod. Run the experiment once, remove the data, and transfer it to the pod. Run the experiment again and leave the data with the instrument. When you recover the vessel you\u0027ll get points for two runs of the experiment. Unfortunately with surface samples you can only return those inside a pod, so, unless you have multiple pods to store multiple samples, you can only do one of those per visit to a biome.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also noted that you didn\u0027t mention the GRAVMAX Negative Gravioli Detector and Atmospheric Fluid Spectro-Variometer.
