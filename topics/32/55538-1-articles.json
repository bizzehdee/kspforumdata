I did eight or nine different landings on Mun to get most of these, and that gave me enough science points to nearly complete my tech tree. In the long term, all planets and moons will have multiple regions, but for now it\u0027s just those two.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2\u0026gt; Make sure you\u0027re sending manned missions, and doing EVA reports and taking soil samples. Unmanned probes just don\u0027t earn as much, since you can\u0027t do either of these. Frankly, in the stock game there\u0027s no real reason to use unmanned probes until you reach the point of ion power, and even there it\u0027s really only useful if you use mods that add scanners (like ScanSat, ISA MapSat, or Kethane).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3\u0026gt; Go to Duna. Really, it\u0027s not hard with early-game parts; getting LV-Ns makes the trip much easier, but you can do without these if necessary. Land on Duna, take a sample, and return. One trip there gives a huge amount of science compared to Mun and Minmus, especially if you bring two atmosphere scanners (one for low altitude, one for high). With an LV-N on your transfer stage, you\u0027ll have no problems at all reaching Duna\u0027s sphere of influence, but I\u0027d recommend going to Ike first (and returning to Kerbin) to get a quick influx of science to buy the various heavier parachutes and such that help on Duna. (You don\u0027t NEED a parachute; my first Duna trip didn\u0027t have them, and I landed with rockets.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4\u0026gt; Make sure to go back to bodies you\u0027ve already been to once you unlock a new science part. In the stock game there are seven different science parts (Mystery Goo, Materials Bay, thermometer, seismic scanner, barometer, graviton detector, and the old aeronautics package converted to an atmosphere sensor). A few of those (barometer and atmosphere) won\u0027t work on airless moons like Mun and Minmus, and the seismic requires you to have landed, but the others can be used both in orbit over a biome and on the surface itself. The later science parts give more science than the early ones, too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5\u0026gt; When you unlock the atmosphere scanner, make sure you use it over Kerbin a couple times.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6\u0026gt; The later science parts (i.e., not goo or materials bay) weigh so little that you can easily pack a half dozen of each on your vessels, so just remember to take readings at each stage of your trip. Outside Kerbin\u0027s SOI, orbiting the Sun, you can do science as well. Getting back might be difficult in the early game, but it\u0027s an extra source of science if you do a Duna or Ike trip. So do a reading right after leaving Kerbin\u0027s sphere of influence, then do it again right after entering Duna\u0027s, then again once you\u0027re in orbit over Duna, then again as you\u0027re descending through the atmosphere (when you\u0027re parachuting down you\u0027ll have plenty of time to kill), then again when you land... it all adds up very quickly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Also, if you have extra science devices, you can stack those extra science points without the penalty for transmission.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the first couple days of my own game, I did eight or nine Mun trips, two to Minmus, one to Ike, and two to Duna. That gave me enough science to complete the entire stock tree. I then did a spaceplane trip to Laythe, with several atmosphere sensors... that gave me so much science that I unlocked a bunch of very expensive techs added by certain mods, with so much left over that I never need to worry about science again.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Javster","CreatedById":74613,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T12:51:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks everyone, I did a high altitude Eve flyby which hopefully will give me loads of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFUTURE PLANS:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELand on the places I\u0027ve been to\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAtmospheric probes to Duna and Eve\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd a question:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDo you need more dV to go to Jool or Eve?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-12-08T13:18:09Z\u0022 title=\u002212/08/2013 01:18  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EDecember 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Javster\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-08T13:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERun out of places to do science???

Yes, Eve is harder. Generally you\u0027re going to find that inner planets are harder because to get to them you need to blow off a lot of the dV that you have simply because you were at Kerbin. Kerbin is zipping along it its orbit at whatever its speed is relative to the sun, and you need to slow from that speed, it takes a bit of doing. Eve helps you out on the other end because you can aerobrake which makes it a nice target - Moho is a stinker because you\u0027re going to need about 5k dV on the Moho end just to slow down! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EConversely, outer planets are easier because you can build on the velocity that Kerbin gives you from its orbit.
