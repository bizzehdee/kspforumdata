But I only remembered to snag a few along the trip. I have a mun base in progress that consists of a communications tower, my Nova Base rover, and an MOLAB for extended operations away from the main base. Jeb along with his trusty sidekick Bill had been running the base operations for just over a year. I figured a year on the mun was wearing down on Jeb and Bill so I decided to plan a mission to bring them home. Operation Homecoming was a success although it did take the two Kerbalnauts quite some time to re-adjust to gravity again! Here are a couple of the screenshots I managed to snap of the space programs heroes return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/VQdDx20.png\u0022 alt=\u0022VQdDx20.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have Jeb maneuvering the Nova Base Rover to where the return ship landed 2km away from Mun Base Alpha\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/7kswAjx.png\u0022 alt=\u00227kswAjx.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere we have Jeb and Bill hastily making their way to the return ship. Two more Kerbalnauts rotated with Jeb and Bill. There are six kerbalnauts stationed at Mun Base Alpha\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/gTbSfQi.png\u0022 alt=\u0022gTbSfQi.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return ship breaking through the atmosphere. Due to an engineering problem not addressed before take off, the parachutes deployed too soon. Luckily they didn\u0027t burn up and they were able to slow the decent of the craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/ou99tAG.png\u0022 alt=\u0022ou99tAG.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd finally Jeb and Bill coming in for a hot landing at the KSP launch facility at Kape Kanaveral.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the Mun Base mission a success Jeb has handed over command of that mission to Munski Kerman where he will continue to conduct experiments and prepare for eventual resource mining of the mun. Jeb and Bill are being assigned to a new mission to be the first Kerbals to set foot on Duna and begin colonization. When asked about the Duna mission Jeb had no comment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-06T06:12:52Z\u0022 title=\u002205/06/2013 06:12  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 6, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Asheron04\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
