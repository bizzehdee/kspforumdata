One could then choose \u0022simple\u0022 while testing the logical elements of the design (staging, action groups, etc.) and then later switch to \u0022realistic\u0022 to debug the flight characteristics (or vice versa depending on play style).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI frequently remind myself when scanning these type of threads that depending on a players view of what makes something \u0022realistic\u0022, there are probably an infinite number of game elements which could be considered as \u0022not realistic\u0022 even down to the paint patterns on parts for example. The OP obviously views the Aero model as deficient - and though we might disagree with the style of the commentary, it\u0027s a personal opinion only. But... It\u0027s Squad\u0027s product. They can develop it according to whatever plan and end state architecture they desire. We play the game based on a license agreement. If the market accepts the game and the license, it will sell and have a following. If it breaks badly, then the market will reflect that. So far, the market seems to be generally accepting of the progress and design direction currently in play - OP being one of the exceptions. Regardless, Its good to register those areas where improvements can be made.

I also understand that some parts will be updated at different times, that Squad can only do so much at one time, that some updates may not be clear just from looking at it, that customers don\u0027t always understand the difference between a minor and a major change, and that as a system becomes more complex, adding to it becomes more complex as well. I\u0027m happy to have what I have now. The amount I paid for the game is rather small, and compared to the hours I\u0027ve gotten out of it, I have absolutely nothing to complain about. There are things that I\u0027d like fixed, things I\u0027d like added, and things will be added that I disagree with, and I accept these facts. I also trust that Squad cares about their product, and has made design decisions based on what they would like to see as a finished product.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember the days when I found out about new games by walking the shelves at a store, patches were extremely rare, and my communication with a game company used an envelope and a stamp.
