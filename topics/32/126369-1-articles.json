It\u0026#39;s the same course either way.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nThey also have classes on other subjects, too.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nHere\u0026#39;s the link: [url]https://www.edx.org/course/goddard-apollo-history-rockets-part-1-ieeex-atg1-x#[/url]!\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nMods: I thought that this would get the most views here, as opposed to the Space Lounge, where I know it belongs. I just want it to get more traffic so that users who don\u0026#39;t normally visit the Space Lounge can see it, because they might be interested. There\u0026#39;s a copy of this thread there. At the end of the day (when registration closes) can you lock this?\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lincourtl","CreatedById":72218,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-25T00:34:39Z","Content":"\nOh hey!
