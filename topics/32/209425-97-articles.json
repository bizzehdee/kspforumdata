Absolutely ideal would be some nifty dual 24 core Xeon workstation, but I gather that is not within your budget range. Something that is actually within reason is an i7-5820K. Still very expensive though. The problem is that what is good for rendering, often is not beneficial for gaming and vice versa. Good rendering rigs often focus on plenty of cores with relatively low clock speeds, while for gaming rigs you want 4 to 6 cores with clock speeds as high as you can get. Hyper-threading is mostly useless for gaming, while it serves rendering very well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere are some conflicting interests there \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E If you really want something that is great for gaming and reasonable for rendering, a 6700K would be the choice. It has a very high single thread speed and thanks to HT and four fast cores it will render decently too. However, it costs 3-4 times as much as the i3 you picked, of which about the price of one full i3 is just the hyper-threading upgrade (compared to the 6600K). Those are some rather expensive gains, so you will be needing to render quite a bit to make it worth your while. Considering your suggested price range, I think it all is probably a bit of a big ask. Then again, rendering is one of the more intensive things you can do on a computer (along with video editing, gaming and virtualization), so expect to need to do some investments if you are serious about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMind you, for the rendering pros, even a 5820K is simple stuff.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Hobbes Novakoff","CreatedById":129018,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-11T07:13:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECan somebody suggest a cheap-ish build.
