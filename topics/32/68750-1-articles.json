I\u0027m aware that ships can get a nasty and sometimes fatal jolt when exiting time warp, but this is the first trouble I\u0027ve had with entering it. I foolishly already terminated the asteroid, but still figured it might be worth posting.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a thought right as I was about to post. I believe the manned capsule had a ladder than slightly breached the asteroid\u0027s surface. I know that sort of interaction is usually associated to the Kraken drive. Maybe someone can test that idea?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"vexx32","CreatedById":12283,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-04-09T08:22:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re aware there are some strange things happening with time warping.

It seems to happen mostly with clawed asteroids though. Generally, switching between two or more clawed asteroids in the map view ~5-10 times will trigger the bug. Quicksaving and reloading a clawed asteroid after moving it may trigger the bug after ~10-20 times. Quicksaving and reloading while using physics timewarp to move it brings this down to ~5-10 times. Having two clawed asteroids in physics range usually triggers the bug after \u0026lt;5 quicksaves and reloads.
