This made the start of carreer mode very very hard. Probably too hard to bear (had to do a lot of launch-pad tests to earn a good sum of money). However I\u0027m now approaching midgame, and suddenly I notice myself swarming in money suddenly I see missions where I have to rescue a kerbal - those earn me upwards of 30k money. While I can do them using a standard (not even optimized per mission) spacecraft worth ~11k. Realistically I might get all those done within a 9k budget.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow as said next time I\u0027d probably start with 50% money at least, which would give a nett profit of around 50k per mission. And this is just \u0022conquering\u0022 LKO etc. Not even attempting Mun missions or beyond.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027m wondering: would there be options that keep the start equally difficult: but increase the difficulty of the later missions? Maybe make some missions high-reward but need to be done very fast (so not allowed to spend ~4 hours in orbit before aligning)? Or are there other things that could make KSP more difficult near the end game... Yet still give an incentive to actually do those rescue missions instead of completing the simple test part landed/in flight missions?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPS: just for reference, using above settings, I do those rescue missions using 3 thumpers and a swivel, so still very early in the science tree).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-10-19T16:24:09Z\u0022 title=\u002210/19/2015 04:24  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by paul23\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goomblah","CreatedById":143441,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-19T16:39:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you don\u0027t already, using a life support mod will make later-game missions more difficult and expensive, because visiting other planets will require lots of additional life support, while missions in Kerbin\u0027s SOI (early game) generally don\u0027t need so much extra mass.

Usually it also is easy to change the numbers used, either in a settings menu or in the config file. Non-visual, non-part mods often make the game harder.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you are looking for difficulty, I think TAC-LS may be the best LS mod.

This will not preclude you from running a bajillion LKO rescue contracts, but it will provide you with mid-to-late-game money and science point sinks, which will encourage you to take higher-risk, higher reward missions just to keep it interesting.
