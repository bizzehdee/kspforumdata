After millions of years of doing this, they started standing and walking on their hind legs. Predators brought the new species close to extinction, moving them into caves were the large predators could not go. The predators soon go extinct from hunger, being that their only food supply reclines in caves all their lives. Within the caves, the small kerbals were forced to live off of small amounts of algae, and the little water that trickled into it. It is here in the caves of kerbin, that the kerbals gained their large eyes. The small amount of light that came in forced their eyes to larger sizes, so they can see better. It was not for a million years after this, that kerbals, as we see them now emerged from their caves. In the desert, were they made the great pyramids for a dead ruler, who was sculpted in giant proportions outside of his tomb. But a UFO, that crashed at the north pole, scared the small civilization back into the caves, were they rested for 3,000 years. Soon though, about 2 years ago the young kerbal Jebediah Kerman, stepped out of his small cave, and saw the great stars of the night, he then started the Kerbal space program. Kerbals reproduce by eggs, and because they eat algae, like certain earth reptiles, they actually during times of drought, can do little amounts of photosynthesis, to keep them alive. They live the lives of turtles, and can live for hundreds of years without aging effects which is why they can live for so long on their longer missions to Jool and Eloo.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bigyihsuan","CreatedById":29291,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-20T02:28:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Strategia\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Strategia\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EKerbin\u0027s air is full of spores, far too tiny to see with the naked eye, which naturally seek out and adhere to command capsules.

The tale of the origins of the Kerbal species is a much more interesting topic, since they are shrouded in the mists of time and mythology. Some Kerbals subscribe to the theory that their species was hand-crafted from rocks and trees by the almighty Bob, but this theory is generally discredited by any Kerbal who doesn\u0027t have the syllable \u0022bob\u0022 somewhere in their name. Others believe that Kerbals naturally evolved over the millenia from a now-extinct interim species they refer to as the Cukes, but this theory too has some major holes (such as the fact that nobody has ever located a Cuke skeleton anywhere on Kerbin). Still other Kerbals hold that their species is nothing more than a simulation in a computer program sadistically coded to keep them busy, but this is now believed to be the byproduct of a severe mental disorder caused by ingesting a combination of liquid fuel and oxidizer (known in the conspiracy theorist circles as \u0022Jeb\u0027s Coffee\u0022).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Of course, Jebediah Kerman has is own theory on the origin of the Kerbal species that nobody but he believes: that Kerbals were crafted by a mysterious alien species that left a ton of relics all over the solar system as hints to their existence and how to find them again some day.
