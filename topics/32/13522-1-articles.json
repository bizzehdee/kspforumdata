Samotage Here!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve recently bought KSP ( Just over a month ago ) and I\\\u0027m thinking of doing Mod reviews. I love KSP and will probably make Mods/Addons in the near future. What program should I use for video capture and editing? I\\\u0027m probably going to get Fraps, so what should I use to edit the video\\\u0027s? If you guys can link me to a few mods to do then that would be great! I\\\u0027m currently on school holidays, so I can work Day and Night to give you guys these mod reviews \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks for Reading!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Samo\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plaatinum Aerospace","CreatedById":30569,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T01:26:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFraps is surely the best choice. For editing, you can use Windows Live Movie Maker for free, but if you want premium editing use Sony Vegas or Adobe After Affects (the latter two are expensive, keep that in mind)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope this helps!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlaatinum Aerospace Technologies \u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"samotage","CreatedById":29175,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T01:48:03Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIt helps a lot!

That was the reason I hated it before. Just don\\\u0027t try to record your vocal commentary with FRAPS; that still sucks as much as ever. Bandicam is also good. Playclaw is good. MSI Afterburner is acceptable, and is free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecord your commentary with Audacity. Works great, easy to use, and it\\\u0027s free.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\\\u0027ve tried two different editing programs: AVS and Vegas Movie Studio. AVS is cheaper in every way. Vegas costs twice as much but is more than worth it. Easy to learn, easy to use, tons of options... I love it. Using AVS, I had to jump through hoops to keep the program from crashing whenever I fed it too much data at once. Vegas takes 50GB files without blinking. I love it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"semininja","CreatedById":3837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-02T07:04:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022samotage\u0022 data-cite=\u0022samotage\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you know any great Solar Panel or Satellite Mods?
