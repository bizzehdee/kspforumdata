It\u0027s not just the heat flux in, but also the thermal mass, etc. Smaller parts can end up overheating faster than more massive parts nearby. If the tail is getting heat from multiple sources (Engines source, plus friction heat conducted from forward fuselage, then it may fail before other parts around it."},{"CreatedByName":"Tobyz28","CreatedById":72108,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:07:55Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/5HIKHo5h.png](http://i.imgur.com/5HIKHo5h.png)\n\u003E Tail connector is always the first piece to overheat, despite the fact that it is stack-occluded by the mk1 cockpit and fuel tanks.\n\nI would recommend going to debug mode to see what\u0027s going on as stated above. The tail connector im guessing has a very low mass, and it\u0027s receiving heat from two sources. It also probably has a low drag value, meaning it\u0027s going to be shedding less heat into the air (Just guessing, haven\u0027t tested). This results in it potentially overheating quicker than the parts around it. It may also have a lower thermal tolerance vs the wings around it.\n\nIt\u0027s entirely possible the part may need some balance tweaking too, so do check what\u0027s going on in Debug to be sure first before believing our speculations. ![:D](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Redshift OTF","CreatedById":78679,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:07:55Z","Content":"Looking at the debug menu temps the tail connector heats up far faster than anything on the craft, wherever it is placed."},{"CreatedByName":"skepticon","CreatedById":111470,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-27T20:19:40Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Better check it with debug tools.
