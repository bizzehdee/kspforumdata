It contains somewhat practical engine test results as well as data gleaned from the KSP game editor (VAB/ SPH) and Wiki. It is sorted by the max mass each engine was able to successfully launch with from sea level, what I designate as \u0022strength\u0022. This is sometimes in line with Squad\u0027s thrust data, but sometimes not. Altitude figures of a second test at sea level are of each engine using a small tank, which sometimes is in line with iSP, but again, sometimes not. I refer to this as \u0022efficiency\u0022. You may also compare Squad\u0027s T/WR (and other characteristics) of the engines. All engines are compared (inline, radial; liquid fueled [rocket \u0026amp; jet], solid boosters, monopropellant thrusters, ion; even a Kerbalnaut with EVA pack).

I had posted about the chart in the add on forum before I became aware of the graph discussion(s) in this forum, so I decided to mention it here and link to the other post. If that\u0027s bad taste, my bad. Johnno, a poster below you is in fact asking for a download, as you can see now. Sojourner, the chart itself demonstrates what is meant by \u0022strength\u0022. However, I will go into more detail. By using the small RGU (and an air intake to keep mass and drag more equal for all engines where possible) and loading up the engine with tanks of various sizes, I tested until each engine failed to carry its starting mass or failed to fly until it ran out of fuel. The maximum altitude included inertial or momentum coasting (and for great altitudes used the apoapsis projection as the maximum). The more important figure is not the number of tanks or amount of fuel, but starting mass. One column gives max fuel, the next column give the more important mass and the next one gives the max altitude. The starting mass is I think the best measure of \u0022strength\u0022. The altitude simply shows how far the empty tanks and engine were propelled. I do not know of a better way to demonstrate on a practical level the \u0022strength\u0022 of an engine, since all engines can fail if loaded with too much payload. I hope you might decide that this is not \u0022bad science\u0022. At least, that the tests might have practical applications, such as helping someone determine which engine to use for a desired purpose, which would be up to you to decide. And 1001sd, your english is excellent!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit: Since the tests are of differing types of engines, there were bound to be some special circumstances. For example, solid boosters were not able to use up their payloads as fuel; this was dead mass. I also had to adjust figures for boosters to, in effect, shrink them to the size of a small tank (the small booster is about as massive as two small tanks). For jets, they run out of oxidizer instead of fuel and thus have a natural altitude limit. There were several other considerations, but the chart touches on those also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the spreadsheet, I use OpenOffice. If more people want that, I am open to the idea of making it available. Edit: note that you may use the interactive charts at the KSP Wiki to sort each variable of a stock part. So my providing a spreadsheet seems a bit redundant. The primary purpose of my chart is simply to generally rank engines. \u0022Strong\u0022 tends to be toward the top of the chart. It happens that efficient engines tend to cluster toward the middle of the chart and the ones best used only in space tend to be found at the bottom of the chart.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-28T23:31:35Z\u0022 title=\u002208/28/2013 11:31  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 28, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Dispatcher\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kerbart","CreatedById":78303,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-28T23:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst of all, thank you for all the work you put into it.

That\u0027s great but the reality is that \u0022everything\u0022 is \u003Cem\u003Enot\u003C/em\u003E equal, which is why we have different engines in the first place. If you need sheer brute strength, get a mainsail. The fact that it consumes \u003Cem\u003Einsane\u003C/em\u003E amounts of fuel is kind of irrelevant, as this is a typical first-stage engine. Who cares that it can empty a Rockomax Jumbo 64 tank within a minute? This is about pure, raw, uncensored thrust, and nothing else. On the other side of the spectrum is LV-N atomic rocket motor. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not as \u003Cem\u003Estrong\u003C/em\u003E as the Mainsail, but hey, it gets me to Jool \u003Cem\u003Eand back\u003C/em\u003E on half an X-200-8, so who cares?

In the end, you need to tailor each mission and hence each engine for the payload at hand. What my chart does do is show you the maximum mass each engine can handle. For all non solid engines, that is also the maximum amount of fuel tank mass each can handle. In real simulation terms, the actual for your needs will always be less for payloads other than fuel (excepting those pesky solids again). The solid booster results may relate to what you wrote since most of that mass was dead. I learned a lot from the testing, so perhaps you will find a nugget here or there in the chart that you may find interesting and useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems to me that what you are suggesting would be some kind of interactive chart where you plug in one variable and get results in another cell.

Drag is calculated in a strange not-very-physical way in the stock game, where drag on each part is proportional to that part\u0027s mass and applied at the center of mass of each part. Since the drag coefficient of the aerospike is slightly lower than other parts, less drag force per unit mass gets applied to the aerospike than all the other parts on a rocket. If the aerospike is mounted at the bottom of your rocket (as you might expect for most designs), this means the overall center of drag of your rocket is located higher up than the center of mass. Unless you\u0027re pointed exactly surface-prograde (or retrograde), this means the drag force exerts a torque on your rocket that makes it want to point backwards.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo while the \u0022pendulum rocket fallacy\u0022 is a fallacy most of the time, due to the aerospike\u0027s drag characteristics it actually helps immensely to mount aerospikes at the front of your rocket instead of the back. Then the center of drag will be lower than the center of mass, and drag will exert a stabilizing torque instead of a destabilizing torque. And since aerospikes don\u0027t gimbal, they aren\u0027t subject to the bug where gimbaling rockets mounted ahead of the center of mass don\u0027t switch their gimbaling direction like they should.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-08-29T01:46:57Z\u0022 title=\u002208/29/2013 01:46  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 29, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by tavert\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Dispatcher","CreatedById":78707,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-29T01:46:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Esojourner, I think its noteworthy that only the aerospike is sensitive to what kinds of tanks are used (see \u0022tav\u0022\u0027s following post too as he addresses the reasons).

It\u0027s a bit odd to have it up on Spaceport, as that\u0027s not really what it\u0027s meant to be used for. If you want to give users access to the actual spreadsheet file, you can use a file hosting site like Rapidshare or Mediafire. It\u0027s nothing personal, but that\u0027s just not what Spaceport is for, not to mention that we get a lot of players complaining about the Spaceport being cluttered in the first place. Spaceport is for mods, crafts, and packs really, and shouldn\u0027t be used as an image hosting site.
