I\u0027ve had problems with sepratrons blowing up the center stage long before 1.0, so it\u0027s nothing new in that regard.

Most of the selfdestruction occurs because those things are faaaaaaaaaaaar to strong, half a second burn is already more than enough for huge booster-sets.\n\nThere isn\u0027t to much point in using sepratons, though.
