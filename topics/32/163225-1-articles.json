So by now I\u0027ve started going through the forums and wiki to learn as much as I can and start exploring what mods there are for the game. But I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s not the easiest thing to find mods that are up-to-date or what mods have simply become obselete by newer versions of the game. I like to keep my list of mods down to the minimum in any games I play both to keep balance and keep redundant or duplicated functions from mod in check.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo, my question is simply what\u0027s stated in the thread title: what features added by mods have been incorporated into the stock game? From what I\u0027ve been able to gather, RemoteTech has been made atleast partially redundant by the CommNet function, some of SCANsat\u0027s old function have been added through KerbNet and the system with Autostruts and Rigid joints come from mods like KJR. Is this correct, and/or are there more?\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWelcome!\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nAlways love to see a new player \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u00A0\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003E\nHas anyone mentioned the newly integrated Asteroid Day mod?
