The basics are - synchronise orbits, get your periapsis/apoapsis on the orbital trajectory of the target you\\\u0027re trying to get to, burn to make the opposite apsis also on the same orbit, so your orbits are the same. Then, to catch up, burn slightly retrograde, making your orbit take less time, and thus catch up on the target. To slow down to meet it, burn prograde and you\\\u0027ll slow down relative to it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ealways keep the apoapsis or periapsis on the same orbit as the target though. When you\\\u0027re within, say, two KM (it takes some practise) then you can start manoeuvring towards it, remembering that you have to burn engines to slow down, or you\\\u0027ll fly past it. A good rule, if you have spare fuel, is burn towards it until you\\\u0027re halfway, then burn away from it. That should slow you down in time, although rendezvous without an RCS system is not a nice thing to do, for your first time. Don\\\u0027t do what I did, which was pick an elliptic orbit at a funny inclination, and a ship with no RCS for your first rendezvous. Pick a nice circular orbit, with loads of spare fuel. 100km is a good orbit to start with.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsEmbeddedVideo\u0022 contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Ciframe width=\u0022459\u0022 height=\u0022344\u0022 src=\u0022https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0x_53X3l-Q?feature=oembed\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 allowfullscreen=\u0022true\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"VincentMcConnell","CreatedById":14492,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T20:26:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EEh, Vostok\\\u0027s idea of rendezvous is not really how they do it in real life.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe best thing to do is to use Kosmo-Not\\\u0027s rendezvous chart. That can be found here in \u0027Orbital Rendezvous made easy\u0027.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor Rendezvous, I have a target (space station) in a 200KM orbit. I put myself into a 180KM orbit and when I am exactly 50.5KM from my target, I burn to increase my Apoapsis to 200KM. Then at Apoapsis, I burn to increase my Periapsis. Usually ending up a few hundred meters from the station. From there, it\\\u0027s a matter of fine control with the RCS and then I end up right next to my target. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe distance from the target at the burn will vary depending on the altitude of the orbits. That\\\u0027s where Kosmo-Not\\\u0027s chart is helpful.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"boolybooly","CreatedById":6572,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-24T21:09:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Elink\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9726.msg144123#msg144123\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://kerbalspaceprogram.com/forum/index.php?topic=9726.msg144123#msg144123\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
