Calculating the bent is not that hard and putting this information back to the 3D model neither. But this way you\u0027d have a bending coefficent and a breaking value. This could result in other, pretty funny things, like things getting bend permanently, but not breaking, if too much force is applied. Struts could work this way. On some parts you could just ignore this, like parachutes (or only calculate something for them on impact. Like someone crashing into your stored chute and destroying it). But this will be a lot of work. Really a lot. It means writing your own physics engine, at least for the space ship parts.\n\nThe SAS problem is PID tuning. It could use some predictive code.

Could certainly due with being more solid still, but the \u0022wacky charm\u0022 bit doesn\u0027t really do much for me.\n\nYeah. I remember trying to secure those big orange tanks. But alot of the launch \u0027comics\u0027 were due to inexperience and you have to learn the tricks.\n\n1. Strut placement and triangulation. Placing struts on some parts of the ship have little effect, others have profound effects.\n\n2. The SAS module should not be on the part of the ship will highest flexibility per unit length. It better to turn off the space stage SAS and use a large SAS attached to the launch phases.\n\n3. The winglets need to be tuned. To close to the thrusters and they may apply to much force, to high up and too little. \n\n4. Reduce the number of segments (needs net-loonish exclamation points). While side mounting parts increases drag, it can markedly reduce the segmental flexibility, since the side mounted parts sit over a wider stages its not too bad if a cap is placed on top (or one blenders an aero tank or device). \n\n5. Build or stretch fuel tanks so that no stage is composed of more than one stacked tank. \n\nIf player does 2 through 5. they may find that they only need struts on space stages (looking at the lunar lander they appear to have strut comparables) , wanting stability may frequently be gained simply by slowing down the launch. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module#/media/File:LunarLander.JPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module#/media/File:LunarLander.JPG)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module#/media/File:LM-9KSC.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module#/media/File:Lunar_Module_Equipment_Locations_2_of_2.jpg)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo\\_Lunar\\_Module#/media/File:Lunar\\_Module\\_Equipment\\_Locations\\_2\\_of\\_2.jpg\n\nnote the extensive use of small struts. (cough), based on this and other similar images I created small strut connector scale mods that are basically fall into \n\n1. Welds (which the game really needs)\n\n2. lander strapers (i.e. about apollo lunar lander length)\n\n3. Stock\n\n4. Super long and heavy strut for securing things like a mega-space telescope to an oversized fuel tank.\n\nNote that !st, 2nd and 3rd parts can produce problems in VAB, the strut overstretch bug that locks the game until you exit VAB and reenter, since once you attach one end of the strut it will not release until to have validly attached the other end. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module#/media/File:Apollo_17_LM_Ascent_Stage.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module#/media/File:Apollo_17_LM_Ascent_Stage.jpg)\n\nNotice the enclosed out mounts for the RCS thrusters. I am using 3D scale-modded MK1 cylinders for out mounting, the stock MGS and the cubic strut just aren\u0027t suitable. They are not aerodynamic. \n\nNote that in the Heat Omnibus thread, I used such an enclosed outmount to feed a fuel line to an engine around the a heat shield (which blocks in-stack fuel transfers) to protect the rest of the craft from the improper heat reset issue in the game. \n\nAnd look how extensively struts are used in this research vessel\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module#/media/File:Lunar_Landing_Research_Vehicle_in_Flight_-_GPN-2000-000215.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Lunar_Module#/media/File:Lunar_Landing_Research_Vehicle_in_Flight_-_GPN-2000-000215.jpg)\n\nStruts are a reasonably good choice when you do not have to enclose a volume of gas, in total vacuum they do not produce drag. So the issue is enclosing the space stage.\n\nSo I have to disagree with OP. Struts have a place in the game and much of the wobble problem can be fixed by better design without necessarily resorting to struting the lower stages. And I think if you are creating someting \u0027outside\u0027 the NASA box, struts are a handy thing to have around even in launch stage. The reason why I say this is now with aero getting those wide draggy packages into space requires slowing the launch down (meaning engines like jets that are efficient and lots of them) and this also means securing those outmounts and also stabiling a huge dragy thing on a node that is stock 3.75 or with mod maybe 5 to 8 meters. I\u0027ve launched factorys that are almost 30 meter across so struts are very nice things to have around. \n\nBut........some parts realistically need zero span welds. (massless preferably)\n\n\u003E \n\u003E The problem with the wobble is that KSP only uses a singel point to attach parts, not the three point type. If you wonder what the difference is: Try to sit on a chair with only one leg.\n\u003E If you ask me, I\u0027d do a whole lot of things different.......\n\nYou can adjust the breaking torque parameter. \n\nIn general when I have fishing pole flexibility its because my launch SAS was on a thin space stage. If I turn off the space stage SAS and add a SAS module to the launch stage this causes alot to diminish. Then slow the speeds down.\n\nA second cause of wobble is winglet tuning. There is only one winglet in the game (unless you\u0027ve added more), but you can bet that NASA does not put winglets that are oversized or undersized on their rockets. Oversized winglets are as much a problem as undersized, but one can mediate this problem by moving the winglets up the launch phase lower the distance between the winglet and CoG and therefore lowering the torque they can produce. \n\nI don\u0027t want to use the word whine but from what I see alot of the complaints are complaints about not knowing the physics and poor design. I have launched rockets with 10 burn stages that are taller than the VAB itself, yeah used struts, yeah needed outmounts and modified struts, yeah slowed down launch phase, yeah its all to compensate for an unrealistic design with a magnitude more unwelded *segments* (meaning linewelded not separable) than NASA has in their rockets, should I expect flawless operation? But another point is that the GAME allows users to redesign parts to suit their needs, so don\u0027t whine, modify, and if the modification was really something the game needed then it might get added. \n\nIf you really really want to fix the single point snap issue without needing struts, modify your tanks to exactly fit your need. IOW don\u0027t have a 400 and 800 when you need a 1200, instead modify the scale of an 800, making the y = 1.5 times the original. Then add 50% more mass, 50% LF and 50% more Ox. Do this for every stage and reduce, realistically, the segmental flexibility. The real name of the problem is segmental flexibility, unrealistic numbers of segments result in \u0027unrealistic\u0027 levels of wobble. Count your segments from your SAS module in both directions and from your winglets. if you end up with lots of segments on the thinnest stage, . . . . . . . .\n\nIMHO, wobble and flexibility below 20000 meters alt tell me that I have a problem in my design. MechJeb generally takes care of the control issues (keyboard controls are not as good as stick controls). If the issue remains you have to treat is as a design flaw not neccesarily a game problem.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-16T20:04:50Z\u0022 title=\u002206/16/2015 08:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 16, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by PB666**"},{"CreatedByName":"Jouni","CreatedById":97346,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-16T19:54:11Z","Content":"In 0.22, it took me a long time to figure out how to use the Mainsail without it tearing the rocket apart. Over time, I slowly learned to use enough struts in the right places, sometimes building exoskeletons for my rockets.

Using standard lifters was almost mandatory, as it took a long time to build and test a heavy rocket.\n\nWhen I saw the first screenshots from 0.23.5, they looked ridiculous. Huge boosters were attached with just the decoupler and a single strut. Soon I learned to appeciate the change. Struts had become almost unnecessary, and rockets barely wobbled at all.
