Since NASA likes to do fancy CG videos of their missions, I decided to do one, in Kerbal of course! Took a weekend and about 40 hours to get it into it\\\u0027s final form. It\\\u0027s kinda long, but represents the mission from launch to landing. Thought it was pretty cool and you guys might like it.

Not many succeeded lol. But they all asked what it was so I got the word about Kerbal out a little more.
