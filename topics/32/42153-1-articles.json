That in turn means that I have to always have an infrastructure in place if I want to fly somewhere. I fly up to Kerbin Space Station, take a bus to Mun Space Station, then take a dedicated Mun Lander to the surface. The Mun Space Station gets refueled by a Fuel Shuttle from a Kethane Base on the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo far I\u0027ve been doing all this in equatorial orbits and equatorial landing sites. What if I wanted to land anywhere on Mun, though? I would need a space station on polar orbit. But that creates a problem that I can only take my bus from Kerbin twice per month. That\u0027s because I need to approach Mun at such an angle that will reach the space station without needing large burns to correct my longitude of ascending node. I might reach Mun polar orbit, but with a longitude of ascending node 90 degrees off in relation to the Mun space station. Correct me if I am wrong here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s not a big problem though, I can wait half a month (well not really a month, but it\u0027s tedious to call it \u0022a time it takes Mun to do one full orbit\u0022). The real problem comes when I want to do the same with Dres for example. Then I have to not only always wait for a transfer window for Dres, but also wait when the transfer window is aligned with the right approach angle for the polar space station. This might take many years and I don\u0027t like huge time warps. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what\u0027s the best way to reach every point on Dres then?

Then I need to wait for the right time to do a 90 degrees inclination burn to align my LAN with the station. The inclination burn should be cheap because I am in a high orbit, but I don\u0027t know how much waiting this involves (probably much less than option one).\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EI could just set up everything equatorially and then always land at the equator and perform a short suborbital hop to my base at higher latitude. This could be the fastest, but I don\u0027t know how much deltaV this involves.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EMaybe there is a possibility to set up some maneuver nodes during the flight to Dres in such a way that will allow me to approach the polar space station at the right angle no matter when I come to Dres?

And then it hit me that I cannot approach the Mun from behind, I always have to come from the front, because I have much lower orbital velocity than Mun at that point, so it has to catch up to me.
