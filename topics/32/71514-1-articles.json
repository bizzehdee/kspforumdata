The code running in the background basically falls into a self set trap where it attempts to divide by zero and hits a brick wall when it returns with something that isn\u0027t a number. Since the strings (correct? I\u0027m no programmer) are expecting to receive a number this leaves them unable to do their job properly and the result is the Kraken. The reason it\u0027s happening is fairly straight forward but tracking it down is not necessarily. Squad are clearly very talented devs, as are a lot of the mod community here. If it was straight forward Squad would have found it. If Squad left it in intentionally some from the community would have probably stumbled across it and fixed it. It\u0027s not been fixed because currently it can\u0027t be until they figure out how.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe idea that a dev would leave a bug in a game intentionally (Goat Simulator not included) strikes me as ridiculous. If you were selling a product, would you intentionally break it before shipping it out? There\u0027s just no business logic and Squad have done enough in the past to have proven they have good business sense, even if this is their first outing in video games, it\u0027s far from their first outing as a business. I\u0027m sure if they even tried to pull something like that Harvester would get grilled by the boss for shipping something intentionally broken. So no, I just don\u0027t see it as possible, and honestly it sounds like you\u0027re trying to create reasons for yourself not to buy it. Don\u0027t want it? Don\u0027t buy it, but don\u0027t accuse the devs of going out of their way to make bugs in the game when in reality they\u0027re working their asses off to squash the bugs while adding content and optimizing. That\u0027s a big challenge alone since it\u0027s not remotely similar to standard video game development processes which would typically allow you to focus on less at a time and leave optimization until the end.
