I have definitely made some mistakes, it seems like I really need to intercept at a location at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E so that I can get a fuel efficient course correction, is it possible to do this before the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E and would that improve things a lot? I\u0027m just trying to figure out what to do here, I am always having to tie in so many contracts to pay for the vessels. Someone has to know what the deal is with the mistakes I am making here. I am not too sure if I have characterized my issues well enough, but I wonder if it is just that I haven\u0027t had a real good crash course in handling asteroids.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T05:14:34Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you want to approach a Near-Kerbin asteroid which is still in\u00A0\u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoi\u003C/abbr\u003E of the sun, you can pretty much eyeball the direction, burn and make the next intercept burncorrection (should be pretty small) outside Kerbins \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E.\u003Cbr\u003E\nMake sure the trajectory\u00A0of your first burn contains also\u00A0the right inclination and points at the Kerbin \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E edge straight to\u00A0the desired target, aim at the Roid Icon, regardless all the colored trajectories!!!\u003Cbr\u003E\nIn \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESoi\u003C/abbr\u003E of the sun, draw an encounter regarding the Roid trajectory, fiddly but you are still in \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0of the sun while meeting it.\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt is somehow a bit brachistochrone but hey, you meet the chunk quickly an you have plenty of time to change his trajectory after \u003Cs\u003Erendezvouz\u003C/s\u003E\u00A0errm rendezvous.\u003Cbr\u003E\nAfter you get it, it becomes a piece cake.

First off, I might have too many mods so I am wondering if this might be a problem as well. My last mission due to an oversight of using remotetech even though I swear I put the dish on there I had to pilot with 1/7th or 1/8th of the reaction wheel capacity and I couldn\u0027t control anything. I thought reaction wheels would be better this time because last time I used \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E and even though I deactivated all the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E thrusters before flight the game decided to use them anyway for some reason. Then on top of that once I used the thrusters and steering the ship would sometimes bug out and swing around even going in the asteroid. I\u0027m definitely doing that part wrong and I don\u0027t really get what I have messed up.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Mikki","CreatedById":137508,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-11-01T16:50:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100668-claw/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u0022100668\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/100668-claw/\u0022 rel=\u0022\u0022\u003E@Claw\u003C/a\u003E, we bow down before you, Kerbal master!\u00A0\u003Cimg alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E Excellent tutorial!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
