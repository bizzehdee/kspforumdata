And up to this day, what is the megalomaniac MATRIX texture actually doing?). But since 0.90, there is another aspect to it: KSP itself consumes not just hundreds but over a GB of memory, ignoring textures. And there seem to be leaks that result in an inevitable out-of-memory after some time. ATM will neither fix the assets (it doesn\u0027t compress those), nor the memleaks. I run a highly optimized install of KSP - more than i suppose 99% of players are capable of achieving. Yet even my playtime is limited by: A) Initial wasteful base mem requirements. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E Memory leaks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other aspect is textures of mods. By now, this for fairness has to be split into at least three considerations:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1) No on demand loading and unloading of textures. I suppose argument in favor of this is: If your puter cannot handle loading ALL textures at the same time, then it would eventually crash anyways, as soon as there are enough vessels loaded into \u0022physics range\u0022 (a pitiful and laughable 2-something kilometres distance - what is this - the 80ies?). That might be so, but potential of crashing does not justify performance at a given point in time: When i design a puny probe in the VAB, i do not expect ALL textures of ALL parts, plus the entire vicinty of the KSC and kerbin, AND its oceans, to be loaded into memory... yet, that is what is the case. And it does matter, because FPS in the editor matters perhaps more than inflight - after all, you interact much more frequently with your craft in the editor, than in flight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2) Texture memory: I could write a long story here, but i think by 0.90, there are only two things to mention. First, neither squad nor modders care anymore by now about texture memory (most of them: I honestly apologize, if you\u0027re one of the exception - you\u0027ll get karma points in a few secs). This might seem like a bold claim, so to debunk any myths, let me tell you this: I have seen plenty of times SINGLE COLOR TEXTURES, of 1024x1024 or more... often 2048x2048.... MILLIONS OF PIXELS OF THE SAME ONE COLOR. DOZENS OF MEGABYTES (multiplied by THREE in VMEM), that can be expressed in THREE BYTES. I\u0027m not kidding - i\u0027m talking about a BLANK SINGLE COLOR IMAGE, wasting dozens of megabytes of VRAM. And that\u0027s not a singular case. I\u0027ve seen it many times, and i see it regularily for two or three color textures. To put it bluntly: Some devs with overly expensive rigs, seem to think that since they have a machine that can abundantly waste memory (probably on linux, without 32bit limits), they seem to think all it\u0027s users can afford to not give a ***** about VRAM too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere\u0027s a quite devious twist to this: It would appear that at least with regards to icons, some modders have adopted more efficient goals. Unfortunatelly, they now are punished for it - and forced to allocated larger textures than neccessary. This is because before 0.90, KSP used to not rescale textures in PNG format. So, modders started assuming, that if they store their textures in PNG, they will not be rescaled. THIS NO LONGER IS TRUE IN 0.90, and it is the reason for the pixelated or nonexistant icons reported in various threads. In theory, this is actually a feature, since normal part textures now are properly rescaled even if stored in PNG. It however stops being a feature, when apparently SQUAD did not inform the modders at all about this, nor about how to mark icons as non-rescalable. (Squad, you reading this? If you had spent 5 minutes of devtime, to set a lower limit - say, that textures smaller than 128x128 should not be downscaled... you wouldn\u0027t even have had to bother informing modders, and would have established forwards compabibility in uncountable cases.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3) This is a new thing, especially in 0.90. It used to be that KSP requires an excessive amount of RAM, but a rather fixed - and in terms of 32bit VMEM manageable - amount of VMEM. So, even though the \u0022fixed base costs\u0022 were significant, they were mostly static. This no longer applies in 0.90, because of memory leaks: No matter how carefully you pick your mods - no matter how much time you spend on handoptimizing textures (or letting ATM do it) - KSP will inevitable run out memory no matter what you do (on 32bit - much later on 64bit if you have enough mem), because of memory leaks. For example, on my setup, KSP will lose half a gigabyte in 20-25mins of playtime... so, no matter what optimizations i apply, i will have to reboot it from time to time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-02-03T01:48:07Z\u0022 title=\u002202/03/2015 01:48  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EFebruary 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by rynak\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Eembassassing addition about 128x128 downscale limit: cost \u0026lt;5 minutes devtime.\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-02-03T04:17:10Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENote that the stock game WILL crash eventually due to running out of memory.
