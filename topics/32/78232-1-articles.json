I got to thinking how the thought of how SSTO\u0027s were getting to be rather pointless in the game since you could build a disposable rocket to do the job much easier.

With an SSTO, the reward is even greater, especially with missions like rescuing a lost kerbal in orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis affirms to me that Squad embraces all aspects of space travel, and stations especially are bound to see more relevance with career mode in the next few updates. Heck, a proper fueling station with a science module could allow for SSTO\u0027s to make trips to the Mun and Minmus for the science to be found there with much more affordability.
