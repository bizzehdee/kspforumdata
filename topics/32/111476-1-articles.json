Does this happen to anyone else?"},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T08:55:25Z","Content":"Next time it happens check the [F3] flight log to see what exploded and why. Even though you\u0027re well up in space you might be crashing into one of the KSC buildings. It\u0027s a well known bug though I do not know what\u0027s causing it or how to solve."},{"CreatedByName":"RogueMason","CreatedById":45069,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T11:04:07Z","Content":"Don\u0027t tell me THAT bug still exists?! I almost always encountered it just as I was coming up to the runway with an SSTO from orbit, with the space centre somehow annihilating the ends of my main wings along with my tail fins. I managed to land most of the time, but good god, it was infuriating.\n\nIf I encounter it in 1.0, I won\u0027t be happy. That was one bug I expected to be gone."},{"CreatedByName":"Tex_NL","CreatedById":58254,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-31T13:45:37Z","Content":"I **HAVE** encountered it in 1.0.X. So sadly yes, it does still exist."}]}
