I wanted to kethane map the entire system. This mission dates to .20.2. I had 4 satellites in 2 tandem craft launched for Jool. The first one I separated because the tandem drive ran out of fuel. The first one crashed into Jool because it ran out of fuel (and these were ION probes) changing inclination (I had come in retrograde). The other remained stuck in the retrograde orbit dancing between Bop and Pol, often getting encounters, too tantalizingly short to capture with so little thrust. While working to save those two, the other pair entered and due to my frequent timewarping and inattentiveness (this was without kerbal alarm clock), I accidentally slingshotted the other tandem out of the system onto an orbit which bounced them between Duna and Dres. I was unable to line anything up without adding about a decade to my game clock, so I abandoned that mission and terminated.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELater I tried to get kethane probes in with a large manned carrier type ship. That mission ran out of fuel while trying to capture into lathe. Lathe spit it back out and Tylo caught it, bringing it in on a collision course. I killed Bob, Bill, and Jeb in that ship. That\u0027s 5 failed ships sent.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMultiple more probe missions and even an audacious mission to send two seaplanes to Lathe all failed in some way, eaten by the jolly green giant and her massively shifting SoI of moons. I killed the heroic three at least once more and have also lost the better part of a kethane base sent as a two ship mission by Tylo\u0027s oversized SoI throwing monkeywrenches in things.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Galacticruler","CreatedById":58398,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T01:32:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDres, because it is just..sitting there, silently waiting to mess with your intercepts.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"The Spacemonkey","CreatedById":74681,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-03T01:37:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Pol could be chosen, then I would\u0027ve chose that.
