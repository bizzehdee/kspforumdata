For example, I want to know how does the game\u00A0calculate the force produced by the wing(s) while flying in a specific speed.

To calculate aerodynamics, it just adds up the drag and lift values, so you can get some funky craft to fly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I think, please correct me if I\u0027m wrong)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"jimmymcgoochie","CreatedById":199902,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-19T16:28:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nUnlike real wings, the wing parts in KSP are not directional and do not produce aerodynamic lift in the true sense- they need to be angled into the air to deflect air downwards and will happily do the same in the other direction if angled the other way.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWhen building planes, angle your wings very slightly so that the leading edge (nearest the nose) is slightly higher, this gives you a bit of lift at a neutral pitch and can reduce drag at high speeds as well as making your plane much easier to take off as the wings produce lift when it\u2019s rolling down the runway.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"KerikBalm","CreatedById":91917,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-19T16:30:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLift depends on angle of attack, a wings defined area, and velocity squated, except that the coefficient of lift changes with mach number, I don\u0027t know the exact formula used\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Yi C","CreatedById":202745,"CreatedDateTime":"2020-05-20T08:33:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00223787729\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022193991\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221589905849\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u002291917\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022KerikBalm\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\n16 hours ago, KerikBalm said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLift depends on angle of attack, a wings defined area, and velocity squated, except that the coefficient of lift changes with mach number, I don\u0027t know the exact formula used\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe fact\u00A0is I know that lift depends on those too, I just want to know how is that calculated\u2026\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
