The elevons were hitting the maximum travel with about four clicks left on the roll meter. Changing the sensitivity or dead-zone in the settings didn\u0027t help. For clarity, they were fully deploying but they were just doing so in a compressed time and before I had used the whole sweep of my gamepad paddle buttons.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo I decided to try something. I placed two pairs of elevons on the wing of a craft, one inner pair and one outer pair. For the outer pair I set them up just like normal, with only the \u0022Roll\u0022 actuation on. For the inner pair I disabled the toggles for roll as well as pitch and yaw. But I went into the action groups and in the \u0022Axis Groups\u0022 I assigned the \u0022Roll\u0022 action group to the inner pair of elevons, making sure to select the \u0022Deploy Angle\u0022 function and setting it to \u0022Absolute Control\u0022 instead of \u0022Incremental Control.\u0022\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow the inner pair of elevons should still respond to the roll input on my gamepad but it bypasses the normal roll assignment. If you remove one of those elevons from symmetry and invert the direction then they will function like normal ailerons without having to use the KAL controller. And indeed it did. The inner pair of elevons used the full width of the roll meter to reach the end of their travel, when the normally assigned outer pair would stop before the inner pair did.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI don\u0027t know exactly what this means, and it\u0027s not ideal, but at least there is a way to gain full range of the axis without having to program a KAL controller. Unfortunately, they won\u0027t respond to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Stability Augmentation System\u0022\u003ESAS\u003C/abbr\u003E control in this configuration which severely limits its functionality.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222020-09-22T22:05:51Z\u0022 title=\u002209/22/2020 10:05  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00223 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 22, 2020\u003C/time\u003E by HvP\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
