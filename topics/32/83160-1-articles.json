I didn\u0027t find anything wrong with your voice, although except the volume was a bit low, and combined with a bit of sing-songy intonation it\u0027s a bit hard to follow. I\u0027ve the habit of doing the same thing, so when I read or speak to others I have to make an effort to break rhythm or just the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI was also kind of confused about what your installed mods were (that\u0027s going to affect your goals on a per-session basis). That made it a bit difficult to identify with the experience. Unfortunately, I\u0027m a bit goal-oriented, so typically I you-tube to learn how to solve specific problems rather than watch people chill and play. There\u0027s nothing wrong with that, and a lot of people do it, but I\u0027m less lkely to tune into that kind of thing. But you seem pretty good at the game, so I think you\u0027d have a lot to share with a bit more organization applied.
