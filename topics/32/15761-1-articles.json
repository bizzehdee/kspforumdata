He thought this was great, and subsequently posted a picture to reddit, which made the front page that afternoon. Somebody e-mailed us about it, and the whole company saw the reddit post. We decided to include free stickers with every order that mentioned reddit (there were many) along with rage face stickers and even laser-engraved boxes. Over the following few days, I kept checking reddit to see if any more of our handiwork was being submitted. While searching for the word \u0027laser\u0027 I found a submission on the /r/kerbalspaceprogram subreddit about how a guy had deployed a laser reflector on the Mun.
