From my observation the problem is not the that the science could be spammed, if there is data available a science module should be able to get 100% of that data on the first go, after all that is what they are intended to do. The thermometer gets temperature readings and fairly accurate ones at that, but what about infrared readings, or radiation readings as well. The purpose of sending the probes out is to collect the data they are designed to collect. However the hangup with probes in real life, is a loss of data during transmission that may require multiple transmissions of that data in order to get it. So my question is would it be more challenging of a gameplay experience to make science time sensitive instead of \u0022fly here, click module, transmit, done\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is what I mean, lets say you have a probe that is scheduled to do a fly-by of mun, given a low speed of data transmission, high speed and descending rate of velocity, you know that of 200 total science you are going to collect, your probe is only going to be able to transmit so much of the avaliable data over a given amount of time, and none once it is on the dark side of the Mun. So your thermometer collects all 32 points of science that it can collect from around the Mun and begins the slow process of transmitting that science back home. However, your radiation detector is picking up fluctations in the levels of radiation and is there for going to take time to collect the data before it can begin the slow process of transmitting the data back home. Of course, data tramission speeds are dependent both upon antenna size and power available. What this could create is a slow but steady stream of science rather than just large lumpsums of science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kinglet","CreatedById":58832,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T13:10:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis would also keep antennas from instantly eating huge amounts of electricity.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Monger","CreatedById":4143,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T13:13:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERemember that the rules of a game should\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ea) be transparent and obvious to all players\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_cool.png\u0022 alt=\u0022B)\u0022\u003E offer a series of interesting choices (freely quoted after Will Wright)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo what is the choice here?

This allows the player to put up more probes in the same area doing different jobs at the same time, or the same time of probe somewhere else. This means multiple sources of slowly generating science at all times. Inexperienced players can design small single job probes in large quantities and players like Mr. Scott Manly will find themselves designing larger more sophisticated probes with multiple antennas to transmit data. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs far as energy is concerned, its really quite simple, science modules need energy to collect data, antennas need power to transmit. The batteries can be there to allow the conitinued transmission of science and to allow for control when a power source is not available. This works out especially well early in the game and in terms of part cost because the player is asking themselves, especially when the budget is finally implemented, \u0022Do I build a probe that has a set battery life for really cheap, or do I spend a little extra money on the solar panels\u0022 In terms of cost, the batteries are the way to go, but do not guarnetee that you will have the battery life to collect all the science you want. In terms of life span, an RTG or solar array is what you want, but the low power output means slower rates of science unless you stack them to provide more power.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Flowz0r","CreatedById":9387,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T13:35:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThink of it this way: \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA science part takes a single reading, which gets you most of the information you need.

A completionist is someone who will go so far as to mark every anamoly with a flag and set up manned stations on every planet things like this arbitrary achievements. When you are talking about a resource in a game like science points in KSP a player needs to be able to expend all available sources of that resource around them there by motivating them to send probes to the more difficult places to gather more science points. This could even stress more strategic thinking in the consumption of those resources as it changes the mentality from \u0022Oh ill just go here and grab all of these science points\u0022 to \u0022I am generating 2 science per minute with a grand total of 200 which means that in roughtly 1 hour, time acceleration dependent of course, I will be able to get those new engines that I was looking\u0022. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne of the reasons I suggest passivey generated science is because once the budget is implemented for career mode, it is not going to be financially advantageous to send probes out to go and gather 5 science. At least if you can gather that science passively and totally, then you know that you have expended that resource for that area, meaning you really do have to go to laythe and set up a probe there and in doing so your not wasting time and money on things like pocket change science. Passively generated science, gives an advantage in terms of nearby celestial bodies like Mun and Minmus, but when you start speaking in terms of sending probes to Jool, the time it takes to get there almost overwhelms the advent of the reward. So why not make it so that if you only want to do one trip to Jool to gather negative gravioli data, you can do that, but if you want to send 5 probes to assist in gathering that data, you can do that too, either way you are going to expend that resource totally one way or another.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"soldieroffilth","CreatedById":88590,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-07T16:02:47Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Luckless\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Luckless\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EPersonally I would prefer having science experiments run over time.

This could be easily done with a series of true/false statements that check to see if 1)power is present, 2) the module is active, and 3) the antenna is active. If all are true then they passively generate science whether the craft is being actively flown or not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo avoid stacking for quicker science rates, each probe can only generate 1 point of science for each IBE type on the craft. This is because with two or more IBE\u0027s of the same type on the same craft they are only double checking their results. However in order to generate more science in the same biome another probe with the same or similar equipment would have to be active and transmitting as well. As a probe moves through each biome the IBE\u0027s generate science in regard to how much science is available in that biome, if all the science in that biome has been done, they will generate no more science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf going to , say Duna, you will generate science from being in the solar biome, Duna high orbit biome, Duna low orbit biome, Duna atmosphere biome, and ultimately the surface of Duna, and how much of the science cap you pull from depends entriely upon how much time you stay in each biome. This works especially well for rovers and can extend their mission life span as they will need to move from biome to biome in order to get science from those biomes. It could even be setup so that you get science for day and night side conditions of each biome on a planets surface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow arguably this might be abused at this point in time of the KSP development by using time acceleration, but once the budget and reputation mechanics are implemented a player wouldn\u0027t really be able to do so as using time acceleration at any point in time during career mode as doing so might upset other time sensitive operations and contracts where a player needs to be doing something other than time warping to increase science gain. Abuse of time acceleration can be also be avoided by adding deprecation values to equipment, whether it is micrometeorite impacts or prolonged exposure to radiation, equipment will eventually begin to fail and sensors will fall out of calibration. Adding this value can ensure that even if a player does decide to time accelerate to increase their science gain rate, that rate will fall as time goes on until it reaches the point where it is no longer useful.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDepreciation of the IBE\u0027s results is expressed this way through time instead of limiting how much science can be achieved, after all if a probe is sending nothing but raw data, that data can be resent over and over until the full set of data is attained, which is more or less the basis of the suggestion, but the hang up is that no probe is going to spend enough time in a biome to collect all of the data unless specifically commanded, or flown, to that biome and set up so that it stays there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis would also increase the mission life span of all probes, Voyager 2 conducted several experiments to several planetary systems during its life span and continues to collect data, however because our own tech tree has expanded and given us more options for research we have found that we are still sending probes to locations that Voyager 2 has been to, and not just to get newer types of data but to also get a better look at what Voyager 2 was only able to give a glimpse of.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222014-01-07T20:11:05Z\u0022 title=\u002201/07/2014 08:11  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EJanuary 7, 2014\u003C/time\u003E by soldieroffilth\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
