I only accept the part test and do science at x contracts if Im using that part or going to x anyway, and I only accept satellite contracts for things like geosync and useful seeming trajectories. It\u0027s a playstyle thing. I get the philosophical aversion to the game adding things you didn\u0027t, especially when it comes to the role-playing thing of being the first to duna or whatever. I don\u0027t feel like I could outright tell people they shouldn\u0027t have access to contracts I just happen to not like though necessarily.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"NoMrBond","CreatedById":69263,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T22:39:41Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ObsessedWithKSP\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMultiplayer: still very much in development, but is a looooooong endeavour.\u003C/strong\u003E Like, to make it is fairly easy.
