A player who is focusing on aesthetics doesn\u0027t concern themselves with the process, only the end result. People often build recreations of famous sci-fi craft without worrying about whether they can fly. Focusing entirely on aesthetics, we have single-part reproductions of famous vessels. Others have travel as their goal, and aren\u0027t concerned with appearances. The average Eve-return vessel won\u0027t win any beauty contests!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s the same argument we see with MechJeb. People focus on the aspects of the game that appeal to them, and de-emphasise the ones that don\u0027t using tools like mods or part clipping. If the idea of running a semi-realistic space program is what appeals to you, you can see how placing a fuel tank through the body of a kerbal would be difficult to rationalise. For this play style, mods are the equivalent of parts from different manufacturers. Mods are \u0022overpowered\u0022 if their performance is far enough from what could be physically possible to be immersion breaking. Again, what level of impossibility is acceptable differs from person to person.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen it comes to forum discussion, not everyone is playing by the same game ruleset.
