As others have said, with the nuclear engines you need surprisingly little fuel. The issue for me was how many engines I carried. Nuclear engines are fine for the stuff that can happen slowly, like the plane change and establishing Eeloo orbit from the Hohmann transfer. They\u0027re annoying for the boost away from Kerbin, so I held onto my last pair of mainsails from the Kerbin ascent, refuelled, and used them to start my escape burn, switching them off when I was close enough to Krbin escape velocity to finish the burn on the nukes without a problem.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"bsalis","CreatedById":32928,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-13T09:07:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI used an SSTO Spaceplane.
