Landing can has a cockpit with very really good visibility, the DLC dual landing cabin is suprisingly poor in that regard. Well, maybe not that surprising because the thing was designed for humans and Kerbals got eyes on what would be chest level for humans. Also is special in that it\u0027s a in stack 2.5m cockpit, and is better at fitting heat shields.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHonestly though, I rarely use that thing. Looks too ugly for my taste, and the windows has ugly reflections blocking sight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222018-03-14T11:02:55Z\u0022 title=\u002203/14/2018 11:02  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00226 yr\u0022\u003EMarch 14, 2018\u003C/time\u003E by Temeter\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
