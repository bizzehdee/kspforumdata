The first (and most notable for me), time this happened was when I was coming back from my first Ike mission. I was coming into Kerbin\u2019s atmosphere at almost 4 km/s, and ended up just barely not getting captured because my periapsis was too high. Upon realizing this, I got Jeb out of the ship and had him push it back with his EVA pack until it ran out of fuel and he became stranded floating in space. After Jeb was stranded, Mungan Kerman went on EVA to get himself back into an orbit, and while this was successful, he was fried on reentry. In the end, the last Kerbal remaining on my craft was Rodfurt, who didn\u2019t do anything and was left to orbit the sun for the rest of my career game.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Axelord FTW","CreatedById":1896,"CreatedDateTime":"2022-01-25T02:12:14Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEVA fuel replenish upon boarding a craft.
