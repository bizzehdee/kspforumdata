Historically, agricultural development happened around the world almost all at once with no communication between civilizations. Which may not sound like a huge accomplishment. However, this allowed humans to have specializations, such as blacksmithing, or tailoring and allowed free time for people to think even more and invent. Imagine what life would look like without being able to go to the grocery and get food.\u00A0I submit to you that it is no mere coincidence, just human nature, that if given enough time, we will always (more often than not) arrive at the best solution for a problem.\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"MaxwellsDemon","CreatedById":147660,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-03-14T20:35:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222985444\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022157705\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221489519016\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022134040\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022A_name\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 3/14/2017 at 3:16 PM, A_name said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cspan lang=\u0022en-us\u0022 xml:lang=\u0022en-us\u0022\u003ERockets with huge fins on the bottom, a.k.a.

topic and one I\u0027ve thought about a lot.\u00A0 My philosophy right now is to go for fairly realistic ships in that I use TAC life support and always include about 4 or 5 tons of living space per Kerbal.\u00A0 I basically look at the size of different crewed modules (I also use Planetary Base Systems) and incorporate what I think looks like enough living space for hard-core astronaut types that are totally motivated for their mission.\u00A0 So of course that is way less space than a wimp like me would be able to deal with on a 5 or 6 year round trip to Jool, but probably realistic for hardened veterans of space flight.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThough my ships are very functional and I can pretty much do any mission (though maybe not as efficiently as the real

looks.\u00A0 Plenty of food, living space and making the ships not too \u0027Kerbal\u0027 (by that I mean using multiple launches and docking realistic-sized sections instead of just making one 10,000 ton ship) and of course having it look nice and maybe even innovative.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe other facet of this philosophy, however, is that part of my idea of \u0027realism\u0027 is to deal with the actual game limitations as I would any real life situation.\u00A0 This isn\u0027t a perfectly realistic space/flight simulation so sometimes you have to do stuff that is a little unlikely to happen or be designed that way in real life.\u00A0 It took me a long time to come to terms with that fact that I can\u0027t always solve problems like NASA or ESA would because of little quirks of the game, but in real life you deal with the actual situation confronting you and not always holding to some abstract ideal.\u00A0 That may sound a bit overly philosophical, but when I do design something a little on the \u0027Kerbal\u0027 side versus a more realistic interpretation, I don\u0027t worry about it as much as I used to because being effective in the game is slightly more
