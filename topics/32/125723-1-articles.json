Therefore, I have a few questions:\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich destinations should be included in a UIGT? The GN mod includes several systems that only include stars, with no planets to land on. Should those be simply skipped, and if we should go there, what should we do in a solar system with no planets in it? \u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nISRU and a warp drive mod are basically requirements to make this sort of thing feasible.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhich planet packs should be included? I rather doubt that I\u0026#39;ll be able to get all of the planet packs supported by GN to fit in my 3 GB of ram along with the mod for warp drives. This means there is a high likelihood that I\u0026#39;ll have to pick and choose certain planet packs. Any ideas which ones are better candidates for this sort of thing?\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAnd lastly, would you like to see this as [noparse]A:)[/noparse] A series of mission reports [noparse]B:)[/noparse] A series of Youtube videos [noparse]C:)[/noparse] Something else [noparse]D:)[/noparse] Two or all of the above [noparse]E:)[/noparse] None of the above.\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-17T16:21:16Z\u0022 title=\u002211/17/2015 04:21  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 17, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by hawkinator\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Esme","CreatedById":107436,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T16:34:05Z","Content":"\nI woudl be fascinated to see reports of such a game.

There\u0026#39;s a LOT of planets out there, and I wouldn\u0026#39;t want you skimping on the missions just so you can get to all of them.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIt may also be wise to send a flotilla. I\u0026#39;m usually a proponent of massive singular motherships, but if you\u0026#39;re going on a multi-system grand tour, you\u0026#39;re likely to go way beyond KSP\u0026#39;s \u0022reasonable\u0022 part count limits. It can also save you time if you send each ship to a few planets, and stagger their arrival times using KAC so you can take turns visiting planets one after the other without having to wait years and years every time. I guess that\u0026#39;s not technically a grand tour in the classical sense any more, but you\u0026#39;d still be visiting everything and it\u0026#39;d still make a fun series to follow - something like Kuzzter\u0026#39;s Duna and Eve stories involving multiple ships.\n"},{"CreatedByName":"sdj64","CreatedById":100819,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-17T22:55:48Z","Content":"\nThe part count really depends on if the mods installed allow you to bring a lander that can SSTO from all the planets you want to land on. If you can, it will decrease the part count drastically. I could see 3 main components: lander, transfer stage that can land on low gravity moons and refuel, and a scanning satellite if your preferred ISRU requires it. Without an SSTO lander, you might want to bring additional ships to carry landers or disposable lander stages. I had an almost working Eve lander that could be reused by attaching new drop tanks on docking ports. It would keep its core with engines, crew, batteries, and most of its part count, while the stages are just 2 parts each - tanks with docking ports on them that are dropped in an asparagus pattern.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nIf you really want to go to every system, install them one at a time and delete them afterward if all you leave is flags. More complicated if you want to leave stuff behind like rovers and probes.\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nAs for the format of sharing it, use anything that can possibly contain the awesomeness of such a mission.
