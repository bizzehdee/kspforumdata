Rightclick on the dockingport of your current vessel which you want to dock in, and select \u0022control from here\u0022 - also select the docking port you are heading to (if in view range) and select \u0022set as target\u0022. This allows a much more precice approach because normally you controll your craft from the manned capsule which might result in \u0022false\u0022 angles or false distances shown!
