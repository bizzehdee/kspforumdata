So I got it, and loaded into the game. Now, I didn\u0027t check this yesterday, I had other issues I had to attend to, but today I noticed rockets that previously had no trouble getting anywhere suddenly no longer work. Just got back from a launch that should have gone smoothly, according to the numbers I had from Kerbal Engineer. But at the launchpad the rocket didn\u0027t want to leave the ground for half it\u0027s first stage fuel load. Which of course was not planned for, leaving me well short of the delta V needed to get into orbit. So was it this tiny update today that broke things? I never saw a change log for the tiny update.
