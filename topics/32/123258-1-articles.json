My video card is where I think I will get the most improvement in KSP\u0027s performance. I currently run a MSI GTX 780 graphics card, which until now has been beautiful.

You may be able to tweak other things to allow a higher base clock but you really need to adjust the clock multiplier to get serious overclocks. However, not all CPUs allow this.
