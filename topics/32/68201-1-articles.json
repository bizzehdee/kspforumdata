How far can get on this single stage? Whats it going to take to get to Eeloo? Whats the heaviest thing I can lift in to space? From where I am sitting the intent behind KSP from day one was to provide an environment for players to explore, but it would be up to them to figure out how to get there. Big engines like the SLS just mean that setting up a colony on Laythe is now a bit more practical.
