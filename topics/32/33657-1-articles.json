It\u0027s something altogether different when you\u0027re wrong because you know you did something stupid.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve seen KSP on Steam. I even watched the one video that was up there for it. You know the one... the guy takes his helmet off on the Mun. I saw it, I considered it, and I discarded it out of hand. I\u0027d been burned by shallow, boring indie games before on Steam, you see. Not that that is any kind of acceptable excuse. And so I carried along, sans rocketry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen yesterday I run afoul of a certain JREF thread. Specifically, this one: \u003Ca href=\u0022Its\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJREF\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe name recognition got me, I clicked the link to see what about this game had managed to entrall enough JREF posters to merit a multipage thread. And I saw those pictures. I read the enthusiasm people have for this game. And I reconsidered.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went home that day, downloaded the demo for KSP, and took it for a spin. Specifically, a flat spin from about four kilometers up that ended in a fireball, a handful of crushed field mice, and a topsoil depth crater sufficient enough to give all the world\u0027s landscapers nightmares. I was enthused; the Kerban was dead. What I had initially took for a goofy, non-complexity based game completely devoid of realism or challenge actually concealed large measures of both. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo then the grief strikes. If I\u0027d only been around a few months earlier, I could\u0027ve been there, at the launch pad, with the rest of you, as this strange machine was fueling up. Instead, I have to cling meekly from the outside. Peering in through a tiny window. Wondering if you guys have coffee in there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI bet it\u0027s great coffee.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, that\u0027s it. That\u0027s my failure. I relapsed to the whole judging/book/cover combo fallacy, and my lapse is now revealed to all. I am sorry. I will make amends by buying this game. I will enjoy it. I know I will; I got three hours of sleep last night because I spent my usual scheduled coma time towards building a reliable heavy lift booster system. And now I post here, full of grief and coffee. I look on it as a learning mechanism; Even the finest of brews can come from the strangest looking grounds. You do a disservice only to yourself by opting out and not at least trying it out with a bit of half and half and sugar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~Whackjob\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-06-18T20:10:42Z\u0022 title=\u002206/18/2013 08:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EJune 18, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Whackjob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sir Nahme","CreatedById":57378,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-18T20:17:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYou have doomed yourself!

It didn\u0027t take long; yesterday I treated myself to my very own birthday present and bought the darn thing (can\u0027t wait for the finished game). Putting a lousy probe in orbit felt like such an accomplishment, I know now I\u0027m hopelessly hooked.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I\u0027ll briefly hi-jack your thread here to report myself in, and tell everyone I\u0027ve been thoroughly enjoying every corner of these forums.

I had a rocket (this is the demo game, recall) where the center \u0022mast\u0022 was a tri-stack of the larger fuel tanks. On the outside, I had three booster rockets that I could disengage when their fuel was spent. I braced the heck out of those rockets, and it looked nice and sturdy. After liftoff, all looked well, until I shed the boosters. The three-tank central spire? Bolted together at the top, wiggling like mad at the bottom. Torque added, stress added, shrapnel added. I had neglected to strut the bottom properly. A lesson I\u0027m sure we all agree is critical.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMine Kerbonaut survived, this time, because I finally added a parachute.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlways put struts between tanks that are joined in a stack!

Just view your flight log to see which two parts unglued first, and strut those two parts up tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOf course if you want a pre-made even more obnoxiously huge stack (be careful, it can still wobble into two pieces if you run the very last Mainsail engine at more than 1/3 power), have one of mine, \u003Ca href=\u0022http://kerbalspaceprogram.com/joolrover/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E (requires Mechjeb, ISA Mapsat).
