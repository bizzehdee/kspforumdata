KSP is one of them. I\u0027m proud to be a member of the community here, too.

While some aspects of this anger may be justified, others are certainly not. So today, I\u0027m just going to give my two cents on the current state of affairs within the community, as well as how it can be improved.

After the release of 1.0, many Forum-goers have been irate about SQUAD releasing KSP prematurely, which has led to some heated discussion.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s difficult to emphasize this enough: \u003Cstrong\u003E1.0 has already been released.\u003C/strong\u003E It\u0027s out, whether you like it or not. There is nothing you can do to change this fact, unless you have a time machine. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003EAnd even then, the paradoxes would be immense!\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it right to be irritated that 1.0 isn\u0027t as good a version as you thought it would be? Perhaps. But many people on the Forum are taking it one step further. Their argument is, essentially, that we warned SQUAD of the impeding problems with 1.0 and they didn\u0027t listen. Depending on who you ask, they could certainly be considered correct. But bringing up this point again and again is akin to gloating. At the end of the day, \u003Cem\u003Ewhat does it accomplish?\u003C/em\u003E It doesn\u0027t make a better game and it doesn\u0027t make for a better community. Indeed, there have been some serious, often impolite arguments flying both ways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only argument you could make in favor of this gloating is that some are saying, \u0022SQUAD should listen to the community more! If it did, these things wouldn\u0027t happen.\u0022 But if we\u0027re just deadlocked in events of the past, criticizing decisions that have already been made, there\u0027s no real reason why SQUAD \u003Cem\u003Ewould\u003C/em\u003E listen to us. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s time to accept that 1.0 is out, and that it\u0027s a much better use of your time to ask that SQUAD fixes things that \u003Cem\u003Earen\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E impossible to fix.

Claiming to know exactly how the game should be developed, and getting irritated when it is not so.\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was once an expression that went something like, \u0022The greatest experts are the ones in the stands.\u0022 I can\u0027t remember exactly how it goes, but you get the idea. \u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:8px;\u0022\u003E(Anyone who could point me towards the real expression gets free Internet points!)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESQUAD, it is important to note, is doing what it thinks is best for KSP.\u003C/strong\u003E There are a few people who think that it is deliberately trying to make a bad game, and this is \u003Cem\u003Esimply not the case\u003C/em\u003E. If SQUAD really was trying to make a bad game, I hope you can agree that the game would be much worse than it is now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, they sometimes don\u0027t listen to their community. And sometimes they are wrong. But they listen to the community quite often, and they are actually right more often than not. I don\u0027t think that enough people appreciate this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it reasonable to make requests to SQUAD? Absolutely. Is it right to get irritated if these requests are not fulfilled? Not really. While SQUAD\u0027s opinions on what make this game great may be different from ours, it has full control over the game and nothing will change this. In addition, the community\u0027s interests and SQUAD\u0027s interests often align well, though they may disagree when it comes to the minutiae of the game. There\u0027s where the \u0022SQUAD isn\u0027t listening to us!\u0022 argument comes into play. (I know there are exceptions to this, but it seems as if many quibbles are over surprisingly minor aspects of the game.)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would also say that few other developers work with the community at all, including indie game developers. SQUAD is doing us a huge favor as it is. When we\u0027re yelling things at SQUAD, we\u0027re going a little too far. And when SQUAD doesn\u0027t unconditionally try to work on what we want and we get irritated, we\u0027re behaving like privileged children who don\u0027t know how lucky they are. I\u0027m sorry to say this, but it negatively impacts the community. And I don\u0027t think anyone wants that to happen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E~~~\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:14px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-family:Georgia;\u0022\u003E3.

As a matter of fact, it will make them even more opposed to your point of view. Being hostile does not encourage rational thought, but instead personal attacks and other such travesties.

Gamers will buy ANYTHING.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve heard some commentators say that another game market crash is approaching because of this over-saturation.
