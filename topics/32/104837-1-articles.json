Designing, building, planning, lots and lots of planning! 13 ships, 3 space stations, over two dozen landers, rovers, planes, boats!, SSTO Seaplanes (four of them!) a budget of 6,000,000 funds!\n\nEverything has been designed, built, and tested. I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m halfway through orbital construction of the Fleet (6 of the 13 ships are done) departure in 45 days!\n\nBecause of all of this, I never upgraded to 0.9.\n\nAnd now: Monday!\n\nNew aero, heat shields! Resources! And I never did get into those new MK3 parts, Kerbal skillz or the new VAB.\n\nI\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m so conflicted!

While the same time my mouth is watering over the new features, and fewer bugs.\n\nSo I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2m taking votes:\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA.
