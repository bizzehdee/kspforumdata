At launch that may result in failing pre-launch checks, engine failure, other undefined \u0027failure to launch\u0027 or an explosion. If the launch succeeds a similar process applies in-flight, with solar panel, landing leg and other external faults being favoured because they encourage the player to spacewalk :-) Broken wheels are unlikely to feature much because other planets/moons are only a single location, just to say \u0027been there, done that, got the space helmet\u0027, so no rovers (well, there IS one, but it\u0027s just in KSC).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf/when the player is a mechanic or engineer the reliability of a vehicle is adjusted according to how well they perform their launch-preparation tasks. In-flight, prior experience as a mechanic/engineer affects repair chance - craftsmen fix things faster. Incidentally; experience as an astronaut affects deltaV use and flight-time - more experienced pilots fly more efficiently. (Ooops, just realised I haven\u0027t coded the deltaV equations yet - that\u0027s why the rocket-building is limited to serial-staging btw, because it makes it easier to calculate deltaV).\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-30T02:30:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EKTP\u0026gt;\u0022You are standing on a truncated pyramidal mount of concrete with gratings on top.
