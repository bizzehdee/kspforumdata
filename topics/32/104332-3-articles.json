Basically it boils down to \u0022infinite monkey theory is a crock\u0022. A moderately-sized team of focused and trained testers produces far better and more intelligible results than an entire community bashing the software randomly into walls. Yes, some things get missed, but with the wide-scale testing, targeting major issues is much more difficult. And yes, this does include the possibility of doing both.
