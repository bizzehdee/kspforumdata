Pilots still feel extraneous, unmanned probes should be encouraged more (starting off the tech tree with unmanned pods would help this a bit). Kerbal experience seems tacked on. Et cetera, et cetera.\n\nYes, exactly. I think for many here this doesn\u0027t feel like such a big deal if they\u0027re just building out their dreams in sandbox mode, but I think getting the features feeling really right together in a sensible career mode is critical to a true 1.0 release.

My main reasoning for this is that since this is going to be 1.0, reviewers are going to treat it as a finished product.

These can be simple typos, memory leaks (I believe Mike found the causes of the two biggest ones already), or things like the radial decoupler bug, etc.\n\n-Optimizations: Doing more with less. E.g., Better RAM management (dynamic loading of parts, load textures in a smaller format), creating a smaller HDD footprint, creating shared textures when possible, etc.\n\n-Performance: Reduce clock cycles to perform a task. E.g., rewrite the physics code, update orbital information less often, make contract checking less of a burden, write faster shaders and other GFX improvements, etc.\n\nNote the difference between \u0022optimizations\u0022 and \u0022performance\u0022. Using a gigabyte less of RAM won\u0027t allow you to build larger vessels that run at full speed, nor will being able to have a 1000 part ship that runs at 100% necessarily mean that you\u0027ve reduced the RAM requirements."},{"CreatedByName":"White Owl","CreatedById":10849,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-17T06:14:34Z","Content":"Hang on, wait a minute here!\n\nIf the big concern is what features and/or fixes can make it to the release version 1.0... and it looks like you can\u0027t get in absolutely everything you want, otherwise this thread wouldn\u0027t exist... and you say you\u0027re willing to change the plan on the fly...\n\nDoes the next version really *have* to be 1.0?
