Landed 100 kilometers away, spent the next 2 and half hours rovering towards it and it was probably the smoothest gameplay experience I ever had in KSP. The heavier gravity of Eve makes flipping over very hard, there aren\u0027t any bumps almost anywhere, and the hills are extremely gradual, making runaway tumbles down big hills very unlikely. I don\u0027t think any other planet could offer a smoother roving experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Canopus","CreatedById":57774,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-06-28T06:09:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ENot for me.

The high gravity give wheels excellent traction for uphill/downhill/braking/cornering at high speeds, the dense atmosphere help to prevent sideways drift (but at the cost of lower max ground speed due to drag) and the intensified solar radiation and relatively quick day/night cycles (not as short as Kerbin, but much shorter than say, a day on Mun) ensures plentiful energy during the day and nights that are not too long.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/30909-Two-men-Eve-landing-and-return-(image-heavy)\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI once drove a manned 5 ton rover 80km to the ocean, then 90km uphill to my return vehicle parked on a 5km mountain top. \u003C/a\u003E Both trips were done by simply putting pedal to the metal using trim control, then set ASAS to keep heading and then leaving KSP to run for an hour.
