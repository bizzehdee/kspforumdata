Which one are you the proudest of ? Which one took you everywhere ? Which one was simply the best that you ever made, to your eyes ?\n\nWhatever it is, a 5000 ton lifter, a simple probe or even a plane; it doesn\u0027t have to be over-engineered, it can come from the depth of alpha KSP or from the brand new 1.0.x; just share your favorite rocket or plane (or rover, base...) and why you love it.\n\n(I apologise if there\u0027s already a similar thread somewhere in the forums)\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nI\u0027ll start with mine: BlackDog VI\n\n\u003E \n\u003E On the launchpad:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![N7mzVUu.png](http://i.imgur.com/N7mzVUu.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E Under the fairing:\n\u003E \n\u003E ![gUOFanp.png](http://i.imgur.com/gUOFanp.png)\n\u003E \n\u003E \n\nIt is a medium interplanetary rocket coming straight out of 1.0.2 and it has already taken me everywhere, from Moho to Eeloo (and back). It sits 2 Kerbonauts, weighs 735 tons on the launchpad, is completely stock and costs only 276k kredits (I\u0027m quite proud of this: twice cheaper than the previous ones), so it\u0027s not the biggest rocket ever, but is enough to plant a flag pretty much everywhere with no atmosphere (except for Tylo).\n\nIts name comes from the Led Zeppelin song \u0022Black Dog\u0022, and most of my other rockets are named after rock or metal songs.\n\nSo far, it took me to Vall, Moho, Dres, Gilly, Ike and Eeloo and one is on its way to Bop and Pol.\n\nI really like this rocket more than any other for mainly three reasons:\n\n1- I think it looks really good, it could exist in the real world and take off from Earth.\n\n2- My previous class of interplanetary rockets was a pain in the a\\*\\* (not exagerating here) to fly: heavy, took ages to turn around and (really) liked exploding. On the other side, this one is extremely easy to fly around (though it may be because of 1.0 aerodynamics) and will not explode unless you crash in on the ground.\n\n3- It is simple: a booster stage, 2 stages and the payload; no fancy clipping, 1 engine per stage / booster and that\u0027s it.\n\nIt is not my first rocket, not my last, not the most advanced, not the biggest but my favorite by far."},{"CreatedByName":"EtherDragon","CreatedById":82405,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-13T00:28:30Z","Content":"My most glorious craft, thus far, was the Jool Explorer - the crowning achievement of the first \u0022Career Mode\u0022 (now Science Mode).
