Did I lean my lesson? No. I\u0027m just preparing a manned mission for Duna and realised the main orbital hab module (currently being assembled in LKO) has those panels and I\u0027ve already deployed all of them. So they\u0027re gonna get ripped of during the aero-braking (I should have just deployed half now and then the other half after I was safely in orbit). So I\u0027ve had to send up an extra module for it that adds some of the SP type panels, but that\u0027s not going to be as ideal. \n\n(I don\u0027t mind this change, I\u0027m just amused that it\u0027s caught me out a couple times and my brain is refusing to accept it)\n\nSo what changes to things that you where very familiar with are now catching you out?"},{"CreatedByName":"Levelord","CreatedById":57711,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-21T12:07:50Z","Content":"I think that might be a bug because when I took my Kerbals out on EVA and select the panels, the box comes up asking if I would like to retract them.
