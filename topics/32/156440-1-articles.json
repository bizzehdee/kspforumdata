It was so fun! Love it. It feels like a flying simulator. Haha!\u00A0It\u0027s really hard for someone who doesn\u0027t watch and tutorials but its really fun and rewarding when you finally made it. I since my first flight, I have been enjoying flying around Kerbal and conducting experiments. Now I noticed that there is something lacking. Is it possible to put clouds and other weather disturbances such as lightnings, typhoon etc that would make your flight\u00A0more challenging and enjoyable? I haven\u0027t been to other moons or planet yet because I decided I have to master the basics such as re-entry, orbiting and flying first.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Val","CreatedById":126227,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-14T14:50:23Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI use this one:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ciframe data-embedcontent=\u0022\u0022 frameborder=\u00220\u0022 src=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/143288-122-113-stock-visual-enhancements-116-1083/\u0026amp;do=embed\u0022\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"michanst","CreatedById":172931,"CreatedDateTime":"2017-02-14T16:41:55Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI installed but I dont see any clouds but there were changes though.
