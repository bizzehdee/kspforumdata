They pay less, but in most cases you only need to worry about a kerbal or a part, not both.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also completely disable part recoveries in GameData/Squad/Contracts/Contracts.cfg if they are not your cup of tea by setting AllowPartRecovery in the Recovery section to false.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the topic at hand - the gender of spawned crew members is random.
