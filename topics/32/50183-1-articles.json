This results in the tech tree being completed in like 2 missions. However, imagine that your space program has a budget, and that the Kerbals don\u0027t just magically know how to land on the Mun from the get-go. That\u0027s what I\u0027m doing, my first mission was a flight to the upper atmosphere, and then a suborbital mission. Now, I\u0027ve done like 15 missions, yet I\u0027m still only half done.
