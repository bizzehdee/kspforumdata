What you just said makes no sense. Projectile weapons in space can have enormous velocities cause there is no air to slow down acceleration. Space-based rail gun is limited only by material strenght and energy you can provide. Gun on OPS-2 fired just fine and was as deadly as in real life if not more once you consider that heading of a space craft is much easier to predict that the one of airplane (there is no air to help you manuever, so agility of a space ship is limited to the power of it\u0027s RCS, and these are build for precision (docking) not avoiding AA fire).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3.
