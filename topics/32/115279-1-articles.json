Beyond that the usual things like checking the system drivers, and making sure there isn\u0027t background software running interfering with the game. As Red Iron Crown suggested, you could test Prime95 running a single thread and see what happens. And be assured that the performance you are getting is far below what\u0027s normal and expected for that sort of hardware and therefore you can hopefully fix it.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Varsi","CreatedById":120571,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-07T14:33:22Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Majorjim\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Majorjim\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI totally agree here. KSP performance has drastically worsened and Squad remain tight lipped on the issue. This is a major problem that needs fixing.
