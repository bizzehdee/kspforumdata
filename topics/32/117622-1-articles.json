How could this happen- are East-bound flights different for some reason than North-bound?\n\nI wonder if it has something to do with orbital speed versus surface speed? When you fly east your orbital speed is a couple hundred m/s faster than surface speed, because you are going with rotation. Going north this would not be the case...is it possible you were looking at the wrong readout, and thus had a surface speed (and therefore airspeed) that was actually a bit faster than you thought?"},{"CreatedByName":"Hagen von Tronje","CreatedById":148278,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-04T16:12:56Z","Content":"Did you pass over the exact north pole?

It had only been out-bound from KSC for about 10 minutes, and after the explosion the still full-thrust body narrowly missed K2 on its way down. The plane, incidentally, continued accelerating uncontrolled for another 20 minutes, until I found that I could manually turn the engine thrust to zero. It augured in about half-way to the north pole.\n\nI will be running an unmanned test flight tonight with probe-cores attached.
