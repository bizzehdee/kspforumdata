It\u0027s merely a nuclear reactor that heats a working fluid (usually LH2) to great temperature and pressure before expelling it through a rocket nozzle to produce thrust very efficiently. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGiven that\u0027s the case, shouldn\u0027t the LV-N only require liquid fuel? One possible explanation is that the liquid fuel used at KSC is not hydrogen but kerosene, which would explain why it can also be used as jet fuel.* in that case the oxidizer could be the working fluid instead since some NTR engines run off of LO2 or other chemicals but in that case, why require liquid fuel? I\u0027m sure the reason why is game balance and simplicity since this isn\u0027t Orbiter, but still. It strikes me as a weird oversight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E*This doesn\u0027t agree with the numbers however. The Mk.2 fuselage has a total mas of 1.0 tonnes, a dry mass of 0.25t and holds 150 liters of LF. That gives a density of 5kg/L which is hugely more than kerosene\u0027s 0.8 kg/l or LH2\u0027s 0.07 kg/l.
