Since Kerbin\u0027s velocity is the greater, your ship\u0027s velocity will be a proportionally smaller deviation from Kerbin\u0027s motion. That means you will be pretty close to the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, on an ellipse, the shape of which is hard to guess from the picture. (At a second look, I think I was wrong to say that this orbit would be \u0022highly\u0022 elliptical, but it is going to be more elliptical than Kerbin\u0027s circular orbit.) But since the other planets are also more or less on the plane of Kerbin\u0027s orbit, it\u0027s likely that you will, sooner or later, pass close enough to one to be affected. This will, depending on the geometry, either slow you down and drop you to a lower solar orbit, or speed you up and through you to a higher solar orbit. There\u0027s a tiny chance of actually hitting a planet or moon at this time, but the odds are vastly against it. As Tex_NL points out, though, you should just pass through the encounter SOI and not enter orbit unless you brake. However, because there is a little bit of inaccuracy in KSP math, it actually is possible to end up in an orbit without a burn, but only if the geometry works out JUST right. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E But that\u0027s just a minor glitch in the game, and not a matter of orbital physics. But that might not be the end of the story. Depending on just how your ship gets thrown out a first encounter, it might end up having others. NASA sometimes intentionally sends probes on paths that cause them to pass and interact with several planets.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-05-17T22:46:20Z\u0022 title=\u002205/17/2013 10:46  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EMay 17, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Vanamonde\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Rhomphaia","CreatedById":2440,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-17T23:05:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022paleorob\u0022 data-cite=\u0022paleorob\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EUnless you end or being aerocaptured by Eve...but even then it will be a decaying orbit with a periapsis inside the atmosphere.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou could in theory then get a gravity assist from Gilly that raises your periapsis, leaving you in an Eve orbit at least until the next Gilly encounter.
