But I always end up with the Spider Like design. It\u0027s a bit heavy and oddly hard to get into orbit even though I have sent things 10 times the weight and size. Can someone show me some of their great space tug designs and maybe the craft file? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"magnemoe","CreatedById":57801,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T05:15:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDo it simple, 1.25 m probe core with docking port in front. a 720 or 1440 liter fuel tank, two radial mounted 45 to 90 liter tanks as far forward as possible with two LV-N behind. Remember fuel piping, RCS with monoprop tanks, two of the radial 150 liters are nice. Power either solar or an RTG, battery anyway. and 2.5 meter sas module, they are lighter than the 1.25 meter ones. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Eyou might also want to add an docking port in back with the 1440 liter tank. optionaly senior docking port if you prefer them. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EREMEMBER to disable cross-feed in docking port, if not the tug will drain fuel from your lander. Optionaly add an flat structual panel below the port as it don\u0027t do automatic crossfeed. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also use this as first stage then going to Eve or Duna, burn until just outside Minmus orbit, undock and continue the burn with the ship, do an aerobrake with the tug to get it back to LKO.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Heavens","CreatedById":84629,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-08T05:44:59Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWell the \u0022spider design\u0022 makes it easier to land. Depending on what you\u0027re planning to transport you can attach the tanks/engines directly to the main tank instead of using girders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMight need a bit more information on what you want to tug around and also what mods you\u0027re using if any as some mods provide parts that make it easier.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a heavy duty version I use sometimes (I use different parts but it\u0027s basically the same)(30t):\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(click for a larger version on imgur.com)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://imgur.com/sEbhT9s.jpg\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/sEbhT9sl.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022sEbhT9sl.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see it has fuel for around 7m 40s burn in vacuum it has a low TWR though so you might not get things down to Kerbin with it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI mostly use it if I\u0027m not sure about how much fuel I\u0027m actually going to need and am too tired to do some tests or calculations.

You can change the remote guidance for a crew pod and add ladders to get your kerbins inside but the 4 engine design gets kinda tight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou can also reduce the weight by using smaller RCS tanks and drop the SAS but there more or less placeholders to make room to attach things. If you\u0027re good at landing you can also reduce to engines to 3 or 2 but I like having at least 3 as it makes it more stable for me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope I could help \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBtw. feel free to make suggestions to my designs, I usually just throw them together and not really improve them if the work.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-10-08T06:16:01Z\u0022 title=\u002210/08/2013 06:16  AM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 8, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Heavens\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"}]}
