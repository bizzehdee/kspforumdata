The drill only comes to a stop if your ore bunker is 100% totally full. Which is good practice: imagine you brought just enough storage to take exactly the amount a contract requires, and then notice that it won\u0027t fill to the brim?\n\nNow comes the troublesome part: every moment the converter takes a small amount of ore and refines it. The drill senses room in the tank and springs into action. If the amount of ore the drill produces in that single moment is bigger than the free space in your ore bunker, the remainder will be spilled. And the very next moment, the converter takes another small amount and the process repeats itself.\n\nI don\u0027t think it was meant to be that way. In 1.0, the mining rate was supposed to be limited by heat generation. This worked badly, the heat was just too damn much and we had no heat sinks, so in 1.0.1 they introduced the engineer skill instead. I guess someone has blundered, as now the mining rate from asteroids is insanely fast even without engineer: a single unmanned drill can already outpace a converter, and if you bring a three-star scientist, a single drill can easily provide for 17 converters. Running the drill and converter at the same time, you will waste 16 units of ore for every unit you refine.\n\nSince 1.0.3 we have heatsinks; I suspect that in the next version of KSP, heat may be brought back into mining.\n\nNow, the problem won\u0027t go away just because the mining rate is reduced: whenever someone spams enough drills and heatsinks (or whatever) to outpace the refinery, there will be spillage. But a small loss of (say) 2-5% may go unnoticed, while the 94% losses we have right now are pretty hard to ignore.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-03T21:04:17Z\u0022 title=\u002209/03/2015 09:04  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 3, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Laie**"},{"CreatedByName":"Skalou","CreatedById":133496,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-04T00:14:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Um, is it not simpler to just (in your case) divide 325.5 by 15 and multiply by 85?
