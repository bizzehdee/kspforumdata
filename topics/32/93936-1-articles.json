I\u0027m playing Career as well, didn\u0027t get anywhere else than Kerbin and Mun yet, but I have everything researched from the 2nd tier R\u0026amp;D (nuclear engines and all those).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe strange thing: I\u0027ve had a mission end just a few minutes ago, it was a mission to Mun and back, got back with loads of Science, got like 2500 Science from ONE place on the Mun!

I\u0027ve been playing career since 0.22, and aside from the big break form KSP I took for a month or so I\u0027ve been making steady headway. Even with a little over 2.1 million funds right now, its a struggle to make cost-effective spacecraft and can get into orbit, transfer to a moon, land, get back into orbit,m then come back in one piece. I applaud Squad; this update has made career awesome! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Spaps","CreatedById":83083,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T01:20:12Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI have to agree with Thomas988, in prior updates I wouldn\u0027t even touch Career mode, but THIS update brought a fresh feel to this game. you can actually feel like a Space Agency manager, pilot and space pioneer. It\u0027s like a brand new game!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"SmashBrown","CreatedById":102799,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-21T02:06:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree as well. Planes finally have a use for survey missions. It would be great for the surveys to also take us to various points of interest and Easter eggs as well. I have sent my first probe to the mun, rescued a kerbal from orbit, done a tonne of surveys on kerbin, now I\u0027m off to deploy satellites and start sending manned missions to the mun and minmus. Remote tech should really be integrated now, with these new satellite contracts it makes a lot of sense.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhilst your at it squad, fancy integrating infernal robotics and kerbal alarms \u0026amp; engineer as well? Great update.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
