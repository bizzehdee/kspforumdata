I see a potential similarity to one part of SH3-that you can go to first-person on the \u0022top deck\u0022 when not submerged (as you can see, I am an expert in U-boat design(!)). Apollo 15 pioneered a technique were the commander would peek his head out of the docking hatch after landing, to get a \u0022look of the land\u0022 around the landing site. This chance to pick out interesting features in range (15 had the first rover, so they needed to be able to identify were to place the \u0022forward bases\u0022) with the excellent visibility of the top of the lander made their limited time on the surface much more effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI propose the same kind of idea. A Kerbal pokes their head out the docking port (I\u0027m imaging the player clicking on the ladder in the two-person lander-can IVA. Gives the guy not piloting something to do).

Potentially, it would have a \u0022zoom-in\u0022 feature, like binoculars, and you can place \u0022feature of note\u0022 markers on interesting features, like the rim of a crater, or an anomaly.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Synapse","CreatedById":72502,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-12T21:01:16Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah sorry I wasn\u0027t very clear.
