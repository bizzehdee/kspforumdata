For picking a site, trial, error, and blind luck are fairly effective, if tedious. Parachutes are always good as a means of not turning your lander into an explosion. If you can build spaceplanes, one of those is a pretty good bet, due to the oxygen atmosphere and all. Just, whatever you do,\u00A0 remember to make your vehicle aerodynamically stable.
