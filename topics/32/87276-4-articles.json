I think I\u0027ve seen something in the past that this was something they were debating adding. This would also be a good way of controlling the flow of the game, meaning you couldn\u0027t just do a probe round all the planets at low tech and harvest all the science. Discover it with a space telescope first, send probes, then manned flights later.
