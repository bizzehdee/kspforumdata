It is obvious that it is a something\u00A0that entered the sphere of influence of Jool. But what and where was it before the capture? It could be just a simple comet but it\u2019s size says something different. Perhaps it was something from outside the Kerbol system\u2026\u003Cspan\u003E\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0 \u003C/span\u003EIt could be a captured planemo that was pulled by Kerbol.
