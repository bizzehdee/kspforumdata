So much plenty I\u0027m still finding new things to learn in the game after years. If the stock game doesn\u0027t consider any one of the issues related to spacefaring, one or more of the add-ons does, for interested players that gives the opportunity to learn such things in amazing depth. There is no shortage of scientific and technology papers I find and read to improve my knowledge about subjects first considered due to KSP gameplay. Also, many have improved coding and modelling skills so to create those add-ons in KSP.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYes, the game has a steep learning curve. Yes, is very rewarding for those who have an interest in space matters. Yes, is difficult to master (at least when playing career in hard mode, with add-ons that realistically make for the difficulties of spacefaring; or when trying to achieve a challenge; or building the perfect replica of some spacecraft; or planning a mission with detail and accuracy like NASA does; and many other ways to play KSP); but still can be played casually with ease (e.g. doing aerobatics with a plane) while remaining fun. Unlike most games, there is no set limit, no end, no mandatory storyline to follow: each player is free to use the game for what he likes most. I know some who never left Kerbin (the home planet) for other worlds (quite the contrary of what a space game should be) but still have so much fun on the planet they see no need to move out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-12-19T11:53:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222891948\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022153662\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221482041988\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022172646\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Huwanna\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 18.12.2016 at 7:19 AM, Huwanna said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHello,\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI was thinking about getting the game but before I do so I have a few questions:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1.
