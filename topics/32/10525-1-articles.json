The brilliant solution was spamming a row of landing legs on the RSC-tank, improving the strength of the improvised Munar Rover dramatically. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe last test was an enormous succes; despite terrible piloting the Rover survived for almost 2 minutes ... !\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis design has some drawbacks:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Capsule is now weak point \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Very hard to control\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Kerbals cannot return to Kerbin\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E-Still prone to destruction\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i45.tinypic.com/1ny1ib.jpg\u0022 alt=\u00221ny1ib.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GoodGuy","CreatedById":17980,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T01:01:57Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHow does it work, exactly? does the landing legs propel it?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Anachronda","CreatedById":23187,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-13T03:34:46Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI suspect he uses the RCS to roll it along.
