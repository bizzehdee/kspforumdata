Salizar Thorin review the notes before him, then shifted his attention to the public news release. The date stamp marked it as being only two days old, which elicited a frown over his thick jawline. Bushy eyebrows lifted as he looked up to the only other person in his well furnished office, tucked off to the side of the Yaren Republican Space Administration\u0027s Urganaught Tracking Station. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You know this means we have to do better, right?\u0022 Salizar grumbled to his guest. \u0022We cannot allow the KSP to actually establish a foothold in space.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe other occupant, Fleet Admiral Jonas Freewhaler, simply shrugged. \u0022The King will demand we respond in kind, of course,\u0022 the senior naval officer in the YRN said flatly. \u0022But I\u0027m told you and your people have a new program getting ready to kick off. One that will not only outdo the KSP but take several strides pas their recent accomplishments.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESalizar frowned again. How the YRN kept finding out what he was up was beyond him, and it certainly didn\u0027t make him think any less of the growing sentiment that the military wasn\u0027t far away from taking over the space exploration program. Which was, of course, at least half the reason for his present melancholy. If the KSP continued to make their achievements as fast as the last few had been, they\u0027d be in a wonderful position from which to assault the Republic, perhaps even finally finish them off in order to gain total control of the planet. That thought wasn\u0027t very pleasant, either, Salizar admitted to himself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Project Alarim will begin tomorrow. Project Director Kolbin assures me that this time the rocket will stay aloft and we\u0027ll finally achieve a stable or it.\u0022 Salizar kept his personal thoughts on the project to himself, though. It was a wonder no one had been killed yet, what with all the recent disasters and exploding rockets - not to mention the wasted millions of marks sunk into the YRSA coffers. \u0022Pilot Jebdah has personally reviewed the recent tests of the Mk 9 OLR and he has expressed his own confidence in Kolbin\u0027s team\u0027s work. No doubt he just wants to fly again, most likely, but whatever his motivations, they\u0027ve gotten the go ahead from the Director of Science and Education. And once Sallace blesses off on something in MY administration, I can\u0027t refute her.\u0022 His frown thickened into a full on glare at that notion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJonas sighed in a manner not quite befitting the senior naval official that he was. \u0022You have a point on that one, ill grant you that. Director Whimball can be quite... ornery, shall we say?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESalizar slumped back Into his chair and regarded the admiral on the other side of his desk. \u0022At any rate, Pilot Jebdah will fly tomorrow afternoon. I suppose we\u0027ll just have to wait and see, won\u0027t we?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFleet Admiral Jonas Freewhaler nodded grimly. \u0022Indeed.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
