I know that term has a negative connotation, but I enjoy how my obsession with KSP has evolved over the years and versions. I had made up my mind to play .90 \u0022vanilla stock\u0022 until release, but I found that my playstyle had changed to the point where stock play was just not fun. After discovering this, I thought it might induce a chuckle or three if I wrote down a few observations I\u0027ve made. Think of this as a companion to the famous \u0022You know you play too much KSP when\u0022\u00A6\u0022 thought flow.
