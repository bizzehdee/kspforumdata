But quite like building a wall, that stuff only provides the building blocks. Especially since KSP isn\u0027t some more-or-less generic FPS where there are hundred out there (some even with source code available) from which you learn, recombine stuff and maybe add one or two innovations of your own and pretty much know what to expect. KSP is something really unique, so they have to expect parts not working out as thought when they throw the blocks together (similar to how the (honest) schedule of a building gets more and more vague the less normal it is). Also, I think you either misunderstood or dislike Squads general development approach (as I understand it, in turn). I don\u0027t think they got together, made the specifications for the final release, and then started working towards that. It seems like a more flexible approach, where they have a general direction, but no set specifications. Instead, they will continue to develop, regularly shipping new updates, until they one day declare KSP to be finished. The benefit here is that they can react to the loads of feedback from us players much more flexible then if they did a full specification at the start (which would be required to give any reasonable approximation of a release schedule). It\u0027s a different development cycle: instead of specify everything-\u0026gt;develop-\u0026gt;test-\u0026gt;release it\u0027s specify the next bits-\u0026gt;develop-\u0026gt;test-\u0026gt;early access-\u0026gt;repeat.
