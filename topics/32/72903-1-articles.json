Originally adapted from a diving suit, they were issued to the first kerbonauts. Once the program accelerated and other pilots were brought in, the original crew talked management into providing them with orange versions to indicate seniority. The white suites are standard issue spacesuits used by all other kerbonauts. The blue jumpsuit is the standard issue suit used during training, ground tests, and other non-flight related activities. Of course, only the trainees are seen wearing them in the kerbonaut portraits, as any flight-ready crewmembers have their official portraits done in flight gear.

Straight from the NASA site: \u0022Astronauts use white spacesuits when they go on spacewalks to do work outside the space shuttle or International Space Station. White was chosen for a few reasons. One of the most important reasons is that white reflects heat so that the astronaut doesn\u0027t get too warm. Astronauts can get too cold as well, but that is usually in their hands. Therefore, the spacesuits have heaters in their gloves.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother reason spacewalkers use white spacesuits is that white is visible against the black background of space, so other astronauts can easily see the spacewalker. In addition, since spacewalking astronauts always go out in pairs, one of the suits always has red stripes in four places so the other astronauts can tell one spacewalker from the other.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/eva/white.html\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/eva/white.html\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Tripzter","CreatedById":75335,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T01:00:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ECurious, why not make the gloves/boots black?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"razark","CreatedById":32993,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-21T01:07:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Tripzter\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Tripzter\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ECurious, why not make the gloves/boots black?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause it\u0027s easier to add heat than remove it, maybe?
