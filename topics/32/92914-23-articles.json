And perhaps a better explanation of how things work.

Same goes for some of the satellite vs manned pods stuff that has been brought up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECost of buildings/upgraded buildings. While early on I did find it to be a problem getting the money to upgrade the buildings, it did force me to take contracts I normally would have no interest in (i.e. surveying Kerbin with a plane, or launching satellites). And also to think outside the box on how to get the Mun in 30 parts or less, which I don\u0027t think is necessarily a bad thing. Also I don\u0027t think for the first level the maneuver planner is necessary as getting to the Mun and Minimus isn\u0027t that hard without it and it actually forces the player to understand the basics orbital mechanics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce I got the Mun, the game became much easier as I had money for upgrades and started to get good paying contracts to go do surveys etc. I made 500,000 Kbucks in one mission along with a few hundred science to do a munar survey, which enabled me to finally upgrade my science building. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt the mid-point of the game I don\u0027t feel like the contracts or money paid per contract is too bad, you have to fly a few mission to upgrade each building and while that may seem \u0022grindy\u0022 I think there is enough variety in the mission system to make it tolerable, and at the mid levels you have most of the basic game functionality. And the contracts do provide a interesting balance between getting money and doing the science to move through the tech tree.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith regard to the kerbal experience system, I think this could be done better, the pilot progression I think is generally good, but I feel like the scientists and engineers are too underdeveloped skill wise. Maybe make a scientist required to use some of the more advanced instrumentation to collect science, and I\u0027m not sure how to make the engineers better. One weird thing is that if I kill a kerbal they are listed as MIA, and I have to delete them from that part of the roster before I hire any new kerbals, could there be a list of dead kerbals kept somewhere, a memorial wall or something? \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlso, I would really like to see some sort of off-world fuel/supply system though as alluded to.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ArmchairGravy","CreatedById":78526,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T20:36:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIs it possible to do the place satellite missions in a specific orbit without KER?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frank327","CreatedById":115926,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-12-17T22:14:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022ArmchairGravy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022ArmchairGravy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIs it possible to do the place satellite missions in a specific orbit without KER?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003EWhat I do is just fix it visually.

Make sure you look at the orbits from all different directions and don\u0027t try and don\u0027t be afraid to make corrections all the time. You\u0027re in orbit anyways so you\u0027re only limited by fuel. Using the normal/antinormal markers (cyan coloured) to line up the apoapsis and the periapsis is very important. Once those are lined up, just look at the distance of ap/pe and you can get them really accurate. Also try and get the phase angle of the orbit right the first time.
