I\u0027m sure it\u0027s possible to fly close enough to drop one of those off and have it roll off the inertia, but since mun isn\u0027t flat, the rover would probably flip over from the speed bumps or turn a crater into a ramp that launches it, or just crash and burn on impact due to the speed (maybe small rockets attached to the front and facing the opposite direction it will be moving might slow it down). I guess you could also just land on mun with rover-ish shaped parts attached to a decoupler directly below the cockpit and an engine, then take off. but the biggest issue with that would be fuel and descent speed due to the extra weight.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"whyterabbit1987","CreatedById":25543,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-04T04:49:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOr an interplannetary space plane design capable of taking off from Kerbin traversing space and re-entering a second planets atmosphere to glide down.
