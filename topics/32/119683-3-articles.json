Another \u0027Starflight\u0027 feature was the ability to fill your cargo hold with precious metals and ores, and bring them back for money. The ISRU systems out there seem to tackle this mainly as part of a method of refueling ships and making parts. Would like to be able to harvest industrial crystals, rare-earth metals, precious metals and gems, and interesting minerals, and to be able to put examples of these in a \u0027natural history museum\u0027 trophy-case at the KSC. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E* Space-race competition.
