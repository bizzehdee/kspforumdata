Sure, Kerbals can be asexual or genderless, that\u0027s fine, but then it shouldn\u0027t matter if you throw in a few female names too and apply them to the regular \u0022male\u0022 looking kerbals. After all they have no gender or sex, so why would it matter? It would also just be as simple as adding a few names to the generation list (maybe a few rules too, I suppose), so I doubt it would take a significant amount of time away from working on the bigger aspects of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"leax256","CreatedById":57364,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-24T14:09:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Oggula\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Oggula\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAsexual, a-racial.
