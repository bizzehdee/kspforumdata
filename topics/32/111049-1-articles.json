While they did move it to the Kerbal instead of the part, leveling your Kerbal only grants you automatic repositioning (you can have him hold prograde, retrograde, normal, anit-normal, radial, anti-radial, and even at high levels right at your maneuver), it doesn\u0027t grant you more torque. Torque was also reduced on the command modules in order to keep the SAS modules still useful. So if you have a larger craft, you may need to add an SAS module for that extra turning ability.\n\nTorque and SAS were completely eliminated from many of the probes, which my belief is that they intended the change to include more diversity amongst them. However, my experience has been to pretend like those probe cores don\u0027t exist so it has effectively done the opposite and all I ever use in the early tech tree is the OKTO. I\u0027ve even gone as far as to simply delete the OKTO2, QBE, and Stayputnik so I can fit more mod parts and stop getting contracts that I will never do, without at least a reaction wheel that is just how useless they are in my opinion.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-27T20:26:34Z\u0022 title=\u002205/27/2015 08:26  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"DancesWithSquirrels","CreatedById":138267,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T20:37:16Z","Content":"Even without SAS the early cores are at least a little useful - I\u0027ve successfully used the Stayputnik to get some altitude records, especially with slightly canted fins to put some spin on my rockets.\n\nI only tried one Mun landing with it, though - and that wasn\u0027t successful."},{"CreatedByName":"clivman","CreatedById":139191,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T21:18:10Z","Content":"I always just end up using mechjeb sas because it works so well, especially in 1.0 aero"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-27T21:24:01Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Even without SAS the early cores are at least a little useful - I\u0027ve successfully used the Stayputnik to get some altitude records, especially with slightly canted fins to put some spin on my rockets.\n\u003E I only tried one Mun landing with it, though - and that wasn\u0027t successful.\n\nWell if you have alternate means of turning (RCS, Fins, Gimbal, or Reaction Wheel module) then it can work but that doesn\u0027t make them worthwhile or all that useful when you have the OKTO. But there is a difference between SAS and Reaction Wheel/Torque. You can\u0027t re-orient a Stayputnik satellite in space by itself without one of the above items, you can\u0027t even point it at prograde to circularize. With the OKTO you can. So why would you ever use the Stayputnik?\n\nAnyway, a bit off topic, but I think the OP intended to include Reaction Wheels AND SAS in the conversation. A lot of people confuse the two.

Oh how I miss that mode of it just stopping rotation, but doing nothing else.\n\nIts really annoying that as I try to do small control inputs, the SAS simply counteracts them as soon as I release the key.... yet if I hold the key down a little longer, it will reset the heading that it tries to hold.\n\nI\u0027ve also noticed that the normal SAS hold seems to smoothly apply forces... and to slow down the rotation as it approaches the desired heading.\n\nHowever, the prograde/radial/normal holds will apply full force when not pointed in the right direction, and will hold that force basically continuously... not slowing the rotation down as it nears the correct heading... resulting in large oscillations around the desired heading, that you have to manually dampen"},{"CreatedByName":"waterlubber","CreatedById":119333,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T00:31:09Z","Content":"We need stock PID tuning"},{"CreatedByName":"The Lone Wolfling","CreatedById":13675,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T20:31:36Z","Content":"Well, for that to apply we first need it to actually be a PID controller.
