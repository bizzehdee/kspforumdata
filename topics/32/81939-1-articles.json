The main thing, I think, is that it wont\u0027 actually be a new building per say, but a revamp of an old one. Specifically, the Astronaut Complex. As to what it will do, I\u0027m leaning towards Kerbals getting a revamp as well as providing the mechanic of interchanging funds, science, and rep, perhaps with other additions to complement contracts and career mode in general. My reasoning is that because the function of a real spaceport administration facility that would actually make sense to see in the game has everything to do with the astronauts, and everything to do with the running the spaceport. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe know that interchanging F/S/R is coming eventually. We also know that reputation, as it exists in the game right now, is provided by safely returning Kerbals and has little to no function.

What functionality needs to be added to get the game into a \u0022feature complete\u0022 state? What new features are eagerly awaited by players? What new features require a new building?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt seems obvious that the Astronaut facility will eventually do more than it does now. We know that it will eventually cost money to train astronauts. We don\u0027t need a separate building to do this.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me add my own speculation here. Training implies levelling up and learning new skills. This could make it worthwhile to send newbie astronauts on missions to level up their skills. Do astronauts get paid a salary? Does the game punish us with high upkeep costs for recruiting too many kerbals too soon? The current rescue a stranded kerbal from orbit contract implies that gaining an extra kerbal is a reward, not a burden.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext, let\u0027s look at research. This is a very interesting area. Lots of strategy games present players with the dilemma of expending resources in the short term to gain long term benefits from research. What if my science department has a budget? Perhaps the admin building allows players to buy upgrades that improve their science output? We hear over and over again that the tech tree is too easy, that players can open up the entire tech tree in a few launches. What if the current tech tree is only a placeholder? What if the devs intend it to me vastly more difficult in 1.0? What if research became extremely slow and massively expensive without upgrades from the admin building? It might be cheaper to send ambitious low tech missions than to pay the high prices needed to unlock late tech tree parts such as the LV-N and the RAPIER.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext speculation. This is the big one. This is the game changer I don\u0027t think anybody gave proper consideration to until now...reusability...SHOCK!!!...\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWait, haven\u0027t we all been dealing with reusability since 0.24?! Haven\u0027t we all been figuring out clever ways to justify the cost of air breathing SSTOs versus expendable launch vehicles?!...Actually no, we haven\u0027t. The current 100% recovery value of rocket parts that are returned to the KSC is nonsense. The reason why this is nonsense is because of processing costs.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot convinced? Let\u0027s build a Space Shuttle analogue. I sell the enormous development costs of my Space Shuttle program to the Kerbin Government on the basis that contemporary launch vehicles are too expensive and I can do the same job cheaper on a re-useable vehicle. The only drawbacks are that my re-useable vehicles will incur massive weight penalties from the enormous dry mass of the orbiter, meaning that although I\u0027ve technically built a heavy lift booster, almost all of my lifting power is being used to lift the dry mass of my orbiter (wings, landing gear, thermal protection).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot to worry, I\u0027ll recover my orbiter and get 100% recovery value after each flight. Ooops! No I won\u0027t!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow much processing time was required for each shuttle orbiter between launches? How much did it cost to pay the workers involved? How much did it cost to build a contemporary expendable launch vehicle and pay for it to be ready for launch without worrying about re-usability? In case you didn\u0027t know, the Space Shuttle was supposed to be cheaper than the expendable rockets it replaced. The end result was the exact opposite. It cost a lot more to pay a huge workforce to re-use the Shuttle than it would have cost to build a new vehicle for each launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet me guess, you\u0027re not convinced yet? What if I speculate that the Admin Building is where budgets are balanced and wages are set. What if the recovery value of spacecraft and yield from returned science depends on how much resources were expended? What if the return value from my SSTO depends on the salary for my ground crew? Low launch rates might make it cheaper to expend rockets rather than re-use them.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"biohazard15","CreatedById":91655,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-17T20:26:05Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think it may have something with contracts assignment, just like in Take On Mars.
