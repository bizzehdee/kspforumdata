Try an uncrewed probe for Eve, and crewed or uncrewed trips to Duna, Ike, and Gilly.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nGilly is a particularly interesting object, as it has so low gravity, that you can go to all three biomes nearly without using fuel. It might be difficult to get an encounter with it, as it has very low gravity, but it\u0027s definitely doable also for a beginner - just go to Eve orbit that approximately matches the one of Gilly, and do a normal rendezvous with it, just as if you wanted to rescue a stranded Kerbal from high Kerbin orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nDuna is very similar to the M\u00FCn, but has slightly higher gravitational pull. You can in principle land there using parachutes, but I\u0027d use a mod to verify that they are going to work - RealChute is quite handy. Or, you can just land like on the M\u00FCn - powered. Having an aerodynamically stable lander is a plus, but above 5 km the atmosphere of Duna should be thin enough to allow free orientation of your craft with respect to the airstream. That\u0027s why for a powered landing I\u0027d try to kill most velocity already above 5 km, and then go down nearly vertically, but that\u0027s just a rule of thumb.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAh, and don\u0027t get frightened by people claiming you\u0027d need immense amounts of solar panels to go to Duna or Ike. The efficiency goes down to about 40% (Gau\u00DF\u0027 law - (Kerbin-Orbit/Duna-Orbit)^2=(1.3e10/2e10)^2=0.4), what\u0027s far from an issue for regular probes or ships.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor transfer Windows there is the excellent Transfer Window Planner mod, that\u0027ll allow you to calculate how much dV you\u0027re going to need as a function of both, departure time, and transfer duration. By graphically representing this information as a so called porkchop-plot, you can easily choose optimal transfer conditions. The mod takes into account planetary inclination, and orbital eccentricity, so you can even plan ahead for several years to find sweet spots, what\u0027s especially relevant when going to Moho or transferring between the moons of Jool. Furthermore, its calculations include Oberth Effect.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnother mod that gives you information on transfer windows is Kerbal Alarm Clock, but in that case the information is limited to the date around which conditions are best.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can of course also calculate the transfer windows by hand, as all you need to know is the angle that your target planet is going to travel while your ship is on the way. So, first you\u0027ll need to calculate how long the transfer will take. Approximating the planetary orbits as circles makes this pretty easy, as your transfer orbit will be half of an ellipse that has a semi-major axis that\u0027s just the average of the semi-major axes of both planets. Then, following Kepler\u0027s third law (the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis) you can calculate the time. By either calculating or looking up the angular velocity of your target planet, you\u0027ll immediately get the angle it will cover during this time, which will allow you to estimate already by looking at the map view, when it\u0027ll be best to launch.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso it pays off to rely on Oberth Effect, which directly comes from the quadratic velocity dependence of kinetic energy. It\u0027s actually pretty straightforward to understand, and I\u0027ve once written a nice short \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/115238-transfer-delta-v/\u0026amp;do=findComment\u0026amp;comment=2048403\u0022\u003Eguide\u003C/a\u003E on how it works (I\u0027d just self-quote, but I don\u0027t know how to do this properly with the new forum software...).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"goon46","CreatedById":157192,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-18T20:48:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThanks everyone for the amazing responses.
