From the chief engineer to whichever one of you will take the same role: Jesus that was a long time. 4 ditched craft... let me tell you. I don\u0027t really know of any other things to say... so, I guess I\u0027m done.\u0022\n\nJared: \u0022From one pilot to another, six words: Prepare to be here for hours. That\u0027ll be all.\u0022\n\nTyler: \u0022Guess who had to do the docking and testing? Whoever goes after me, word of advice: Never use docking mode. It will destroy you.\u0022\n\nMariyate: (I had to cover for everyone when they were going out eating. I\u0027m still not sure how to play the game efficiently; haven\u0027t explored all the data, but I can do well enough as a co-pilot. Whoever might be a co-pilot, I can\u0027t really offer any advice, but I can say that it is fun. I guess that\u0027s all?)\n\nWell, they all enjoyed it.

However I agree with Echo there. \n\nMy problem is that I am currently working on putting ~1500 tons into low pol orbit in many many seperate missions and even designing the mission for that is taking all my time atm. Also one reason I am not as enthusiastic with this as I probably should be is that it\u0027s stock (don\u0027t get me wrong I get why it has to be this way) and I am a mod fanatic. I feel like I am just missing so many parts when playing without all of the mods I use like KW Rocketry, B9 and B9 P-Wings, KSPI-E, Kethane, MKS and OKS etc. etc. etc.\n\nI guess my imagination is not good enough but I often feel like it is a little pointless to build stations and bases in stock since there is no life support and no way to make anything self sustaining.\n\nI like going big, like ridiculously oversized 1200 ton Stations and in stock that just seems pointless ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"Yukon0009","CreatedById":109376,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:22:27Z","Content":"So this is dead?"},{"CreatedByName":"TheXRuler","CreatedById":125517,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-03T09:34:50Z","Content":"I don\u0027t think so.
