After experimenting with RasterpropMonitor and a bunch of other mods that make going all IVA truly feasible (including Lazer Mod which gives first person EVA. Still has a third person transition between IVA and EVA, but I can deal with that as a limitation of the game) I\u0027ve decided to dedicate an entire save to doing nothing but that. All IVA (or more accurately, first person) missions, all the time. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENaturally I\u0027d have to use third person for testing purposes past Apollo level (I already have a set of crafts I can rebuild in my sleep that will accomplish everything up to Apollo rather easily) as well as for probes and such but beyond that I certainly think I could do it, and it would probably be the most immersive experience ever frankly. I already have experience going first person from flight simulators (particularly combat flight sims, so how I\u0027ll be able to react to problems whilst in IVA will be interesting) so, much like the real astronauts, I\u0027ll have at least some idea of what I\u0027m doing going in. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now I\u0027m getting a save started and my first rocket launch will be completed shortly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut, before I really get into it, anyone have some mission ideas or even mod suggestions (i\u0027ve got almost all the major ones already.
