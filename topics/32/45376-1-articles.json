Even just switching from the Game Start menu to the space center can take a good \u003Cstrong\u003E8 - 10 seconds\u003C/strong\u003E sometimes. Is this normal, or should I be worried?

Random read speeds are what generally affect loading times, such as windows bootup, game loading, application startup and other things like that.
