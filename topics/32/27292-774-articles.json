While descending for the landing I made a slight whoopsie that left one of the four engines with slightly less fuel than the others. The \u0022slightly\u0022 is literal. Maybe a full \u0022unit\u0022 of fuel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWasn\u0027t a problem, the excellent piloting of Isaalla was able to cope and I landed safely. She did Science, got out, retrieved Science, planted flag and prepared to go home. While ascending I realized I would not have enough fuel to return home. I decided to land in case it wasn\u0027t enough fuel to orbit safely. This turned out to be a good idea as it, in fact, wasn\u0027t enough fuel. The engineers and mathematicians (this agency employs no actual mathematicians, instead opting for the Trial and Error methodology) are still being berated for this failure of a design.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile descending, Isaalla realized that she would run out of fuel before she returned to the Munar surface and would need to bail out and RCS her way down safely the rest of the way. She prepared to do so as her fuel gauge dropped, but as her craft burned the last of the fuel it was suddenly sent into a rapid flip, end over end. One engine had run out of fuel first since some had been accidentally used before. Still falling towards the Mun, Isaalla kept her head, righted the craft, and climbed out. Daringly she grabbed the Science from the capsule before leaping clear and propelling herself away from the Munar surface as much as she could as she rapidly descended. Her ship exploded below her as she descended. She hit the ground hard and bounced back, high over the surface. Regaining her bearings, she took her RCS controls back and safely guided herself back down as secondary explosions went off from her doomed lander. She touched down safely and chased after the only remaining piece she could see, still bouncing away. It ended up 400m away in the end. She used a scant amount of precious RCS fuel to reach it and found it was only a landing leg and no use to her in her predicament. Unable to contact KSC or do anything more to save herself, she waits for a rescue.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUpdate: Isaalla is saved!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy first rescue craft lacked solar panels. I built in haste. It is currently drifting around in an elliptical orbit thanks to its flyby of the Mun. No idea how long it will take it to crash. While the craft was en route I had Isaalla climb out of the crater to gain higher elevation. Every little bit helps.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy second one safely made it, but by the time I had gotten a second rescue craft to reach the Mun Isaalla\u0027s position had been engulfed in darkness. I hadn\u0027t thought to put lights on it because, again, I built in haste. I used Isaalla\u0027s targeting marker as a rough indication of elevation change (I had to estimate because I landed a kilometer away from her). The landing went safely and Isaalla EVA\u0027d her way over to the craft. We can\u0027t see her face in this picture, but I imagine her smile was massive.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/395547605766026368/C4B5CD72372C4CA11B896C4004A9B58E159D7E10/\u0022 alt=\u0022C4B5CD72372C4CA11B896C4004A9B58E159D7E10\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return was relatively uneventful.

Went smooothly. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst I messed my transfer from Kerbin, but got enough fuel to get my mothership in high-elliptic Tylo orbit. I sent initially some tankers so no worries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGot my Tylo lander with a tug in a 30km circular orbit bit after. Crew transferred in smaller lander as the mother ship is a bit low on fuel and the small lander is able to refill at Tylo-tug. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen to the business...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst attempt from 30km orbit went kaboom. One continuous burn aiming retrograde beginning from 30x30km didn\u0027t do. The lander had plenty of fuel and speed left on ground impact. So not enough TWR I guess. Lander descent stage is on single aerospike, some drop tanks. Separate ascent stage with single terrier and more drop tanks. Alcor pod on top with the usual crew. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChanged plans and managed to land by aiming thrust below retrograde to gain more time to burn through all the fuel. That did it after some tries.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb planted a flag. The he was not able to climb the ladders to the top of a tank, even though I had tested that on the pad. Then I figured out to raise one landing leg and tilt the craft and Jeb got back to pod. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt ascent, I then realized just after take-off that my ascent stage was drained. Probaply the tug eptied it through a docking port. So nothing more to comment on that ascent. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo reloaded a save, refilled the lander, and eventually managed to land again. Planted \u0022second\u0022 flag. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I did the trick with the landing leg and got ready to take off. Landing had cutted my fuel margins thin. I had to stage almost immediately after take off and switch to single terrier ascent engine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I ran out of fuel later. Fired monoprop. Bailed out Bill and Bop with jetpacks to safe orbit. Jeb didn\u0027t have enough time to jetpack to orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI decided that the ascent was not so optimal and there was possibility to success. So I reloaded a save. This had nothing to do with the fact that I hadn\u0027t refilled ALL ascent stage tanks. So refilled two Oscar tanks also. I guess that I lose some delta-v on ascent as I can\u0027t aim the prograde when it\u0027s near horizontal like on Mun ascents. I have to aim higher to gain altitude. Not enough TWR here also.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen I did a new descent, with just slightly better piloting and all full tanks to begin with. Planted \u0022third\u0022 flag. This time no landing leg trickery as I was on nice slope. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAdjusted staging to get rid off landing legs and empty tanks right at take off. Had to switch to terrier again too soon. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAimed for hopefully better trajectory, fired monoprop almost immediately to get rid of weight and optimize delta-v. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAgain ran out of fuel. Bill was ready to bail out. Then Bob right after. Also Jeb managed to get out in time to jetpack for orbit. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow all three crew members are orbiting in suits in safe altitude. I plan to pick the guys with the small lander and then proceed with the mission as usual.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow thinking it I should have used the tug for the initial descent. It at least has some tiny amount of fuel left. Also firing the monoprop right at the beginning of the descent instead on ascent might have gained something. Anyway, the flag is planted and crew is in safe orbit, so I call my first Tylo crewed landing a success. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENext on schedule is testing out my first Laythe plane, arriving in few days. I expect nothing to go wrong with that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"algwat","CreatedById":137609,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T10:50:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ERunning MUN tests for the ASTAR Mining Company....with a relocatable mining base..testing lander docking functions, some pilot errors..8) My other mobile miner was a brick could not make it fly... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I-nJdiGC8Do/ViDUZbD7peI/AAAAAAAABXQ/JUDKjZrG_OE/s1600/screenshot85.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot85.png\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FRyIpmCHai0/ViDUZRIAiRI/AAAAAAAABXU/oXVx74R_MLQ/s1600/screenshot89.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot89.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"capi3101","CreatedById":59027,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-10-16T12:38:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ELast night began with the Mun Sojourner\u0027s resource scan.
