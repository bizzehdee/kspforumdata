My first two attempts to land on the Mun had to be restarted from the beginning since I crashed the lander into the surface. No reloading before I make the final approach, time to head back to the launchpad at KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince then I\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2ve discovered the quicksave function, but now I think I rely on it too much. I used it a few times with my first manned landing on Duna for example. On one hand it\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2s nice that I don\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t have to restart that long voyage from scratch, but I also feel that reloading is almost \u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C5\u201Ccheating\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2 and the feeling of accomplishment when I finally do land isn\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00E2\u201E\u00A2t as strong.
