I had some success with easy .craft I proced as follow, change or add the LINK = with the part in attN or surfN ( top or bottom towards wich direction climb the tree ), but when the tree split in two or more it\u0027s a pain because you might end in the wrong subtree not leading to the root part\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI know this might sound a bit crazy \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E , but there are many cases in wich the ingame function to change the root part just does not work as needed\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAny hints?
