That\u0027s why it is a bit slow and... well, more boring. But fascinating just the same. The equipment you can attach are real-life instruments used on the current Mars rovers, and the landscape you are exploring is real-world places - not fictional or procedurally generated. Try to Google the craters. It requires a lot of patience to go anywhere, and you don\u0027t just race across the surface with RCS thrusters (or rockets for that matter). If anything, I think KSP is the most \u0022arcady\u0022 in comparison. But also the most fun.
