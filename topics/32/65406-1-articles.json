I tried searching for threads on it and I\u0027m not even sure this is posted in the right place. All that said, here\u0027s the rub.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHas anyone else came upon a mod on the SpacePort that had a \u0022BUY\u0022 button instead of \u0022Download?\u0022 I just came across one and was a little disturbed by it. I enjoy playing with mods. I don\u0027t use a tremendous amount, but some just fix things that need fixed and I am grateful for the modders that have the capability to do that. The part that worries me is the potential for Squad to suddenly start releasing purchasable DLC content. Some companies do DLC alright, others make it a requirement to buy certain \u0022updates\u0022 to even make the base game fixed enough to enjoy. I worry Squad may begin to start charging people to download mods. Or worse yet, institute some type of Squad-only coin like current mmo games are doing for the \u0022extra\u0022 content.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf it is just for mod devs to be able to make money on their mods, that\u0027s great. Any thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"malkuth","CreatedById":57414,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-10T23:57:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIts been discussed.. It happens sometimes.

If I remember correctly, Squad is planning paid DLC in the form of expansion packs or something. People who bought the game before a certain date would get these for free. Those who bought the game after that date would have to pay for it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats not to say that there wont be free stuff, just that some of the goodies might need to be paid for.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm almost certain that all updates up to the 1.0 release will be free to those who buy the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI cant find any sources but if I\u0027m wrong, feel free to correct me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-03-11T01:14:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHighlad, that has nothing to do with this. At all. The software Spaceport uses was original intended to allow purchasing, but KSP doesn\u0027t use that aspect of it.
