Personally, I like to play an immersive game - I don\u0027t lauch crafts full of unneeded parts just for testing purposes, and I mostly try to accept contracts that make sense for the game I\u0027m playing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo here I\u0027m asking: are you doing the same? Do you choose the right contracts to make your career game feel alive, or you play for the challenge? Do you accept everything that Mission Control offers you, or do you skip contracts until you get the one you\u0027re looking for?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd do you use any special strategies to twist the contract goals to your purposes? Let me give a few examples:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#FF0000;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESatellite Contracts:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E So you got a contract to put a sat in orbit around the Mun. A good idea is to put a thermometer or another reusable scientific instrument on board, so that sat can be used to do the \u0022get science from space\u0022 contracts. But sats usefulness don\u0027t stop there. If your sat has an engine and fuel, you can actually move it from its orbit after completing the original contract. This means it can be used to complete a few \u0022survey\u0022 contracts (those that require you to get a reading while flying above a certain altitude). Put the sat in a polar orbit, pick the right contracts and you can keep using it forever (though that strategy isn\u0027t very good for planets with atmosphere). And if your sat has an engine, you might even use it to do a \u0022test part in orbit\u0022 contract!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#0000FF;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESpace Station Contracts:\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/span\u003E Stations may seem useless to the untrained eye, but they\u0027re actually pretty handy to have around. Visual survey missions require a ship capable of landing or at least doing some pretty drastic plane changes. Leaving this lander in orbit of the targed planet/moon and refueling it can be more efficient (or at least cheaper) than sending a new lander for each survey mission. Also, if your station has a lab, it can be used to reset the materials bay and goo cannister, so you can have these instruments in your lander and use them for each new biome visited. \u0022So one station\u0027s good\u0022, you might say, \u0022but what\u0027s the point of accepting multiple station contracts for the same celestial body? I don\u0027t need more than one station!\u0022 You might be right, but keep in mind that you can dock the new station with the old (as long as you already fulfilled the contract requirements), so the new contracts can be treated as expansion contracts for an old station. It\u0027s kind of cool to have a huge station capable of housing over 30 kerbals around Minmus, trust me.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022color:#008000;\u0022\u003ESurvey Contracts:\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E The cool thing about survey contracts is that they can be done multiple ways. A simple and economic one is by using robot rovers. As long as they aren\u0027t visual surveys, a rover can do multiple survey contracts in a planet - but you should be careful to accept contracts to sites that are near the rover\u0027s position, or you\u0027ll have to drive for hours. For moons with low gravity, such as Minmus, a small ion-propelled probe can be even more effective, since it can have enough delta-v to perform dozens of surveys.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what do you say?
