It started out a while back, before sicence came so proberly around ,20 i think, were i had just launched a rocket... nothing more, that\u0027s it.. just Done, Complete, Game Over. Then science came and for a day or two i thought, \u0022Yes! finally something to do\u0022 but i would learn that it wasn\u0027t what i wanted it to be quit quickly, actually it made it all worse. So now that money and contracts are comming i\u0027m really hopeing it won\u0027t just be another flop like last time. right now i haven\u0027t gone to all the planets and don\u0027t want to, can\u0027t see the fun in it anymore, don\u0027t even go to Duna any longer. all i do is to drop the game for two weeks, make a new save, play a little, drop the game, make a new save etc. ect. so i hope that getting a goal and a prize for going places and some money to look after will help, but we\u0027ll see.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHope you got through that wall of bad grammar and... ok i\u0027ll stop talking now. hope i\u0027m the only one that think this, hate when a this good game gets boring.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Xacktar","CreatedById":88876,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-25T19:42:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI reject your boredom and substitute a Kerbapult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.twitch.tv/xacktar/c/3602846\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-3.steampowered.com/ugc/432645228406059252/244AD442A54AC37EA287DB2DEA4E0ACB864B1C3D/\u0022 alt=\u0022244AD442A54AC37EA287DB2DEA4E0ACB864B1C3D\u0022\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s only boring if you let it be.

If any of us were given a job in a real rocketry organisation within a couple of years we\u0027d be moaning about the work, boss, colleagues, pay, etc. etc. Routine is dull, by definition. My absolute favourite games are the Total War and Elder Scrolls series, but I couldn\u0027t play them all the time. Currently I\u0027m hooked on KSP \u0026amp; associated space simulators, I used to spend huge amounts of time in Second Life. Variety is required - just leave KSP for a few months then play with it a bit intensely when you feel like it later.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
