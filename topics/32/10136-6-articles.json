You\\\u0027ve actually convinced me to take a look at some of the planes I\\\u0027ve been building and take a more analytical approach rather than just throwing stuff together, seeing what works, and tweaking it through trial and error, along with teaching me a few things.\n\nAnyway, I have a question/request.\n\nI notice that you use .cfg edited wing connectors, delta, and structural wings (and it seems the hardpoints or pylons?) so you have larger variants of the parts. I\\\u0027ve downloaded and have been toying with the rescaled plane parts mod/edit where the creator just made increasing sizes of swept wings. I\\\u0027m happy with those but would like the same for the other \u0027basic\u0027 plane wing parts.\n\nWould you mind either, A: releasing the .cfg edits you did to rescale the parts, or B: let me in on what kind of math you used to arrive at your figures? I could just scale them up, but I\\\u0027d want the weights and lift/drag to be at least somewhat realistic in terms of their counterparts.\n\nThanks in advance, and keep up the good work."},{"CreatedByName":"TheBlaster","CreatedById":10575,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-08-01T20:45:04Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Love your vids.

Really, I\\\u0027m hoping some aeronautical engineering types can get us better wing code for this game.
