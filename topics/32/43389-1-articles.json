It basically looks like a large stalagtite inside of the SRB. The binders and what not make the SRB fuel pretty darned tough. The thrust from the burning fuel compresses things pretty evenly inside of the booster and push it back upwards...so unless you messed up the patterning, there is even force all the way around the rod. It has been used on SRBs before, but it is not the profile that the SST used; an 11 point star with two truncated cones near the bottom. It caused high initial thrust for 50s with gradually reducing thrust till burn out.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
