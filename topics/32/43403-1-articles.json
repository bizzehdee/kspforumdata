However, recently, I\u0027ve been feeling greatly inspired by this game. I have always been amazed at science fiction, since I was a kid watching Godzilla, Star Wars, and even playing games like Starcraft. I\u0027m in absolute love with the Star Trek universe and it is now my favorite fictional story. Star Trek has also given me a great hope to what we can accomplish in the future with a lot of hard work and an unlimited imagination. How does KSP fit into all of this? The semi-reality of the game and and physics provide a real challenge for anyone, and I became addicted to this challenge, crash after crash, even a few Kraken visits, planetary exploration, orbital mechanics, and ship design. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis challenge has inspired me so much, I am now planning to become a part of the aerospace industry after my service ends in the US Air Force. (a few months ago I had no idea what I wanted to do after the service) I am super excited at where we are right now as humans in terms of space exploration. My main goal of this decision is to contribute to the next landmark in human exploration, the first manned landing on Mars. I have much schooling ahead, but I have already started studying for the necessary degrees on the side. (My current job keeps me pretty busy, as a translator you are never done learning lol). I just wanted to say thank you so much to Squad and the whole KSP community for creating the catalyst that is taking me to the next step in my life, and maybe even mankind itself. (who knows how many others feel the same way as I do?!) If it has insipred you in same way, like myself, please share it! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESafe travels everyone! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EC\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00A1\u00C3\u00C2\u00B0\u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00BB\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u00C2\u00B2\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u00B9e \u00C3\u00C2\u00BF\u00C3\u2018\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u2018\u00CB\u2020\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5\u00C3\u2018\u00C2\u00C3\u2018\u00E2\u20AC\u0161\u00C3\u00C2\u00B2\u00C3\u00C2\u00B8\u00C3\u00C2\u00B5!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERedKosmos \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"0x7be","CreatedById":71709,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T20:47:25Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve used KSP as testbed for training my project management skills \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Motokid600","CreatedById":66349,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-08-21T20:49:52Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u0027s awesome man best of luck to you in the future.
