I\u0027ve found a few, but none of them seem to be accurate for interplanetary stuff. For example, they say it takes about 130 delta-v to get to Duna after exiting Kerbin SOI, but i find this false, and it is really more than 1000 delta-v. Either that or I\u0027m just reading them wrong:sticktongue:. Also, if you want to share a delta-v map, you can show it here. Thanks in advance:D!

I sometimes ignore them but the result is that it can take stupid large amounts of dV to make the transfer. It takes patience to wait for the windows but you CAN make it to Duna for 130 dV. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s equally efficient to burn out of Kerbin\u0027s SOI then time warp to the window, but that might be a way to cut down on the waiting.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Superfluous J","CreatedById":73725,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-12-06T01:53:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wZUXZxr.png\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis one\u003C/a\u003E fairly exclusively, though I also use \u003Ca href=\u0022http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis tool\u003C/a\u003E as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYou may be either reading the chart wrong or executing your transfer improperly.
