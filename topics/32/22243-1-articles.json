Struts everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe entire flight to Mun was smooth with no mishaps. Jeb was grinning ear to ear. It was the perfect mission with a behemoth craft.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe problem was on descent. There was no way this thing could land safely, just the way Jeb likes it, darn near impossible. It came down just crooked enough and just fast enough to break into two pieces and topple over on the Mun. Through some odd miracle, Jeb, Jeb\u0027s smile and the DEMV survived. Even though the DEMV looked as if it was undeployable. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs was the original plan, Jeb stayed put in the command pod and waited on Bill, Bob and Jerton to come aid in the research of a Mun arch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe return ship was ready. Three man pod with a crew tank underneath. The main XL parachute and four smaller chutes to ensure that the return would be safe. The lander was all set.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBill, Bob and Jerton were off to meet Jeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThrough ill timing, Jeb ended up on Mun at the tail end of the Munar day, so the rest of the crew arrived right at the beginning of the Munar night. Too dark for EVA, everyone stayed put.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAt Munar daybreak, Jeb goes for broke and deploys the DEMV, it actually lands on the wheels...after kind of landing on the back end and falling on its wheels, but it didn\u0027t blow up, so it was good enough. Jeb exits the command pod by falling onto his back and boards the DEMV, never to board the wrecked rover lander again.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe drives the 200 meters to the rest of the crew, who then ride to the Mun arch after going back and examining the wreckage. Poor engineering is blamed for the crash.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter a time of research and collecting samples and Jeb seeing just HOW all terrain the DEMV Mk. 1 is, it was time to return.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJerton was to board the crew tank with the samples, while Jeb took his usual seat.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at this point, that the mission began to go downhill. The MechJeb did not work. At all. Not even a screen display to pull up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo problem, this baby is just small enough to easily maneuver it back home manually(I\u0027m at least that good). Just use the ASAS and all is well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaunch from the surface, everyone is happy...screaming is happy right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at roughly 5000 meters above the Munar surface that everything went bad. There\u0027s no ASAS, just the non-functioning MechJeb.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe\u0027re beginning to loose altitude and spin. Not uncontrollable spin, but darn close. We can manually land this and just send another rescue crew up to save us, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope. The lander came back down WAY too hot and lost a lander leg, smacked down and lost the main chute as well as two of the smaller chutes. What I can only describe as a bug sent me back upwards instead of blowing me up entirely, which only adds to the level of fail.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt was at this point that the decision was made to not wait on the inevitable crash, but to regain control and do it on purpose. This just barely happened. I got enough control to put the nose down and full throttle the ship right into Mun at about 250 m/s\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ER.I.P. Jeb, Bill, Bob and Jerton Kerman, your efforts in Munar research will not soon be forgotten. Especially your faulty construction on two consecutive crafts. We\u0027re REALLY not forgetting that.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cby","CreatedById":26505,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-15T10:58:58Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EHahaha I liked that bit at the end.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust in case you didn\u0027t know, you can EVA when it\u0027s dark by using the lights on the helmet.
