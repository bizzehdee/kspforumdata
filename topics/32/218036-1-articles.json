IMO much depends on where your station is located: low Kerbin orbit you\u0027ll likely put one full tank into orbit at a time, while Minmus with less gravity might allow a mining rig \u002B many tanks to land, process fuel, redock with the station.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nKerbalX.com is a good source for ideas.
