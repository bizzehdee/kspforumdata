Low on fuel. At some 25\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 inclination.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA scientific lander sitting on Minmus - it lands, makes science, makes a suborbital hop to another biome and off it goes to dock with the Station to reset experiments. Four biomes left. Low on fuel. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo contracts. Test 1 KR-1x2 while landed on Minmus. Test a rockomax sized decoupler while on Minmus orbit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETwo needs. Refuel the Space Station. Take the science out of the Station and take it back to Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd so goes a ship I\u0027ve already deleted: A KR-1x2 as the middle stage, surrounded by a ring of skippers in, yes, asparagus configuration plus SRB below them. That engine has to reach Minmus with as much fuel as possible after all. Due a design oversight, it has no landing legs. On top, separated by the decoupler I need to test, goes a small ship to return science to Kerbin: an LV-909, a FT400 tank plus pod, rcs, dock and some solar panels.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Contract Ship takes off. The last pairs of Skippers exhaust their fuel during the circularization burn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother ship, a simpler tanker with additional docking ports launches to Minmus afterwards. Since I\u0027ve orbited it in a slightly inclined orbit, it goes straight to Minmus without waiting for the AN/DN node. It\u0027s scheduled to arrive six Kerbal days ahead of the Contract Ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EScientific Lander runs two more biomes and parks to wait for the tanker. The tanker arrives and refuels the Station. The Lander takes off, docks with the Tanker/Station and refuels. Lab and Goo are reset and experiments are stored in the Station Lab. Off it goes to Minmus to finish the last two biomes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Contract Ship hasn\u0027t arrived to Minmus yet. The lander finishes the last biome - Minmus poles, and heads of for a final RV with the station. It refuels and goes for the Mun, to harvest science there. The Tanker, it task complete is finally undocked from the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Contract Ship arrives to Minmus while the lander is days away from entering the Mun\u0027s SOI. Remember, it has to land and doesn\u0027t have landing gear. It touches down at 2 m/s and the contract conditions are met. Before it tips over or whatever, the stage is triggered and the contract fulfilled. It takes off fast in a 0\u00C3\u201A\u00C2\u00B0 (roughly) inclination. Off to correct the plane and meet with the Station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe Contract Ship fills over 3/4 of the Station tanks. The Station plus Contract Ship lower the periapsis to test the decoupler. In doing so, it expels the empty KR-1x2. The Return ship heads for Kerbin, while the Station waits for the transfer window to the Mun so to assist science gathering efforts there.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe lander enters the Mun\u0027s SOI and gets captured. It now has about half the tank/some 1600 delta-v. The return ship splashes some 100km away from the KSC and delivers over 4,000 science. The Station is still transferring between Minmus and the Mun.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"GusTurbo","CreatedById":57552,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-08-06T01:52:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022JHadden123\u0022 data-cite=\u0022JHadden123\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EHow\u0027d you make that stock?

So interstage was still connected and blocked nuclear engine. Tried to cut a second time, but now i couldnt get it to work on interstage and thought cut only works once.
