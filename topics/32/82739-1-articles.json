Attempting to land near a probe on the surface in a spot 2,000m above sea level, every time I landed about 40-80km away.That scares me for a manned mission. Nevertheless, I attempted one. I build a pretty nifty lander that could return from Eve if it landed on one of the plateaus. Unfortunately it burned up during reentry (I\u0027m using deadly reentry).
