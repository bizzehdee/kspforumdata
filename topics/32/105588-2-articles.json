The grind is real. Science is incredibly hard to come by until you can make a heavy SRB rocket that can break orbit / return (though this resulted in me making a almost entirely SRB rocket to get a munar flyby). Money isn\u0027t a real bottleneck since all the early stuff is so cheap (especially SRBs, which are pennies for a dollar considering what they can do), it\u0027s science that seems incredibly slow.\n\u003E Not landing on the mun till I can EVA / Surface sample, which will take another dozen or so contracts till I have enough funds for both building upgrades.\n\nseems like you\u0027re getting your science at a rather slow rate. Since money isn\u0027t a problem, try upgrading your astronaut complex ASAP to be able to do EVA reports, this wil help science gathering considerable. Secondly, focus on unlocking more science equipment in the tech tree and milk all possible spots/biomes for as much science as possible (EVA reports, goo and mat bay in flight, upper atmosphere, space and space high over kerbin for example. That stuff alone is worth a ton of science). also don\u0027t forget that EVA reports near Kerbin vary depending on which biome you are over and give a respectable amount of science points. Get a ton of them in one mission by going out, taking a report, storing it in the pod, rinse, repeat. \n\nUsing these techniques I got into orbit after about 1 hour, mun flyby after 2-3.

I did have some 1.0 Career Mode, so learning the capabilities of each part a little bit already. Here is the trick!\n\n**Speed Kills**: There is not need to go rushing past terminal velocity as fast as you can! In fact, doing so is a recipe for a flipped rocket, overheating parts, or any other problem that will cause a rapid unscheduled disassembly. \n\n**With the Kerbal-X**: Go up-ish to about 1,000m and push her over to 10degrees off of vertical. Now, here\u0027s the real trick - TURN OFF SAS. Don\u0027t use it, YAGNI. You are in a gravity turn, let gravity - turn you! \n\n**The Gravity Turn**: Allowing gravity to turn your rocket is all about being hands-off. No control inputs! NONE! - don\u0027t do it, it\u0027s a trap! Instead, throttle back, it\u0027s really ok, you don\u0027t have to fly your ship - a well designed rocket *wants* to reach orbit. At lower throttle the rocket will naturally tip over to about 45 degrees above horizon. The lower your throttle at first (after initial ascent) the faster this happens, play with this a bit until you find a routine you really like.\n\n**Give\u0027n Her All She\u0027s Got!** Once you\u0027re at your desired ascent angle, \u0022Z\u0022 it up - go whole hog until your Ap is where you like it.

In my opinion hard should be hard because of more \u0022realistic\u0022 effects, ie stonger reentry heat, no saving, bigger penalty for crashing etc. Smaller marginals for error, quite simply. In fact, maybe you should earn MORE money than in normal, but also loose more money when failing.\n\nI also (as someone else wrote) think it is grindy in the start because I\u0027m already so experienced, so I don\u0027t really have to think when I design my first 10-15 rockets. The fun challenge is to get to the Mun with no manouver nods. That is hard, and its not grindy. Then, I found in 0.90 you hit a (dead end?)/wall when starting to go to other planets. With no dV calculator and no mods (since were talking stock here) it is just dead (too) hard to design a good enough rocket to take you to for example Eve, and if I somehow still manages to do that, it is too hard to aerobrake successfully around another planet. One little design flaw, or a periapsis a touch too low, and you lost a bunch of money with no way of reverting. I have a good solution for that problem, but this post is too long already.

The cost of the initial building upgrades is just brutal, and you find yourself stuck with no way to do any of the more lucrative missions (how are you going to go to the Mun with only 18 tons and 30 parts?) or to get all the science you can get from EVA reports over different biomes.

Why is there no simple \u0022do an EVA on Kerbin orbit\u0022 contract, and that sort of thing... hopefully better, but it just seems like it\u0027s \u0022get into orbit\u0022 and then \u0022land on the Mun\u0022 with nothing to ease the blow. As the game progresses, I expect more of that kind of thing to apear. \n\nI am having a lot of fun, and expect the problems that I am having to be easily fixed by some mods that don\u0027t change gameplay too much.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-28T21:49:08Z\u0022 title=\u002204/28/2015 09:49  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Musil**"},{"CreatedByName":"zarakon","CreatedById":5160,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:49:43Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E There\u0027s not still a ton of grind. There\u0027s a ton MORE grinding involved in career mode. The massive engine nerfs mean that I haven\u0027t managed to get to the mun yet with a rocket under 50t. In old career, a single one of the huge SRB\u0027s, a 909 and a medium fuel tank could get you a moon landing and return.\n\nIt\u0027s also much harder to re-use anything due to re-entry destruction, so margins on each mission are much lower than what you could get before."}]}
