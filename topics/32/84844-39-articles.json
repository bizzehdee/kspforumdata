At best we might see one thread per craft in the physics bubble, but individual ships will still be all one thread. I don\u0027t have the math/CS background to evaluate that, but I\u0027m keeping my hopes in check and planning my next PC build around single thread performance.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do have the CS background to evaluate that, but not the physics background. \u0027Chained rigidbody\u0027 (and my own KSP experience) implies that the state of a part relies on the state of the parts around it, which will put a big dent in any multithreaded gains (You can\u0027t process part B if it\u0027s dependent on state from part A, which means handing part B to thread #2 isn\u0027t going to help, and may in fact incur extra overhead from thread synchronization that would make it slower AND more costly than a single-threaded solution).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat being said, there might still be opportunities for gains if any pre- or post-calculation has to be done (do any vectors or matrices need to be normalized etc?). Also, I\u0027ve heard some alarming things in the past about Unity 4 not being thread-safe in some manner or another (I don\u0027t know the Unity context, nor even remember what was said clearly, unfortunately), but that \u003Cem\u003Ecould\u003C/em\u003E mean that Squad\u0027s own code is stuck behind fat mutexes for large periods of time while Unity goes about it\u0027s business.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWithout being able to see the code, it\u0027s all guesswork from this end...but my number above is a \u003Cem\u003Emaximum\u003C/em\u003E estimate, so it still stands \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E (well, unless they can magically pull a 100% efficient solution out of their .. uh, hat, and blow past that figure..)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, you should always keep single-threaded performance in mind in any case.

Getting less science from missions, making the price of buying stuff with science higher (I\u0027m assuming this is definitely the case), or both? I doubt they\u0027ve \u003Cem\u003Eremoved\u003C/em\u003E science from places, but I do wonder if they reduce how much you get from collecting science or not.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom my understanding, the Science slider (indeed, all sliders) increases or reduces the income, as in a 60% slider will take a 40 science gain *0.6 = 24. (they talked about it before in the videos and blogs, and that\u0027s what they pretty much said). I was converting it to costs, as the old user-provided MM configs did that for Funds (as MM can\u0027t address contract income, only part costs..).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts are that 60% doesn\u0027t seem very hard as:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027ve played MM configs with 10x part cost multipliers before, it\u0027s still doable, if very grindy (that\u0027s equivalent to 10%). The standard multiplier is 6x for those mods, or 16 and 2/3 percent income.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- There\u0027s allegedly 75k science in the Kerbol system, and the tree is supposed to be about 10k long, so you really only need 13 and 1/3% science returns - or less, since there\u0027s apparently no limit to asteroid and contract science.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I think the \u0027hard\u0027 setting should really be more like 20-30% gains tops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022 data-cite=\u0022FleetAdmiralJ\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI wonder if there is a plan to essentially save custom game modes either for your own use (so you can just select your custom settings at the start of a new game and go) or to share?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be neat, although I didn\u0027t see any template buttons, unfortunately :/\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, the sliders and settings are one of the things I\u0027m most hyped about.
