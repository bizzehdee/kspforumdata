I was testing a Lunar Orbit Rendezvous technique, with a two-stage lander and separate command module, as a preparation for deep-space missions. Designing the lander was a bit of a challenge as I was also intending to test a rover (the Packrat, from the USI Exploration Pack). I wasn\u0027t sure about building it in-situ, so I made it in the VAB and tacked it to the side of the lander. This required me to make an asymmetrical lander, with fuel lines feeding from tanks into a single LV-909.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith our crew of Jeb (because I couldn\u0027t make him stay home), Buzz (because who wouldn\u0027t send a Kerbal with that name on a Mun mission), and Geofdard (for his low stupidity, and to operate the command pod), the \u0022Kerbal X-Int\u0022 was off!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote lang=\u0022en\u0022\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022//imgur.com/a/qilO3\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EJavascript is disabled. View full album\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause the lander\u0027s ascent stage had lots of Round-8 toroidal tanks above and below the crew cabin (to make the ascent stage balanced for RCS rendezvous), they acted like neck vertebrae and flexed like crazy during the Kerbin-escape burn. The spinning was so bad that I just throttled the engine up when it was pointing more-or-less in the right direction and then cut it off again until the next rotation. With that, we managed to struggle our way to the Mun, and then I realized that the delta-V numbers on the lander were looking awfully low. An inspection revealed that, somehow, the fuel lines hadn\u0027t stuck properly during the assembly process. So, it was time to put together a rescue mission with some KAS fuel pipe ends to fix it. After learning the hard way that Kerbals couldn\u0027t carry more than one thing at a time (and having to chase wayward pipe ends), the repair was complete and the lander was good to go.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn retrospect, one LV-909 was not enough for a lander of that weight -- its Mun TWR was greater than one, but not by much. I rotated the pod so that the lander\u0027s wheels were facing down, hoping to perform some kind of non-destructive high-horizontal-speed landing, but our trajectory took us inside a crater, and we smashed into its rim as the ground rose up to meet us.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo add insult to injury, because I had TAC-LS installed, I had to send Geofdard home immediately, so I got to watch him wail inconsolably about the loss of his crewmates.

Kerbin escape and mun insertion and landing happened without a hitch.
