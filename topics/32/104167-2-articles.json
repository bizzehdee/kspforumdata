Refuelling a reuseable lander that carries its fuel in ten to fifteen golden donuts must be fun.\n\nAs the only lander presented here that \u0022carries its fuel in ten to fifteen golden donuts\u0022 seems to be mine, I should maybe clarify that it\u0027s part of a fully expendable, apolloesque Mun mission stack that returns only the 3-place capsule to Kerbin. The lander is never refuelled. (That docking port carries a payload not seen in the image, and can be used to supply monoprop. to the rover.)\n\nAnd it admittedly does not make a very convincing case for the ROUND-8. For a more reasonable and practical example see ddenis\u0027 post on the previous page.\n\nThe point I wanted to make is that the Round-8, especially in combination with the Oscar, allows for very creative use of limited space, and can sometimes be a fix for a craft that just needs a *little bit* more fuel. This actually WAS the case with my lander, the bottom 4 tanks were added later after two missions almost failed due to running out of descent fuel, and it would have been difficult to add that amount anywhere else without a major rework of the lander and/or its fairing."},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T15:52:52Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E In addition to the poll ([Vote here!](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/115621-Do-you-think-Squad-should-leave-the-Round8-Toroidal-Tank-alone)) I would like to open this thread to enable all of you to show your crafts using the ROUND8 tank before 1.0 hits and all of our designs become useless.\n\u003E I would like to start with this lander that visited all 5 Jool moons. \n\u003E \n\u003E [http://i.imgur.com/MdmXAWjh.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/MdmXAWjh.jpg)\n\nThanks for linking the poll.

The great thing about the Round-8 in my opinion is that it is such a fantastic adapter for 1.25 - 0.625 for things that on purpose should not look very rigid--like landers. There would be no replacement for it.\n\nAnd this would make no sense for ion sats since they usually don\u0027t have 1.25 parts.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-04-15T17:10:51Z\u0022 title=\u002204/15/2015 05:10  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EApril 15, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by LostOblivion**"},{"CreatedByName":"merendel","CreatedById":97774,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-15T16:58:38Z","Content":"I\u0027ve used them for small probes plenty of times just cause I dont like the oscarB.
