A couple of sections have pdf links to scanned NASA docs from back then when several of these engines were tested.\n\n[http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#ntrsoliddumbo](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/enginelist.php#ntrsoliddumbo)\n\nAlbeit being a DUMBO ![:P](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif) It functions the same as a NERVA or any other NTR engine really, no radiators used. Fuel flow is used to cool the engine/reactor.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E *(bad photocopy of a ) Rough schematic of Dumbo engine. Liquid hydrogen propellant enters top and flows through beryllium neutron reflector, cooling it. Flows upward through a Cold Gas Entrance into interior of a reactor tube. Hydrogen seeps through walls of tube, being heated by fissioning uranium. Hot hydrogen escapes through hot gas exit holes in bottom, entering exhaust nozzle. Beryllium reflector will have control drums (not shown)*\n\n![dumbo15.png](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/images/enginelist/dumbo15.png)\n\nSo my question remaining: can the 1.0 heat system be modded, so that any liquid fuel can act as a radiator as long as you give enough throttle/give enough fuel flow. \n\nThis is what I like to know. Cause how it works now and has worked somewhat in the past is rather wrong."},{"CreatedByName":"Brotoro","CreatedById":57674,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:26:22Z","Content":"regex, I very much appreciate what you said elsewhere about enjoying a good engineering challenge. Version 1.0 is making us all re-think how we design our ships, and such challenges are the best part of KSP, in my opinion. \n\nBut I just don\u0027t like the idea of having to overcome a challenge that is rooted in some unphysical or erroneous implementation made by the devs (be it aerodynamic instability caused by improper implementation of heat shields, or overheating caused by a decision to make the nuclear engines run overly hot).

If you have a fuel tank that is being depleted, it will cool. The effect is just not very noticeable at the moment, since its is not very much, and the heat from the engine will easily overpower the cooling, so the net heat still goes up. I have noticed this when I saw a strange \u0022backdraft\u0022 on a few designs. The fuel tank would stop heating up, and start to cool while the engine was firing. After the engine stopped, and it was no longer getting any hotter, the fuel tank briefly reversed and started warming up again. This was because the net flow was positive again, and the engine was hotter that the tank, so it was warming it. Took me a few minutes to realize what was happening."},{"CreatedByName":"Radam","CreatedById":79910,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:46:34Z","Content":"I wouldnt mind if it just got up to say 2000 K, but it has to have enough emmisivity to stay there by itself."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T21:53:53Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E But I just don\u0027t like the idea of having to overcome a challenge that is rooted in some unphysical or erroneous implementation made by the devs (be it aerodynamic instability caused by improper implementation of heat shields, or overheating caused by a decision to make the nuclear engines run overly hot). I\u0027ll do it if I HAVE to...but I won\u0027t enjoy it.\n\nAs far as NTRs are concerned, I think the heating is a fair balancing point (although, again, a dedicated radiator part would be welcome). The reasons being that LiquidFuel is essentially cryogenic kerosene (by density and other engine stats, IIRC) with the thermal properties of Aerozine 50 (the thermal info according to NathanKell). It\u0027s a super-fuel, nothing near cryogenic hydrogen in terms of storage and handling. Realistically, an NTR running kerosene would probably have a terrible isp. Also, while NTRs may actually be quite cool engines (they appear to be about mid-range in terms of chamber temperature) KSP glosses over the storage of cryo fuels, which require some sort of cooling mechanism in order to avoid boil-off.\nI can\u0027t believe I\u0027m saying this, but I feel the NTR heating is a balanced and interesting gameplay mechanic because KSP is not realistic.

You would have to insulate it really well from everything else. I don\u0027t think they actually changed that much about the LV-N, I just think the implementation of a proper heat system suddenly started taking into account the fact that they run HOT. I personally love it. \n\nWhy is it so hot? Who cares. Jeb probably bribed the engineers to put some extra Uranium into the engine, since he thought the \u0022normal\u0022 non- overheating engine was \u0022too dam slow\u0022. \n\nWe had Whackjob shoot insane monstrosities into an orbit, and you are saying we cannot figure a way to cool one measly nuke without a dev revision or boring stock radiators?"},{"CreatedByName":"blowfish","CreatedById":119688,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-28T22:02:17Z","Content":"It might be worth exploring the thermal debug options.
