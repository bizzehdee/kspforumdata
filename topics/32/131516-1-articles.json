As a result I have permanently stranded a bunch of kerbals on the mun in 2 separate trips. 1st mission I forgot to ensure that the fuel lines from the propulsion system I loaded were all connected and it crashed destroying everything except the kerbal I had intended on sending up with the rover to do a mission. Oh well I figured, I have to send some tourists up anyway and I just loaded a new rover up on another rocket I had planned on sending anyway. I accidentally over staffed the craft making my rescue attempt futile (oops), but I ran out of fuel anyway and damaged the engine on landing...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo... not sure where to go with this. If the craft had a working engine it would just be\u00A0 a matter of refueling it and getting a winch up there to stand it upright. The craft doesn\u0027t have any docking ports at all, so I don\u0027t know if I can get these tourists out if they can\u0027t EVA. Any ideas? I could easily send a craft to pickup my crew but have no clue how to deal with the tourists.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, my rover is pretty far from my the location I wanted to science for the mission and it moves slowly in addition to being a pain to pilot around craters. What are other people doing with rovers? is there a way around this? I think I have to move it like 1/40th of the way around the mun, but at 16 m/s max speed taking a long route it is kinda arduous.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlso, what are others doing to prevent this sort of thing with quicksave?

I find it pretty hard to get it figured out, I have the engineering mod with the delta Vs listed but I don\u0027t really understand what that means or what my targets are.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSome calculate it, but i\u0027d guess most use a mod (Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb) to display the delta-v of the rocket, combined with their own memory or a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://www.google.ch/search?q=delta-v-map\u0026amp;tbm=isch\u0026amp;tbo=u\u0026amp;source=univ\u0026amp;sa=X\u0026amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzppu8r-jKAhWDj3IKHUrBB-4QsAQIHA\u0026amp;biw=1680\u0026amp;bih=939#imgrc=_\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Edelta-v-map\u003C/a\u003E.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEasiest way to get info on mods is in their release threads in the mod section. Or do it like i do, just build a mess with all the parts from a mod and then trial and error on the launch pad. Helps with forgetting to add the necessary parts later because you already went trough it \u003Cimg alt=\u0022;)\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022true\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 title=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
