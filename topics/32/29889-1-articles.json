I, myself, was once new; and I\u0027m pretty sure that everyone else here had a first launch, first failed launch, first successful moon landing, first successful moon rescue mission, etc. I think that it can sometimes be difficult for veterans to put themselves back in their old \u0022shoes\u0022 and see how foreign the game may seem to someone just starting out. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember when I tried to land on Duna the first time. I felt like I was trying to hit a target obscured in darkness a million miles away while looking through a pinhole(which was mostly true). I finished my initial ejection burn, and watched as Kerbin got smaller and smaller as I entered that great span of nothingness between planets. I felt kinda helpless; just wafting around like a speck of space dust. It seemed like magic when I actually arrived at Duna\u0027s SOI, and I felt a panic set in as I saw that my orbit was some millions of meters away from the planet. I knew that if I missed it, and slid on by, I would plummet away into the darkness of space. . . and there would be nothing I could do to get back. I eventually corrected my orbit, managed to land successfully, and even send a successful rescue mission later to retrieve the whole crew. But that moment when I actually touched down on Duna after a few months(time accelerated minutes) in deep space lifted a huge weight off my shoulders.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ETo someone new at this game, it can be daunting. Things that veterans take for granted like planetary transfers and docking can seem impossible at first. I think it is the responsibility of the community to help new members understand this game as much as possible, so that instead of having a group of veterans and a group of noobs, we have a single, united playerbase always welcoming in new people.
