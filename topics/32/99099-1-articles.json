It\u0027s an insanely complicated engine class, requiring three different fuels at once to run, which is why it\u0027s not really been used outside of feasibility studies. But it does give you the performance profile that you see from KSP turbojets. First low-ish but still acceptable thrust on the runway thanks to the active jet component, then steadily increasing thrust as the aircraft goes supersonic and the ramjet gets going for real, until finally bottoming out between mach 5 and 6 - the practical limit for ramjet engines IRL.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs for the F-15 as an airbreathing first stage, it will likely have the same issues as all other air-launched rockets: height is largely irrelevant in getting to orbit. The F-15 can maybe push between mach 2 and 3 or so? But orbital velocity for Earth is mach 25. Meaning that if a ground launched rocket needs about 10 km/s dV to get all the way into orbit, then this F-15 launched rocket will still need somewhere between 8 and 9 km/s dV. You save very little at all, and considering how small the rocket is, it\u0027s probably not staged like the ground launched rocket would be, which puts it at an additional disadvantage.

For one, they have way too much thrust. For two, they have roughly 16x the isp they should have based on how intake air is used within the engine code (you basically get afterburner-level thrust for cruising fuel consumption). For three, KSP\u0027s \u003Cem\u003Ecurrent\u003C/em\u003E aerodynamic/atmospheric/drag model is, to put it mildly, dumb.

An air-launch can help reduce those delta-v costs, by taking the rocket up to the thinner part of the atmosphere to start with, so it can be launched closer to horizontal, with less gravity AND aero drag.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPlus all rocket engines have better specific impulse at lower atmospheric pressure... can get away with smaller/fewer engines up in the rarified air than at ground level.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOnce you add that small initial velocity to the cake, it basically becomes the icing. Oh also don\u0027t forget the Oberth effect!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJouni\u0027s right about the cost, too. Not only is it using established equipment with high re-usability indexes, but also you\u0027re cutting delta-v from the bottom-most stage.. the biggest, heaviest, and most expensive bit...and if you do it well enough, you could delete the entire first stage, reducing the complexity. For example, the Saturn V first stage is only about 3500m/sec, and pretty much half of that disappears to gravity - half of what remains would vanish to the initial velocity. Crank in vacuum or near-vacuum specific impulse, and you have a good shot at completely eliminating that stage.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(The only difference between KSP and the WhiteKnight2/F-15E is that the KSP version would carry the payload into space, the pilot would EVA, and give the last 0.5m/sec with a physical \u003Cem\u003Etap\u003C/em\u003E to put it in orbit~)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(Why do I keep on using the Saturn V as an example?
