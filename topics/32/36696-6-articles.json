The appeal is that it opens the game up for all different types of people to customise the experience of the game to suit them, and given that its not multiplayer, what difference does that make really? It keeps the game alive and encourages creativity. Some of the mods I have seen actually add aspects that increase the difficulty of the game or make it more realistic, and if you don\u0027t like any of these things, then you don\u0027t have to have them. This makes the game appeal to a much wider audience which can be only good for future developments that we can all enjoy\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis.

But what if you are launching some insanely large craft, which requires careful human input? That is where the fly part comes in, and where you are needed. Take a look at GigglePlex\u0027s crafts, there is no way that Mechjeb could fly them. That\u0027s the spirit of KSP.

For me however, the mod itself makes no difference whatever. It makes the game harder or easier, whatever makes you happy is fine with me. That being said, and this is my opinion, the idea of manually flying a rocket and plotting trajectories and whatever is absurd. Guidance computers have been a part of spaceflight since the V-2. To me, career mode should be a simulation of a space program and I doubt anyone is going to let Jeb fly by hand when a guidance computer is available. But, you can play in any way you like.
