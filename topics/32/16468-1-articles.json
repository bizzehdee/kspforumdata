Although it had a Mk2 pod, I only had one Kerbanaut on board. After descending the ladder and jumping off to set foot on the tanks of the lower stage, he slipped. Then promptly fell between the gap between the inner and outer tanks and got stuck. With no one else there, I had to send a rescue party in the form of two Kerbanauts in a Mk2 pod. Once there, I had one of them take control of the poor fellas ship and takeoff and land again, hoping to dislodge the stuck Kerbanaut. No luck with that, so I decided to try going to orbit and see if he could dislodge himself in zero gravity. So off we go on the initial burn. I checked, and he is still there - all good so far. Another burn to almost get a full circle orbit, and I check, and... he is gone! Map view, and I see he was dislodged during the second burn and he is behind me some distance away. While both in sub-orbit, coasting to Ap, I try to rendezvous. No luck with that, however on the EVA, the RCS activity accidentally put my poor Kerbanaut into orbit! So I get the ship into orbit as well and try more rendezvous attempts. Sadly, no luck so I gave up. However if anyone posts a challenge to get a Kerbanaut in EVA to orbit around the Mun without holding on to anything, at least I can say I done that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EMunbuggy Madness\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUsing the wonderful Carts mod and Crewtank mod, I created an ingenious ball of fun out of just two parts: The Munbuggy.

One incident that fortunately ended well, I was returning to the lander in the Munbuggy on Minmus after visiting another landing site. Travelling atop a plateau at speed, I decided to slow down as I approach the edge down to the lake, for obvious reasons. Alas, I touched on the brake at the wrong time it seems, because it rolled and bounced. Minmus, being Minmus, this meant nerve racking ordeal that was probably pushing 2 minutes. I did reach the edge of the plateau after a few bounces... then went careering over it. I thought it was a goner, but no, it kept bouncing.
