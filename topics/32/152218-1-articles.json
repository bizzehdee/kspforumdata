Fuel works with an orange jumbo tank (use interstellar fuel switch to turn it into a liquid fuel only tank) with either four radially attached Nervs (radially attach an MK1 liquid fuel tank, the nervs attach to the bottom of it, remember to use fuel lines to pass fuel from the central tank) or a mod\u0027s 2.5m Nerv alternative (MRS has a good one). You can throw in a mobile science lab to it, Make sure you add docking ports.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou Mun lander should serve as the basis for your planetary landers for Duna and most of Jool moons. If you\u0027re using Terrier engines, you might want to replace them for aerospikes for Duna and maybe for Vall, depending on your lander\u0027s weight.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn Duna parachutes (specially drogue) will help you slow down but they won\u0027t slow you down enough, so you\u0027ll have to make a powered landing anyway - parachutes save you fuel. Duna has an atmosphere but doesn\u0027t have oxygen, so airbreathers don\u0027t work. While you can fly a plane (with aerospikes, terriers or some mod engine which works in any atmosphere) you need to design it differently than a Kerbin\u0027s plane. There is a tutorial about flying with wings in Duna somewhere. Keep in mind it is a challenge. Dropping on vertical rockets is a lot easier.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe has an oxygenated atmosphere, so you can may want to carry a spaceplane there. Basically, if it can go from the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Kerbal Space Center\u0022\u003EKSC\u003C/abbr\u003E all the way to \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Low Kerbin Orbit\u0022\u003ELKO\u003C/abbr\u003E, it will easily work in Laythe. But Laythe is mostly water and the terrain is rather rolling, so horizontal landings can be tricky. OTOH, you can land in the water with the proper design. Or just use a vertical rocket. Parachutes will slow you down enough to land.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo requires a lot of \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eand thrust\u003C/em\u003E to land (something like 3,500 m/s for the whole down and up again trip).

Duna\u0027s not difficult to make a single stage lander for, but for someone who\u0027s less experienced it might be best to try a 2-stage lander consisting of a descent module and an ascent module. Landing on Duna and returning to orbit (assuming you use parachutes and an engine to land) takes about as much delta-v as going from low Kerbin orbit to the surface of the Mun and then back to an aerobraking trajectory with Kerbin. The Kerbin return vehicle is even simpler, since it only takes around 600m/s of delta-v to escape Duna\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E, which means a rather small fuel tank (for comparison, an ascent from the surface of the Mun takes a similar amount of delta-v). If you also want to land on Ike, it\u0027s usually easiest to add a bit of extra fuel in the ascent stage of your Duna lander, and use that for the Ike landing.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EJool system\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIn terms of difficulty\u00A0(assuming you want to return your kerbals to Kerbin), the next level is the Jool system. In order of difficulty for landing and returning, the moons follow this order: Pol, Bop, Vall, Laythe, Tylo. You can\u0027t land on Jool itself because it is a gas giant and thus has no surface, but you could potentially drop a probe into its atmosphere to transmit some science data.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the Jool system, you\u0027ll probably want to construct an interplanetary transport in a separate launch from your landing vehicles. The transport will need nuclear engines (which run on liquid fuel with no oxidizer) because the Jool system takes a lot of delta-v to get to. You\u0027ll also need to learn how to use the Joolian moons (mainly Laythe and Tylo) for gravity braking, as this can cut down enormously on the amount of delta-v you need to get into orbit of Jool. Also, you\u0027ll need to consider which moons to visit; unless you\u0027re doing a Jool 5 mission, it\u0027s generally best to do Pol, Bop, and Vall with the same\u00A0mission, and have a single dedicated mission for each of Laythe and Tylo.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the landers, Pol and Bop are very easy to land on and have such low gravity that even an ion engine can land a reasonably-sized payload on them, so there\u0027s no point using a multi-stage lander. Vall can be done using slightly less delta-v than the average Duna lander, and it\u0027s also not difficult to make a single-stage lander for Vall.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLaythe gets rather challenging. It takes almost 3000m/s to ascend from Laythe (for comparison, a Kerbin ascent takes around 3500m/s for the average pilot), which generally means a rather large lander is needed. The good news is that you can land using parachutes instead of fuel - but be careful, because Laythe is mostly ocean and has very few islands large enough to land on easily. Laythe missions can be done most easily using a spaceplane as Laythe\u0027s atmosphere has oxygen, but since you appear to be rather new to the game I imagine spaceplanes may be somewhat beyond your current abilities. Still though, give it a try if you want to - no one learns anything in this game without attempting it themselves.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTylo is the ultimatum for non-atmospheric landing vehicles. It\u0027s nearly the size of Kerbin but has no atmosphere to slow you down. Theoretically it takes only 4500m/s to land on Tylo and return to its orbit, but I\u0027ve found that it\u0027s safest to go with at least 5200m/s. In case you don\u0027t use a mod that lets you calculate delta-v, this is similar to the delta-v needed to get from the surface of Kerbin all the way to Mun orbit. Single-stage Tylo landers are plausible, but ugly, and also enormous and thus enormously difficult to transport to Tylo. Your best bet is to use the tiny rover seat instead of a crew pod, and minimize your lander mass as much as possible. Also, you probably should cheat your landers to Tylo beforehand (in a test save if you don\u0027t want to cheat in your career) just to test them out and ensure that they work. The last thing you want is to crash into the surface of Tylo after spending a huge amount of time and effort designing the necessary spacecraft and flying them to the Jool system. Another thing which might be a good idea - particularly with a very massive Tylo lander -\u00A0is to send your Tylo lander separately from your crew vehicle, and rendezvous them in Tylo orbit.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cu\u003EEve\u003C/u\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEve is the single most difficult planet to land on and return from (in the stock solar system at least). The planet takes the least amount of delta-v to get to, which is convenient because Eve ascent vehicles are absolutely gargantuan. The amount of delta-v needed to ascend from Eve is more than double what it takes to ascend from Kerbin - and you have to land a rocket capable of doing that on the surface of Eve in the first place. You also need to use engines that actually work in Eve\u0027s thick atmosphere, which really means that your only options for the lower stages are aerospikes or Vector engines.
