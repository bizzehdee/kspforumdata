What I had realized was with minimal alterations to the design I could get my launches down to 5 (one for each rover\u002B refuel) and skip the docking and tugs entirely. Instead of building a small skycrane that could safely land the 40-90 ton rovers, I should build big ones that could launch the rovers! \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI built large sky cranes, stuck mainsail engines on them with a few nuclear engines and launched them into low orbit. Built my refueler using KAS to transfer the fuel. Disabled the mainsails and used nukes to fly them to Duna. And this is where the brilliant part comes in. I only launched a single fuel tank for the refuel, it was enough to get the 4 to Duna with the fumes they had left from reaching orbit but mostly because the tank on my converter rover (which was a normal fuel tank) had sucked up most of the fuel in the refueler, and was still full. I connected all of the rovers as they were intended to be on the ground and siphoned the fuel out of the converter. From there it was just setting them on a trajectory in the general area of where I wanted to land, jettisoning the nuclear engines and landing with mainsails, once on the ground undock them from the skycrane and using the probe core inside each crane fly it away and crash it somewhere... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBefore I had this idea I was planning on 3 launches per rover making it 12 launches and 8 dockings total.
