That should unlock 2 or 3 nodes. Then you can build a functional rocket and start your suborbital hops to different biomes. Keep experimenting with early parts and you\u0027ll eventually hit orbit which will net you a good amount of science. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne you get partway into the third column of nodes, you should be able to do flybys (if not straight up orbits) of Mun and Minmus, which if you plan it right will net you stupid amounts of science depending on how low you can get your periapsis (as you\u0027ll get science from the different altitudes) and whether or not you decide to put yourself into Munar/Minar orbit, which will also net you more science as you get EVA reports from the different biomes. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom there, landings on both moons. Standard stuff. After that you should be ready to go interplanetary. Just breaking Kerbin\u0027s SOI will give you a good boost to grab a node or two if you bring enough experiments and return them to Kerbin. From there, its the same procedure. Flybys, orbits, then landings. If you have mods then the game can get really interesting at this point, as you\u0027ll have unlocked enough to start digging into some of the really neat toys that some mods have.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoing it this way (and making sure you get yourself all the science you can from wherever you are. EVA and Crew reports from all kinds of places, positions, and altitudes are your bread and butter) gives you a good progression that\u0027s not too grindy and dull but also not handicapped by the low technology you\u0027ll have. Its also mostly realistic if you\u0027re into that sort of thing. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd remember, if you\u0027re ever in a stump (using my approach its usually somewhere between orbits and landings that you want science but can\u0027t get it), always go for probe impacts on various bodies. Bring as many experiments as you can reasonably put on a probe, load it up with batteries and solar panels, and crash it into one of the Moons (or even some other planet or other planets moons). You can pop experiments at various altitudes on the way down and transmit before you impact the surface. Won\u0027t get you the full science (and you\u0027ll have to land to get the rest), but with the high base science, the transmitted values will add up to a good enough boost to get a node. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnother good way early on is to go interplanetary early and go for Kerbol, ie, the sun. You should be able to easily push a probe into solar orbit. As with good flybys, get your periapsis as low as you can so you can get the different science values.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"nats","CreatedById":58316,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-20T21:33:35Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI find it boring as well - but more for the fact that its doing science for new parts!

The only thing you should get from carrying out mission science is some prestige and that should provide more funding to the program. I dont see how science is related to parts manufacture at all. It all seems very contrived to me the way it is presently. I think Slitherines Buzz Aldrins Space Program Manager does the whole space program thing far better.

That was prior to unlocking landing gear, batteries, or solar panels. How do you not fall over landing on the engine nozzle. How does 50 power get you to the Mun and back let alone Minmus?\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIf you spend your first 20 science the right way, you have landing legs. Since it\u0027s possible to get rather more than this with an orbital mission (or perhaps even a suborbital hop)... As for power, a mere 50 units if you\u0027re careful in your maneuvers. You\u0027ll need to keep ASAS off most of the time. Transmitting of data will be quite limited, though.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lammatt","CreatedById":21777,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-23T03:57:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Eyou can basically just use pod\u002Bchute \u0026gt;decoupler \u002Bsmallest tank\u002Bengine\u0026gt;decoupler \u002BSRB\u0026gt;decoupler \u002BSRB\u0026gt;decoupler \u002BSRB to get into low orbit and return for your first mission\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ei think you can at least get ~150science with that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E(if you cant... you are probably doing it wrong)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
