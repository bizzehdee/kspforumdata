KSP can now provide us with such things as communication, graphs, charts, failures, and more! So now is the time!.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI would like to perform a 100% realistic Apollo mission (maybe more missions like it) with 3 crew members who will manage specific aspects of the mission (The CMP would manage the aspects of the Command Module, the LMP would manage aspects pertaining to failures of the Lunar Module, etc etc). We will also have a working GROUND crew to assist them. We will even performing training as possible. This will be a LONG duration mission within RSS, so astronauts and Ground Crew can go afk at listed times. The mission will be done on a 1:1 time scale meaning no warp will be used. This will be done over the span of several days.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EAs it stands, I need FLIGHT crew to fill in the gap in the role! The Capcom will be selected at a later date from the backup Flight crew. It is also desirable to have someone record/livestream the mission as it happens, that person will be known as the PAO, or Public Affairs Officer. As the mission progresses, a Ground Control rotation will be able to be performed as needed. Alt tabbing (going afk) for the astronaut or Ground Control crew will be permitted during certain durations. \u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv style=\u0022text-align:center;\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022trcM61S.png?1\u0022 src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/trcM61S.png?1\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EProgram Patch By: \u003C/strong\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/91405-adsii1970\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003Eadsii1970\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nTo be able to become part of the Mission Crew (MC), as a Commander (CDR), Command Module Pilot (CMP), and Lunar Module Pilot (LMP), you must participate in early developments of this project (help and actively participate) and also fill the role specific needs.
