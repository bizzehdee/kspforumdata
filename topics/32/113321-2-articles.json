At first I was convinced that my Kerbal would die in the cold void of space and started thinking of ways to at least recover the science. Then I remembered this [launch window calculator](http://alexmoon.github.io/ksp/) that allows you to select trajectories based on time, and I started looking for the fastest one that I could take with my limited fuel supply. After some clicking around, it gave me one that would leave me with about 10 days of breathing room but would require most of my delta-v.\n\nHere\u0027s a screenshot during the burn (compare the maneuver node delta-v with my total delta-v in the bottom left corner):\n\n![CwKhXwq.png](http://i.imgur.com/CwKhXwq.png)\n\nHere\u0027s a screenshot after the burn.

Always remember, most engines have alternators. A very low throttle, and your batteries begin charging.

The cockpit can survive some 80m/s impact, not sure about the cabin but 50m/s is reasonable.\n\n(OTOH the joints between them are miserable; I managed to land a craft consisting of an engine, a small fuel tank, a cargo bay (with probe core) and some nose cone, on Minmus, setting it gently on the engine.
