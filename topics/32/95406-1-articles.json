The exception to this, obviously, is the most recent 0.25-\u0026gt;0.90 upgrade where I\u0027m remaking my designs. The thing is, a remake is a good excuse to make design upgrades you wouldn\u0027t have bothered with before. For one thing, I went from using Kethane in 0.25 to using Karbonite in 0.90, so many of my designs need fundamental changes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also helps that I don\u0027t use Steam for KSP. I can have 0.25 and 0.90 open side-by-side, which makes it much easier to remake my old designs if that\u0027s what I want.
