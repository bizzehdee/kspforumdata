It was a monokote covered balsawood airplane with some decent avionics inside built to be a trainer for people who would fly the Ikhana (predator) later:\n\n![596524main_droid_1_672.jpg](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/images/content/596524main_droid_1_672.jpg)\n\nA distinguished Israeli engineer came up and proceeded to diss the airplane saying loudly that it was beneath NASA to use (said with almost a sneer) \u0022hobbyist\u0022 materials.
