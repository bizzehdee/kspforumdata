The basic idea is that the gameplay is improved, something was likely overpowered and a change was needed to make an overall improvement to gameplay (although \u0022improved\u0022 is subjective).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I\u0027m not a priori opposed to any changes that result in my craft not working anymore (although I will use it an excuse to .cfg file edit to get around a change, since this game has much more persistance than starcraft games, for example).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t mind too much that this craft no longer works:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xlp1/v/t1.0-9/12042998_10103920539299643_7804082981841770667_n.jpg?oh=0cf6758715b027a89c6f324d4e4578bf\u0026amp;oe=56AF0ECD\u0022 alt=\u002212042998_10103920539299643_7804082981841770667_n.jpg?oh=0cf6758715b027a89c6f324d4e4578bf\u0026amp;oe=56AF0ECD\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/kuZeQIo.png\u0022 alt=\u0022kuZeQIo.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs you can see... even in 1.04, the rear wings were approaching the limit of their heat tolerance... I\u0027ve concluded that there is simply no way to get this craft back down from orbit in 1.05 now... those 1200K tolerance wings will not survive reentry, not even with a large etroburn bringing my speed below 1,600 m/s, not with as shallow of a rentry as I can possibly do... they just won\u0027t survive kerbin reentry (I .cfg file edited it back to KSC, and have retired the design).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFine, I will adapt, and use parts intended for spaceplanes, with 2400K heat tolerance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EReentry heating is more relevant for gameplay, I consider this a gameplay change, and possibly for the better... the FAT-455 wings have a role that overlaps with the goliath now I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/wrNkvOF.png\u0022 alt=\u0022wrNkvOF.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/FOfPjuO.png\u0022 alt=\u0022FOfPjuO.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy design can now deal with much higher temperatures -still need to test reentry, but the lowest heat tolerance is now 2000 instead of 1200 - it should work now\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe buoyance changes, and new aero parts:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI love them!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPeople may say that it loses focus on space... but one of the \u0022space\u0022 challenges I\u0027ve had before is the challenge of how to get something to another planet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGetting this to duna was quite a challenge... how does one space that? no free atachment node, and lots of aerodynamic surface to screw up a rocket launch...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://scontent-frt3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/11535865_10103666692595473_6263945086339643445_n.jpg?oh=34f059edc4e1aa1c3f2706b0f4e0ece0\u0026amp;oe=56B524C7\u0022 alt=\u002211535865_10103666692595473_6263945086339643445_n.jpg?oh=34f059edc4e1aa1c3f2706b0f4e0ece0\u0026amp;oe=56B524C7\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I\u0027ve got little Juno spaceplanes to space, which should be fun on laythe,\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/E5ktWT7.png\u0022 alt=\u0022E5ktWT7.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m working on sub designs... for laythe... those will surely be a challenge to space... and sub designs for Eve? probably going to have to use a 3.75m heat shield and a fairing to get them to even survive rentry... a huge spaceing challenge... awesome...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003Ebut my biggest complaint: the ISRU changes.....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot the addition of small ISRU with heating and concentration drawbacks... but the heating changes to the big drills and ISRU.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhy?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhat purpose does this serve?
