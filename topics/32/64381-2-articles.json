If a game, or game genre, becomes too main stream stream it starts losing that thing that made it special, and bigger companies will flood the market with dumbed down versions of the original.

Even with some of the issues it has currently I have enjoyed this game more than some bigger games I have recently play, and those bigger games are usually released with many issues or missing content that has to be released or fixed later.

IMHO, it\u0027s more a toy than a game per se. It has just enough realism in it to set the tone, from which players are free to role-play or add mods to customize their sense of reality. And then the players are free to devise whatever contraptions they can imagine, using stock or mod parts, and do whatever jobs they can think up. All very good, all very fun.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut OTOH, KSP\u0027s biggest failing is that the above freedom has hidden and severe limits. First, even with mods, there\u0027s really not much you can actually DO in KSP. You can go somewhere and come back. Maybe slurp up some Kethane or other mod-based resource on the way, but that\u0027s about it. But that\u0027s OK because really there\u0027s not much else to real life, either. The real downer is the rather low limit on the number of such things you can have going on at once.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKSP is at the bottom line a rocket-breeder. You can just keep making stuff and sending it to space, so you might think, if you keep at it long enough. you could eventually build a huge space presence with sprawling colonies on every planet all connected by a functioning trade network. Sadly, no. Put too much stuff in any 1 place and you start getting laggy. Put too much stuff in space, no matter how widely spread, and the game starts getting unstable. And even at the smaller scale the game allows, you have to micromanage everything or nothing gets done. So there it is. You have the infinite void of space in front of you but are not allowed to come close to filling even a corner of it. I find this frustrating.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo I agree with those who say that KSP needs to offer more to experienced players. And I think the best way to do this is to change the game engine or something that greatly raises the limit on how much stuff you can have going. Without this, adding new planets just increases the amount of space you can\u0027t fill.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Arran","CreatedById":64656,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-02-27T15:17:11Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Mipi\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Mipi\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EIt amazes me that many people welcome the fact that KSP is \u0022only\u0022 at 0.23.
