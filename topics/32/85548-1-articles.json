Broadcast distance from other space fairing objects to eliminate risk of space debris collision, Specifically to have a range of 100 miles to let the \u0022Receiver\u0022 now when something is in range . \u0022A sort of way to start plotting orbiting objects so we don\u0027t have to wonder where they are, at least to insure that our little satellite doesn\u0027t eventually become a risk to anything else that might go or up or down\u0022. and B.)
