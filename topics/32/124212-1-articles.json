I plan to not bring a rover. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Now the mission has a \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138221-Boreas-1-Minmushttp://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/138221-Boreas-1-Minmus\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethread\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-11-02T23:33:04Z\u0022 title=\u002211/02/2015 11:33  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ENovember 2, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Findthepin1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"RocketPilot573","CreatedById":62803,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-03T01:36:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGotta go fast!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/D2Qo0wc.png\u0022 alt=\u0022D2Qo0wc.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
