I have couple ships in Kerbin orbit waiting to be shot towards, Duna, Eve and Joolian system. But they are mostly probes, as I never yet been outside Kerbin and it\u0027s moons. I\u0027d like to see how my present design are doing in interplanetary journey before attempting crewed missions. And I wonder how long would I have to wait for next launch window? If for example after arriving at Jool I find that I don\u0027t have enough fuel for return trip I will send tanker, but if waiting for correct planet alignment will take years poor Kerbals will be bored to death so far from home...\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Guest","CreatedById":-1,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T14:17:15Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is indispensable: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EInteractive illustrated interplanetary guide and calculator for KSP\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Gniuz","CreatedById":57846,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T14:20:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThere is a calculator that a lot of people use here is a link: \u003Ca href=\u0022http://ksp.olex.biz/\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ehttp://ksp.olex.biz/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI remember Duna is at about 42 degrees from videos I have watched.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noticeably FAT","CreatedById":43401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-29T14:25:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI had a thread asking pretty much the same question, and there is a pretty simple equasion to figure out when your next launch window will be.
