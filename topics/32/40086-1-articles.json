They have a lot more details in comparison to the old buildings, and even feature stairwells and working ladders! After landing on top of the new VAB, I discovered I could climb from the ground to the top of the roof using the various ladders and stairwells. The ladders work just like the ladders you can add on your rockets, and the stairs work like, well, stairs\u00C3\u00A2\u00E2\u201A\u00AC\u00C2\u00A6 As I haven\u0027t found a thread dedicated to the climbing of the VAB and maybe even other buildings at the KSC, I made this thread, to offer guides on how to climb the buildings. I would however recommend you to discover these routes without looking at the guides, because it\u0027s quite fun to try. I will make a section with which buildings have been confirmed climbable, it might be a good idea to look at that before you spend hours trying to climb something, and IMGUR albums giving step by step explanations on how to climb them. If you have climbed a building that isn\u0027t in the guide yet, post which building it was, and i will try to climb it and make a guide about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan style=\u0022font-size:10px;\u0022\u003ELOW-GRADE SPOILER!
