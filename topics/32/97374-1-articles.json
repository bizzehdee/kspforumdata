So if you landed 100t on a planet, and 20t made it back into orbit, the answer would be 20t.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDoesn\u0027t this vary a lot based on the planet chosen? A lot of the responses so far are not comparable since they are all different planets.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI had a ~1060t lander on Eve that put about 7-8t of payload in orbit there.
