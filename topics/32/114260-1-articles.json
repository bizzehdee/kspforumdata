The French were still \u0022organized\u0022 along the old gaggle of nobles system. The English hit upon the revolutionary concept of organizing their entire force as a unit to fight together. The terrain, weather and other factors helped the English, but the main factor in their victory was the organization that enabled them to fire massive, synchronized volleys of arrows to plunge down upon the French, slaughtering their horses and anyone in the fight without good armor. While the French knights struggled with the gooey mud clinging to their armor, they got to watch as thousands died around them. The English side lost barely over 100 men, the French up to 10,000.

One makes somewhat nicer looking designs. What they\u0027ve done is traced back variations of a large number of surnames, some of which have had their spelling altered many times as people moved around the world, and if some ancestor way back had a genuine blazon, the software authors have applied that to all variations of that surname.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere is an actual College of Heraldry and College of Arms to which one can apply for your own design.
