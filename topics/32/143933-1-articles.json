So we\u0027re ending up with an issue where now and in the future, for all new bugs, no one except Squad or FT staff will be able to help console players (whereas pretty much anyone with decent experience on PC can help anyone having an issue) which will in turn will probably cause some problem in the way bugs are handled and fixed: a large part of reported bugs on PC are already known and the community helps a lot by filtering these bugs and therefore allowing Squad staff to focus on actual new bugs that no one can solve (some bugs might actually be worked around,\u00A0or even\u00A0completely solved, by the community, I\u0027m thinking about Claw\u0027s Stock Bug Fix Modules before he was hired by Squad and Slashy\u0027s help with wheels after 1.1). On console all the workload will go directly to Squad and FT with no help from the community available.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor console, even the most experienced KSP players and modders have no idea how different the game is from the PC version and some bugs that are known and can be fixed on PC might become a complete mystery on a console version (not even talking about the differences between the different console versions). So Squad and/or FT (whoever is\u00A0handling bugs on console) will have a huge debugging work to do, maybe even greater than what is currently done on PC considering that console ports have chances to be at least as bugged as the PC releases.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, I don\u0027t claim to have a solution to this: I actually have no sensible idea on how to solve it (I don\u0027t believe releasing the console code in open source is sensible \u003Cimg alt=\u0022:P\u0022 data-emoticon=\u0022\u0022 src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_tongue.gif\u0022 title=\u0022:P\u0022\u003E); but I believe a discussion can be made on this and some solutions might possibly arise throughout.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHaving an official and \u003Cem\u003Eactive \u003C/em\u003EFlying Tiger representative on the forums will probably become necessary to address these kind of issues, or to bring new elements in that kind of debate.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Violent Jeb","CreatedById":130681,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-17T00:03:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\n[redacted, done]\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222016-08-16T14:35:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/16/2016 02:35  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00227 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 16, 2016\u003C/time\u003E by Violent Jeb\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Majorjim!","CreatedById":61954,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-21T00:37:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou mean in the dev notes?
