On the other hand, the military was and still is a major source of funding for air and space exploration. Many cool designs to make replicas and draw inspiration from have military roots and it\u0027s very satisfying to build military designs that work like the real thing. For me, I enjoy the challenge of making missiles out of stock parts, but others might appreciate some small parts more suited for this.\n\nIt might be cool to see a mass driver or planetary impact science part in stock that shoots slugs of ore, maybe.

No, I am  not advocating dismantling of the military for obvious reasons, but how much more of the global resources dumped into the military could benefit general society through the development of a global space program with each nation contributing SOMETHING to it.\n\nThe problem is that many people fail to understand the basics of human nature, yet want to condemn humankind for doing what has been done for hundreds of thousands of years:\n\n- Yes, there are weapons today that early humans did not have; however, just as in modern times, those tribes that were advanced possessed weapons of great power compared to those that weren\u0027t so advanced. A flint arrow-point is great if the other tribe doesn\u0027t have archery - but an iron arrow point is much more lethal than a flint one... To possess better weapons than your enemies has always been a basic quest of humankind.\n- There is security in having weapons. A good illustration of this is the movie Star Trek: Final Frontier. On the the \u0022planet of galactic peace\u0022 the movie begins with a scene with a man who has fashioned a high-powered air rifle that shoots pebbles - which while not as powerful as a phaser, it is just as lethal. Why did this being have one? It provided him a sense of security.\n\nThen there is a second question that must be addressed - should space vehicles be armed? This answer is a resounding YES, but for numerous reasons:\n\n- It is also human nature to assume danger is near in any sort of unfamiliar situation encountered. This is why I believe there will eventually be deep space human craft that will have some sort of armament. Not because there is a hope for a galactic war, but for the sense of security that it would provide for the crew. Let\u0027s face it, no one likes to be caught off guard.\n- It is also for appearances - imagine the horror on Earth that would happen if an unarmed space craft was journeying out of our solar system and was attacked - it could be ugly for the space program because 1) the crew didn\u0027t have any means to defend themselves, or 2) those who would claim this shows the Earth is not ready for deep space exploration...\n- Spacecraft are expensive and to reduce the liability of loss, manned spacecraft that venture into deep space should be armed. This simply makes sense. Even cruise ships carry light weapons \u0022just in case\u0022 with crew that are trained in their use.\n\nNow that I\u0027ve shared an introduction of the psychology of weapons and space weaponization, I do lightly arm my deep space craft but not for the \u0022desire\u0022 to create battles, etc. I do it for the reasons stated above when understanding human psychology. For any intelligent space-faring race, it would be a little off for them to undergo the expense of crew training, building of a spacecraft for deep space exploration, and not arm it, even if it was only lightly armed."},{"CreatedByName":"BloodDusk","CreatedById":157381,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-01-28T15:02:24Z","Content":"Since when we stopped using weapons in KSP?
