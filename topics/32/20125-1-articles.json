I will detail the flight path:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDuring the ascent, I remained straight until about 10 km. At that point, I tipped about 15 degrees toward the horizon and locked the ASAS. No issues yet. At about 15 km, and 173 m/s, the outer boosters run out of fuel, and I cut them loose. At this point, the roll begins, rapidly accelerating. This is with the fins locked at full deflection in the direction to counter the roll, and RCS active on the lander stage above. A total of 18 fins are ineffective, as is the full gimbal of the engines. I kill ASAS, and the roll accelerates more. Reactivating the ASAS make no difference. I shut down all thrust, stage repeatedly until I am on the Kerbin Return stage, and burn just long enought to clear the mess of spent stages beneath me, and then shut dow the engines, seperate the capsule, and deploy my parachute. End of flight is in the ocean off the KSC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe attached ship is slightly modified from the shown rocket, as it has some more struts, and I removed the fins from the NTR stage.
