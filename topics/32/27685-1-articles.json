Just exploring, orbiting, mapmaking... the pre-works for following manned (kerbaled?) missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the idea was to put four probes around the four moons with fuel to spare to get a good look at the big boy. Named after the god of handkerchieves, the ability to drink more than you can handle and nights WITHOUT white satins....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFirst part was easy: Put a carrier into orbit that can do that.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere it is: The DSV \u0022Dum Vivimus Vivamus\u0022!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screenshot151.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot151.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EStill on the launchpad. Pretty heavy as it is, so the six boosterpacks were needed. It still needs to be refueled in orbit since it burns part of its actual \u0022travel\u0022 fuel while lifting, as you can see here.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screenshot171.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot171.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEach probe is equipped with the usual instruments, plus an ISA-mapper and a kethane mapper. As for fuel each has a nuclear engine that packs quite a bit of delta-V and an iondrive with even more delta-V. Well... a bit overpowered concerning delta-V, but what the hell... those babies (DSP \u0022Lazarus\u0022 A, B, C and D) can each explore the Kerbol system on its own.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screenshot181.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot181.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere, it still has it\u0027s orbital engine attached. It will be jettisoned after docking on the \u0022Dum Vivimus\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDocking there is pretty narrow. The accessory fueltanks for the nuclear engine only fit in past the stabilizing struts if turned the right way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screenshot190.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot190.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screenshot202.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot202.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAfter docking all the probes and refuelling, the orbital modules and engines are jettisoned, the aiding OT \u0022Mule\u0022 is waved good bye and we are ready to go!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screenshot223.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot223.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd here it is, in all its beauty, ready to go and laggy as hell!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://hirnstroeme.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screenshot227.png\u0022 alt=\u0022screenshot227.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI will tell you more how the mission went when the window to Jool arrives.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"satcharna","CreatedById":61549,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T06:02:00Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThat is a beautiful vehicle.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-20T06:10:49Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI agree.
