My first achievement was putting a satellite on the orbit around kerbin after that I managed to design and my own probe and rocket and fly it to the Mun and after that to Minmus where i left it in orbit (took me quite a few tries and amusing failures caused by bad staging forgetting to decelerate time etc.).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECurrently i am trying to put a Kerman on the moon and it is proving to be a quite difficult task. Almost did it yesterday but again i failed to decelerate the time and smashed the rocket into the Mun. The rocket I am using to launch the missions is pretty unreasonable as well. It is like 30th iteration on the design which i started just to see if it will fly (many explosions and dead Kermen happened before this). Not the most efficient design but fun to look at during launch.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/846954195589035764/C4355F8EA628C9C2DBFA349F2BD7DE2A771FE6D8/\u0022 alt=\u0022C4355F8EA628C9C2DBFA349F2BD7DE2A771FE6D8\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also build a space plane that can fly almost 2/3 around the Kerbin before it runs out of fuel. I have still some problems with it though, like for example fuel is not pumped equally out of both sides (plane has separate fuel tanks for left and right side). For some reason when right engine run out of fuel there were still 50 units on the left side. I guess i will just connect both fuel systems that should solve the problem. Also i cannot figure out how to make the jet engine run above 20 km as they will always flame out at that altitude sending the aircraft into a deadly flat spin because one engine always works a split second longer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOverall this must be the best game ever made infinite replay value, always challenging and hilarious, also Kermans are super cute I love the faces they make during the flights..\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Vanamonde","CreatedById":27914,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T02:05:43Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to the party. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T02:42:18Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIndeed, I hope you\u0027re having fun exploding rockets and flying places! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"ZedNova","CreatedById":57175,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-24T03:10:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYeah, the highest you can go is around 20KM, unless you glitch a ton of intakes into one another.
