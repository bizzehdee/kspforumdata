I am thinking, more part count can result in overall less reliability. So when you start up you can fly rockets without an engineer but later on you can\u0027t just do a super jool-5 mission without one.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat would be an interesting limitation... more part counts is more complexity is more things that could go wrong.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn 0.25, the only time I would break things is if a fairing crashed into the solar panels during ascent. Most failures are the sort of thing where you end up with catastrophic failure and lose the entire vessel.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUltimately, I think they need something like Dang It and tracking how many times a particular part has flown. For rockets, it would mostly impact SRBs and booster stages which get recovered and recycled. But for space planes, it might hit them pretty hard due to the constant launch/relaunch count. So maybe space plane engines have a much higher MTBF rating then rocket engines.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESome rocket engines are designed to be started once, then never restarted. So the idea that each start-up cycle adds wear and tear on the engine would have merit.
