I was around 13 minutes into the flight and halfway around Kerbin when I hit 2.2 km/s and the camera switched to orbital. I looked at the map and my apoapsis was 84 Km and my periapsis was 27 Km I got a couple screenshots of the plane and the map. It\u0027s not even an intake spam plane.

Your orbit will always contain the point where you stopped your final burn. Unless you\u0027re using a RAPIER that will be in the atmosphere, so it can never by a sustainable orbit.
