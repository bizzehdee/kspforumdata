Center of mass was way too far backwards once fuel levels were low? No prob, I made the capsule heavier. Trouble with initial lift? No prob, added front wings. Need more power for the orbital injection? Kept sticking on engines. And so on. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI recall this problem when I started building rockets way back also. Of course I am far better with them now. But planes, now, they seem to scream for extra bits.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere is my submission of shame for this syndrome. Am I alone?

Rockets aren\u0027t so bad because it\u0027s almost just a case of inching towards 4.5km/s dV whilst maintaining a decent TWR, but with spaceplanes, particularly any built to reach orbit (SSTO or not) there\u0027s more to consider. More engines will get you there faster, but make the craft heavier and usually mess with the carefully aligned CoM and CoL, adding more control surfaces and wings for lift and control makes it easier to get higher and be more maneuverable but that also messes with the balance of the craft unless you\u0027re really careful.
