Rather, I might have one or two ideas about interesting and complex mission crafts I\u0027d like to build, but honestly I rarely even get to the point of building them because of a lack of funds or the perfect part being out of reach in a top-tier tech in a branch that I haven\u0027t pursued. Often, I get tired of grinding to reach those techs or funds before I get to the attempt, which is sad.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, I wonder if other people experience the same thing, or if they are more single-minded in their approach to a career, i.e. you have a goal in mind when you start, you only tech towards the parts you need?
