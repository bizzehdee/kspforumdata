Then I figured I\u0027d launch another one and land next to it just to show off my awesome precision landing skills to myself, at which point I discovered, about 2.5 kilometers above Minmus in a steep dive trajectory, what \u0022Radiation Safety\u0022 on the DT-Vista engine actually meant. Rather than firing the engine back up and dooming the kerbals below to radiation poisoning, I decided to do my best (not much) to slow down with RCS and see if I could ride out the crash.
