This places the air pressure equivalent to that which is found at about a 7,000 foot altitude on Earth. This is well below the 8,000 foot altitude where the first, relatively small, symptoms of altitude sickness begin, and is well below the altitude where HAPE becomes a concern. In fact, most airliners are pressurized to 7,000 feet, so any base on Laythe that was around sea level would expose its occupants to an air pressure similar to that experienced on a jetliner. In short, Laythe\u0027s atmosphere is dense enough that Kerbonauts at a sea-level base would be perfectly able to breathe -- the only negative effects would be a slightly lower endurance due to the thinner air, which would itself be offset by Laythe\u0027s lower gravity (55% of Kerbin\u0027s) making exertion less difficult.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELaythe also has liquid seas. These seas apparently have some ionic compound in them, but it would appear that any base with desalination equipment would have access to a huge supply of fresh water. Furthermore, the water is in a liquid state, making it much easier to access than if it was frozen.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause of Jool and the other moons around Laythe, as well as Laythe\u0027s relatively thick atmosphere, asteroid impacts would be a relatively small concern, as any incoming asteroids or comets would most likely impact one of the other Joolian bodies, much as the moon currently protects Earth from asteroid impacts. Also, it appears that Laythe is far enough from Jool so that it would not be ripped apart by the planet\u0027s gravity, nor would it experience massive vulcanism.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe only difficulties that would be found with supporting life on Laythe, it appears, would be the temperature and solar radiance, both of which would be lower due to Laythe\u0027s distance from Kerbol. Purely for roleplaying purposes, does anyone know exactly how hospitable Laythe would be for supporting life, and how much the lower temperature and solar radiance would affect photosynthesis?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Geschosskopf","CreatedById":69507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T20:22:19Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Jool has anything like the magnetic field that our Jupiter has, then I doubt life as we know it could exist anywhere near the surface.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"DChurchill","CreatedById":60282,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-07-03T20:22:36Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EDunno for how much longer.

And if so, is it as powerful as gigantic Jupiter\u0027s, or is it much less powerful like our other Jovian planets? Or even less powerful, as befits its size? Also, unlike the Galilean moons around Jupiter, Laythe has a substantial atmosphere that would block some of the radiation from reaching the surface.
