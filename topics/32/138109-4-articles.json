I mucked with the angles of incidence for horizontal stabilizers and wings to adjust the CL so it\u0027s halfway between the center of the CM marker and its edge. I\u0027ve usually found that to be pretty well behaved on takeoff; I don\u0027t have to rotate super hard to get up and flying. The center of thrust is at the same height and through the CM. I might mess with the engines later for looks, but it\u0027s fine.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo testing the gear placement. What I did was move the gear up and down the fuselage by very small increments and then nudged the nose gear up and down to match. At any reasonable point below halfway (that would be where the word \u0022flammable\u0022 is on the fuel tank fuselage), the aircraft becomes unstable on takeoff, exhibiting that roll oscillating moment. I found that the on snap-to locations (pressing C) I could adjust at what speed the oscillations begin. One notch down exhibited unstable oscillations at 40\u002B m/s, two notches down occurred at 30\u002B notches. Each time I rotate the gear so that they were properly vertical and met the ground flush. No canting in or out like a low-rider. The only time the plane became stable was with the gear mounted directly to the side, no rotations. That makes it nearly impossible to rotate the plane on takeoff; the tail will drag and crash the plane.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nOne thought I had was to take the position of the gear where it\u0027s unstable at 40\u002B knots and attach it to the cubic octagonal strut like this:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cimg alt=\u0022extended%20gear.png\u0022 class=\u0022ipsImage\u0022 src=\u0022http://i66.photobucket.com/albums/h251/SirBedwyr/extended%20gear.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nWell guess what? It was reasonably stable through the takeoff roll. Again, in the picture dead sideways is level with that flammable label. So it appears that the instability is purely a function of gear width. The gear need to be located at least at a width normally seen at the sideways attach point. Using the cube strut is an ok fudge for testing, but not for a normal career mode playthrough. If the gear need to be attached at the sides, they also need to keep that fuselage high enough not to have a tail strike on rotation.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nLayperson\u0027s recommendation: Increase the size and the stiffness of the L01 gear so that it gives better ground clearance when attached to a 1.5m fuselage at the sides and might remain stable at some reasonable location just below the sides. Adjust size and stiffness of the nose gear so that a normally designed airplane at early career mode playthroughs will rest with the fuselage perfectly level.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEdit: sorry for the second picture size.

Replace the swept wings with Wing Connector E with control surfaces and you get \u0022normal\u0022 control surface behaviours (they point upwards when S is used to climb). Turn on the aerodynamic indicators to see - the force indicator arrows act in the opposite direction for each wing type.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCombining the two changes and you get a plane that gets off the runway with no issues.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think in Alshain\u0027s test plane the combination of both the LY-01 and the swept wings is causing the problems.

That means that any damping in the suspension would result in a deformation of the craft, creating a momentum that makes the airplane dip down in the opposite side of the COM. Auto struts were applied in 1.1.1, yet imo that should only partially solve the problem. The fact remains that the resulting momentum was/is stronger than the initial momentum, creating dynamic instability. (I should test more to see what is and what was).

The conclusions that I read seems to imply that the problem is in how Unity integrates the wheels. \u00A0This is coupled with the fact that U5 doesn\u0027t treat wheels as wheels, it treats them as a line pointing straight down from the center of the axle to the ground. \u00A0So as long as the bottom of your wheel touches a hard surface, you\u0027re fine; but if your wheels become angled, or if you encounter sudden terrain, you\u0027re screwed. \u00A0Think of it as a rolling donut 1m tall - the only part of the donut that counts is the part that exists in a straight line from the center of the mass to the bottom of the donut. \u00A0If the donut encounters a 0.25m tall cube, it doesn\u0027t climb the cube, it overlaps it until the line touches it, and rather than a gradual increase as you\u0027d see in a real wheel, what you get instead is a momentary jump from 0 to 0.25m. \u00A0The physics engine then creates a force change to compensate, and your wheel blasts off. \u00A0This is why we\u0027re getting dancing and other phantom forces... Unity doesn\u0027t handle modular parts well, because the assumption is that wheels will be a fixed part of an asset, not added at runtime in all manner of helter-skelter configurations. \u00A0So if your wheels aren\u0027t pointing straight down at the hard surface they\u0027re sitting on, the physics engine reads it as a collisions and applies force to compensate. \u00A0It also explains why people have issues with the fixed nose wheel - if the three parts of your tricycle gear aren\u0027t perfectly perpendicular to the runway, one or more of them will generate phantom forces as Unity detects constant collisions with the uneven surface it sees. \u00A0So if your aircraft starts with a slight nose-down or nose up cant to it, and you haven\u0027t compensated by leveling the wheels, you\u0027re either going to bounce like mad or lose steering ability. \u00A0This is also going to be a problem with landing - if you don\u0027t make a perfect 3-point landing with the wheel lines perpendicular to the runway, Unity is going to see those offset collisions and apply forces to compensate, probable upward and forward, which explains the bouncy landings people are posting all over youtube.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0So the problem is threefold:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. PhysX changed how wheels work\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Unity doesn\u0027t implement it well\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n3. KSP uses\u00A0Unity\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo amount of settings changes or .cfg tweaks are going to fix it, kids. This isn\u0027t something you can design around.\u00A0\u00A0Until Unity figures out how to make Physx wheels work, or KSP decides to use a different, less problematic engine, this is what we\u0027re stuck with. \u00A0KSP will forever be a game that almost works because the engine itself is the problem, not KSP. \u00A0KSP is brilliant, but it\u0027s just held back by the Unity-PhysX problem.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u0027Fraid KSP is going on the shelf for me for a while until they get this sorted, I\u0027m not spending my free time being frustrated by a game that continues to be broken at its core. \u00A0I get that the devs have done a lot of work to get to this point, and I\u0027ve had a lot of fun with it until now, but the bottom line is that you spent a lot of time building a project that was doomed to never work right due to the tools you built it in. \u00A0It\u0027s not their fault, really, that Unity handles\u00A0wheels so poorly, but unless they\u0027re willing to invest more work to port the game to an appropriate engine, it seems this is the best we\u0027re going to get. \u00A0I understand their reluctance to do so, and I don\u0027t blame them, but the only probably outcome is that we bought a game that turned out to be a lemon, and the devs really aren\u0027t to blame for it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere is a petition on the Unity forums to get the Unity developers to enable a legacy compatibility mode so that U5 can use older versions of PhysX... seems to me that\u0027s probably the best solution at this point. \u00A0So if you want to see this work, that\u0027s probably where the community needs to focus its energy right now - getting Unity to make their product work. \u00A0In the meantime, KSP devs, thank you for all you\u0027ve done, and I really hope it works out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"smjjames","CreatedById":134004,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-04-30T17:08:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe devs are trying their best to make the wheels work as best as they can.
