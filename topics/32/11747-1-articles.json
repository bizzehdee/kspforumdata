Needless to say, the launch went nominally on the first try and ended up as a great little KSP demo and cinematic.\n\nObviously it has been chopped up and cut very much, as getting into orbit without warp or video editing takes about 12 minutes.\n\nThis video is more short and sweet at under two minutes. And of course, as all of my KSP videos are, it is in High-Definition. The best KSP videos are the ones where you can see what\\\u0027s happening.\n\nThe C/SM will orbit Kerbin for the next twelve days to test its reliability for long term stays in space during later missions to Minmus in this spacecraft. After which, it will retrofire and return home. I believe I will film that and upload it!\n\n[Kerbal Space Program: Orion Launch into Orbit with Ares I-X Demo Flight (HD!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYgN5ue3TqM#ws)"}]}
