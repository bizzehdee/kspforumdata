(I don\u0027t happen to be one of them, I came to KSP already knowing the mechanics of both from Orbiter 2010 and a dozen space games before it)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for my proudest moment? Probably the establishment of a full six satellite Com Relay network and mapping constellation over the Mun... from a single launch vehicle. The 1st stage was reminiscent of an Atlas V with a payload of two trinary sets of satellites, one with heavy Com Relay gear set to go into Munar equatorial orbit and the other with lighter relay gear and a full biome and altimetry mapping suite for going into polar orbit. The equatorial set was mounted to a tricoupler at the top of the 2nd stage, with a pylon up the middle of those three satellites to a 3rd stage with another tricoupler with the polar satellites mounted to it. After TMI (Trans Munar Injection) the 3rd stage separated and made a course correction burn to put it right over the north pole of the Mun, while the 2nd stage continued on a trajectory to enter equatorial orbit. When the 3rd stage reached the right altitude over the Mun, I retro-burned for a 2-3 synchronous orbit of my target orbit. Then quickly switched to the second stage and repeat, putting it in a 2-3 synchronous orbit over the equator. As soon as each reached apogee, they released their 1st satellites, which burned to circularize. Then, one orbit later, released the 2nd, and after the third orbit I released the last.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe icing on the cake was that after the satellites were placed around the Mun, I used the last of the \u2206V in the 2nd and 3rd stages to send them back to Kerbin, using a deployable heat shield and chutes to recover the entire launch vehicle, the 1st stage having been recovered after TMI...\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n...and I did it all without using a quicksave \u003Cem\u003Eonce\u003C/em\u003E. Three satellites in perfect equilateral triangle formation offset exactly one sixth of an orbit from three other satellites in a perfect equilateral triangle, 90\u00B0 off axis... all in one shot and with nothing wasted except fuel and a shroud. \u003Cstrong\u003EThat\u003C/strong\u003E was my proudest moment! (no pictures though... lost the whole thing with a HD crash \u003Cspan\u003E:^/\u003C/span\u003E )\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nEither that or the time, back in 1.0.5 when I re-created all of Project Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab using FASA parts playing in Science Mode. I even had a full roster of crew with specific Kerbals standing in for each of the real life astronauts. (Jeb was Sheppard, Elzer was Lovell, Hudfal was McDivitt, etc.) The only thing I \u003Cem\u003Edidn\u0027t\u003C/em\u003E replicate were the accidents (Apollo 1, Apollo 13, Skylab\u0027s damage, etc.) or the cut missions.
