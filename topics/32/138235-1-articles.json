Give your gear a slight inward camber, turn suspension off, and set friction to 0.0 for takeoff. This makes them quite useable, generally. You may have to up friction on landing so the brakes work better.

They lose their power at higher altitudes. In practice, during my flight to the arctic (One way, mind you, wouldn\u0027t have enough fuel to get back), I\u0027ve never surpassed 10km.

That way, the SAS will have an easier time maintaining pitch. You can then go AFK for about 3-5 minutes at a time and just correct the flight when you come back.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor the rudder, you can use the the tail fin or standard canard - those parts can have things attached to them.
