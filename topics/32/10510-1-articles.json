I\\\u0027m not sure if the pads on the end of the landing legs are actually solid objects, but I know at least it\\\u0027s not long or tight enough to firmly grip the smooth side of fuel tanks. The arms will prevent any lateral movement of the two ships but if there\\\u0027s movement long the length of the arms then the docking arms were unable to prevent the two ships from separating.\n\nNext step I plan to put some bumps on the outside of docking arms with struts to provide more traction for the claws. Let\\\u0027s see if that improves things. If things work out then a Munar Orbit Rendezvous mission profile for munshot may be possible."},{"CreatedByName":"Panichio","CreatedById":2858,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-12T17:10:24Z","Content":"Wow, great job!

So I ran a quick test on docking again with a test rocket.\n\n\u003E ![35jcyfk.jpg](http://i49.tinypic.com/35jcyfk.jpg)\n\nHere is my test ship. The aim is to grab the nearly spent rocket stage behind me with either set of legs.\n\nSo the idea here is to see how well I can dock with forward vs reverse landing legs. Immediately in VAB I noticed a difference - you can\\\u0027t get as tight of a grouping mounting legs backwards on fuel tanks or even decoupler as you can forwards. In the above picture you can see the difference. Notice how I was able to place the forward legs so far inside the decoupler that the pivot is almost flush against the decoupler wall, where as the rearward legs can only be attached onto the wall of the tank.\n\nThe rear legs are easy to test, I just have to keep the legs closed and stage. Unfortunately it turns out there\\\u0027s no grip at all on the rearward facing legs, the rocket stage immediately slips out. So it\\\u0027s onto the forward set.\n\n\u003E ![1z4zo6b.jpg](http://i50.tinypic.com/1z4zo6b.jpg)\n\nAfter reloading I flipped the spaceship around and inched my way inside the decoupler nose first.\n\n\u003E ![2ymgmz6.jpg](http://i47.tinypic.com/2ymgmz6.jpg)\n\nSuccess, the forward landing legs were able to firmly grip the decoupler. Wobbling the spacecraft around pivots the rocket stage in front of me without any loosening of the grip, looks like a pretty firm dock.\n\nI then turned SAS off and the ship started rolling like a top. Even turning SAS back on was barely able to bring the ship under control. I turned SAS off again and sure enough the rolling started again. Leaving the SAS off resulted in the ship rolling faster and faster until the forces involved violently tore both ships apart. \n\nIt seems like the spent rocket stage is somehow exerting a rolling force on my spaceship without any source of acceleration, physics engine bug? I don\\\u0027t recall this happening in my earlier test docking two crewed spaceships, maybe this only happens with debris?\n\nNext step I plan to put a large spaceship in orbit and then try to dock to its tail with a smaller spaceship to test stability. If docking is successful and there\\\u0027s no miraculous force trying to spin both ships I\\\u0027ll then try to do an orbital maneuver. If that\\\u0027s successful then I say we\\\u0027ve found a way for Apollo style Munar Orbit Rendezvous mission.\n\nTest ship is attached for those wanting to try for themselves."},{"CreatedByName":"Wyrm","CreatedById":25210,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-05-20T00:01:35Z","Content":"Cool beans!\n\nAnd yes, I did notice that dead weight ain\\\u0027t so dead.

Since I\u0027ve always been a docking advocate I got to see the development in this area first hand. Let\u0027s see what happened over the versions and how it mirrors real life:\n\nIn the beginning - there was no persistence or tracking station, so you\u0027re stuck with just the active flight you\u0027re running. The closet thing to rendezvous you could do in those bad old days where to just turn around the capsule after separation from the booster rocket and track the spent booster behind you. This is exactly what happened during NASA\u0027s Mercury program. The Mercury spacecraft was primitive and didn\u0027t have the ability to translate, only row pitch and yaw. So one of the thing that Mercury flights did was spin the spacecraft around and look at the booster behind it.\n\nVersion 0.11 - RCS system introduced to allow translation control, spacecraft control system greatly improved with the introduction of ASAS and orbital view. This mirrors the Gemini 3 flight with the introduction of a much improved spacecraft with both translation and rotation control, paving the way for fine manoeuvres on orbit\n\nVersion 0.14 - major break through with introduction of spacecraft persistence and tracking station, allowing multiple flights at once, thus first opening up the theoretical possibility of rendezvous. However there is very little experience with rendezvous in the community at that time and little guide available, so most players are in the dark as to how to do this. This mirror\u0027s the situation on Gemini 4 where the spacecraft attempted to rendezvous with its spent booster but failed because simply pointing the nose at the target and thrusting didn\u0027t work. Like KSP players around this time NASA staff have not worked out all the nuances of orbital mechanics yet.\n\nVersion 0.14.4 - when this thread was first posted. No technical improvement in the game but people have played with persistence long enough that the first rendezvous guide started showing up on youtube. Rendezvous was still very difficult because there was no select target or closest approach. And in any case where you get there there was no way to dock. Yours truly cut his teeth on rendezvous around this time and as you can see tried to come up with primitive ways to connect the spacecrafts. This mirrors the situation with the Gemini 6A and Gemini 7 rendezvous where two spacecrafts launched separately where able to meet up to as close as 30cm. However lack of docking port mean that Gemini 6A and Gemini 7 couldn\u0027t actually physically join as one craft.\n\nEven without working docking ports, the fact that I managed to briefly get two spacecrafts to grab each other fired my imagination and filled my head with ideas of propellant depots and tanker rockets and colossal interplanetary motherships:\n\n![34ovrja.jpg](http://i50.tinypic.com/34ovrja.jpg)\n\nVersion 0.17 - around this time the first docking mods became available. I remember back there the two were ORDA and warp claws, each with their strength and weaknesses. They didn\u0027t actually merge two crafts like modern docking, but rather the parts would pull on each other with massive force once they are close enough. Me, being Dr Rendezvous was busy promoting the possibilities opened up by docking and came up with a system that used both ORDA and warp claws at the same time on the same craft and performed the first big \u0022mothership style\u0022 interplanetary mission with my Duna/Ike double landing and return:\n\n![2hzh4oz.jpg](http://i50.tinypic.com/2hzh4oz.jpg)\n\nThis mirrors Gemini 10, where primitive docking ports where first introduced and used to dock Gemini 10 with an Agena Target Vehicle. Test shows that it\u0027s possible to use engines on one spacecraft to boost the combination to other orbits. Thereby paving the way for Apollo\u0027s lunar orbit rendezvous mission plan.\n\nVersion 0.18 - stock docking, much joy all around from the community. Stock docking turns out to be much more reliable than the mods and all the rage at the time was Apollo-style lunar landing mission. I was also caught up and shared one such craft:\n\n![2d6tnqp.jpg](http://i41.tinypic.com/2d6tnqp.jpg)\n\nThis mirrors the Apollo fights, where docking became mature technology and allowed much more delta-V efficient mission profiles.\n\nVersion 0.19 - rovers where introduced, introducing theoretical possibility of docking on the surface of a body. At the time I was working on docking with multiple ports at once to allow heavy duty space construction which resulted in this:\n\n![screenshot361.jpg](http://103.imagebam.com/download/Hrl_snQoHS2ORunn_LapyQ/24990/249891975/screenshot361.jpg)\n\n[Orbital Propellant Depot Olympus II](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/showthread.php/24990-0-19-1-Orbital-Propellant-Depot-Olympus-II). Of course this then become obsolete with the release of large docking port in 0.20. But I wasn\u0027t too bothered since wide spread heavy docking meant the explosion of heavy construction in orbit.\n\nThis mirrors the development of modular space stations such as Mir and ISS.\n\nVersion 0.21 - After a long break I came back to KSP to continue to work on the modular surface base idea. All the tricks have been worked out and it\u0027s almost ready to be shared:\n\n![2vvsuj5.jpg](http://i44.tinypic.com/2vvsuj5.jpg)\n\nReal life space program haven\u0027t advanced to surface base construction yet ![;)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-13T12:14:36Z\u0022 title=\u002209/13/2013 12:14  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 13, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Temstar**"},{"CreatedByName":"LameLefty","CreatedById":57336,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-13T15:13:38Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E This mirrors Gemini 10, where primitive docking ports where first introduced and used to dock Gemini 10 with an Agena Target Vehicle.

The first docking was Gemini 8 to the Agena Target Vehicle (Neil Armstrong, commanding, and David Scott, pilot). There was a Gemini RCS malfunction almost immediately after docking and the mission had to be aborted after an uncontrollable roll developed.
