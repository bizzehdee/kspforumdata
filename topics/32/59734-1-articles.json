Every so often, if I got too comfortable or went too fast, the rover would careen and go flying end over end in the low gravity. Most of the time I would be able to right it by slamming one of my Kerbals into it at high speed with RCS. Other times I\u0027d reload the latest quicksave (which I did often). I also had to avoid craters like the plague, but every so often one would take me by surprise and I\u0027d go flying off the edge Dukes of Hazard style!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELike I said, my Kerbals eventually did get there in mostly one piece. I took some screenshots to commemorate the occasion, but the drive was so painful I decided there was no way in Hell I would drive back, so I loaded up the last save I did right before the drive and fast forwarded the clock by about twice the time the journey took.
