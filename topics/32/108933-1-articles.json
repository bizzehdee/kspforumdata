MY small satellites cost about 200k apiece.\n\nThe big problem with the tiny probes are that once you start stacking on \u0022essential\u0022 non-propulsion systems (like ore scanners and such) your efficiency will go WAY down on a probe that only masses 0.5 tons by itself. First, because each scanner masses 0.1 or 0.2 tons, and secondly because you need power generation and storage to handle those scanners\u0027 operation. Once you unlock ions, I found that the sweet spot for cost vs. capability was between 2 and 3 total tons.\n\nOne thing you might want to do is stick a small parachute on that probe. That way, you can use them for the \u0022return a craft from Mun/Minmus orbit to Kerbin\u0022 missions as well, and those things pay a tremendous amount for the effort (assuming it survives the reentry). With the new contracts, it becomes very easy to use a single launch to complete half a dozen or more individual contract requirements, as long as you design carefully.\n\nBut honestly, money hasn\u0027t been a problem for me even in my Hard career. I\u0027ve got small unmanned satellites around Kerbin, Mun, and Minmus containing a thermometer and an antenna, and I\u0027ve got tiny unmanned landers on Mun and Minmus with a similar setup (dropped off by manned landers, as they don\u0027t have any propulsion of their own). Every time a \u0022get science from X\u0022 mission comes up, I can complete them for no additional cost. I\u0027ve even got a pair (satellite\u002Blander) on the way to Duna right now, which\u0027ll make the money come in even more quickly. And instead of hiring kerbonauts, I\u0027ve got a fleet of tiny recovery vessels orbiting Kerbin\u0027s equator to rescue any stranded folks (which also pays nicely). So I haven\u0027t bothered with any of the satellite placement contracts."},{"CreatedByName":"Renegrade","CreatedById":96629,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-12T21:09:35Z","Content":"Dry mass is definitely a critical section of the rocket equation~\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Depend on payload, its very good for medium payloads, for heavy weight hid dV the LV-N rules, for tiny lander the 48-7S.\n\u003E The ant and the radial ant is not terible anymore, and is good on tiny probes, the oscar tank is also buffed.\n\nI haven\u0027t updated my own TWR/mass efficiency charts, and I don\u0027t think Tavert has either (but I haven\u0027t checked recently so...information may be dated) - but my gut feeling is that the 48-7S\u0027s niche is actually smaller than the ant\u0027s niche at this point.\n\n\u003E \n\u003E yeah, and even tho i haven\u0027t looked up the stats about it, i also \u0022feel\u0022 like the Poodle got buffed (indirectly maybe) ! i think its lighter and has a fairly ok TWR...

Yes, I made money with every contract, but it felt a bit grindy. I\u0027m playing a \u0022moderate\u0022 career mode, because it kind of makes me think about cost efficiency, even though I can progress in relatively few missions. I like the challenge of incrementally improving the cost of going to, say, Gilly and back, with a full science load for 230K (it turns out I could have eliminated the bottom stage, because I made it back with 1900m/s of delta-v). I just like having the measure and having it matter enough to act as a motivator.
