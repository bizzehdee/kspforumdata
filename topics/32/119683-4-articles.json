Right now the game is none of these things.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe 1.1 update will likely make a big difference on the stability side of things, but as of right now this is something that still needs work.

Many of the features are still half-baked and need quite a bit of work. Specifically, there needs to be an endgame, a goal to work towards in career. Right now the closest thing to that is unlocking the tech tree, but once you\u0027ve unlocked the tree there\u0027s really no further goals to pursue unless you make them up yourself.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said, here\u0027s a short list of features I would like to see added to the game to fit my vision of complete:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELife Support\u003C/strong\u003E (various mods)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERight now manned missions are OP, the additional weight is negligible but it dramatically increases the available science (plus infinite EVA fuel) and there is no penalty for stranding kerbals, especially with all the free ones that are handed out in rescue missions. The new antenna mechanics will penalize probes, further increasing the desirability of manned missions unless life support is implemented to balance things back out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKerbal Actions\u003C/strong\u003E (KAS/KIS)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs of right now, Kerbals are pretty limited in what they can do. They do a great job of pushing (and running into) things and can do limited repairs and gather a little science, but there is so much more they could do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBase Building\u003C/strong\u003E (MKS/OKS/Extraplanetary Launchpads)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEstablishing an extraplanetary colony has been proposed for decades (and has gained more attention recently with all the mars talk), this would be a natural extension for the game and would mesh well with many of the other features and provide a nice endgame goal for sandbox.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETime Based Science\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESince science can be done instantly, there is zero reason to stay anywhere for any length of time. I\u0027ve done too many missions where the lander touches down, the kerbals jump out and take samples, the science action groups are toggled, the kerbals retrieve/reset the necessary experiments, and I\u0027m off again to land in the next biome. Time based experiments would add a great dynamic where you have to plan out your experiments ahead of time (instead of just spamming all of them everywhere) due to limiting factors like life support/batteries/flyby trajectory. It would make satellites and surface bases (and rovers and aircraft) much more viable as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStory Mode for Career\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOne idea I\u0027ve liked (and seen mentioned repeatedly) for career mode would be a basic story revolving around anomalies and having to explore progressively farther from Kerbin to find new ones. The first one could be revealed on Kerbin once the first satellite is in orbit, at which point you would send an aircraft/ICBM to investigate, which could reveal one farther away on Kerbin, which leads to the Mun, and so forth to guide the player through the solar system. To keep things interesting, it would be great if the placement was randomized at the start of each career so you would have to actually search for them (using a scanner on a satellite) instead of just going to the coordinates on kerbal maps. Bonus points for awesome cutscenes of the likes of the update videos.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProcedural Solar System\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is a bit of a stretch feature, but it would be awesome if we could specify a seed on a new game that would randomize the solar system (planets, sizes, locations, atmospheres, etc).

The core gameplay of launching rockets is close to being done, but there\u0027s still some areas (like career) that really need to be fleshed out before the game is really feature complete (not to mention multiplayer). At that point a major balance and polish pass (likely multiple) will be needed, and maybe then the game would qualify as finished.

I remember time before we got nice airplane parts (there were only two control surfaces!), where orbit from Kerbin still took 4500 m/s through the souposphere, when parachutes could be deployed at 2000m/s, the Stayputnik had reaction wheels and the LV-909 still made a nice ascent engine for Duna. These weren\u0027t good, or bad, they just were. It WAS a different game in many regards, and I guarantee that by the time we get to version 1.75 or so it will look like yet another different game. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I\u0027m glad that I get to live through all these different games. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-08-31T15:07:23Z\u0022 title=\u002208/31/2015 03:07  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003EAugust 31, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by moogoob\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003Ephilosophy\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Nori","CreatedById":41334,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-08-31T17:38:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI said 80%.
