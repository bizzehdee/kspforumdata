It\u0027s still an extra $110 more than the 4 core CPU we picked earlier...I don\u0027t know if I can swing that AND get the 980 over the 970 like I want to do. Also, just so you know, our shopping carts differ a little. I want\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817438053\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0power supply, a G2 series, not GS.

Finally, I also want\u00A0\u003Ca href=\u0022http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487079\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003Ethis\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0GPU, the EVGA 980, for all the reasons we\u0027ve already talked about. I\u0027ve also got a keyboard, headphones, and thermal paste (not important\u00A0to include, but does affect price).\u00A0That\u0027s what\u0027s in my shopping cart that isn\u0027t in yours, and it brings the total to $1918 after tax and shipping costs. So I\u0027m basically already over budget; which is okay because it\u0027s only by ~$100, but I can\u0027t really spend anymore. I still have to have money for a cheap desk, computer chair, and a little wiggle room. My absolute total budget was $2200, which is why I want this system to cost ~$1800.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSorry for such a long post, I probably could of put more effort into keeping things shorter. TL;DR: I really want to stick with the GTX 980, and I just can\u0027t afford a 6 core CPU right now, nor do I think I would truly need one for quite some time. I suppose if I wanted, I could get a 970, or other AMD card, and then I could afford getting a 6 core CPU, but I don\u0027t want to make that trade-off. Like I said, I\u0027m more concerned with my GPU than my CPU; most things I plan on doing/playing are much more GPU intensive than CPU intensive.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nedit: forgot to also mention I\u0027d much rather stick with Skylake than go down to Haswell.

Yeah, an IPS is nice and has better colors and I can look at the monitor sideways (which is a feature I care absolutely nothing about), but it also is slower; it comes with a 4ms response time, and a 60Hz refresh rate. That is something I suspect I \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Enotice, even without the experience of 1ms/144Hz beforehand. I didn\u0027t realize earlier that I could afford a 1440p monitor, but that was because I was always searching for 1440p with a 144Hz refresh rate.

Also, from what I read, I\u0027d be a lot better of with a 27\u0022 if I was going 1440p.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like this is another trade-off situation, and personally, I don\u0027t think getting a 60Hz monitor just so I can experience 1440p is worth it. Again, I\u0027m not an expert...but from what I\u0027ve read and some of what Cam has said, I think I\u0027d have a much better experience getting a 24\u0022 1080p 144Hz monitor. I care more about response times than sideways viewing or a monitor that will stand the test of time because it\u0027s IPS. IPS is slower, and what you gain from it being slower does not seem important to me- just like how more CPU power at the cost of GPU power absolutely doesn\u0027t sound worth it for my preferences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo granted, I don\u0027t have current plans to play a ton of FPS or \u0027fast\u0027 action games, but the idea of being able to because I have a monitor that has fast pixel responses and refresh rates is great. The downside to TN monitors? It looks bad viewed from most angles that aren\u0027t straight on; and truly this makes absolutely no difference to me. I don\u0027t care about a 3 monitor setup. I mean no offense whatsoever and I always appreciate your time and help, but everything I\u0027m reading is basically pointing towards the kind of monitor I\u0027ve chosen. It could be we just see this particular issue differently? But the idea of a TN monitor sounds better than IPS to me, and a 60Hz monitor sounds like a huge bottleneck, and a giant waste of money in regards to my beefy GPU/system. If I can run 1080p on ultra and draw very high FPS, why would I limit myself to 60? Or the other way: if I am limiting myself to 60, why not spend \u003Cem\u003Edramatically \u003C/em\u003Eless on my system? Honestly, to me the monitor I\u0027ve chosen sounds perfect, the only thing it seems it\u0027s missing is GSync, which I definitely can\u0027t afford.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more I read, the more good things I hear about BenQ and how well made their monitors are. They have monitors with the ability to scale down your refresh rate from 144 to 120/100/etc., which sounds a bit like GSync/FreeSync essentially, for a lot cheaper. They call this \u0027game refresh rate optimization management\u0027 (probably just a selling point).\u00A0Isn\u0027t this standard with all monitors, or at least 3rd party software can be downloaded for free to do this?

Amazon on the other hand I have no computer component buying experience with (and no RMA experience, which is kind of scary).\u00A0Plus, it\u0027s always nice the day it arrives in the mail and its \u003Cstrong\u003Eall\u003C/strong\u003E there, and I don\u0027t have to potentially wait another day or two for the monitor (or parts); can\u0027t begin the fun until I get both.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like what I\u0027ve read about graphics in general is conflicting with what you\u0027re saying. Yeah, an IPS is nice and has better colors and I can look at the monitor sideways (which is a feature I care absolutely nothing about), but it also is slower; it comes with a 4ms response time, and a 60Hz refresh rate. That is something I suspect I \u003Cem\u003Ewill\u00A0\u003C/em\u003Enotice, even without the experience of 1ms/144Hz beforehand. I didn\u0027t realize earlier that I could afford a 1440p monitor, but that was because I was always searching for 1440p with a 144Hz refresh rate. Just a few posts ago, \u003Ca contenteditable=\u0022false\u0022 data-ipshover=\u0022\u0022 data-ipshover-target=\u0022http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/59088-camacha/\u0026amp;do=hovercard\u0022 data-mentionid=\u002259088\u0022 href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/59088-camacha/\u0022\u003E@Camacha\u003C/a\u003E\u00A0says that it\u0027s a lot easier to lower your monitor to a lower refresh rate than raising (a 60Hz) rate to higher than what it is. Also, from what I read, I\u0027d be a lot better of with a 27\u0022 if I was going 1440p.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI feel like this is another trade-off situation, and personally, I don\u0027t think getting a 60Hz monitor just so I can experience 1440p is worth it. Again, I\u0027m not an expert...but from what I\u0027ve read and some of what Cam has said, I think I\u0027d have a much better experience getting a 24\u0022 1080p 144Hz monitor. I care more about response times than sideways viewing or a monitor that will stand the test of time because it\u0027s IPS. IPS is slower, and what you gain from it being slower does not seem important to me- just like how more CPU power at the cost of GPU power absolutely doesn\u0027t sound worth it for my preferences.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo granted, I don\u0027t have current plans to play a ton of FPS or \u0027fast\u0027 action games, but the idea of being able to because I have a monitor that has fast pixel responses and refresh rates is great. The downside to TN monitors? It looks bad viewed from most angles that aren\u0027t straight on; and truly this makes absolutely no difference to me. I don\u0027t care about a 3 monitor setup. I mean no offense whatsoever and I always appreciate your time and help, but everything I\u0027m reading is basically pointing towards the kind of monitor I\u0027ve chosen. It could be we just see this particular issue differently? But the idea of a TN monitor sounds better than IPS to me, and a 60Hz monitor sounds like a huge bottleneck, and a giant waste of money in regards to my beefy GPU/system. If I can run 1080p on ultra and draw very high FPS, why would I limit myself to 60? Or the other way: if I am limiting myself to 60, why not spend \u003Cem\u003Edramatically \u003C/em\u003Eless on my system? Honestly, to me the monitor I\u0027ve chosen sounds perfect, the only thing it seems it\u0027s missing is GSync, which I definitely can\u0027t afford.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe more I read, the more good things I hear about BenQ and how well made their monitors are. They have monitors with the ability to scale down your refresh rate from 144 to 120/100/etc., which sounds a bit like GSync/FreeSync essentially, for a lot cheaper. They call this \u0027game refresh rate optimization management\u0027 (probably just a selling point).\u00A0Isn\u0027t this standard with all monitors, or at least 3rd party software can be downloaded for free to do this? I was under the impression that it was for pretty much all 144Hz monitors. This will obviously be a useful feature when I can\u0027t push really high FPS, like will be the case when I play GTA5 on high settings.
