When you have reaction wheels controlling the attitude of a ship, you can override it in a single direction by just telling the system to let go of that reaction wheel. It takes I think 3 or 4 reaction wheels to keep control in all directions, but saying you have to turn of all of them just to change one of the directions is strange. Computer control systems should be there to help us constantly, not all or nothing. Like the F-117 Nighthawk, if it did not have a computer assisted flight system, no pilot in the world could keep it in the air(although it does not use reaction wheels). I understand this may make the game \u0022too easy\u0022 but maybe they could make a power system that regenerates, so you can only make a limited correction in a set period of time, or it is significantly heavier because of the \u0022computer\u0022 or hydraulic system required, or just have it take a crapton of research in career mode. When flying a spaceplane in kerbal\u0027s atmosphere the SAS locks onto a celestial point, so the farther I fly, the more it pitches up, it needs to lock onto an angle relative to the current horizon and keep the angle. Oh, and PLEASE tone down the ASAS. The control surfaces are either 100% or 0% with it. It needs to be a little more, well, gentle. Maybe even let the ASAS individually throttle each engine for more control(I know that would take some major coding)\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"9911MU51C","CreatedById":49907,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T20:53:32Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI think Bases would be a nice touch, launching big ships from Mun would be a lot easier than Kerbel\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Frostiken","CreatedById":1837,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-09-25T20:58:56Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022kulesz\u0022 data-cite=\u0022kulesz\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EFor me is mostly the docking (a tons of possibilities) and stable, simple electricity system.

Given how every version of KSP breaks 80% of plugin mods, this puts the onus on the modders to keep active and continue digging through whatever Squad changed to make it work again.
