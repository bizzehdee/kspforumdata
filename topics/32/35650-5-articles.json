It\u0027s pulling the data from the game, yes. But then IRL scanning satellites pull their data from the Earth. The difference being the data was oh so very analog and not already digital. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EISA doesn\u0027t come with a pregenerated map texture that it exposes as you pass over the surface, it uses a series of beams (how many is selectable in the options) that cover a swath 16 degrees wide, centered on your position, that pull the height data for the spot they hit. If they come close enough to an object, it gets saved into the anomaly database.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe point is, there\u0027s no way to simply pull a completed map and anomaly database from somewhere. To get it you HAVE to put a ship with an ISA Mapsat dish into orbit, and have it pass over the planet in such a way that its 18 degree swath ends up, at some point, touching every point on the planet. Using a higher orbit does so faster, but with a lower resolution (though you can now mitigate or eliminate that by using more scanning beams...at the expense of rapidly increasing CPU load as you add more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI tend to do ISA and Kethane mapping simultaneously, but the Kethane scanner doesn\u0027t HAVE a swath width. It only scans the point directly beneath you. It\u0027s gotten easier to use with the recent updates, however, which changed the scanning to be based on a geodetic hex grid (and some pentagons, of course), so you don\u0027t have to somehow hit EVERY point on the planet, but the grid\u0027s still pretty fine. It still requires you to take a lower orbit with a finer grid in order to hit everything. The lower orbit makes it take longer. A LOT longer. About 3-4 times longer, generally.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt also seems to me that by your definition it\u0027d be impossible to actually scan a planet, because it\u0027s all already data in the game\u0027s databases, if not the mod\u0027s. But let me ask, what\u0027s the practical difference between a beam that pulls data directly from the game\u0027s heightmap, and measuring the beam\u0027s return time to determine the distance? Sure it\u0027s more accurate. And probably faster. And gets you the height directly rather than a database of relative heights. But the practical effect is the same. You\u0027re basically pointing a radar dish(With a massive swath) at the planet and making a map based on the result.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunately, you can\u0027t at present get the data from the mapper via an uplink, you have to be sitting in the ship with the dish in order to collect the data...which is most of what\u0027s so annoying about it. You have to leave the game running with your mapping probe focused for hours of realtime. I\u0027d just rather minimize how much of that I have redo, because it\u0027s really...not that fun.
