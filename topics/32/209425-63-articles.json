Nothing too fancy, just enough to get me through daily use and play a few relatively low-demand games. When I first got into KSP I thought \u0022This thing is never going to run this but whatever, it\u0027s worth a shot\u0022, and much to my surprise (integrated graphics/ancient CPU) it ran quite nicely until I started building bigger and bigger things. Well long story short, my laptop is no more, and seeing how it\u0027s a off the shelf laptop from Best Buy I don\u0027t expect it\u0027s really worth fixing if it\u0027s even fixable. So I\u0027ve decided to go about building a PC which will hopefully be at least a bit more capable than my old toaster.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EProblem is, I\u0027ve got no experience with actually building PC\u0027s (Seriously, none, nada, zip, does replacing RAM count?\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cry.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;.;\u0022\u003E). Luckily for me, you folks have this awesome thread set up where I can hopefully ask questions to my hearts content and figure things out. So to start off with, I\u0027ll fill out this build helper thing.

Unless someone who would recommend Linux over Windows can point me in the direction of a good build and humor me a bit while I pester them with questions about it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Does this include peripherals (a keyboard, monitor, mouse, speakers, etc.)?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E For the most part, no. I\u0027ve got a mouse I used with the laptop because of my undying hate for trackpads. Speakers, check. Monitor, check. If anyone can recommend a nice keyboard though, I\u0027ll probably be needing one of those.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Are you from the United States or a different country? Are you ordering from your own country or from across borders?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUS, and I\u0027m not exactly sure where I\u0027ll be ordering from yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Wherever you may be from, does the store that you are planning to order from have a website?

Which I suspect won\u0027t be hard to do.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Do you plan on overclocking?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Nahh.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Would you prefer the build to be particularly small?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E To be honest smaller is better, but bigger is usually easier as far as I know. So it doesn\u0027t really matter I guess.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWould you prefer the build to be particularly quiet?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI don\u0027t care, make it as loud as a turbine engine, as long as it stays cool and does what I want it to it\u0027s fine by me. I rarely get on a computer without having headphones on anyways.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E In general, do you prefer this to be a computer that you can spend money on now and let it rest, or a box built for continuous upgrading?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I\u0027d like to be able to upgrade if I can, but to be honest when I actually do upgrade I\u0027ll probably build a new rig with a bit bigger budget. I\u0027m just kinda getting my feet wet with this first build and trying to get a grip on what I\u0027m doing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Do you ever plan on utilizing NVIDIA\u0027s SLI or AMD\u0027s CrossfireX technologies? These features, with a compatible motherboard, allow a user to link multiple identical graphic cards together for added performance. In real world terms, this lets you buy a second identical graphics card down the line as a relatively cheap and easy way to gain a fairly large boost in performance. However, this requires buying a SLI/CFX compatible motherboard and PSU now, which may result in slightly higher initial cost.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENope, for what I\u0027m going to be using it for I don\u0027t see a need to do so.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlright, that\u0027s finished (I hope). If I\u0027ve left anything out or anyone needs any more information let me know. If you\u0027re patient enough to put up with me and answer all my inevitable dumb questions I\u0027m more than willing to help out where I can, I just need some guidance on this and some recommended builds.

You managed to kill off your laptop in a little over half a year? It actually seems to be a reasonable laptop with a quadcore chip and fair single thread speed, so unless you want to build a dedicated KSP computer (read: one fast single thread) you will need a proper processor in the new build. Graphics and RAM are a little easier to improve on, I would suggest the aforementioned 270 or 270X or a sightly slower 750ti.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022GiantZombies\u0022 data-cite=\u0022GiantZombies\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EI actually am a music/movie hoarder, but luckily I\u0027ve got an external HDD I store all of that on.
