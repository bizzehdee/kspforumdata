The way my design worked out is it has a surplus of fuel by the time it reaches the space station, so I transfer what fuel the ship has onto the station. This stage is then discarded. However, whenever I fire off this stage, all other stages seem to go off as well. It turns on any engines, and also activates my parachutes. Not sure why this happens. I press spacebar once, and it\u0027s like it becomes stuck and it fires off all remaining stages. This only seems to happen after I dock with another ship/station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs this a bug or am I just doing something wrong here? Is there a way to get around it? I have a mechjeb module on the ship if that has anything to do with it, though I\u0027m doing the docking manually and don\u0027t have mechjeb activated when it starts firing stages.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Noticeably FAT","CreatedById":43401,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T23:47:45Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOpen the ascent guidance window and turn off auto stage.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"astropapi1","CreatedById":57507,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-05-03T23:48:21Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EYour staging changes once you dock with another craft.

As long at the ship you dock to has less than that it won\u0027t auto stage I find.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI do hate it that you can\u0027t trigger a stage from the stage icon on the left hand side. Sometimes you need to trigger a certain stage component manually (like when I docked with another vessel and I ended up with the stages mixed up. I wanted to ditch an almost empty tank that I had transferred the fuel from but I had to dig around in the 3D view to try and locate the stack separator under engines and monoprop tanks because if I hit the stage button I would have probably ditched some part of the other craft too. In the end I just undocked, staged and then re-docked. Docking is so simple these days (after lots of practice) that it\u0027s no hardship. But newbies would have a lot harder time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be nice to colour code the mixed stages of the various docked ships of the gross vehicle... or tag the stages with a code like Ship1, Ship2, Ship3 etc. How about a line from the stage list part to the 3d rocket that can be turned on and off. All good ideas that a decent coder (which I am not these days) could probably do in their sleep.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
