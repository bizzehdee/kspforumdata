I got it with 20m of the target, after draining nearly all the transport crafts fuel, and finally ran out of monopropellent. I am still a bit lost as to the HNJIKL what control who, it just feels unnatural to me for some reason. The second fuel cell craft tips nose down when at rest, yet it should in theory be heavier than the rear of the craft. Maybe I am not meant to dock large crafts together, I can do smaller ones ok but I think that is more to do with less mass to translate around.
