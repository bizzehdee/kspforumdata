Yeah, we all figured it was only a matter of time. I mean, honestly, who wasn\u0027t in love with Valentina? The first time I saw her out of her spacesuit I about fell over.

The girls were crazy about him. He got so much mail from women, we had two full-time employees whose job it was to open all the packages and see what was inside them (a lot of underwear, I\u0027m told). So it was no surprise to us. But those clowns at mission control were clueless as usual. Otherwise they never would\u0027ve sent the two of them off to Bop together with Bill Kerman along.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nBill Kerman? Are you kidding me? The guy may not have been bright enough to light your dashboard, but he was a legendary ladies man. Sure, he was getting on in years, but that didn\u0027t hurt him a bit. He had that salt and pepper thing going. Girls always seem to go for that. And he played it to the hilt. With the cowboy hat and boots all the time. He cut a pretty rakish figure.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow imagine the three of them packed up in a tin can and shipped to the edge of the solar system.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAnd tin can was pretty much what they were in. Rockomax offered a contract to put a base on Bop that could support eight Kerbals.

He didn\u0027t actually need eight Kerbals. On top of that, he double-dipped with a contract for Kerbodyne. They wanted us to mine some ore for them. And thus, a disaster was begun.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe mad geniuses at the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E slapped a couple of MK2 lander cans on top of a hitchhiker storage facility (simply known as a \u0022hitcher\u0022) to make up the required eight seats. It really did look like a giant soup can. They threw on some drills and a resource converter (with Bill aboard to run them) and the mission was a go.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThings went fine on the way out, but it wasn\u0027t exactly uneventful. Supposedly there was a lot of sneaking around going on. Two and a half years is a long time, so it\u0027s no surprise. But it was after they landed on Bop that it all came to a head.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027ve heard this story a bunch of times, and I\u0027ve heard it a bunch of different ways.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow, you\u0027ve gotta understand, Bill was known to drink a bit. And on long flights, he was known to drink a lot. He had grown adept at making toilet-wine. It was a foul-tasting concoction he cooked up in an empty monopropellent canister. This is where accounts start to vary. Some say Bill got drunk and made a pass at Val. Some say Bill got drunk and tried to rekindle an old romance he had with Val. Some say Bill got drunk and took a swing at Jeb. About the only thing everyone agrees on is that Bill got drunk.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe story I got from Jeb himself, is that Bill (drunk on toilet-wine) EVA\u0027d to the surface to retract the drills for takeoff. A transfer window to Kerbin was opening, and they needed to launch soon to be sure not to miss it. Bill got the drills retracted and boarded the ship. Then he got on the intercom to say they were good to go, promptly laid down and passed out. Jeb fired up the Poodle and they were on the way. Six hours later they fired the engine again for a direct burn home from Bop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNot half an hour later, they got the word from mission control. Bill Kerman had woken up. On Bop.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe story was that Bill (drunk on toilet-wine) had indeed retracted the drills and boarded the ship. And he did promptly lie down and pass out. But he was actually inside the \u0022hitcher\u0022, which was not scheduled to come home. It was staged and left behind as dead-weight. Jeb and Val assumed he was on the other lander can (where he would\u0027ve been if he was sober) and took off for home.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNow that they made the burn, there was no going back. Once you start the Jool dive, you don\u0027t just turn around. So Bill was stuck on Bop, and Jeb and Val had a couple of years to themselves. Which I hear they made the most of.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAs for Bill, luckily we had a permanent science station on Bop (can\u0027t remember the name; we just called it the Bop Stop). They sent a rover for Bill and he waited there for a rescue.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThere was an investigation, of course, but it was just for show. Val was the first woman in the space program and Jeb was a national hero, so what could they do? They changed some protocols and that was it.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nSo did they leave him behind on purpose? Who knows? Nothing was ever proven. Even Jeb and Bill made up afterward. Of course, by the time he got home Bill was a decade older and slightly brain-damaged. I guess drinking toilet-wine out of a monopropellent canister isn\u0027t good for you.
