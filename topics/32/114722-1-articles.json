In all the time I\u0027ve been playing KSC, I\u0027ve never noticed that some of the ridges up on the plateau near KSC form a circle, despite having driven rovers over them many times. Hell, I\u0027ve even had Kerbinside that puts some antennae in this area and never saw it then, either. I don\u0027t even recall ever hearing of a crater near KSC. So it was with some surprise that I noticed what appears to be a crater in the background of a screenshot I took at random. I didn\u0027t even notice it at that time, but only when looking at the pic just now.\n\n[![19312120005_10c4ef4687_z.jpg](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/467/19312120005_10c4ef4687_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/vqxEsi)\n\nAs you can see, this is just SSW of KSC on the plateau. I recall long ago there was a dry lakebed in this general area but it\u0027s been gone for many versions.\n\nI\u0027m sure this must be a well-known feature to at least some folks--I can\u0027t imagine nobody else has noticed it. But if this is new, I\u0027ll gladly take credit for finding it ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif).\n\nThis leads me to wonder how many craters there are on Kerbin. This makes 3 I know of.\n\n\\* This one.\n\n\\* The very obvious one with the central island W of KSC.\n\n\\* A huge, ancient, misshapen one on the continent E of KSC.\n\nAny others?"},{"CreatedByName":"mikegarrison","CreatedById":137807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T02:56:37Z","Content":"That could be intended to be a volcanic caldera.

Ramp noise is the noise heard by the ramp workers for the ECS (aircon) packs and the APU. Our guarantees were written for 25 degrees C, so we went and did the test in Arizona (in the evening). We parked the airplane on a remote taxiway at a low-traffic bizjet airport and did our test.\n\nThe next morning we took off to fly back to Seattle. But the pilot decided he wanted to do some sight-seeing. So he got permission to go VFR and flew over to Winslow. We all went over and looked out the windows as we circled the crater once or twice at maybe 2000 feet agl. Then we flew back to Seattle. This was before 2001, so things were a little more relaxed in terms of airspace.\n\nAnyway, I have always wondered what people on the ground thought when this 737 flew down low over the crater and circled it a couple of times before flying off!"},{"CreatedByName":"Sharpy","CreatedById":145504,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-01T10:24:10Z","Content":"By the way, some 800m east of the start of Runway, there\u0027s a 50m or so patch of Tundra right between where the biome changes from Shores to Grasslands.
