The real lunar rover had a top safe speed of about 3 m/s because of the Moon\u0027s bumpy terrain. However, I\u0027m pretty sure that rover had much better handling than any deathtrap you can make in KSP.\n\nHere\u0027s the issue: Driving over a cliff on the Mun or Kerbin should be not much different than driving off a cliff on Earth; however even on a gentle slope with the brakes full on, you\u0027re going to hit 30ms(70mph!) and nothing is going to stop you until the next bump sends you tumbling through the air in an entirely unsurvivable manner. I think we all know this is very, very wrong. I\u0027m quite sure this is also highly unrealistic in addition to being highly unsatisfying. We should be able to drive downhill in a controlled manner with nothing but wheels and brakes.\n\nHey, funny related story. My solution to this problem was to put Verner RCS controls front and back to assist with speed control. I made a big, beautiful science bus that absolutely drives like a dream all over the Mun. Problem solved right? Then I realized that in driving 10km I used about 3000 delta-v in fuel! ![:cool:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cool.gif)\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T20:01:53Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 08:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by cephalo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Robotengineer","CreatedById":104525,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:03:58Z","Content":"The problem is gravity, on the Mun you have less gravity, thus when you go fast, you tend to soar rather than drive, making braking difficult because your wheels aren\u0027t actually touching the ground."},{"CreatedByName":"regex","CreatedById":70807,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:05:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E The real lunar rover had a top safe speed of about 3 m/s\n\nYou just answered your own problem.

It\u0027s ok for a newly installed wheel, but as soon as you open the right-click menu it\u0027s getting set to a fraction of what it should be, in some cases to 10% or less than what it should be by default.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, edit your save file and you\u0027ll find that you have cases of \u0022brakeTorque = 30\u0022 on some rover wheels. Set that to a more appropriate value, e.g. \u0022brakeTorque = 300\u0022. You can check the default values in the cfg files in GameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel, it\u0027s different for each wheel:\n\n    $ grep brakeTorque GameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel/*/*.cfgGameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel/roverWheelM1/roverWheelM1.cfg:\t\tbrakeTorque = 300GameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel/roverWheelS2/roverWheelS2.cfg:\t\tbrakeTorque = 180GameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel/roverWheelTR-2L/roverWheelTR-2L.cfg:\t\tbrakeTorque = 500GameData/Squad/Parts/Wheel/roverWheelXL3/roverWheelXL3.cfg:\t\tbrakeTorque = 200$ \n\nIt will break again as soon as you right-click the wheel, but should stay at the correct value if you don\u0027t touch them. The culprit seems to be brakeTorque\\_UIFlight\u0027s maxValue, so you can also set that much higher, which I believe should prevent the value getting clobbered (untested, not sure if setting a higher value there actually sticks). Each new craft will launch broken, these things only fix it for craft already in flight. I\u0027ve not tried actually fixing the part cfgs themselves.\n\nIf the above made about as much sense as a novel written in a random mixture of Dutch and Chinese combined, you probably shouldn\u0027t be messing with your save file (or at least don\u0027t complain to me if it all goes horribly wrong for you).\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-05-28T19:30:05Z\u0022 title=\u002205/28/2015 07:30  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EMay 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Murph**"},{"CreatedByName":"cephalo","CreatedById":143148,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-05-28T19:32:32Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E Sure I can.
