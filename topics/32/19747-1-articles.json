Keep trying again, be patient, and you\u0027ll get it eventually.

However, there are bound to be more than a few cases where it does not pick it up. After all, no error-checking method is foolproof.

Keep an eye on the progress of the download; if it starts patching before the download has even finished, the download got dropped.
