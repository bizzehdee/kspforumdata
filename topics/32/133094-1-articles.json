Yes, the crew report was probably a factor in crashing, but I\u0027ve done it before without crashing, so it\u0027s not the sole cause.\u00A0Are you sure it\u0027s AA rockets? Usually they blow the plane up a lot more, especially in the wing parts. What direction are the rockets coming from? and why would I trigger a crew report in the first place, on a drone plane nonetheless?
