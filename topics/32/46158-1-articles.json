Otherwise it\u0027s not particularly likely unless you\u0027ve got just tremendous amounts of debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn real life, when something gets hit by debris, it spalls off more debris, or in rare cases can actually cause the thing that got hit to break up entirely. In either case, but especially the latter, you get 1 piece of debris creating a large group of debris. In KSP, any impact is going to destroy both the impactor and impactee, and destroyed parts leave no debris. Which means the only way a collision can spawn more debris is if pieces of one or both don\u0027t actually hit/get hit by anything and go spinning off. Which is possible, but it\u0027s probably going to create at most a few dozen pieces of debris, versus the hundreds or thousands from a real life collision.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EKessler Syndrome refers to a scenario where a part of Earth Orbit becomes so saturated with items, that when a collision occurs, the extra debris it spawns goes on to cause more collisions, which spawn more debris, which cause more collisions... It runs away out of control until everything in that part of Earth Orbit is smashed, leaving a fairly dense cloud of debris that\u0027s almost impossible to get through without getting hit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is almost impossible in KSP, because things which are on rails don\u0027t collide with anything. This means, practically, that only your focused craft or anything within physics range of it (2.4km by default) can be hit by anything. To get an actual Kessler Syndrome, you\u0027d need a massive cloud of multi-part debris and/or ships orbiting the world at a variety of inclinations at a given altitude. You\u0027d then have to use Lazor plugin or something to extend the physics range to encompass at the very least a large section of that orbital space to allow them to collide. If you set it up properly and got lucky you might get part of the orbit-saturating cascade that Kessler Syndrome describes(there\u0027s going to be so much less debris created from each impact than in reality that you\u0027d never get the full effect). There\u0027d also be a fair possibility that so much of each bit that hit each other would be destroyed in the impact that it would peter out, too.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-16T22:42:32Z\u0022 title=\u002209/16/2013 10:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 16, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Tiron\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"henryrasia","CreatedById":45695,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-16T22:40:02Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy closest call was when I launched into a (unplanned) rendezvous orbit.

A really dense ring compared to what I\u0027ve done and seen before. I know what happened to Danny, so I never tried to visit any debris.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/2vlw4s8.png\u0022 alt=\u00222vlw4s8.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E309 pieces flying in various orbits. Here\u0027s one of the early versions of the ship.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i44.tinypic.com/10r5xlv.png\u0022 alt=\u002210r5xlv.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s a ship conveniently named Staphylo (\u00C3\u00C6\u2019\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u017E\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00B1\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00A0\u00C3\u00E2\u20AC\u00A6\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00BB\u00C3\u017D\u00C2\u00AE, \u0022grape\u0022). There are 8 layers, each giving off 10 pieces of debris so I did it several times, first time just releasing it all in a short time.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i42.tinypic.com/rhqts2.png\u0022 alt=\u0022rhqts2.png\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe staging is a bit of an overkill, but I didn\u0027t care. Later I added some thrusters at the top to be able to change my orbital parameters and thus seed junk all over the place, not just in one cloud.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe key is to position yourself properly and then spin like mad, decouple one layer, change orbit, wait, spin, decouple, etc.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot only I\u0027ve made a ring, I\u0027ve made it \u003Cem\u003Ethick\u003C/em\u003E. I\u0027ve changed periapsis, apoapsis and inclination each time I\u0027d seed, so now there\u0027s a torus of pretty much evenly distributed junk ~15 km thick around Kerbin.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EUnfortunatelly, even if you turn off the debris visibility on the map, framerate drops.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd then I placed a small station in orbit in the middle of the torus and waited half an hour at high speed. Of course nothing happened. Pieces are just passing by. One got at less than 1.5 km from the station.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThats an impressive ring of debris!

So I just sent it straight up. When I got the the altitude of where I do all of my parking orbits, an entire other interplanetary ship I had in a parking orbit for later came whizzing by and clipped the top of my rocket. It ripped the escape tower off and went on its merry way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo devestating damage was dealt but it sure was scary! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_ohmy.png\u0022 alt=\u0022:o\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI guess I just have all the luck \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe possibility of space junk ripping your hard work to tiny shreds really does add a spice to the game \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"lajoswinkler","CreatedById":79159,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-17T04:59:48Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EThanks. No, larger junk won\u0027t make measurable/effective difference. If the chances are already extremely low, it makes no difference if the pieces are 0.1 or 1m wide. You might consider debris impact scenario as getting hit by points. It the same reason why almost none of the stars in colliding galaxies have their orbits changed at the local level. They just pass through.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s interesting to watch the ring in the map mode at the highest speed. It fluctuates, you can see patterns emerging.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EYour little accident is even more unlikely. All I ever got was plunging into a stage I\u0027ve decoupled few kilometres away, when I started my rocket. I\u0027ve forgot it\u0027s there and it collided while I was looking at the map.
