I\u0027ve done some rockets of that size with asparagus and it can definitely be done. IMHO the real issue in most cases ( not here though ) is the lack of strutting in the bottom: pylons and decouplers are inherently more flexible than what you want in here and they will make the engines to wobble slightly out of the vertical. This will get worse as the rocket loses mass, but it can be solved by extra strutting in the lower parts to the center part and even between tanks in the same stage ... dirty but effective.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E@ Analogy:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI agree with the poster in the last page that says that putting 5 tanks in top of all the big LV is wasteful. I will not say that you don\u0027t need that fuel, but if you want to take it you would be better doing drop tanks in the side ( say 2 drop tanks in the side and 3 in the LV proper ). Empty big tanks still weight 2t ( thus less mass for you to accelerate if you drop them soon ) and, more important, makes your rocket shorter and far less susceptible to bending stress failures. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBTW that is what you have here: a bending stress failure on the lower side rocket ( the more susceptible to that in your ship when it starts get horizontal ) as soon as the angle of the ship with the horizon reaches a certain level and the center of mass gets low enough while still having that huge mass in the top. The only solution for that are assuring that the center of mass is higher relative to the rocket length ( by reducing the top load and/or making the rocket shorter ), increase the structural strength of the faulty areas ( more strutting and/or reducing the length of the side rockets ) or simply start turning later, when the Kerbin g-force is lower ( I know, it is inefficient fuel wise ... )\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EP.S Other thing you can do is to put some thrusting in the top part of the rocket at launch, thus increasing the center of thrust and reducing the bending and compression stress due to gravity in the gravity turn phase. You have a lot of open space in between the side rockets and the central stage, so you could in theory fire your nuke engines at launch while draining the outer tanks ( you already have the fuel line work done and all ). I say in theory because nuke engines can gimbal and that might end making that the exhaust hits something, but I\u0027ve done it a lot with aerospikes in the .16 times due to the weak decoupler issues. In your particular case you would also need to rotate the engines in top to ensure that you don\u0027t hit the side rockets \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222012-10-04T15:42:20Z\u0022 title=\u002210/04/2012 03:42  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002211 yr\u0022\u003EOctober 4, 2012\u003C/time\u003E by r_rolo1\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003EAdded cooment on increasing center of thrust\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"antbin","CreatedById":22389,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-10-04T15:21:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Analogy\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Analogy\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ETop-heavy rockets are more controllable by thrust-vectored engines\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis makes sense to me, but atmospheric drag might counteract that effect.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy experience is that very top-heavy rockets are uncontrollable during the gravity turn phase because of drag forces (which KSP calculates proportional to mass). 2 degrees of thrust vectoring isn\u0027t enough to control 4\u002B degrees of pitch error drag from a very top heavy rocket.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI would very much like to launch my capsule with a 3200L tank strapped to the top (to fuel an interplanetary tug stage), but I\u0027ve failed every time, with uncontrollable pitch and/or structural failure.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHaving a super long main booster should help by increasing the leverage of the Mainsail\u0027s thrust vectoring, and pulling the center of drag a bit further aft.
