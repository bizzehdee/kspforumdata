Last time I checked, with an ATI card you could forget it (it was supposed to work but practically was a nightmare).\n\nAMD is only a nightmare, if one is masochistic enough to bother with the proprietary drivers. The open source drivers work out of the box on most Linux distributions. The only exception I know of is Debian, which doesn\u0027t install the required firmware files by default, as they are in the non-free repository, and has a crash issue with recent AMD cards (for which a one-line workaround exists, but one needs to know how to compile software to apply it).\n\n\u003E \n\u003E Thanks again.

It might be slightly more difficult to set up and configure than Ubuntu or Mint, but as you are a software engineer, I think you\u0027ll appreciate the manual which, while being written for absolute beginners, includes a lot of useful background information (see also the appendices), and you\u0027ll probably also like the more powerful installer of Debian.\n\n Of course there\u0027s also an [installation manual for Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/), but that\u0027s just a copy of the Debian manual, with the name Debian replaced by Ubuntu, and therefore is rather useless, as Ubuntu no longer uses the Debian installer...\n\nAfter installation, just be sure to do things the Linux way. The biggest difference between Windows and Linux is the [installation of software](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingSoftware). Let the package manager (Synaptic or Muon (or Software Center on Ubuntu, but the only purpose of Software Center is downloading Synaptic...) are GUI frontends, apt-get or aptitude are command line frontends) do software downloads and installation for you whenever possible. This not only gives you automatic updates, it also gives you a sane way to uninstall stuff, as on Linux nearly all programs get installed into the same folders ([Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)). The [graphics drivers](https://wiki.debian.org/NvidiaGraphicsDrivers) are **no exception** to this rule (trust me, updating or uninstalling them is an ugly mess if you don\u0027t use the package manager). Also, Steam is available through official repositories (non-free (the non-free means: free as in free beer, but not free as in free speech) on Debian, or multiverse on Ubuntu). If you bought KSP from the store or GoG, you\u0027ll have to make an exception though, and download it directly from the website...\n\nAh, and don\u0027t forget to read the [Linux Thread](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread). Especially important: If your locale uses another character as the period as decimal separator, read [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/92231-The-Linux-Thread#linuxthread02) before you first attempt to launch KSP (or any other Unity game...), as otherwise your settings file will get corrupted and all kinds of strange things can happen ingame..."},{"CreatedByName":"dognosh","CreatedById":115589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T07:50:45Z","Content":"\u002B1 rep\n\nCheers soulsource, your post is the one I will come to if I install Linux ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\np.s. you read manuals ? ![:confused:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif)"},{"CreatedByName":"soulsource","CreatedById":110576,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T08:39:41Z","Content":"Of course, as reading manuals is half the deal with Linux ![:wink:](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif).

Again, you get a fairly traditional desktop out of this.\n\nKDE is pretty good these days (I use it presently) and gives you a full-featured desktop similar to Windows.\n\nIf you want ultra-lightweight try WindowMaker and similar, but be prepared for a rather different interface.\n\nHere\u0027s an overview of some of the most popular choices these days:\n\n[http://www.howtogeek.com/163154/linux-users-have-a-choice-8-linux-desktop-environments/](https://www.howtogeek.com/163154/linux-users-have-a-choice-8-linux-desktop-environments/)\n\nRegardless of which GUI you choose, you can always mix-and-match applications, although some applications will pull in lots of dependencies if they were written for a different desktop."},{"CreatedByName":"dognosh","CreatedById":115589,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-07-18T22:08:54Z","Content":"\u002B1 rep, cheers micha ![:)](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif)\n\nI like KDE and Mint after going to your link.

Linux has a long, and deep learning curve. I use Linux for a couple of years now. Mostly in server related issue\u0027s. But I have dealt with the desktop version as well. Linux is amazing! With servers. It\u0027s freaking stable. I takes a lot of work (mostly with commands) to set it all up. It is kind of nerd stuff. Linux can be extremely complex, but if you do it all right.. Linux is your best friend. Besides that, unless you want to challenge yourself, keep it to Windows. Linux is a amazing OS, but is isn\u0027t really user friendly. For normal day uses, you have to do, so much trouble. Windows works with point and click. You can control almost anything. You can delete almost anything. Even beyond the point of no return. Windows let you delete system parts. Kinda bad to be honest. But, Linux works the other way around. For a simple delete you sometimes need to do a whole lot of unnecessary stuff. Just to be \u0022sure and secure\u0022. It\u0027s so not user friendly.. Servers NEED to be stable. Server need to work. Linux does that. But for everyday use? I keep using Windows, with all the problems it has. It\u0027s just is SO much easier. Linux is a pain in the ass sometimes. That\u0027s why most of the user have a duel boot instead of a Linux only system. Windows is still the biggest player for a reason. It\u0027s too damn easy to use. Just download Ubuntu and start playing with it. Cool thing about Linux is, that most versions, (at least Ubuntu etc) has a \u0022live\u0022 function. You can try the Linux version from the disk, instead of installing it right away. Try it, and find out. But for KSP only? Why on earth would you install a Linux, JUST for KSP?
