It stays up longer and goes further when fired from the top of a hill because the ground falls away. Then imagine the cannon on the surface of a large round ball (say 500 yards in diameter or so), with gravity pulling inwards going in towards the center of the ball. The cannonball, with progressively higher charges, will start going further and further around the large round ball before gravity drags it down to hit the ball\u0027s surface. When you finally add enough powder, the cannonball will fly all the way around the ball and hit the cannonier (sp?) in the back of the head.

With no force at all acting on the rock, it would either stay still (if it wasn\u0027t already in motion) or move at constant speed in a straight line (if it was). In order to move in a curved path, it needs a force, and that force is provided by the tension in the string.\n\nWith a little bit of questioning the students quickly figure out that this force has to be proportional to the object\u0027s mass and velocity (massive object requires lots of force; fast object is changing more quickly so it needs more force) and inversely proportional to radius of the circular path (this one\u0027s trickier, but I point out that larger radius means more gently curving path, so the direction isn\u0027t changing as suddenly--if the students are old enough to drive, I make comparisons to sharp turns versus gradual turns and they get it right away).\n\nSo far that gives us F\\_cent = mv/r. But the units of measurement don\u0027t work out--we need an extra m/s. Easiest way to do that is to square the velocity, so\n\nF\\_cent = m v^2 / r.\n\nSo far this should work for any object moving in a circular path at constant speed: there must be a (total) force of exactly mv^2/r, pointing towards the circle\u0027s center, or the trajectory won\u0027t be circular.\n\nNow for gravity. Some students have already seen F\\_g = G M m / r^2 ; if not, it\u0027s pretty easy to work out the basic format by a similar line of questioning.\n\nI then tell the students: consider an object, let\u0027s say a moon, in orbit around a planet. That\u0027s a (roughly) circular\\* path, so there must be a centripetal force. What\u0027s providing it? There\u0027s no string holding them together--instead it\u0027s gravity.\n\nMy favorite bit at this point is the equation\n\nF\\_required = F\\_provided\n\nIn other words, the force that is *required* for something to happen can be set equal to the force that is *provided* to cause it to happen. In this case, that means we can say\n\nF\\_cent = F\\_grav\n\nor\n\nm v^2 / r = G M m / r^2\n\nWith a little algebra, we can solve for v:\n\nv = \u00C3\u00A2\u00CB\u2020\u00C5\u00A1(GM/r)\n\nG and M are constant, so this tells us that for any given height, there is a certain speed that will allow a circular orbit. (Calculating that speed for Kerbin, by the way, was one of the first things I did after buying KSP.) Note also that mass of the orbiter cancels out and therefore doesn\u0027t matter; two objects at the same height and same velocity will orbit together even if they have different masses. The upshot of all this: getting into orbit ONLY requires reaching an altitude of your choice (above the atmosphere and any tall mountains should suffice) and achieving a certain sideways speed that depends on that altitude. Once that\u0027s accomplished, no further forces are required except gravity itself.\n\n\\* at this point I have to tell a certain part of my brain \u0022yes, I know it\u0027s elliptical, now shut up\u0022"},{"CreatedByName":"boostme","CreatedById":118817,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-04-24T07:35:50Z","Content":"I\u0027ve already taken the week off - even before the announcement.
