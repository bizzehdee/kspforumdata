The first one is the generic OBS setup, with a sattelite armed with (usually \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E-powered and barely controllable) missiles that orbits Kerbin at an altitude of around 80 to 150 kilometers. The second one is a sattelite that orbits Kerbin at 70-73 km (barely above the edge of the atmosphere) and that releases hypersonic guided or unguided bombs which enter the atmosphere at a very shallow angle and glide towards their target while maintaining a very high speed (should be possible with \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\nWhile at least the first concept has been implempted into the game in the form of OBS\u0027s that are purely cosmetical (e.g. you just fire a missile and it hits Kerbin at a random point), the 2 main requirements for good OBS concepts are as follows:\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n1. Targeting\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMissiles or bombs should hit a predetermined target. The mod \u0022Trajectories\u0022 makes it possible to predict aerodynamic descent pathes, but the difficult part is actually achieving a planned trajectory. There are two possibilities for hitting targets: if your missile has high delta-V, you can just fire directly at the target and hit it at horrendous speeds (but don\u0027t expect good accurancy, probably only good if the job needs to get done fast or if you are using a WMD), or, if your missiles have less delta-V and if you want more precision, deorbit the missile and then re-align it to enter the atmosphere safely after the engine burns out.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nIf you have hypersonic bombs, then you probably won\u0027t need propulsion at all but simply some aerodynamic surfaces (or none if you have \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Ferram Aerospace Research (mod)\u0022\u003EFAR\u003C/abbr\u003E) and change the orientation to correct the trajectory. This concept will also require for the low orbiter to change inclinations constantly or only target equatorial targets.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n2. Service and resupply of the sattelite\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nA standard OBS usually packs less than 10 missiles - if it is not a \u0022one use\u0022 sattelite that is deorbited after running out of missiles, it somehow must be restocked with new missiles. It is of course easy to put those new missiles into space, but the hard part is actually putting them in place. Manipulator arms or other advanced mechanical applications may be needed for this.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFeel free to post your ideas concerning orbital bombardment systems or your builds here.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Joco223","CreatedById":92530,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-08-07T12:04:50Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nYou can watch a video a think Scott Manley did on it.

currently having problems with building an appropriate rocket for this project (everything I tried so far either did not have enough delta-v or had a very weak second stage or just wobbled around like a wet noodle and underwent disintegration upon commencing the gravity turn), but I will of course not forget about the structure of the sattelite itself.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the missiles (which will be basically 1.25m \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Solid fuel Rocket Booster\u0022\u003ESRB\u003C/abbr\u003E\u0027s) should be placed into a special casing made out of structural panels that has a protective lid which is either openable in the fashion of a space telescope or is jettisoned upon reaching the target orbit. The sattelite will also have a weak\u00A0orbital engine and approximately 1.500 m/s of spare \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E for inclination changes and other necessary maneuvers.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that it would be a good idea to put the whole sattelite (probe core, \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Liquid Fuel\u0022\u003ELF\u003C/abbr\u003E and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Reaction Control System\u0022\u003ERCS\u003C/abbr\u003E tanks, engine, missiles, targeting equipment) into an inline\u00A0casing made out of 1x1 panels that resembles a 12-sided prism (using 6-fold symmetry). This would ensure stability and prevent wobbling and disintegration; maybe, the lid should have a heat shield on top of it to allow safe recovery of the sattelite.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nHm...I am actually wondering whether the sattelite should be resupplied in orbit or should regularly be deorbited to land at the launch site and be restocked before launch like a space shuttle.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nThe next problem to work on will be the structure of the missiles and guidance systems (I won\u0027t use MechJeb because it ruins the fun but maybe kOS?). kOS would be especially useful if you want to ignite the missiles not upon decoupling but when they have reached a safe distance from the sattelite (I will write a program that is automatically activated upon decoupling and that ignites the missile, say, after 10 seconds).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI think that the optimal launch profile\u00A0will be a compromise between a classical retro-burn (too slow) and shooting directly at the target (requires insane thrust and \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Delta-V\u0022\u003EdV\u003C/abbr\u003E). The missile will point neither retrograde nor directly at the target but in a vector in between these two, e.g. directly downwards if the target is at the horizon upon launch. This way, the missile will still speed up while changing its trajectory.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI\u0027m on my iPad right now and it is past 3 AM.
