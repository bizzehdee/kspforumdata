For those of us on here that have fictional aerospace agencies, why don\\\u0027t we make Google\u002B pages for them? We could post mission status updates or show off our latest reliable launch vehicles for getting to Minmus or the Mun. Then we could all circle each other and do hangouts or something. And as a bonus, if anyone were to stumble upon our little community and start sharing our posts, boom, publicity. I\\\u0027m not sure exactly what I\\\u0027m going to do with my agency, but I\\\u0027m sure I\\\u0027ll come up with stuff as I play. So who\\\u0027s with me?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENOTE: If you have a Google account, chances are you already have a G\u002B account as well. If you don\\\u0027t want to use Google\u002B personally, you could just ignore your personal profile and make the G\u002B page.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEDIT: Random question: is the name Nexus Aerospace already taken?\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Plaatinum Aerospace","CreatedById":30569,"CreatedDateTime":"2012-07-03T01:32:17Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Ehmmm....\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E nice idea!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E Maybe Gold Stingray is interested.
