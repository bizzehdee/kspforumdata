I found this while attempting to land a spaceplane on Duna. Everyone I\u0027ve talked to has never seen it before I have no idea how it happened. I saw a rocket taking off from the surface of Duna while flying the spaceplane in the atmosphere close to the ground. It\u0027s definitely not debris from my ship, 1. because all the debris is still orbiting the sun and 2. because the \u0022rocket\u0022 is not labeled as debris, with the gray reticule and distance measurement. I followed it as best I could and the exhaust reacted the same way as a player\u0027s rocket\u0027s exhaust would, so it was definitely a rocket. At the top of the exhaust I can see a darker, gray-greenish rocket-shaped object that appears to be emitting the exhaust. After reverting back to my quicksave I went to the same spot and indeed the exact same thing happened. However, there is no base or space port place it came from. It just takes off. This is only the 2nd time I\u0027ve been to Duna, and the first was a probe pod that was not capable of leaving the atmosphere and also had no fuel left, and was on the opposite side of the planet. This rocket appeared to travel quickly to the upper atmosphere, and arced into what seemed to be an orbit, and then the exhaust cut off and I couldn\u0027t find the object anymore. Maybe it became one of those unidentified objects?
