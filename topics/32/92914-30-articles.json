There are too many of them, and many are just absurd. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Dismissing a contract should not replace it with a new one. Contracts should expire in a semi-random date range between a few hours, and a few months (they are sort of like this now). \u003Cem\u003EBut no new contract should be forthcoming until the existing ones expire, if you take them or not.\u003C/em\u003E Rescue missions would expire very quickly, and would require near immediate completion. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EParts testing\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Many (most?) already in game need to be done away with. Jet engine on a world with no oxygen to burn? Deleted. Spashed down engine tests? Deleted. Booster rocket tested at 12,000m? Deleted. You get the idea. Few would remain, frankly, almost all are just dumb. Any that remain should have intelligent requirements.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Some new contracts need to be added, however. \u0022Test the Mk1-2 pod reentering from an apoapsis of 12 million meters,\u0022 for example. Or \u0022Launch 2 clamp-o-trons, and successfully perform a docking in orbit around Kerbin.\u0022 Test landing legs on minmus, or whatever. Realistic flight tests that drive actual missions, not contraptions to test something in an odd way.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. Parts testing contracts should only rarely happen more than once, if they ever do at all. You static tested the 909 engine at KSC? Great, it\u0027s 1 in 1000 that you\u0027ll ever see that mission again in this career (or simply zero if that is easier).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Perhaps part testing can be an additional requirement to open tech tree nodes? i.e.: science points PLUS a few targeted part testing contracts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. If a part really needs another part, they should come together to test. No giant engine tests without matching fuel tanks, no ion engines without xenon tanks, etc. Make it possible to use parts testing for REAL missions, not just absurd contraptions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EExploration\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

Meh. These can mostly go away and be replaced with specific part testing contracts. If a device mfg wants you to \u0022plant a flag,\u0022 what they want is their part on the Mun. Regardless, they should be geome specific (I\u0027m not gonna use \u0022biome\u0022 for places sans \u0022bio\u0022 any more). Stepping out a few times a month to plant a flag next to your lander to gain funds should not be a thing.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EVisual Observation/Surface collection/EVA report/Temp/Seismic/Atmospheric Observation \u003C/strong\u003E(new with 0.90). Good idea, needs a lot of work.:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. Visual observation needs some new \u003Cem\u003Eparts\u003C/em\u003E. Cameras at a few levels. Low res (wide field), medium res, and high res. Can be added to probes, or assumed for some command/habitat pods, or can be new science parts you have to add to craft (in which case the low res camera should be available right away). Mk1 and early probe core have low res. Mk1-2, and science lab have all 3, other might have medium. Perhaps a scientist gets 1 camera better than the pod has (in which case they all top off at medium, and the scientist is required for high res images that are useful). Other instruments possible as well.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Assuming #1 above, the altitude requirements for visual observations would then be replaced with a limit based on resolution needed. With lower res you might need to be at \u0026lt;6000m, but that might double for medium, and double again for a high res camera. This would allow completion at various levels of play. So instead of observing Nerd\u0027s Gamma from under 7500m, the requirement would be to take high resolution imagery of Nerd\u0027s Gamma (which might then be defined as Below 30,000m for a high-res camera, 15,000m for a medium res, and below 7500m for the low res.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. EVA reports. These are OK, but it\u0027s really hard to find the sites once landed (mark on navball is not a thing for EVA). Perhaps these could be related to one another, as they come in groups. Do the camera pass, which then gives a more precise target marker on the surface for EVA/collection (maybe doing the camera pass successfully could allow the map views to be zoomed in more so you know which way to walk?). So VO pass unlocks positions for sample/eva missions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E4. Sample collection. Same as 3, should be linked as above to the orbital observations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E5. Kerbin versions should all require orbital stuff, not surface collection. I need to build a craft to fly to the north pole, yet I hit \u0022recover\u0022 and we can simply drive a truck there to retrieve my spacecraft? Why did I risk a spacecraft instead of just driving? I\u0027d dump all those, I never do them, exploring Kerbin seems absurd to me when I can recover spacecraft instantly from anywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESatellite contracts\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. These mostly make sense, it\u0027s something space programs do. Around Kerbin, that is.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Dump the ones for other worlds or rewrite them as space probes (camera, perhaps other instruments?) until the player has already unlocked the \u0022explore\u0022 contract for that world (don\u0027t need a comsat around Duna if no one is there).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EStations/bases\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. They are OK, but some make no sense, and I\u0027ve had trouble building them from sections and having the game accept them (contrary to the unlocking exploit posted here, I cannot get them accepted, lol). It\u0027s why I have not taken Mun base contracts as I don\u0027t want to work for a Hab for 18, get it all hooked together, then find that it won\u0027t accept it because the first part I landed didn\u0027t have an antenna, because the science lab part already did, and I didn\u0027t want one on each or something.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Getting them for other worlds when I have not yet explored them seems dumb. There should be a reason to explore or send a probe first.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EScience from orbit\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. It\u0027s fine, even with the ability to switch to a station, and do it over and over, but the contracts need to be spaced out in time, right now you could probably do dozens of these before the spacecraft completes one orbit if you were willing to dismiss contract after contract.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERescue\u003C/strong\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. \u003Ca href=\u0022https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/97582-An-idea-for-planetary-science-missions-and-rescue-in-career-mode\u0022 rel=\u0022external nofollow\u0022\u003EI have a long post on this\u003C/a\u003E.
