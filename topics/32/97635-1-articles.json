I\u0027m not actually sure that that PhysX is the limiting factor in the game physics -- lots of people assume it is, but we don\u0027t have timings from Squad confirming that it is. I suspect the scripting is about as much time as the PhysX internals.\u003Cp\u003EUnity 5 isn\u0027t going to improve script performance as far as I can tell.

Furthermore, the earlier versions of Unity 4 had quite a few bugs of their own which we had to work around (or hang tight) until fixes came along. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy point is, moving to Unity 5 is very unlikely to be a straightforward transition, and by no means I expect KSP to be stable or even playable (let alone improved) after simply upgrading the project over. I would be very happy to be wrong in that one, I must add, but historically, every time we upgraded to a new major version of unity, we came across new issues we had to contend with, so please don\u0027t get overexcited about Unity 5 just yet.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis late in a project, most games tend to freeze engine versions when they find something stable that fits their needs. Regression issues is in fact the main reason why Unity stuck with PhysX 2.8 until now. If breaking mods and saves is an issue for us, imagine their case, where instead of mods and saves, they risk breaking hundreds of commercial projects. We have it easy by comparison really... \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnyhow, we don\u0027t plan to freeze engines, but I just wanted to clarify that moving to Unity 5 may not be as simple and so immediately beneficial as it may seem. At the very least, we don\u0027t plan to upgrade until A: The 1.0 release is out, and B: Until U5 is out of beta and confirmed stable.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ECheers\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThanks.. I hope the transition isn\u0027t too difficult for you guys when it comes about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E I have read and I understand that you guys are absolutely determined to release 1.0. and implement further improvements after release. That\u0027s cool, I get it for whatever reason, it\u0027s your project and you can do what you like.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe reason I asked the question \u0027Is any testing being done using the UNITY 5 beta?\u0027 is because, even though it is a beta release you would get a feel for how much of a task the transition would be when it happens. To me that sort of thing seems ideal while KSP is still in Beta itself. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027d assumed that you would have access to the beta version, because everybody who pre-ordered UNITY 5 has access to the beta for free. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhile I\u0027m not expecting magical silver bullets, what I do expect is that one day I will be able to run KSP using all of my cores, and all of my RAM natively without having to write shell scripts to force specific OpenGL libraries and Multi-threading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI enjoy this game. I\u0027ve been a gamer my whole life, and KSP has effectively replaced every other game. I don\u0027t play anything else now. I really want it to be as good as it can possibly be, and I\u0027d like to get the maximum performance out of my hardware, which I know I\u0027m not at the moment.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"rdwulfe","CreatedById":107690,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-01-28T01:03:51Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022 data-cite=\u0022Red Iron Crown\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EWhat are you playing on?
