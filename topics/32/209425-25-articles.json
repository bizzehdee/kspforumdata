This is a fact of computer building, the probability of it happening and you not being able to complete a build is rather low, the list of parts we have recommended is nothing short of quality parts. Components most likely to arrive DOA are things like the HDD, Ram, and probably the GPU. The Hard drive could have bad sectors but the company will RMA it and send you an equal or better product to replace it. Mushkin has a good RMA policy and i dont read about their products arriving to people dead so you will be fine, GPUs can go wrong for a multitude of reasons but that one doesn\u0027t seem to be ruining peoples builds. If your HDD goes bad, use your SSD until Seagate RMAs it. I had to do this with my build because my WD Caviar Blue arrived DOA. 120 is plenty for the OS, plenty of programs, and a couple games depending on size. If your GPU goes bad the inegrated GPU on the intel chip is plenty to keep doing day to day things, i don\u0027t recommend gaming on it but it seems to be reasonable at it. If your RAM DOAs you will be out of luck as you need that fro a system to post, i doubt this will happen but it is a possibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Leonov","CreatedById":51498,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-10-19T15:49:33Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022NuclearWarfare\u0022 data-cite=\u0022NuclearWarfare\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003EAnybody can comment on this?
