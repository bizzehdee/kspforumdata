Secondly I\u0027d like for there to be more experiments. I want to have a large variety of things to do, like radiation tests, geological surveys, core samples, etc. Another great thing would be interactive experiments. A really great example would be taking photos of planets Pokemon Snap-style (Maxmaps said he likes this idea, hopefully it goes somewhere). More biomes would be a good thing to have so that if you are using a plane or a rover to collect science you won\u0027t need to travel several hundred kilometers to get to the next biome. And while I\u0027m talking about planes and rovers, there needs to be some sort of incentive of using those. Maybe for rovers there could be slight variances in soil composition in an area (like tiny biomes), making you need to travel around getting different samples. Planes could be used for aerial terrain surveys or even weather analysis if clouds are added. Lastly, I don\u0027t like the fact that it is very easy to drain all the science from an area. In KSP you can get all possible science from space near Kerbin with a single flight, but in real life we still send up satellites to study the Earth\u0027s atmosphere, radiation belts, magnetosphere, and so on.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Junafani","CreatedById":35255,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-01-01T20:19:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI am not really fond of current science system. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1.

How to design one to land there and come back? How do I make an SSTO? How can I get that SSTO to Laythe? And so on ...
