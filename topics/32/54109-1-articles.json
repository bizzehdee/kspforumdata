Thus, if you\u0027re the type how wants to milk every drop of science possible, probes are a waste of time because you\u0027ll have to send a Kerbal to the same place to get the rest of the science there. In 0.23, probes will be even less useful because transmitting will be nerfed and launches will cost money. Nerfing transmitting will mean you\u0027ll bring everything home, which means you might as well send a Kerbal to get the extra types of data. Besides, you might not be able to afford 2 missions to the same place anyway.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOTOH, in sandbox mode, the situation is reversed. There, Kerbals are practically useless. They add a lot of mass to your rocket, plus may also impose life support constraints if that\u0027s your thing, and all you get in return is a very limited amount of menial labor. Fix a flat, fix a leg, repack a chute (which still won\u0027t work right), plant a flag, maybe pump gas with KAS. Unless you need these tasks, there\u0027s no justification for sending Kerbals when a probe can do the flying just as well with no moral obligation to ever come back.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Northstar1989","CreatedById":91005,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-24T04:23:31Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve taken to playing Career Mode only, and yes, my probes never come home.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is mainly because the types of data small probes can collect (temperature, gravity, barometric, seismic, and atmosphere science) all transmit with relatively high efficiency (usually 60%)- whereas the types of data I collect on a heavier (usually manned mission) such as lab results, surface samples, goo data, and EVA reports, all don\u0027t transmit nearly as well.
