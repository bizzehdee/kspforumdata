Apparently solar panels don\u0027t work very well when they can\u0027t be pointed to the sun, or else they were bugged, so I missed my injection burn. I also learned that when your living battery runs dead you can\u0027t turn on a backup battery. Then my son wanted me to test out his moon rocket on another save account, and well, we had a live Kerbal impact the Mun at 626 m/s. Then he fixed his rocket, and landed a Kerbal perfectly. And then stranded him when we tried to leave. In my own real save file though, I had Muna 2 impact the Mun fine. My unmanned Muna 9 probe missed the Mun but was still in Kerbin orbit, waited for a correction two months later, got into a reverse orbit around the Mun, deorbited, and landed at a soft and comfy 2.1 m/s with about a two meter slide in the Mun dust upon landing, all legs up and working. A perfect first landing! Probe fully functional - except the landing site was on the wrong side of the Mun facing away from Kerbin (I then learned that the Mun is tidally locked to Kerbin). I didn\u0027t call it a failure since I also had a Muna 3 map probe in orbit which I figured it could relay back to Kerbin the lander\u0027s pictures and I got a good screenshot from Muna 3\u0027s view of both the lander below and Kerbin on the other side of the Mun, so it\u0027s possible. But then I reloaded from a quicksave to get a better landing site to be more consistent with historical reality (and no Kerbals were involved)... except instead of a picture perfect landing like my first time, my beginners luck ran out: first attempt I lost half my lander legs, second attempt I lost all my lander legs, and my engine, and third attempt I ran out of fuel and impacted leaving nothing.
