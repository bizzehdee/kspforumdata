When I started KSP I could play fine, then as the months went on and I got better at the game and more and more addicted my performance issues steadily got worse til I could no longer play the game and had to resort to watching youtube lets plays and being sad. That was 5 or 6 months ago. I just got a new video card and played my first session of KSP in 6 months! I had to start over because I also lost my game data. I designed and tested a mun lander on the highest graphics and resolution, set down at a mun arch, took a few screenshots and headed back home and let me just tell you on re-entry into Kerbin atmosphere I felt AWESOME! I jumped out of my chair with my arms up. I felt like id just had the best sex ever. Reflecting back on that moment I think I may be addicted to KSP and should seek help before I lose my job and wife and end up in a box offering sexual favors to strangers in exchange for an hour or 2 of KSP. Everything was made better while I got my first taste of all the new additions from the last couple patches. I can\u0027t wait to dock and learn the new navigation tools and probe... just... everything. Its good to have my KSP fix again and I just wanted to share my joy with the forum! \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_cheesy.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:D\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI FEEL AWESOME AND YOU\u0027RE ALL AWESOME AND I HOPE YOU HAVE AN AWESOME DAY!\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Peenvogel","CreatedById":59022,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-24T01:43:24Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMy first KSPgasm was the game itself. I saw it advertised on Steam, it looked weird and goofy but since it was a space game I needed to check it out on youtube, so I did. Ever since I\u0027ve purchased the game, I\u0027m totally obsessed by it. Imagine a full grown man playing a video game (\u0027cause that\u0027s what it is) for 36 hours STRAIGHT! My girlfriend thinks I\u0027m nuts by now... all I want to do is build rockets, create habitats, explore worlds or hook up another mod to my KSS. Really, this game is bad for me \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_huh.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:confused:\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
