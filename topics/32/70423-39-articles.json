Most of my long range SSTLs (single stage to laythe and beyond) have multiple clipped fuel tanks since i enjoy compact designs, and insist on internal missiles, ive started to use FLT-100s clipped into each other to get the desired range, all while having those tanks stacked sideways in a MK2 bomb bay to accomodate missiles to each side.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMore recently, ive started using xenon tanks with 660 LF in them to maintain the same fuel/drymass fraction to make it at least fair in that regard. The xenon tank is the single best tank that can fit stacked beside 2 missiles in a mk2 bay, and since its heaviest, it means maximum fuel per tank, and less parts. Since part count has become more and more important (with increasing lag in subsequent updates), and the fact that i seem to be going back to massive capital ship battles where a single craft is in excess of 300 parts, every single part that is cut out of a vessel helps with this, and with 660 LF, it beats the 100 LF that FLT-100s have, making it way less parts with stacked fuel tanks.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow i do not consider this cheating per say, since i tend to build alot of sci-fi designs, and in sci-fi movies craft are way smaller, lighter, and have insane ranges, but i still wish i could pull off my design style without having to resort to excessive clipping and having to edit fuel tanks to fit my needs (with the new nuke change to LF only, ive found myself using mods to edit many LFO tanks to storre pure LF, and even as much as edit xenon tanks to fit more fuel in a smaller volume (to keep the same fuel fraction).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIm just hoping U5 gives us some lag reduction, but until then, ill stick to my rather abusing mechanics to get what i want out of my ships without resorting to part spam.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-09-28T00:53:40Z\u0022 title=\u002209/28/2015 12:53  AM\u0022 data-short=\u00228 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 28, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by panzer1b\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"seyss","CreatedById":137952,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T02:02:26Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E- On my first land attempt (Mun) I ended up having to land on the dark side (I didn\u0027t know about RTGs), so my power died and so did my Kerbals\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I\u0027ve been using only one craft since I started playing KSP in Nov/2014 (craft very much improved since, of course. can land on all bodies)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Never played Career\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I use about 6 savegames every mission (like checkpoints)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Modified the part file for LV-N to return it to pre 1.0 patch condition (gimbal, max temp, lf\u002Box, weight)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Only bought the game on Steam after 1.0 came out (was using pirated version)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"hugseverycat","CreatedById":151673,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-28T18:17:13Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EOn one of my first \u0022successful\u0022 returns from Kerbin orbit, and due to staging or blind panic I deployed my parachutes early.
