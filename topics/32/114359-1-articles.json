I will anyway make a huge ship that is docket and it will have 2surface outposts a dunastation and a landing and return crew for Duna and Ike and maybe even a couple of satellites. Is this worth it?

But since you mentioned \u0027mobile base on Minmus\u0027, be aware the game has an issue that rover wheels don\u0027t work very well there. Due to the very low gravity, they don\u0027t get much traction. They do work, sort-of. But it looks more like \u0027garbage trucks on ice\u0027. What I did instead was to land my MPL, and use it as a base to send out a tiny RCS hopper with the experiments. That didn\u0027t work very well either. \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022;)\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHow should it look? \u0022Pointy\u0022.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-27T14:56:18Z\u0022 title=\u002206/27/2015 02:56  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 27, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Zephram Kerman\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"322997am","CreatedById":146422,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-27T15:26:54Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI know that wheels don\u0027t have much traction there which is why I put 10 rcs thruster blocks and the wheel attachment girders.

That means using the Oberth Effect to your advantage, so you\u0027ll want to set up your escape maneuver from Kerbin to put you on (or very close) to an encounter with Duna, rather than simply exiting Kerbin\u0027s SOI \u003Cem\u003Eand then\u003C/em\u003E doing an intercept maneuver. Same thing for the return trip.
