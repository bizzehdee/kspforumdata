The science station and the storage unit are stacked on top of a heat shield. \u00A0With this setup\u00A0I can drift up to 250,000 meters pretty consistently. Once I get back down to about 60-70,000 meters I throttle up the liquid fuel engine and let it run out. This seems to slow me down enough so the science pack survives.
