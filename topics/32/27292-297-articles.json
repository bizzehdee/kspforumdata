Well, again I tipped over the lander at launch, since I (again) forgot to switch on thrusters before throttling up. Luckily I was at least smart enough to retract the solar panels beforehand, so I could get it upright again without any damage, and the mission continued. Since there still was enough Xenon left on the orbital station, I also landed in the Muns Midland Craters, which were the last location close enough to the equator to be reachable with the Xenon reserves of the lander. Afterwards I sent an unmanned refuelling mission that filled the still attached transfer stage of the munar orbital station (which, btw, is just a science lab with Xenon and RCS tanks and solar panels). After properly disposing the refuelling ship (aka crashing it on the munar surface), I used the transfer stage to change the orbit of the orbital station, lander attached, to a nearly polar one. From that I performed a proper landing in the Polar Crater. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe next plans will be quite challenging: Landing in the polar biomes with a solar powered lander which was designed to be used at midday. While, when the sun is close to zenith the orientation of the lander can be changed arbitrarily, close to the poles, where sunlight is always coming from the horizon, one does not have that freedom, but must carefully handle the throttle and orientation of the craft in order not to run out of power.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere\u0027s a screenshot of the Munar Orbit Station, with the lander docked to one of the three docking ports, the return vehicle still attached (with a design flaw: I used a decoupler instead of a docking port), and behind the return stage the (at that time as good as empty) transfer stage. The station was sent to the mun with a crew of 2 Kerbals, while the third crew member was flying the lander from Kerbin to the Mun separately. It turned out that this was not the worst decision, since by doing so the transfer stage didn\u0027t run dry and could be reused for orbit changes. Regarding the lander I\u0027m particularly proud of the placement of the RCS tank - between the 3 ion engines. By placing it there, it makes a nice counterweight for the Mystery Goo Containment Unit.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/GvAiQDo.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022GvAiQDo.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESadly I only took screenshots while landing in the twin craters (at least I think it\u0027s from there). As you can see, I\u0027m horrible at landing, usually spending nearly 2/3 of the fuel in the process. Luckily, getting back to orbit is easier, so 1/3 of the fuel is by far enough to do an orbital rendevouz with the station and dock.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022http://i.imgur.com/DzHx3T3.jpg\u0022 alt=\u0022DzHx3T3.jpg\u0022\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Biff Space","CreatedById":110793,"CreatedDateTime":"2014-05-12T20:56:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI drove a rover from the highlands on Minmus (where I landed it) down to the base on one of the seas.

Probably the most difficult landings up to now, and I hope for the next few days: The Poles and The Polar Lowlands. I\u0027m particularly happy that Bob managed to find a spot in the Lowlands, that was just high enough to be touched by sunlight. Otherwise taking off would have been difficult, considering the power consumption of three ion engines and the issue that there are at maximum only 1050 units of electricity stored in the landers batteries, and less after landing, since, to avoid breaking them, the solar panels have to be retracted a few meters above the ground. Now the Kerbonauts have to wait in munar orbit, until the last two missing biomes, the Northern Basin and the Southwest Crater are reachable from their orbit and in sunlight.
