One thing I have heard criticized about Fahrenheit is that freezing point is 32 instead of 0 and that Fahrenheit\u0027s 0 is, I believe, -17.777 etc.. The reason for this is that Fahrenheit when it was being formed was to be somewhere around the freezing point of brine at avg atmosphere, yes this is vague, I know, it doesn\u0027t mention the concentration of solution and whatnot, however, the point is that only pure water and certain solutions freeze at 0 degrees C and many solutions of water, specifically salt based, the freezing point can get drastically lowered. If you guys would simply read the wiki, it is even suggested that the lack of freezing implies that the seas of Laythe have a relatively high concentration of ionic compounds, likely salt. This combined with tidal forces, combind with volcanic activity, combined with a decent amount of heating from the radiation trapped in Jool\u0027s magnetosphere (depending on where you stand in the magnetosphere argument) say that the ocean could stand a chance of not being frozen.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Crown","CreatedById":18262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-11-15T22:35:37Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EMaybe Kerbals can live on Laythe like other people can on Darehitorimo.
