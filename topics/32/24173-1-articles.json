I did a Duna mission for the reddit weekly challenge #40, it was the first time I had used Deadly Reentry, and despite the fact that on Duna, I did a straight transfer-to-landing aerobrake maneuver, I never saw any reentry heat. Likewise, on the way back to Kerbin, I did a 36k aerobrake maneuver that took me from tranfer velocity to an 880K apoapsis in a single pass with no heating on the heat shield. After all, we\u0027re reentering MUCH slower than the apollo missions did, since Kerbin orbital speeds are a third or less than Earth orbital speeds.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn the other hand, just to make sure that I had installed DR correctly, I reloaded a save just as I entered Kerbin\u0027s SoI and tried a 34K aerobrake, and went from \u0022ooh look, finally a heat bar on the heat shield\u0022 to BOOM! in 10 seconds flat. I\u0027m hoping that whatever formulas the devs use it isn\u0027t that touchy. Basically, there\u0027s a very narrow margin between a perfectly safe reentry with no excess heat and almost instant disaster. Realistic, yes, but not sure it\u0027s appropriate.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Eric S","CreatedById":57117,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T18:08:27Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003Edouble post, sorry.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"azazel1024","CreatedById":44262,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-04-26T18:22:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022bbwonder\u0022 data-cite=\u0022bbwonder\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv\u003ENifty find! thanks for posting \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_smiley.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:)\u0022\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENice to see how the professionals do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt would be cool if KSP modelled the critical angle mechanic.. causing a missed entry or burning up.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMmmmm toasty kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/blockquote\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMissed entry really just meant bouncing too high and dying from asphixiation as your oxygen ran out waiting for another reentry.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere really wasn\u0027t a \u0022skip in to outer space and never coming back\u0022 issue with Apollo or any other. The issue is, once seperated from the service module, the command module as a very, very finite amount of breathable air and power. It isn\u0027t minutes long, but it is only a couple of hours. You bounce off the atmosphere to a higher orbit and you can\u0027t hold your breath for the hour or two it might take for you to reach apogee start descending and hit reentry again, let alone where you will be when you reenter (lets keep in mind all US manned capsules were designed for water spalsh down, NOT solid earth landing).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn either case, too steep or too shallow was fatal.
