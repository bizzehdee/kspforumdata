As I cleared my debris by recovering every bit of rocket sitting around on Kerbin. The last one I switched to, however, was still in space. I didn\u0027t read everything it said and decided to look at it more closely. When I switched to it, I found a single deployed parachute hurtling through space. It even had a fully deployed parachute model on it... sticking off the back and shrunken to smaller than the part itself. Then, I found something strange. This piece of debris was the parachute that exploded on my capsule. Looking at map view, I found it flying out of the solar system, already well past Eeloo, at greater than lightspeed. Much more recently, I was trying to send a plane to the north pole to do science.
