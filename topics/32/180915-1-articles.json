I always start a new save after an update...or well...when I\u0027m done with my active game. Steam auto updates KSP and I can\u0027t be bothered to turn off the auto update function, because of several reasons. KSP is DRM-free, meaning you can have multiple copies of KSP on your system. KSP runs using the files in the (that particular) KSP folder exclusively. So after an update, I make a copy of that\u00A0version somewhere else than in the steam folder.
