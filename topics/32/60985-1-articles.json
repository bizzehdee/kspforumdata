It should include every possible experiment/biome combination. For Crew Report, EVA Report, Mystery Goo, Materials Bay, Thermometer and Barometer, for some planets they are once per biome at a certain altitude and once per planet at a different altitude. In those cases, for the instances where it\u0027s once per planet, simply fill it in for the first biome of that body and it will be automatically copied to all the other biomes, so you only need to fill it in the one time you do it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd of course, check my work.

Thanks! loaded it up in openoffice. Now what I\u0027d love to know is what constitutes low space and high space for each planet and the sun. I was thinking of doing a sun mission as it seems it gives a lot of science points, but just how close do I have to get to it (given how I keep missing the Mun...think I got the trick now though...it seems a lot harder to miss the sun \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_wink.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:wink:\u0022\u003E)\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
