And likely, in the end, you\u0027ll end up with a very good spacecraft.\n\nWhat about you guys?"},{"CreatedByName":"LordFjord","CreatedById":97341,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T15:58:36Z","Content":"Mostly missions, either from contracts or selfdefined goals, preferably with spaceplanes."},{"CreatedByName":"GoSlash27","CreatedById":111526,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T16:15:38Z","Content":"These days my favorite activities are dreamed up by others in the challenge section.\n\n Pretty much all airplanes because (to me) aerodynamics is the most challenging part of KSP\n\nBest,\n\n-Slashy"},{"CreatedByName":"OhioBob","CreatedById":128005,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T16:26:46Z","Content":"I like planning missions and designing vehicles to complete them. I usually like to incorporate contracts into my missions, though they often have addition self-defined objectives. I also enjoy flying the missions, but I like the planning/designing a little more. I find it very satisfying to be able to complete a mission and to have a vehicle perform according to the plan. I do everything with rockets; no air or spaceplanes."},{"CreatedByName":"SpacedCowboy","CreatedById":92106,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-03-01T16:36:41Z","Content":"After reading this thread and replies I was trying to think of what my favorite thing was and then realized I was staring right at it.

That is a good thing! But what I end up doing the most, really, is orbital housekeeping: rendezvouses and assemblies of big pieces that are supposed to go somewhere else and do stuff. Then, usually, a new version appears... and more often that not I have to scrap everything and kill all those awesome interplanetary motherships and cargo flights ![:(](//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_sad.gif) (wich is why I do such low part count stuff: I want to be able to fly *fleets* in close formation!). But I usually have time to at least set up the infrastucture on the kerbin system pretty much every time (orbital depots and mining bases in both moons, basically, plus a few wow projects like the recurring L3 colony project). Well, and then there are the gazillion hours in the VAB hammering the UI into doing things it was never meant to...
