Passing \u0022Career mode\u0022 for the N\u0027th time gets not so interesting but I still want to play in the full stack instead of limited sandbox. So I just start a Normal mode to get a new user experience of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve digged some science around the KSP. You know even monument has its own biome. Ran through basic contracts. Even rescued \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Kerbal from orbit. It\u0027s all about the science at the beginning of the game especially when you have a bit of experience.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI have no idea what those contracts are but I take a risk. It\u0027s all about science and I don\u0027t count the money - I manage to write some contract of conversion 60% of money to science (lacked reputation for more).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHere the fun part starts.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI take a mission to the Mun. It was a disaster from the start. Expensive SSTO burned because of lack of electricity. Because of lack of fuel managed to land only at single spot of the Mun. Not much of the science instruments at that level of science development either.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENevertheless Mun contract completed. How much science? \u003Cimg src=\u0022//kerbal-forum-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/emoticons/default_k_undecided.gif\u0022 alt=\u0022:huh:\u0022\u003E Opened almost all science tree for a single shot to the Mun and no losses on the credit?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo bottom line.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Some Grumpy Kerbal adviser is required in the game. Like helper tutorial which can be switched off.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- Contract are far too cheap. Price should rise exponentially.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E- I really like idea of converting science to other resources after all science tree is opened. This leaves the point in collecting science further.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Cmdr.
