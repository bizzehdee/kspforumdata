They are very excited to go to PS4 to open the ability for more gamers to learn about rocket science.\n- Memory Leak in Temperature Gauges being looked at.\n- KSP 25% off for a limited time on GoG, Humble, and Steam! (Demo on Steam)\n- KasperVld likes the \u0022confetti\u0022 fairing.\n- Working on 1.0.3 - Kasper can\u0027t comment on changes made.\n- Multiplayer is in development and is very complex. No details yet.\n- Why doesn\u0027t the KSP Gamers Edition have Valentina?: Stay tuned for information on that, no confirmation but Squad might be working on something.\n- A lot of discussion on best possible ways to implement time warp in Multiplayer.\n- OSX 10.10? changes the memory management and has issues with Unity 4. Unknown if Unity 5 will fix it.\n- **Announcement: 1.0.3 Due for release next week. Maybe a bit late, but it is looking very good for next week barring any major issues.**\n- If a meteor hits Squad headquarters, there is currently no plan to rescue development resources from the fallout.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T19:01:52Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 07:01  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Alshain**"},{"CreatedByName":"Randazzo","CreatedById":136468,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T19:14:11Z","Content":"So, the memory leak is not necessarily being addressed by 1.0.3; which cannot be discussed? \n\nOk then.\n\n**Edited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222015-06-19T19:17:30Z\u0022 title=\u002206/19/2015 07:17  PM\u0022 data-short=\u00229 yr\u0022\u003EJune 19, 2015\u003C/time\u003E by Randazzo**"},{"CreatedByName":"Alshain","CreatedById":110959,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-06-19T19:18:29Z","Content":"\u003E \n\u003E So, the memory leak is not necessarily being addressed by 1.0.3, which cannot be discussed? \n\u003E Ok then.\n\nHe didn\u0027t say it wouldn\u0027t be fixed in 1.0.3, he just didn\u0027t know for sure and couldn\u0027t comment.
