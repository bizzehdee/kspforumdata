Been to every planet, seen all the sights, even made a station orbiting Jool and Eeloo for god knows why. I never bothered to make space planes though. This time I decided, dang it.. I\u0026#39;m gonna do it. It\u0026#39;s something I\u0026#39;ve always failed to do and have enough fuel left over to come back down, and not have it expldoe, or be so imbalanced, or just plain not enough fuel. After much frustrating testing, and balancing and yada yada... I did it!
