Seems to work well, changes to parts of already existing crafts have been applied properly. Still, had to do some modifications:\n\n1) My spaceplane from Chronus station had been returned to Kerbin (before transferring). If I get those planes working in new aerodynamics, maybe there will be another to replace this one.\n\n2) There was some bug with the state of the chutes on Magnesium (they activated on load). Had to edit the SFS to fix that.\n\n3) Valentina Kerman didn\u0027t appear automatically. I edited her in (copied from a fresh save).\n\nThe updated save has been uploaded.\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nReentry heat at 100% doesn\u0027t seem too dangerous. I\u0027ve ran some tests with returning a craft from the Mun and serious problems seem to appear only if you manage to get the g-force meter in red.\n\nBe careful with high time-warp on reentry trajectories - slowing down when approaching the planet doesn\u0027t work too well (one of the reentry tests dropped out of time-warp at 24 km above Kerbin).\n\nAll the existing Kerbals are males, but females now appear amongst recruits.
