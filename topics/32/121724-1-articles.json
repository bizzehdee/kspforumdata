Can\u0027t wait for updates.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThat said I think the game should add a couple of things to get to know your kerbals better.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E1. When in flight a little icon in the corner of their picture should indicate their specialty. Ie. Scientist, pilot or engineer. It is time consuming when you have 3 kerbals in a ship and I have to go back to the astronaut complex to figure out who is an engineer to repack the parachutes.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E2. Lets get to know our Kerbals a bit better. In the astronaut complex there is a impersonal listing of skills for each Kerbal and what they have done. This should be accessible in flight when you click on the kerbal\u0027s picture.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E3. We should get some back stories for the kerbals and why they are there (which should be on the same information tab). For the oranges interesting back stories could be written quickly and for whites I see procedural back stories being potentially quite humorous.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EMy thoughts on Jeb\u0027s back story.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJeb grew up pondering the stars. While everybody assumed it was a desire to travel to space in actuality Jeb knew that those stars represented huge explosions that he wanted to see up close and personal. His first career running a scrap yard was just the boost he needed to bring him to the attention of the Kerbal space program. His fearlessness was perfect for a program using scrap yard materials to fly to space in. His steely nerve got him through flight school at the top of his class (we was the only applicant brave (read crazy) enough to fly scrap into space. He now embodies the kerbal space programs motto: Putting little green men everywhere.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"CalculusWarrior","CreatedById":58313,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T06:54:28Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EI completely agree with the first two, kerbals should be easier to tell what specialization they are, as well as knowing what things they\u0027ve done (the Final Frontier mod has an excellent example of this), but hesitant about the third. Part of the game\u0027s charm is the fact that it allows you to come up with your own backstory for the kerbals.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-09-26T06:57:53Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EGood points. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFor 1), there is a mod that shows the Kerbal\u0027s profession in the tiny crew displays on the bottom right of the screen. Alternatively one can use TextureReplacer to differentiate the suits by profession.

Click on the tab on the right with a little Kerbal on it while focused on your ship in map view (or tracking center) and it\u0027ll show all the Kerbals aboard, which module they\u0027re in, their rank and their profession. \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m not sure if I\u0027d like to see point 3 in the stock game or not--I tend to agree it\u0027s better to let the player fill in their own backstory if they so desire--but it\u0027d be a great idea for a mod. Especially the part about procedural backstories for new Kerbals--just so long as they\u0027re a little more coherent than the procedural contract descriptions!
