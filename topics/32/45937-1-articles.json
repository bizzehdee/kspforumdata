I have recently encountered a problem where an automatic update rendered a previously working title useless. There was a mix-up between the developer and Steam regarding what was considered DLC. Those that bought this particular title during a steam sale lost access to their gamesaves when the update came down the pipe, costing some 100\u002B hours of gameplay. IMO, anyone using Steam should disable automatic updates and wait to see how the update is going to affect their game before installing said update permanently.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEdit : One should also make absolutely sure that what you are buying is what you want. There are no refunds. With KFC, if you find a hair in your food, you will probably get your refund and a free meal on top of that, they don\u0027t necessarily like being embarrassed by that sort of thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\u0022ipsType_reset ipsType_medium ipsType_light\u0022 data-excludequote=\u0022\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cstrong\u003EEdited \u003Ctime datetime=\u00222013-09-15T13:29:57Z\u0022 title=\u002209/15/2013 01:29  PM\u0022 data-short=\u002210 yr\u0022\u003ESeptember 15, 2013\u003C/time\u003E by Otis\u003C/strong\u003E\n\u003C/span\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"thereaverofdarkness","CreatedById":75673,"CreatedDateTime":"2013-09-15T14:40:08Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat Otis said. Steam has some of the most hideous DRM in the industry, though nowadays most of the big companies do. When you pay money for the right to download a Steam game, you agree that you are paying the money to Steam under no contractual agreement for them to provide you with anything in return for it. You do not own a copy of the games on your account and they can (and do) revoke this access at their disgression. Furthermore, if you install the game fully onto your computer so that you can play it offline, but do not connect to the internet for a long enough period of time (in the area of a few weeks) your Steam install automatically deletes several vital files and renders the title unplayable until you update it through your Steam account online. They also collect confidential information about your usage and you sign an agreement to waive all rights to such data and allow them to use it for marketing strategies, to share with other companies in complete freedom, and to discriminate at will based on said data.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJust want you to know what you\u0027re signing when you click that accept button.
