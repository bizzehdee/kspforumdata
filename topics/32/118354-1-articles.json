I haven\u0027t had Kerbal that long (4 weeks), and there are other posts on the forum regarding sudden heating and explosions from far more experienced players than myself. What I have see is this: I have two careers going, one modded and one stock so I could compare them. I never had a \u0027random heating event\u0027 or \u0027sudden craft explosion\u0027 on a craft that had been in existence for a while until I progressed in both careers to the level where I had unlocked the octostruts and began to use them (to be fair, I also unlock other items at this same tech level at the same time). After that, in both careers, I began experiencing events where I would build a ship containing octostruts (because I had read how useful they are), would launch them and all would be well until you start using time acceleration - then I began loosing craft to explosions. (I posted in another thread with some details). In one instance, I have a probe 500 meters from the ground, chutes deployed, and it exploded within moments of going to 4X time acceleration. I reloaded many times and discovered that if I stayed at 3x or below, the probe never exploded. 4x, near instantaneous explosion. And in all of the cases I have had it, it was always an octostrut that had exploded. I happiness was taking a severe beating, so i searched toe forums and found many threads all on this topic. The more experienced people appeared to corroborate my findings, so I took the suggestion from one of the thread and activated ignore heat limit (or whatever it is called). However, I then found that if a craft overheated and I saved the game, then there was a good chance for an immediate explosion upon reload before I could turn off the heat stuff. So now, as soon as I load a save game, I turn on the ignore heat and also turn of the radiate, conduct, etc. heat in the physics tab. I would rather not - but I would rather play happy and without these than be frustrated with random explosions.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIs it the octostrut? I honestly don\u0027t know. Read the other posts about exploding ships and see what you think. There is definitely something amiss, and it only appears (for me) once I unlock the octostruts and similar level tech nology. What I have tested thoroughly is building ships with only the lower tech levels after you unlock the higher ones and see if the problem exists there now where it didn\u0027t before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI can tell you that all of my mikro probes, which have multiple octostruts, will virtually all explode withing 30 seconds of my craft entering the launch pad.
