BUT THAT\u0027S NOT ALL! When you have the artifact in the craft, it could make you craft very heavy or very light, or make your guiding systems fail for periods of time, making it very hard to get it back to Kerbin. You could have a trophy room that all the artifact you have found and returned are stored.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EImagine this! Your mission, to go to the MUN and bring back a artifact, the artifact is the Monolith from 2001 A Space Odyessy, when you find it, and pick it up, putting it in your craft for the return flight....you would think it would be easy to bring it back to Kerbin...from that distance...right?...WRONG! It will mess with your craft making the return journey a totally diffrent BAL game!\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese are just ideas that I have been daydreaming about.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGive me your thoughts?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWell done Squad 0.17 is amazing.\u003C/p\u003E\n"}]}
