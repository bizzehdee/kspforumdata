What has become obvious from the conversion operations aboard both space stations is that neither one has sufficient electrical power generation to run the converter unit full bore. I\u0027ll be looking into adding a truss structure to the stations for additional power generation in the near future. I\u0027m kinda disappointed about this (though not really surprised), as I was hoping the arrival of Minmusport\u0027s refinery module would\u0027ve been the final piece of mining infrastructure that needed to be established for Kerbin\u0027s moons.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPicked up a rescue contract for Kerbin.

Probably one of the best booster designs I\u0027ve built in a while; got the payload into orbit without too much fuel left in the final booster stage. The initial module is on its way to Munport now; I\u0027ll launch a companion module for the Minmusport station tonight.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI spent the rest of the night in an attempt to get Bob and his \u003Cem\u003EFireball 7c\u003C/em\u003E craft off the surface of Mun by refueling it. Theogel and Verise were still aboard Munport at the beginning of the night, so I left Verise at the station and had Theogel grab the KAS tools out of the \u003Cem\u003EProject Peacock\u003C/em\u003E craft still docked at the station. He then departed in the \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E craft, which already had the necessary hardware for the repairs incorporated into its design. Theogel affected a successful landing and refuel of \u003Cem\u003EFireball 7c\u003C/em\u003E, but in the process was left out of fuel in Munar orbit forty degrees off the plane of Munport. So now he\u0027s out of fuel - and since his \u003Cem\u003EWildcat\u003C/em\u003E craft is the only ore hauling lander I\u0027ve got at Mun, my Munar mining operations are on hold until I can get his craft refueled. I don\u0027t see an alternative but to send a fuel module to dock with him - I had hoped to not have to send another one of those up to Mun (the mining ops were supposed to render those obsolete, they\u0027re expensive as hell and tricky to launch).\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo the lesson there kiddos - If you don\u0027t think you can pull off a landing and get back into orbit safely, you probably can\u0027t. So don\u0027t land. Otherwise you too might ruin your mining operations.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThings didn\u0027t exactly go peachy for Bob after the refuel either. He pulled a reorientation roll a bit too quickly during his launch from Mun and managed to rip his solar panels right off due to centrifugal force. He is heading back to Kerbin now and should make it, but I\u0027ve had to lock his batteries down so that he\u0027ll have some juice left for opening up the chutes at the end. Just one more damn thing, right?\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHopefully tonight I\u0027ll have better luck with things in general.\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Goddess Bhavani","CreatedById":14001,"CreatedDateTime":"2015-11-04T15:03:40Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003ESince my non-spaceplane SSTO thread got downvoted immediately after it got posted (for being different??), I thought to reply that in a world filled with hate and despair, daring to dream is what we should all do.

Second vehicle was a resupply ship that carried a few KIS containers so I could make the VTOL, to which I then added some Gigantors so it kept some usefulness after fulfilling its job. Third vehicle was my original miner ship that had only 1 drill and 1 ore container and shuttled the ore to the space station in Minmus orbit (the one that\u0027s now on the ground), until I realized that\u0027s horribly inefficient and didn\u0027t give any profit. Fourth vehicle is my second miner, which has 9 large ore containers and 4 drills. These were all docked originally to the former \u0022space station\u0022 in low minmus orbit until I took them down one by one to an area with ~8.5% ore average.
