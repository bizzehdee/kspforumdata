For situations other than the launch from Kerbin, there are redundant systems and sometimes other methods of maximising crew safety. On early interplanetary vessels I am getting into the habit of implementing escape pods (however, they become unnecessary when I put stations near to the destination, as every station I make outside of Kerbin\u0027s \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Sphere of Influence\u0022\u003ESOI\u003C/abbr\u003E has (usually ion-propelled) rescue vehicles). On late-game\u00A0ascent vehicles from most atmospheric planets/moons, I will often implement a launch escape system which can allow the crew to safely return to the surface much like in a failed launch from Kerbin. Of course, this is only usable when I have some established colonies on that planet/moon, but it is an option in the late game.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nPlenty of living space on long-duration missions. No one wants to be stuck in the same pressurised tube for decades without being able to move around except for on EVA. Bases and interplanetary vessels should be equipped with more than the bare minimum of habitable space for kerbals, and ideally should have cupolas or other similar viewing pods to eschew boredom.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\nAesthetics is a priority. Nothing may leave the \u003Cabbr title=\u0022Vehicle Assembly Building\u0022\u003EVAB\u003C/abbr\u003E/\u003Cabbr title=\u0022SpacePlane Hangar\u0022\u003ESPH\u003C/abbr\u003E\u00A0if it looks bad. Absolutely nothing. Even if I have to spend numerous additional hours and funds on perfecting the appearance of a vessel, it is worth it.

Not necessarily a \u0022moral obligation\u0022 sort of rule, but even so. Everything being highly modular and saved as sub-assemblies makes it easy to put together a vessel and to plan a mission. And actually, if I\u0027m sharing the craft (which I probably will with most vessels once they\u0027re perfected) I do feel somewhat obligated to make it relatively easy to use.\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Agathos","CreatedById":166232,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T01:01:30Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNo stranding Kerbals on alien worlds for years or decades without leaving them something fun to play with, like a science lab or a rover.\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"kBob","CreatedById":102132,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T01:43:04Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nI just don\u0027t like leaving trash behind even virtual trash it just goes against my nature, so I bring back the science equipment, I try to let my boosters burn up rather than leave them in orbit and I eventually plan to clean up the ones I had to leave behind.\u00A0 Otherwise anything goes though if a Kerbal dies I\u0027ll usually revert back to the start of the mission and then figure out how to avoid the same mistake (but that\u0027s more learning oriented than worrying about Kerbal lives).\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Norcalplanner","CreatedById":112223,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T04:49:39Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nNever give up, never surrender!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Kertech","CreatedById":156079,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-10T10:50:06Z","Content":"\n\u003Cp\u003E\nFor me kerbals\u00A0are only sent into space (after first missions) once the hardware has been built, so interplanetary ships and stations are autonomously built then a crew transfer happens.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nCrew transfer vehicles are tested first before use, again autonomously.\u00A0\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\n(I play with TAC, keep fit so there are plenty of ways for me to kill my kerbals already...)\n\u003C/p\u003E\n"},{"CreatedByName":"Fearless Son","CreatedById":133397,"CreatedDateTime":"2016-07-13T17:06:20Z","Content":"\n\u003Cblockquote class=\u0022ipsQuote\u0022 data-ipsquote=\u0022\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentapp=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentclass=\u0022forums_Topic\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentcommentid=\u00222667398\u0022 data-ipsquote-contentid=\u0022143392\u0022 data-ipsquote-contenttype=\u0022forums\u0022 data-ipsquote-timestamp=\u00221468014469\u0022 data-ipsquote-userid=\u0022133397\u0022 data-ipsquote-username=\u0022Fearless Son\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_citation\u0022\u003E\nOn 7/8/2016 at 2:47 PM, Fearless Son said:\n\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class=\u0022ipsQuote_contents\u0022\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nAlways have a plan to bring home any Kerbals sent into space. \u00A0We do not leave our krew behind!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinimize costs while maximizing returns (i.e. a more expensive mission is justified if it could accomplish what would otherwise take two missions worth of funds to do.) \u00A0Space exploration represents a significant diversion of economic resources, so make it count!\n\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\nMinimize debris that stick in orbit, especially in Low Kerbin Orbit. \u00A0Further out and lower density debris are a little more forgiving, as are debris that remain on planetary surfaces. \u00A0Every piece of flying space junk is one more obstruction we put on the paths of those travelers who will walk the trails we are blazing!
